breaking book news from the bookbitch

goodbye and hello...




home is where the heart is. there’s no place like home. a
home without books is like a room without windows…



for me, that is very true, so perhaps this is the best place
to start.



i have moved to a new home, stacyalesi.com. but don’t worry,
bookbitch.com will get you there, too. eventually the bookbitchblog will send you on your way but for now, please just click through.



the bookbitch is not gone, just re-imagined. it was time for
a change. a kinder, gentler home. while my home may have changed, rest assured
my opinions have not.



i am packing my bags, so to speak, and moving in.
taking all my reviews with me, and some of my reviewers as well. this will be a
process so please be patient if what you are seeking cannot be found yet.



i am leaving the bookbitchblog as it is for a while until
the move is complete. or as complete as i care to make it. we often use moving
as an excuse to get rid of excess, to purge, to cleanse. i am hoping to have a
clean house here, and the best way to do that is to start with a clean house.



besides the opportunity to go mainstream, i wanted all the
reviews to be more easily searchable and more easily found. i wanted to combine
my blog with my website and just have one home instead of shifting between two.
hopefully this new site will accomplish that.



my most heartfelt appreciation to xuni.com for the gorgeous
design and making everything work the way it should. sheer genius!



all comments, suggestions, and constructive criticisms are
welcome.




i hope you’ll stop by often.

q & a with raymond khoury






i am delighted to share a q&a with raymond khoury,
author of rasputin's shadow, an ingenious, fast-paced historical thriller from the author
of the new york times bestseller the last templar.





on a cold, bleak day in 1916, all hell breaks loose in a
mining pit in the ural mountains. overcome by a strange paranoia, the miners
attack one another, savagely and ferociously. minutes later, two men—a
horrified scientist and grigory rasputin, trusted confidant of the tsar—hit a
detonator, blowing up the mine to conceal all evidence of the carnage.

in the present day, fbi agent sean reilly’s search for reed
corrigan, the cia mindcontrol spook who brainwashed reilly’s son, takes a
backseat to a new, disturbing case. a russian embassy attaché seems to have
committed suicide by jumping out of a fourth-floor window in queens. the
apartment’s owners, a retired physics teacher from russia and his wife, have
gone missing, and further investigation reveals that the former may not be who
the fbi believe him to be.



joined by russian federal security service agent larisa
tchoumitcheva, reilly’s investigation of the old man’s identity will uncover a
desperate search for a small, mysterious device, with consequences that reach
back in time and which, in the wrong hands, could have a devastating impact on
the modern world.

packed with the twists, intrigue, and excitement that
khoury’s many fans have come to expect, rasputin’s shadow will keep readers
turning pages long into the night.



head on over to www.bookbitch.com
if you’d like to win a signed copy!



1.      rasputin’s
shadow is a great mix of technology, history, and action, but there is a little
romance too. how do you work to balance these in the novel?



i guess it just comes from practice, really. i’ve been a
storyteller for years, whether in screenplays of in my previous five novels,
and i suppose it’s just a personal preference for how to tell a story, for the
pacing, for having a gut feeling about when those different aspects should pop
up and not jar or crowd each other out. it’s not something i consciously map
out, i don’t outline the books; i just spend a lot of time setting up the
characters and their motivations, the triggers of the story, then i let them
loose and the story—and all the elements you refer to—come in when it feels
right.



2.      in rasputin’s
shadow, there are two distinct storylines that are woven together: one in early
russia and the other in modern-day new york city. how important is it for you
to have both the historical and contemporary storylines in your novels?



i’ve now done it in four our of my six novels (the sign and
the devil’s elixir are the two only-contemporary books). so it varies. i do enjoy
writing the historical storylines, though, and i feel the readers really love
going back in time and living through a parallel (though secondary) storyline,
especially if it feels very “real,” which is my aim. but in books like the
sign, for instance, it was never part of the plan, and i love that book (which
is actually my longest to date) as much as its siblings.



3.      at this point
in your writing career, what has been your most memorable moment as an author?



i guess i was spoiled early on. you have to remember that
when i wrote the last templar (my first book), it was a personal challenge, i
was just adapting the screenplay i had written in 1996 and i had zero
expectation of it being a bestseller. so i remember vividly when, the week
before it came out, my agent called and said “based on the numbers so far, we
just might have a chance of breaking into the new york times extended list (not
the list itself). which was amazing enough. then that first wednesday night
after it came out, late at night, i got the call from mitch hoffman, my editor
at dutton, who told me we’re on the list, and #10. which was surreal. then the
following week, i completely lost my voice from nervousness while waiting for
the call which would inevitably tell me we were off the list. i was walking
back from a football game when mitch called again and said, “guess what? you’re
#5.” which, i was told, never happens. and it just kept getting better from
there.”



4.      what is next
for you?



there are 4 stories fighting to make it to the blank page on
my laptop screen, i wish i could write all 4 at the same time. i’m deep into
one of them, it’s a standalone, a bit of a departure from the reilly books.
then as soon as it’s done, the next installment of reilly.



5.      what do you
hope readers will take away from rasputin’s shadow?



i hope they’ll have fun and not be able to put it down! i
hope they’ll have enjoyed hanging out with reilly, tess, leo, rasputin, misha,
and the rest (maybe not so much koschey). i hope they’ll be curious to find out
more about russian’s history in the first decades of the 20th century, the fall
of the tsars and the brutal rise of communism. and i hope they’ll have learned
a thing or two about how our brains work, what’s possible, what technologies are
being researched out there and how horrific it would be if they were ever
deployed…

guest blogger: jonathan santlofer







recipe for a great serial novel


take 20 great writers.

ask them to each write a chapter in a  continuing story.

give them both direction and a free hand.

donate the proceeds to charity.

mix it all together.

stir. simmer. bring to a boil.


voila! one great novel written in 20 voices.



to continue the recipe metaphor you could say that putting a
serial novel together is a bit like making an omelet or better yet, a soufflé.
you get all the ingredients together, whip up the eggs, put it in the oven and
hope it doesn’t deflate. the good news is that this novel rose high above my
expectations.



i started by asking a bunch of writers if they were willing
to participate, and almost everyone said yes. i had already decided to donate
the royalties to safe horizon, a charitable organization that aids victims of
violent crime. it just made sense that crime writers – many of whom had
profited by writing about violent crime – should be willing to give something
back to an organization that helped real life victims, and they all agreed.



then came the mechanics. a few weeks to craft a story that
was simple yet complex, this one an homage to my favorite noir writers,
hammett, chandler, woolich, among others, put it together in a way that was
both old and new, familiar yet original. i knew the writers would understand
the source material and have fun writing within a known tradition. once i had
the story, i wrote a synopsis, a long then a short version. then a page of
character studies. after that, i broke the story into 20 chapters outlining the
main points in each. the trick was to fashion an organized plot and plan but
leave plenty of room for the authors to improvise—i did not want to cramp
anyone’s style.



each author received the synopsis, the character studies,
individual chapter outline, and was asked to write in their own voice while
sticking to the plot points.



then i waited (somewhat nervously) for the chapters to come
in. but i shouldn’t have worried. after all, every one of these writers is a
pro, and every one of them did the job and more—advance the plot while adding
things i’d never imagined: tension, humor, emotional resonance.



the tricky part was that everyone had to write at the same
time; no one got to read the chapters that preceded theirs. and yet, in the
end, they all hung together beautifully, as if someone had been watching over
us whispering some strange incantation that kept us all on track. every writer
seemed to know exactly who these characters were and simply added a new layer
of complexity. our disgraced pi, perry christo, became prouder and smarter and
shrewder; our heroine angel, the kind of girl men dream of and dread, became
more and more mysterious; her mother more and more suspicious: her father more
and more devious; her boyfriends cruder and cruder; her best friend more
treacherous.



in the end, the novel is fast, fun and thrilling. the
individual voices are there but the seams hardly show. as booklist said in its
glowing review, "the story moves as though there were a single hand on the
tiller. not merely a genre curiosity, the book is a well-told mystery that
stands on its own two (or 40) feet." 
it feels to me as if a group of great writers and good friends simply
got together, put their egos aside and had a terrific time writing the best
thriller they could possibly write.  



jonathan santlofer

october 2013, nyc




about the book:



to find an angel, he made a deal with the devil.



pericles “perry” christo is a pi with a past—a former cop,
who lost his badge and his family when a corruption scandal left him broke and
disgraced. when wealthy upper east side matron julia drusilla summons him one
cold february night, he grabs what seems to be a straightforward (and
lucrative) case. 



the socialite is looking for her beautiful, aimless
daughter, angelina, who is about to become a very wealthy young woman. but as
christo digs deeper, he discovers there’s much more to the lovely “angel” than
meets the eye. her father, her best friend, her boy­friends all have agendas of
their own. angel, he soon realizes, may be in grave danger . . . and if christo
gets too close, he just might get caught in the crossfire.


this classic noir tale twists and turns down new york’s mean
streets and along hamp­tons’ beaches and back roads during a bitterly cold and
gray winter where nothing is as it seems and everyone has something to hide. in
an inventive storytelling approach, each writer brings his or her distinctive
voice to a chapter of inherit the dead, building the ten­sion to a shocking,
explosive finale.

my thanks to jonathan santlofer for being my guest today. fyi, here are the amazing authors who contributed to the book:


mark billingham, lawrence block, cj box, ken bruen, alafair burke, stephen l. carter, mary higgins clark, marcia clark, max allan collins, john connolly, james grady, bryan gruley, heather graham, charlaine harris, val mcdermid, sj rozan, jonathan santlofer, dana stabenow, lisa unger, and sarah weinman. plus, lee child writes the introduction and linda fairstein writes an open letter to the reader.

inherit the dead is available for purchase at amazon.com or your favorite bookseller. 

note: editor jonathan santlofer has arranged to donate any royalties in excess of editor and contributor compensation to safe horizon, the leading victim assistance agency in the country.


jonathan santlofer is the author of five novels and a highly respected artist whose work has been written about and reviewed in the new york times, art in america, artforum, and arts, and appears in many public, private, and corporate collections. he serves on the board of yaddo, one of the oldest artist communities in the country. santlofer lives and works in new york city.

guest blogger: anna lee huber!






i am delighted to welcome my guest
blogger, anna lee huber. she is the author of the the lady darby novels,
and one lucky reader is going to win a copy of mortal arts! 



thank you so much for hosting me! for
this blog post, i decided to go to my readers, to find out what they wanted to
know. what follows are their top five questions.



q.
both of your lady darby novels, the
anatomist’s wife and mortal arts,
are set in scotland 1830. what made you choose that time and place?



a. when i decided to write a
historical mystery series with a heroine who has some knowledge of anatomy, i
knew 1830 would be the perfect time period. it’s just after the trial of burke
and hare, two body snatchers-turned-murderers, which plays into the public’s
fear of kiera once news of her involvement with her late husband’s dissections
comes to light, and it’s just a few years before the anatomy act of 1832. not
to mention all of the other reforms being made with the catholic act of 1829,
the reform act of 1832, the beginnings of the building of railroads, the
ramping up of industrialization. it’s a very interesting period. lots of
conflict. i initially chose scotland because i needed an isolated location, and
the highlands were perfect for my purposes. i stuck with scotland because it’s
a country i love, and it’s the perfect setting for mystery. 



q.
which of your characters have you most enjoyed writing the most?



a. well, i certainly adore kiera, lady
darby and mr. gage, her fellow investigator and romantic interest. they’re both
complex, mysterious people who don’t give up their secrets easily. i’ve also
fallen in love with several of my secondary characters. in the anatomist’s wife, it was that rascal lord marsdale who wormed
his way into my heart. there’s much more to him than meets the eyes, and i have
a feeling we’ll be seeing him again at some point in the future. in mortal arts, it was william dalmay, and
i think anyone who reads the story will understand why. he’s such a
heartbreaking character.  



q. how much alike are you and lady darby? 



a. not much. in many ways i think i’m
more like her older sister. but kiera and i do have several things in common.
we both feel a bit like outsiders, never really fitting in. we both feel
strongly that people should be accepted for who they are—quirks and all. we are
both artists—she is a portrait painter and i’m a writer and musician. and i
think her way of looking at the world, of processing her thoughts, is very
similar to mine.



q. i shed more than a few tears reading mortal arts. you must deal with a bunch
of emotions while writing these stories. how do you deal with that? 



a. writing
the emotional scenes can definitely by tough, especially on the days when i
just don’t want to go there. and i had to go to some very dark places while
writing mortal arts. that can be
extremely draining, both physically and mentally. when i finish working on one
of those scenes, sometimes i have to make myself step away from the computer
and do something more cheerful, like taking a walk or playing with my cat. but
not always. sometimes it’s actually cathartic. i write murder mysteries, but
really so little time is spent on thinking about the murder. most of the book
is really about the quest for justice, the journey of the characters, their
efforts to cast light into a dark place. each novel in the lady darby series is
structured around a mystery, but the main thread connecting the books is kiera,
lady darby’s journey to accept herself and find happiness. that is what makes
dealing with the horrible crimes and darker emotions in the novels worth it. 



q. what books do you think should be mandatory for high
schoolers to read? i always like this question because everyone has such
different views on "the classics."



a. i don’t
know that i’m really qualified to answer this, or that i have specific
suggestions. but i do think high school curriculum should focus more on novels
that teenagers actually have the mental and psychological maturity to connect
to and fully comprehend. so many classics that i read during school, especially
in middle school and early high school, i simply was not old enough or wise
enough to truly grasp. when i re-read some of them later as an adult i realized
how much depth and richness i had missed. there are adult concepts that
teachers can tell their students about, but that doesn’t mean they understand
them. the classics i enjoyed reading, and feel that i had a pretty good grasp
of are: several of shakespeare’s plays, the
scarlet letter, a tale of two cities,
pride and prejudice, and jane eyre. i also enjoyed the great gatsby and wuthering heights, but i don’t think i
was able to fully comprehend them as a teenager. i read les miserables in college when i was about twenty years old and
absolutely loved it. to this day, it’s one of my favorite books. i think
teenagers could connect with it as well.

about
mortal arts: scotland,
1830. lady kiera darby is no stranger to
intrigue-in fact, it seems to follow wherever she goes. after her foray into
murder investigation, kiera must journey to edinburgh with her family so that
her pregnant sister can be close to proper medical care. but the city is full
of many things kiera isn't quite ready to face: the society ladies keen on
judging her, her fellow investigator-and romantic entanglement-sebastian gage,
and ultimately, another deadly mystery.

kiera's old friend michael dalmay is about to be married, but the arrival of
his older brother-and kiera's childhood art tutor-william, has thrown
everything into chaos. for ten years will has been missing, committed to an
insane asylum by his own father. kiera is sympathetic to her mentor's plight,
especially when rumors swirl about a local girl gone missing. now kiera must
once again employ her knowledge of the macabre and join forces with gage in
order to prove the innocence of a beloved family friend-and save the marriage
of another...

guest blogger: chris bolton 







please welcome my guest blogger, chris bolton. chris, along with his
brother kyle, has a new graphic novel out and will be giving away a copy to one
lucky reader!  





interview with smash

by chris a. bolton



hello, blog readers! my name is chris
a. bolton and today i have something special for you. rather than blather on
about myself, how and why i wrote the all-ages graphic novel smash: trial by fire (on sale september 10th from
candlewick press), or what it was like working wth my artist brother kyle, i
decided to let the pint-sized superhero and star of our
book speak for himself. without further ado, please welcome...smash!



smash: hi.



chris: i know you're very busy with homework and fighting crime, so thanks for
taking the time to speak with me. to start off, your real identity is--



smash: whoa! easy, there. first rule of
being a superhero: keep your secret identity a secret.



chris: that sounds like pretty good advice.



smash: i got it from a guy named the
wraith. he's this old-school crimefighter who could phase through walls and
stuff, but now he's retired and trains dogs. he's always trying to make me his
sidekick, and i have to keep telling him to go away. sidekicks spew! i want to
be a full-on superhero, not somebody's understudy. wraith should be my sidekick!



chris: but you're only ten years old, smash. isn't that a little young to be fighting crime?



smash: i don't know. i mean, i can fly, run
really fast, and punch through walls without feeling any pain. can you do all that?



chris: no, i cannot. where did these powers come from?



smash: that's also a secret.



chris: this isn't going to be much of an interview if you won't answer any
questions.



smash: hey, you called me, remember?



chris: let me tell you what we know from tv news footage. the super-powered hero
known as defender was captured by his arch-enemy, a criminal mastermind called the
magus. there was a freak explosion and a mysterious ball of energy erupted from
the building. next thing we know, defender is declared dead by the police --
and suddenly, a young boy who has his powers appears, wearing a smaller version
of his costume. is that about right?



smash: here's what i can tell you: my powers
are totally real. and yes, i am ten years old. but that's all i can say!



chris: were you a big fan of defender's before you got his powers?



smash: heck, yeah! are you kidding?
defender was the greatest hero that ever... hey, wait a second! you're trying
to trick me! i'm still not telling you if i got my powers from defender. but
yeah, defender was awesome. and so were his powers.



chris: so now, as the hero called "smash," you're attempting to pick
up where defender left off. even though you have his -- er, these powers, do you really feel that a ten-year-old kid can carry on such a
heroic legacy?



smash: uh, well... i'm trying to! i guess i've got a few things to learn. i mean, it's not
like you get flying powers and all of a sudden you're an eagle, you know? taking off and landing are hard. so is everything
that happens between take-off and
landing! but i'm working at getting better.



chris: we've also seen tv footage of you clinging to a flagpole. it kind of
looked like maybe you're afraid of heights?



smash: what? no! who said that? i'm not
afraid of heights! i love heights! heights are the best, they're my favorite --
i wish i could fly higher!



chris: okay, okay, relax.



smash: you tell all the bad guys out there
that i'm not afraid of heights! go ahead, say it!



chris: smash is not afraid of heights.



smash: that's better. geez, thanks for
giving away my biggest weakness.



chris: you mean, it would be your weakness, if you were afraid of heights. but you're not,
so it isn't.



smash: ...



chris: moving on. in the new book smash: trial by fire,
my brother and i attempt to tell your story in the graphic novel format...



smash: yeah, you guys really missed the
mark on a bunch of stuff.



chris: such as?



smash: well, for one thing, my secret
identity. you were way off on that one! who's this andrew ryan kid? i've never
even heard of that dude!



chris: well, we did some research and made an educated guess...



smash: way off! way, way, way off!



chris: okay, got it. what else?



smash: your brother, kyle? he's a really
good artist, but he drew me all wrong. like, he made my arms super-skinny and
my chest flat. but anyone can see my arms are really huge, with muscles on top
of muscles, and my chest is buff! it's like a block of concrete over a six-pack
of abs.



chris: i'm looking at you now, and you just look like a normal kid in a costume.



smash: well, you should get your eyes checked!
because i am huge! i once flew past the rock and he was all, "whoa! that
kid's so ripped, i'm gonna quit wresting and become an actor!"



chris: i really don't think that happened.



smash: you don't know, you weren't there!
anyway, i really liked the book except for those parts.



chris: i want to ask you about the magus. here was defender's greatest nemesis,
a criminal mastermind who commands an army of deadly minions. after many years
of fighting, the magus finally beat defender, once and
for all. with that in mind, how did it feel when you came face-to-face with
such a dangerous enemy?



smash: ha! magus has a reputation as a big
tough guy, but he's not so bad. he took one look at me and cried like a little
baby. it was nothin'.



chris: interesting you say that. as a matter of fact, we invited the magus to
join our interview--



smash: uh, what?



chris: -- and he graciously agreed! so, let's get him in here and find out what
he thinks.

smash: hang on, what's happening now..?



chris: mr. magus, welcome!



magus: you may simply call me
"magus." or, if you prefer, "master." or "your
highness."

chris: uh, well, i'm cool with calling you magus...



magus: 
in fact, let's go with "master." i like that. what is your
question, fool?



chris: after
so many years of battling defender, how did it feel coming face-to-face with
your new arch-enemy, who's a short, ten-year-old boy?



smash: short but ripped!



magus: frankly, i was unimpressed.



smash: he peed himself. i saw it happen.



magus: silence, boy! the next time i
capture you, i swear, by all the powers at my disposal...



chris: let's talk about that. magus, you trapped defender so you could steal his
powers. then, after smash started fighting crime, you tried to captured him to
take his powers. what is your obsession with these powers?



magus: i merely wish to use them for the
betterment of humankind. surely we can all agree that a small child is unworthy
to carry the mantle of "world's greatest superhero." i have had a
drastic change of heart since defender's unfortunate passing, and i now realize
my destiny is to protect the innocent and the meek from the forces of villainy
that lurk around us.



smash: uh, that's a stinky pack of lies! magus
is evil, okay? you can't trust a word
he says.



magus: don't listen to the boy -- listen to
your master! i mean, your savior.



smash: are you getting all this? magus is
obviously the bad guy! someone's gotta stop him from taking over the world. and
the last time i looked, i'm the only
person around here with super-powers.



magus: until i take them from you and claim
them for my own!



smash: yeah, right! the next time you try to
take my powers, you're gonna get a tattoo of my footprint on your backside! 



chris: okay, let's wrap this up before it gets out of control. do you have any
last words for us?



magus: i have perused this trial by fire book -- if it can truly be
called a "book" by any thinking individual -- and i find it to be
pure drivel. i never tried to hurt defender or smash. i only have the best
interests of the public in mind, and thus, this book is full of lies!



smash: and i just want to say, i kicked
magus's butt a whole lot worse than
it shows in the book!



magus: more lies!



chris: we'll just have to let readers decide for themselves what's true and what
isn't when they pick up their copies of smash: trial by fire,
new from candlewick press. they'll find it everywhere books are sold starting september
10th.



smash: nice plug! who are you,
self-promotion man?



magus: okay, that was a good one. that
deserves a fist-pound.



smash: get out of here, your face deserve a
fist-pound!



chris: and with that, we'll say goodbye.





about the book



whap! thud! crash! an
action-packed graphic novel simultaneously spoofs and pays tribute to superhero
lore while inspiring a new generation of crimefighters.



ka-boom! clobbered by fallout from a blast that kills the
local superhero, defender, andrew ryan suddenly has super strength and speed!
and he can fly! now it’s up to him to protect citizens from thieves, thugs, and
fearsome villains. he dons a homemade costume to hide his true identity, and
smash is born! but fighting crime isn’t easy, especially when you’re in fifth
grade. on top of evil robots and trigger-happy bank robbers, there’s homework,
curfew, and the school bully to deal with. not to mention the magus, a fearsome
villain who will stop at nothing to steal smash’s superpowers for himself!
influenced by film, cartoons, and of course, classic comic books, this vivid
escapade features a rib-tickling, high-energy storyline and the colorful,
exaggerated figures of nostalgic comic-book art: a combo perfect for kids
longing for a secret identity of their own.





about the authors

bolton has written comics, short fiction, stage plays, sketch comedy, and
screenplays. he wrote and directed several short films and an acclaimed web
series and recently completed his first novel. he lives in portland, oregon,

win moonrise by cassandra king! 






acclaimed author
cassandra king's new novel is moonrise, available on september 3rd from maiden
lane press.  moonrise is a novel of dark
secrets and second chances, new york times’ bestselling author cassandra king’s
homage to the gothic classic rebecca by daphne du maurier.


when helen
honeycutt falls in love with a man who has recently lost his wife in a tragic
accident, their sudden marriage creates a rift between her new husband and his
friends, who resent her intrusion into their close circle. when the newlyweds
join them for a summer at moonrise, his late wife’s family home in the
beautiful blue ridge mountains, it soon becomes clear that someone is trying to
drive her away, in king’s literary homage to rebecca by daphne du
maurier.



here cassandra shares
a few words about relationships, family dynamics and divorce --- all present in
moonrise.



q: in moonrise,
you’ve written about a circle of friends that includes not just women but also
men. the relationship within each couple is unique. while friendship has been a
regular theme in your previous novels, the women in moonrise seem more capable
of betrayal than in previous novels. would you like to comment on this? and
with the exception of your first novel, making waves, you’ve most often focused
on friendships between women. do you find it harder to write about men? 

a:
relationships are always complex, even the closest and most loving—or, perhaps,
especially the closest and most loving. in this book, i wanted to explore that
complexity in ways i haven’t in previous novels. yes, friendship is a beautiful
thing, but how do we deal with rejection? we all experience rejection at some
point in our lives, and it always hurts. and what about betrayal? i wanted to
look at the darker part of friendships--what’s often hidden beneath the amiable
surface. how do friendships survive jealousy, lies, loss of trust? and if they
do, what’s left? all that intrigued me, especially as it applied to the
relationships between men and women, both friends and lovers. i find it easier
to write about men than women for some reason. i toyed with having a male point
of view in this book in addition to helen’s and willa’s, using noel or linc as
one of the narrators. but tansy would not stand for it.

q: the stigma
of divorce is, for many, a thing of the past. with the increase in the divorce
rate, many more couples find themselves remarrying at midlife and having to
adjust to blended families. in moonrise, helen is rejected not only by her
husband’s circle of friends but also by his daughter. which do you think is
harder to bear, and why? 

a: it depends
on how you define family. most of us expand that notion well beyond bloodlines
or genetic ties, and close friends become like family to us. certainly in a
second marriage, efforts are made all around to expand the boundaries of the
family unit. helen and emmet each have a child who has left the nest and
started his/her own life, making for a slightly different situation (though not
an uncommon one). since emmet’s daughter has lost her mother, helen wants to
play a more significant role as stepmother than she might otherwise have done.
however, the daughter’s resentment is an obstacle that has to be overcome. from
my observations, i don’t think that’s an uncommon situation, either.



about the
author: 

cassandra king
is the bestselling author of four previous novels, making waves, the sunday
wife, the same sweet girls and queen of broken hearts, as well as numerous
short stories, essays and articles. moonrise, her fifth novel, is set in
highlands, north carolina. a native of lower alabama, cassandra resides in
beaufort, south carolina, with her husband, pat conroy.



if you’d like to win your own copy of moonrise, just send an email to
contest@gmail.com, with "moonrise" as the subject. make sure to
include your name and mailing address in the us only. this is a quick contest
so your odds of winning are really good - if you enter by sept. 11, 2013. good
luck!
