7 things that make linda different! 







 












 







1. hilarity 



linda is “fall out of your chair funny.” performing on stage for years with legends like the king of comedy, sid caesar, will do that for you. and we all know that content wrapped in humor is more engaging and memorable. 












2. drama 



									linda’s riveting and true story of how she was abducted and held hostage at gunpoint by an escaped convict will powerfully impact your audience and dramatically change the way they view their own lives. read more about this moment. 







 












 







3. expertise 



									former social worker, trial consultant, critically acclaimed author, bsw, mfa, certified professional speaker (csp) and winner of the prestigious cpae speaker hall of fame® award. recognized expert on customer service, personal leadership and sparking creativity and innovation.								












4. connection 



linda genuinely cares about the members of your audience and they feel it! she will make a substantial connection with you and several members of your group before, during and after her presentation. 







 












 







5. creativity 



linda makes her points in very creative ways! does the image of a grown woman on the far side of 50 wearing a helmet with a swiveling antenna sound…normal? 












6. entertainment 



as a former professional actress, linda knows how to infuse relevant content with high entertainment values. think powerful, moving stories, not dry bullet points. 







 












 







7. passion!
