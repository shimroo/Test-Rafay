                                        the flowers were absolutely beautiful! i got the regular size and thought that size was going to be small but they are a large bouquet. very happy with the arrangement! not to mention delivery was perfect as they had to deal with snow and ice as well. will always order from alice’s!!

                                        for the last decade, we’ve sent my mom flowers to honor our late grandmother. and alice’s has always delivered with such care and the most lovely arrangements. 

love supporting a local florist, they are a delight!

                                        i ordered for same day delivery.  the flowers were delivered without issue and the recipient was so happy and surprised to get them!  not sure why they don't give you the option to add a picture on this review but the arrangement was close to as advertised.

                                        i sent this arrangement, and others from alice's, to my sister who is in a nursing home and she tells me that the flowers are just beautiful.  the staff compliments them too,  i am confident that alice's always does a fine job.

                                        our friend thought the clear skies bouquet was incredible, and the bonus of locally made chocolates really outstanding.  she knows this flower shop.  i knew her sister's name is alice.  a triumph all around.  and a huge grateful thanks to them for being so considerate with the delivery.  thank you so much!

                                        i ordered fresh flowers from holland and chose "designer's choice" on the website. when i saw the picture of the bouquet and read my children's reaction that the bouquet of flowers was not only beautiful, but that the flowers smelled delicious, i became very happy. thank you so much for your service and also that the delivery could be made at the suggested time.
