dyersburg real estate is scarce

the dyersburg real estate market is scarce. what i mean by that is there are not a lot of homes listed in the dyersburg tn market. houses that are priced correctly are getting snatched up one or two days after being listed. if you are reading this and own a home in dyersburg and you are ready to sell, call me or my staff today at 731-285-2277.

so how is the dyersburg real estate market oct 16, 2018

wondering about the dyersburg real estate market? let me put it as simple as possible. if you list your home within 2-3% of the actual value it should sell quickly if you have done your home work. by home work i mean is your house presentable? all all the repairs completed? is there any glaring defects?

 home sales are actually down only because of the lack of homes on the market. i personally have 6-7 clients just waiting on the right home. other good agents in dyersburg also have buyers waiting to purchase. if you are thinking about selling and waiting till spring then this message is for you. spring in the real estate market is already here. call or text mike frazier at 731-589-7841 to begin the process of selling or even buying your home.

dyersburg real estate sales are booming like other areas of the country

the dyersburg real estate market is booming like many other areas of the country. in a recent article by the national association of realtors titled, "realtors confidence index survey" reveals the real estate market conditions around the country.

if you are a potential buyer in the dyersburg real estate market this is why you keep missing those buying opportunities. the average days on the market for a properly priced home is 30 days or less! 

this is exactly why dyersburg is turning from a buyers market to a sellers market. these are all reasons to hire the real estate team at carousel realty. let mike and his staff help you buy or sell a home. call us at 731-285-2277.

notice in that second picture that demand is expected to be very strong in the next 6 months.

more jobs coming to dyersburg tennessee

there are more jobs coming to dyersburg tennessee. a new company named frazier industrial(great name) just announced that they have selected dyersburg where they plan to build a state of the art manufacturing facility.

their plan is to complete construction in 2018 and hire 120 people. carlos oliver the ceo of the company stated at the announcement that one factor that helped their decision to build here is the tennessee general assembly passed a new law(improve act) that was signed last month that will give manufacturing companies the option to use a single weighted sales factor which is a new form of tax break. i expect that many more manufacturing companies will also start relocating to tennessee and also to dyersburg.

if you are moving to dyersburg with this company or with hopes to get hired by this company please consider using my real estate firm carousel realty. we offer short term and long term rental housing as well as assisting with your home purchase. we can be contacted at 731-285-2277.
