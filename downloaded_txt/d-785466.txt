conquer stress, depression and dependence…


featured in:


for over 25 years, jeff rutstein, has been providing personal fitness training for a diverse population of men and women coping with a broad range of challenges:



patients referred by their mental health professional as part of a clinical treatment program, who are dealing with every day stress or the more daunting prospect of recovering from depression, addiction, eating disorders and other psychiatric conditions.   


high profile executives seeking to manage their everyday stress for greater productivity.


individuals who want unparalleled service and the best personal attention.



 you can be assured that you will receive the utmost privacy and confidentiality.



a compassionate and caring approach to total wellness 


jeff rutstein provides a compassionate, caring, and individualized approach to emotional and physical wellness.  your sessions of "mindful movements" take place in the comfort of your home, office, or his private studio.


by setting attainable goals and using your current activity level as a starting point, rutstein will develop a program of depression beating exercise therapy that is tailored to your individual needs. this gradual and gentle program helps reconnect the body and mind; which leads to higher functioning, increased energy, and peace of mind. no sweating involved! (unless you are ready!).


alex vuckovic, m.d., professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school, and medical director of the pavilion at mclean hospital, states, “rather than emphasizing the need to get buff, jeff trains his clients to get their minds and bodies connected through exercise. in that way, his program is far ahead of the game.”


jeff’s mindful movements approach to fitness helps people get over the barriers they face with exercise. here is what his stress and depression melting exercise program can do for you:


• improves your body image and self-worth: there is a link between exercise and self-esteem.  you feel better when you see your body becoming more toned and losing body fat.


• gives you a sense of control: exercising gives you a sense of accomplishment that you’ve done something healthy and positive for yourself.


• plain-to-see evidence of progress: your strength steadily increases and your adl’s (activities of daily living) become easier to accomplish.


• distracts you from problems and negative feelings: helps “burn off” stress and negative feelings.


• physical comfort improves– aches and fatigue that often accompany anxiety and depression become less and less noticeable.


• compulsive eating typically drops away with exercise: you will be less likely to eat ‘junk’ food when you are exercise and leading a healthier lifestyle.


• sleep improves: when you tire yourself out with healthy physical exertion.
