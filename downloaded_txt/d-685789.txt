our members in their words


 

esa has been an integral part of my career preparation and professional development. the society not only provides the opportunity to learn about the latest technologies, meet the scientists behind the work, and present my own research, but the society also provides many opportunities to become involved in committees, journals, and leadership positions even while a student and early career professional. these opportunities have helped me develop necessary skills while opening doors for networking, collaborations, mentorship and lasting friendships.
dr. tamra reall
field specialist in horticulture, university of missouri extension, esa member since 2010



 

membership in esa has enhanced my career. esa journals have provided an international audience for my research in regulatory entomology. esa provides aspiring young scientists with an introduction to a branch of science that is unique and diverse in specializations.
dr. victoria y. yokoyama
esa honorary member since 1974



 

esa is a dynamic, collaborative, and pivotal organization for the advancement of entomology around the world. it affords its members, especially its early career professionals, opportunities to become engaged in leadership, to maximize their professional development, and to network with established leaders in the field. the esa annual meeting is a must for young entomologists to keep up on the latest research, find new jobs, and to build their cv. i cannot recommend joining esa more highly.

research entomologist, usda-ars center for grain and animal health research, esa member since 2010
