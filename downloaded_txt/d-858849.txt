 we do our best in all we do, with god’s love. ‘love one another. 
as i have loved you, so must you love one another. by this everyone will know that you are my disciples.’ john 13:34-35


we are a small, caring, church of england school, housed in a victorian building set in beautiful grounds in the village of west dean, in the heart of the south downs national park.
our christian vision is at the heart of all we do. as jesus taught us, we value all children and adults in our community as individuals, setting and achieving high standards, driven by purposeful, exciting learning. everyone in our school is loved and nurtured by our team of dedicated staff. we believe that, for children to thrive in school, working in partnership through positive relationships with families is key. we also believe that inclusivity, tolerance and respect are cornerstones of the christian faith. our ethos and practice is rooted in the teachings of jesus, therefore all are warmly welcomed at west dean, regardless of their own faith.
our stunning location within the south downs national park and at the heart of the west dean estate, is also very important to us. we make regular and frequent use of our outdoor environment as an integral part of our curriculum, enabling our children to develop a deep knowledge and love of the natural world around them.
 we hope that you enjoy browsing our website and find it useful. please do get in touch if you have any queries or suggestions or would like to arrange a visit: we would love to hear from you and show you around.
chris williams
headteacher


keeping children safe is a priority for us all.  any concerns of any kind should be reported, in confidence, to mr williams, who is our designated safeguarding lead and headteacher. 
 
in the absence of mr williams, mrs reynolds will support with any safeguarding concerns.  mr edward younghusband leads our governors in monitoring our safeguarding work in school.  our governors and premises staff work hard to keep the school well-maintained and safe for us all. 
additional and special educational needs at west dean ce primary school
mrs bowman is our senco and will help if you feel your children have learning needs which may need a little extra or different support.

what are cookies?
cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. cookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
cookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, eschools) are called “first party cookies”. cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics). the third parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.
