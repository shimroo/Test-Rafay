safety near trains





while the number of highway-rail crossing collisions, deaths and injuries has dropped over the past five decades, it’s still a startling fact that about every three hours in the u.s., a person or vehicle is hit by a train.

82% decline in collisions





we’ve helped to reduce the number of train/motor vehicle collisions from a 1972 high of roughly 12,000 annual incidents to approximately 2,200 incidents in 2019. source: federal railroad administration statistics.
