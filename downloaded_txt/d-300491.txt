â jen braverman, transworld trade shows




âchad is an unbelievably talented artist. the fact that he is able to take that creativity and use it to build websites that not only look good, but also work well and are reliable is just one of the reasons we've loved partnering with him over the years.â
â edward douglas, midnight syndicate




âsinistervisions.com have built and serviced three web sites for me over the past 6 years. chad's input, design, backup and all around service are a credit to him, especially as we are based in the united kingdom. i would not hesitate in recommending chad and sinistervisions.com to anyone wishing for web design and creativity.â

â leonard pickel, hauntcon




âchad savage has a command of typography that isn't seen anymore... and that's only one of his skills; he's really a pioneer in horror / haunted / fantasy corporate id and digital design. most of the work you see in this arena that wasn't done by him was most likely influenced by him. he's an original.â
â joe sena, emce toys / cinefantastique magazine / the monster channel




âchad savage delivers, in an internet world where most designers and enablers spew and wheeze far beyond their capacity. chad views complex codings with an artist's eye â­ which makes him the real deal. he walks the walk. hire him now before he wises up and prices himself accordingly.â
â david j. schow, author




âi knew by hiring sinister visions i would get excellent results. the results were even better than expected. thanks for exceeding my high expectations.â
