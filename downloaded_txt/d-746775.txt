the barn at the weald and downland museum



it has been a privilege to work in the barn for the tv program, the repair shop. i have been in 12 episodes and in the background of a few more. everyone is as lovely in real life as they are on the programmes. the museum is well worth a visit.https://www.wealddown.co.uk
