   norbert wissing (1959)

 

the music of norbert wissing
is
based on colour as is shown in his colourful orchestration as well as
in the inspiration norbert draws out of paintings and photo-collages.
his refined orchestration he learned from the renowned dutch master lex
van delden.

in 2010 the acquaintance with artist and poet sharon miedema let to a
new, more intense accent in his music. recent works in this style are
"sharons songs" and "otto dipinti di sharon".

repeatedly studying and listening the music of great composers as
shostakovitch, sibelius, nielsen and prokofiev strengthens the
continuous flow of his imagination.

he composes music for orchestra and chamber-ensembles, as well as music
for theatre. he wrote music for the fassbinder play "bremer freiheit"
at the occasion of the fassbinder-retrospective of the ostade-theater
(amsterdam, 1998). 

his orchestral music is performed by the ricciotti-ensemble, which
played his "fassbinders tod" on tour through the netherlands, sweden
and denmark (1998). 

the composition "light" for soprano, trumpet and organ is performed in
the 2006 season of the enschede music festival. his interest in
orchestration is shown in his collaboration with hans van eck in the
arrangements of classical and modern works.

 hans van eck
(1958) 

 

 'music is basically the
art of listening'

the art of music arises from the digestion of sounds in the ears and
minds of the listener. in the chain of creation the composer is only
one facet, the performer and listener play just as important a role. in
my opinion this is even more true when timbre is used as the most
important carrier of meaning.

thoroughly educated in the music of the western classical tradition, i
added new viewpoints to my art. from my musical hero's giacinto scelsi
and luigi nono as well as from music from the far-east (japanese
gagaku) i learned to work with the basics of sound. studying
compositions by claude vivier and the music of the near east taught me
about the use of melodic lyricism and the expressiveness of micro-tones.

in the late 1990's i became interested in sound-art after meeting the
visual and sound artist hans van koolwijk. for some of his
installations i provided compositional elements and timing, sometimes
resulting in many hours of music as in the 12 hour 'passages': the
music for the 'klankkaatser' (sound reverberator 2010). our
collaboration led to the development and building of new musical
instruments for which i composed many pieces; the most prominent for
the bassboxes.

the magic of sounds is for me the most important aspect of music. the
foremost goal of my compositions is to make the listener experience
sounds as they are, taking him beyond the surface of the music. my
musical style might be described as lyrical and colourful. the use of
live electronics and soundtracks is so integrated in my way of making
music that i cannot do without it.

i co-founded the schreck ensemble with the late arie van schutterhoef
in 1989 in order to perform music that combines the use of acoustic
instruments with the new sounds offered by modern computer technology.
my music is published by mcn/donemus, amsterdam and can be found here.
