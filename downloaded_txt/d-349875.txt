		for many years, i had the pleasure of working with karen eernisse for my insurance needs, and i can't recommend her highly enough! from our very first conversation, i was impressed by her extensive knowledge of the insurance field. karen took the time to explain all the options available to me, ensuring i understood the details and benefits of each policy.

what stood out the most was her genuine commitment to finding the best coverage for my specific needs. she patiently answered all my questions and provided tailored recommendations that truly fit my situation. it’s clear she cares about her clients and goes above and beyond to ensure they feel confident in their choices.

karen also kept me informed every step of the way, making the entire process smooth and stress-free. if you’re looking for an insurance agent who is not only incredibly knowledgeable but also truly dedicated to her clients, look no further than karen eernisse. she’s the best in the game!

		worst experience with western truck insurance they’re supposed to renew my policy in time. i did remind them two months before the renewal. the barton told me we are working on my cote  and i spoke to the manager. he told me same thing  two days before my insurance renewal  they  told me we need lose  run records which is not a possible two days before i end up paying 9000 extra for my policy because they never work on time every time i call them they not answer phone calls and not reply for the email shame on you guys if you can’t help someone simple say no the way they are treated there customer i am sure they have fake reviews   all truckers think twice before getting their services
