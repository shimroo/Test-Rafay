testimonials



sandy gordon
, recreation director
“kathy was knowledgeable and answered our questions… when it came time for installation the construction crew were equally easy to work with, met our deadline for installation, and also answered any questions we may have. overall, we are very pleased with the outcome and the splash pad has been very well received on our community. we wouldn’t hesitate to work with them again on another project.”

joe heiby
, park maintenance supervisor
“i cannot say enough about todd and his staff. they are top notch and i really appreciate the hard work they do and their attention to details. we had that small issue with a loose post at the new playground and todd was so quick to respond and address it without question. it was taken care of last friday and the playset is a welcome addition to that neighborhood. when todd and his crew are on a job, myself and my staff all know that it will be done correctly and look great when it is finished.”

diana savage
, former superintendent of school
“from the initial design meeting to installation of the finished project, the team was well educated, well informed, and professional.  since the moment the construction tape was removed - parents, students and visitors have been using our playground every day, from dawn to dusk.  thank you to kathy and the team for helping us to design a playground that will be utilized by many for years to come!  ”

“dwa is such an easy company to work with for any project.  they went out of their way by following up with me as the items were ordered, installed and in use.  city of tiffin will always use dwa recreation.  i can't wait for our next project!”

kim conrad
, director
“on behalf of the citizens of the city of grove city, i enthusiastically recommend david williams and associates and gametime products for outdoor recreational needs.  the sales staff are professional, attentive and friendly.  they truly work with you to ensure that you are receiving exactly what you want.  the installation staff is equally as attentive to detail and the needs of the client.  one example of the excellent service provided by david williams and associates was on a project for an inclusive playground we recently built.  our community advocacy group for persons with special needs were enthusiastic and involved in the selection process for the playground.  kathy, bob, chris and the other associates with david williams and associates were very patient, understanding and more than willing to ensure that the needs of these community members were thoroughly met.  i know our relationship with the company will continue for a long time into the future!   ”
