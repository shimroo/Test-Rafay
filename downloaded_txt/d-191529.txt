david w. allan










a unified field theory, including a new
        theory for gravity and experimental evidence, is introduced by an
        internationally recognized leader in the field of ultra-precise time and
        frequency measurements, david w. allan








 


      "after the third tribulation, a
          new source of energy will be discovered that taps the earth's magnetic
          field."




-- hopi prophecy








 


 
      


     
              "physicists have already brought most of the forces of nature
              into a single underlying theory. the ultimate theory will
              incorporate gravity as well."




-- steven weinberg, time,
            april 10, 2000; p. 86














for the weekend scientist: evidence of new gravity theory in
                your refrigerator.








formulae behind new u.f.t.: justifications, experiments,
                evidence.
