is there a god? who is god? is
  jesus christ the son of god? 




"the people
        walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land
        of the shadow of death a light has dawned."     
        isaiah 9:2





"not one recognized
religious leader, not moses, paul, buddha, mohammed, confucius, etc., has ever
claimed to be god; that is, with the exception of jesus christ. christ is the
only religious leader who has ever claimed to be deity and the only individual
ever who has convinced a great portion of the world that he is god." -

is there a god? 



looking for answers to
          questions like: is there a god? who is god? is jesus christ the son
          of god? was i created by god or evolved? what does the bible say about
  witches, witchcraft, and the occult? how does islam differ from christianity?
  how do new age practices like yoga, astrology, and meditation fit in with christianity?
  is god there, will jesus christ help me? the answers are here on this christian
          apologetics website, earth harvest. the purpose of this web site is
          to explore and answer eternal questions such as: is there a god? who
          is god? what is the nature of god? is jesus christ the son of god and
          as such god incarnate? offering proof that god does exist and exploring
          from a christian perspective: the issue of trust (faith), the trinity,
          mystical experiences, witches and witchcraft, yoga, how new age mysticism
          has crept into christianity, the lure of the new age, signs and wonders,
          the spirit of delusion, hearing from god, recognizing the spirit of
          god, being born again, acquiring new eternal bodies after death, and
          what death holds for those who believe in christ and those who don't.
          christianity's greatest proof, the resurrection of jesus the christ,
          will be analyzed, as well as the numerous messianic prophecies which
          jesus fulfilled and the odds of such prophecies being realized by chance.
          the resurrection and these prophecies evidence the existence of a god
          outside the dimensions of space and time. a comparison of creation
          and evolution is made and the validity of the theory of evolution is
          investigated.this web site is a work of apologetics or a presentation
          of the beliefs and proofs of the christian faith and their defense
          against theological corruption. finally and most importantly, you will
    be shown how you can establish a personal relationship with god.

the bible & nostradamus on the origin of antichrist.





daniel's vision







lost book scan


who is the antichrist?  what do the bible and nostradamus say from where he will arise?  do they reveal his identity and the circumstances of his ascendancy to power?
is the antichrist from libya, as nostradamus seemed to imply, or is he from syria?  is he the âassyrianâ mentioned in bible prophecy, the âking of the north,â the âlawless one"?  in the present turmoil in the middle east are there clues as to who he will be, which group of people will he arise from?   did the old testament prophet daniel prophesy his coming and where he come from?  is time a physical dimension which prophets can pierce via the inspiration of a supernatural intelligence outside time and space and give us a glimpse of what is to come?  for a detailed analysis read, 
 âthe bible & nostradamus on the origin of antichrist."

"white yogiâ, a story about the search for the ultimate truth by michael graham.





read "white yogi" by michael graham now


about michael graham: michael graham was once the disciple of an indian swami and a teacher of new age techniques until an unexpected encounter with ultimate truth turned this life around. michael, who had embarked on an intense and far-reaching spiritual journey from the time of his graduation from elite geelong grammar school in the mid 1960âs, came to find himself at the heart of the great migration to the west of indian religious teaching and practices.   for the next 28 years, 4 spent in india, michael became one of the foremost western practitioners of yoga and meditation.  he pursued his search for enlightenment, inner peace and truth with unparalleled dedication.
michael was one of the first western disciples of swami muktananda paramahansa, who was to become a leading figure in america and elsewhere with his teachings of siddha (perfect being) yoga. michael helped manage his ashram (spiritual center) in india. he also became deeply involved in muktanandaâs american activities and energetically promoted his teachings in australia and elsewhere. 
michael returned to india several times, and studied and practiced under other gurus also, some of whom were to become famous (and in some cases, infamous) in the west, such as bhagwan shree rajneesh. in 1977 he rejoined muktananda in america and spent some years working and touring with him and his successors. muktananda was attracting huge numbers of followers
michael's story and personal transformation is extremely interesting and surprising.

"be healed by the god who caresâ, a free booklet authored by sherif michael.





"be healed by the god who cares"


now available free online! if you face serious physical illness and your body is falling apart, you need to turn to the source of life and healing.  god can heal, heals daily, and may heal you this moment.  god should not be limited nor minimized by our inability to conceive who he is.  quoting jonathan edwards, the triune god upholds the universe instant by instant.  god defines physical reality.  if you don't believe in god's son, you face a much more serious consequence... eternal torment, an existence banished from the only source of  light, joy and peace.  physical healing is for the present, but spiritual healing is the greatest gift, as it is forever.
by believing in god's son, you have eternal life.  faith is a gift from god, but jesus christ used his fulfillment of old testament prophecies and his miracles to evidence his claims that he and the father are one, that before abraham was "i am," that "he who has seen me has seen the father." we need to build our faith to believe, and then by his stripes we are all guaranteed spiritual healing and some of us will be physically healed.  to develop faith, this booklet examines some of the proofs of the christian faith, the fulfilled prophecies, the proofs of christ's resurrection, the moral argument for the existence of god, and present day physical healings in fiji.   for those who are sick and very likely not capable of extensive reading, "be healed by the god who cares" is short and an easy read.  it is also inexpensive so it can be given to all those in need.
