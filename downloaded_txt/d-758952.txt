welcome to the home page of the currituck cut-ups located in currituck county, north carolina
the currituck cut-ups square dance club, in the past has danced at the currituck high school, but recently we have had to change our dance location to elbert's barn located at 441 north sandy hook road in shawboro, north carolina.. map directions are located on this site..... we dance every second and fourth saturday of each month, and the dance begins at 7:30 pm and lasts until 10:00 pm.we dance mainstream and plus levels. all dancers are welcome, so come out for fun, friendship, fellowship, exercise and "good food".

great food every fourth saturday dance!!!
every fourth saturday night of each month, we have a food theme. click the "2014 dance schedule flyer" link to see what each month's food theme is. we have some great cooks, so come dance with us and see for yourself. remember, this is not a "covered dish meal". we do all the cooking, all that you need is your partner, or we always have experienced dancers on hand if you need someone to dance with.


 "latest updates from the club" our next dance will be july 26th.... come join us .....our july 12th dance has been canceled....
