beans don't burn on the grill





blogger & i have enjoyed a 5 ansd 1/2 year love affair but it is time i moved on.  no big reason for the switch.  i've been thinking about it for a while as wp allows you to password protect individual posts instead of having to password protect the whole blog.  and when & if we ever get a kid i want her pics to be password protected.  from now on you can find me at www.shanny.wordpress.com.  movin on up!
