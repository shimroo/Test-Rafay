our programs 




rescue and rehabilitationeach year, we intake hundreds of dogs, puppies, cats, and kittens who need help and provide them with basic necessities and tons of love while looking for their forever homes. 



low-cost wellness clinicsour low-cost wellness clinic services help owners keep pets up-to-date on their preventative care, including annual exams, core vaccines, and routine blood testing for common diseases. 



spay and neuterwe love puppies and kittens, but pet overpopulation has reached crisis levels throughout the country. in 2024, we spayed and neutered 1,188 animals to help break the cycle in kalamazoo. 








 




about our wellness clinic 



in partnership with dr. kathleen corbett, dvm, we host periodic wellness and vaccination clinics for members of our community. by offering low-cost preventive care, we help families access veterinary care for their beloved pets that they may not otherwise be able to afford.
