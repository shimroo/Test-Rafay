anyone can draw



itâs as easy as abc



my method



thatâs right! i believe anyone can draw! it doesnât take a special kind of talent. thatâs because drawing is a skill. just like with writing. you didnât learn to write your abcs in one day or two.



seriously, if you can write your abcs, you can draw. how? look at the alphabet: itâs a grouping of symbols that make words. after a year or two of practice, you learned how to create words.



 as  i say in all my classes and workshops, âi will teach you how to draw, using line, shape and form, but youâre the one who has to âworkâ at developing your drawing skills. itâs all about practice, but worth it every time!
