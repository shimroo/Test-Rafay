our story
 





our storyone week boutique was started with the intention of giving families the opportunity to earn some extra money by reselling items that are still in good shape but their children have outgrown. we’ve always believed this was a great way to provide a wide array of merchandise at an affordable price. at the end of each sale, any unsold items that aren’t claimed by the consignor are donated to crisis nursery or salt & light ministries, ensuring that all of the merchandise ends up finding a good home in our community.
