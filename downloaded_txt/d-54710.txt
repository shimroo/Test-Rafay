âdonât concentrate on making a lot of money, rather on becoming the type of person with whom people want to do business.â



bill burke is an internationally recognized trainer and recovery expert who teaches back country driving techniques, winching and extrication methods, vehicle preparation and maintenance, land navigation and woods skills through classes, private training, instructor and trail leader courses to individuals, families, groups, clubs, vehicle manufacturers and dealers, tour operators, government agencies, and all organizations that use 4wd vehicles in their operations.
4-wheel drive education starts with an understanding of how a 4-wheel drive (4wd) works, giving you insight into why your 4wd performs as it does. bill, through his experience as an ase master truck technician and the use of training aids, will teach you how to get the most out of your 4wd. each obstacle, stuck vehicle, and piece of 4wd equipment becomes a discussion, a demonstration, and an opportunity for learning. safety is fundamental.
billâs sense of humor and history, geographical expertise, and environmental insight combine to give a greater sense of civilization as we know it relative to the prospectors, explorers, natives and dinosaurs who were on the trail before us! his comprehension of group dynamics and personalities means that even in large groups, each person feels like a vital part of the training rather than merely a participant. from first-time 4-wheelers to highly experienced drivers, each student will expand their skill level exponentially under billâs watchful eye.



"everyone is still talking about the experience. there's even a thread in the "members" section regarding a more advanced driving class. you & chris definitely knocked it out of the park... rising sun will be back! thank you for having us. it was truly an eye opener for me and my driving/leadership skills jumped by leaps & bounds. truth be told, i'm still processing a lot of it!!!"
– travis hurleycruise moab coordinator committee





âif you are looking for a trail guide and 4wd instructor, you can do no better than 4-wheeling america.â
– john lee expedition exchange

		turns or traction - we still need to pick a good line to allow 3 to move the 1     ??!!a differential system is essential for transmitting power from the engine to the wheels, allowing them to rotate at different speeds, especially during turns. here are six common types:1. open differential: the simplest and most common type, it splits torque equally between the wheels but struggles with traction as one wheel spins freely on slippery surfaces.2. limited-slip differential (lsd): combines open differential behavior with better traction by limiting the speed difference between wheels, using clutch packs or viscous couplings.3. locking differential: locks both wheels on an axle to rotate together, ensuring maximum traction in off-road or extreme conditions.4. torque-vectoring differential: actively distributes torque between wheels, improving cornering and handling in performance vehicles.5. spool differential: fully locks both wheels permanently, common in drag racing but unsuitable for regular driving.6. electronic differential: uses sensors and braking systems to mimic differential behavior, enhancing control in modern vehicles.#mechanic #automotive#carrepair#carmaintenance#carhacks#cartips#asmr#mechanic#technician#tutorial#mechaniclife #reelsfb #fypã·ãviral #fypã·ã
