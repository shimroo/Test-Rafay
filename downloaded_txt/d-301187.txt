san francisco, where dining is so fabled that some visitors flock here just to eat, has more restaurant options per capita than anywhere else across the nation. reigning here are ethnic cuisines from a (afghan) to v (vietnamese and vegan) and well beyond. bucking a trend toward smaller enclaves, chef michael mina's showplace in the ornate westin st. francis hotel (where dinner for two can run $500) woos with caviar, foie gras, double-cream cheeses and the purple potato. more intimate hot spots include michael tusk's 15-table quince with renowned pastas, tartare, serving tuna tartare parisian-style with a raw quail's egg atop, boulette's larder at the ferry building marketplace, offering organic breakfast and lunch, and jack falstaff where the ahi tuna martini is flavored with white soy, topped with oregon wasibi and green-apple granita. 

while union square and fisherman's wharf are packed with restaurants, savvy visitors won't want to overlook options in more distant neighborhoods such as haight-ashbury, the sunset, the richmond, north beach, and others. innovative chefs combine the bay area's abundance of organic produce, seafood, free-range meats, and northern california wines to create fabulous dining experiences where taste sensations are virtually unsurpassed. so-called "small plate" menus are gaining popularity as an affordable way to sample more options. also hot at many restaurants are fixed-price or tasting menus that often include dessert. good tables at top restaurants require advance reservations several weeks in advance for weekends and are advisable for weekdays as well. all bay area restaurants are smoke-free, even in separate bars and lounges, but patrons are welcome to smoke outside.
