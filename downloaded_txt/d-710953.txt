what do you love about pres?










"what i love most about pres is the people - all of the students and staff! they make pres a welcoming environment as soon as you walk through the front doors. you should consider coming to pres because you will meet new people and can get involved in a lot of sports and clubs, even as a freshman."

sydney ohlmann ‘25











"i transferred to pres because my last school was too big. i felt like a number in a building and wanted more of a home. since i have been at pres, my sisters and teachers have made me feel so at home, loved, and cared for! i am more than just a name on a list here. i belong, i matter, and i am recognized!"

grace mcgregor ‘23











"what i love most about pres is the small size and the community. you should consider coming to pres because you can be your own person! you can take ap and dual credit courses, get one-on-one help from teachers, and be involved in extracurriculars starting freshman year."

abby fortener ‘25
