proanagen: the anti dht and hair loss formula therapy


































home 
        of the anti hair loss and thinning hair products
































 
        over 
        90% of hair loss and thinning hair cases are due to dihydro-testosterone 
        (dht)
        ...hormone 
        in human body. 
 
        dht 
        reduces the hair follicle until it no longer produces visible hair.





 

 
        proanagen 
        (proangen) is a potent natural topical solution that blocks dht 
        production,
...which 
        causes hair loss and thinning hair within scalp.
 
 
 


 
        proanagen 
        has other extra strength ingredients that promotes thicker and
...healthier 
        hair.
 
 
 


 
        proanagen 
        is effective and safe for both men and women.
 
 
 
 


 
        proanagen 
        is backed by 100-day 
        money back guarantee.
 



 
              rogaine® (minoxidil) can grow hair, but it can not block 
              the dht hormone that causes most hair loss cases.
so 
              you could keep growing hair with rogaine®assuming 
              it is working for you, but the dht hormone keeps damaging hair 
              follicles. 
proanagen 
              topical solution and shampoo can help blocking this damaging hormone 
              that causes hair loss.
