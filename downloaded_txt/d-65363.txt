lake county tax collector expands concealed weapon license services to include replacement options
 
the lake county tax collector’s office is proud to announce the expansion of its concealed weapon license (cwp) services. effective immediately, residents can now replace a statewide concealed weapon license at any lake county tax collector service center. this addition complements the existing cwp services, which include original license applications and renewals.
florida commissioner of agriculture wilton simpson partnered with my office to pass legislation that extends this opportunity to our community. “we are pleased to be able to expand our partnership with tax collectors to make it easier and more convenient for floridians to receive concealed weapon license services and exercise their second amendment rights,” commissioner simpson said.
“our office is always looking for ways to improve and provide new, innovative ways to best serve our constituents,” said david w. jordan, lake county tax collector. “adding the capability to replace concealed weapon licenses locally makes this important service more accessible and convenient for the residents of lake county. previously, this option was only available by mail through tallahassee or by visiting a department of agriculture regional office in orlando.”
