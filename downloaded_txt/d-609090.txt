stand up paddle board (sup) rentals
stand up paddle board (sup) is a fast growing sport that offers a fun,
  easy way to enjoy the water on cape cod.  

rent our stand up paddle boards (sup)...have a blast with friends & family! 

easy to learn for adults & kids (and women excel at sup because of their lower center of gravity!)  
sup can be done on any body of water, from high surf to flat water. 
great exercise for improving core strength & balance 
a perfect way to explore the beautiful shores of the cape 
sup boards are longer and wider than traditional surfboards, so they provide more stability for a person to stand while paddling 
stand up paddle boarding originates in the hawaiian islands. in the early 1960s, the beach boys of waikiki would stand on their long boards, and paddle out with outrigger paddle
