perfect for entertaining and personal enjoyment. no longer will you need to decide which rooms  will have a great view and which rooms will have a minimal or no view at  all - the rotatinghome allows you to see your entire view from all the  major rooms in your home! if you prefer to enjoy your view in the open  air, a   viewing deck can surround the entire circumference, or just part, of your home. a rotatinghome may be just right for you. 
you  choose the speed of rotation. we  recommend a variable speed from one revolution in 30 minutes to one revolution  in 24 hours. a rotatinghome is perfect  for an upscale beach house or large mountain cabin or even in areas prone to  storm surges! steep mountain terrain is  not a problem as the rotatinghome can be built up on a central steel  column. with only one fully rotatinghome  that meets 21st century building codes currently in existence, its uniqueness and technology are unprecedented!
