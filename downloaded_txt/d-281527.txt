what really counts:


the case for a sustainable and equitable economy








politicians and economists fixate on growing the economy measured by a country's gross domestic product. but this yardstick counts harmful activities such as greenhouse gas emissions, plastic waste, and cigarette sales as gains, and it ignores environmental protection, voluntary community work, and other benefits. what we measure is a choice, and what is and isn't counted determines what sorts of policies are enacted. how can we shift the focus to well-being and quality of life?
what really counts is an essential, firsthand story of the promise and challenges of accounting for social, economic, and environmental benefits and costs. ronald colman recounts two decades of working with three governments to adopt measures that more accurately and comprehensively assess true progress. chronicling his path from nova scotia to new zealand to bhutan, colman details the challenge of devising meaningful metrics, the effort to lay the foundations of a new economic system, and the obstacles that stand in the way. reflecting on successes and failures, he considers how to shift policy priorities from a narrow economic-growth agenda toward a future built on sustainability and equity.
colman has taken the critique of gdp outside the academy and attempted to realize an alternative. the lessons he offers in what really counts are vital for anyone interested in how we can measure what matters and how better measures can help build a better world.

human impact on the environment ~ greenhouse gas emissions


the cost of climate change



 every dollar invested in climate change action now avoids more than $17 in future damagesâgpi atlantic 



the costs of future climate change are so astronomical that even modest investments cutting greenhouse gas emissions now will produce huge savings in avoided damages in future.
climate change economists estimate that each tonne of greenhouse gases we emit will cause at least $38 in global climate change damages. when compared to costs of drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions now, gpi atlantic found that every dollar invested now will save at least $17 in avoided future damage costs.
nova scotia has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% since 1990, mainly from electricity, through increased use of wind power, heat pumps, and efficiency measures. but nova scotians are also driving more, and emitting ever more greenhouse gases from cars and gas-guzzling suvs. every nova scotian still emits 18 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year â twice as much as west europeans, 65% more than quebecois, the fifth highest in canada, and the fourth highest per dollar of gdp â 13% above the national average.
in nova scotia, climate change is predicted to increase extreme weather events, particularly hurricanes, floods, and droughts, and to flood low-lying regions round halifax harbour, yarmouth and the bay of fundy due to sea-level rise, higher tides, and greater storm intensity, frequency and surges.
the geological survey of canada projects a 75-centimetre sea level rise in halifax harbour this century. nova scotiaâs southern and eastern shores will see more erosion and coastal instability, and environment canada warns of potential saltwater infiltration into nova scotia groundwater, threats to communication links, and falling lake and groundwater levels.
gpi atlantic has a new share the earth youth project. students may also join the gpi climate change working group to help produce briefs like this one. please contact gwen@gpiatlantic.org to sign up and check the gpi atlantic facebook page for details of upcoming workshops.
