update 1/29/25


now added to the havocrecords.com webstore are two new limited shirt designs from destroy. we printed these from the original photostats/films from the 90's. printed at tee squared in minneapolis on next level shirts sizes s-xxl. we printed these for the gig here and this will be a one time run of these. there's not enough room in the havoc records bunker for a shirt distro, so get these while you can. scroll down the menu on the left to "t shirts" there's also a handful of code 13 shirts left from those gigs.
