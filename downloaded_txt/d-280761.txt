cafr1 - walter burien, since 1998 has diligently worked for you bringing forward into the light of day what needs to be known about the collective scope of government finance and massive investments held. government is not funding cafr1. in fact several from within government have taken much from me over the last twenty-years. several individuals have pitched in since 1998 to assist cafr1 in its efforts. "that is why cafr1 is still standing today". if you can assist with direct operating funds, please go to the cafr1 donation page  or call 928 458-5854 a.s.a.p. 
i know for a fact, one (1) person can make all of the difference in the world for a positive outcome! that one person may even be you. my genuine and valid request is made of you this day.   exposing nests of scorpions for visibility to the public is dangerous. (scorpions don't like it when you show others where and how they nest) for those that help, a big thank you from wjb
bio: walter j. burien, jr - welcomes you to cafr1.com - "collective" government's massive and true wealth exposed!

ending taxation - "the only game in town" - 2011 
the new cafr1 documentary -  "first cut" the way our government can be 


 
please share the above video with everyone you know
and ask them to do the same
"the only game in town" (with that only game being ending taxation)

 

 
if only al capone was an attorney, he may have written new laws and made it to president

 


what st. augustine had to say about what we now call government:

 "a gang is a group of men under the command of a leader, bound by a compact of association, in which the plunder is divided according to an agreed convention. if this villainy wins so many recruits from the ranks of the demoralized that it acquires territory, establishes a base, captures cities and subdues peoples, it then openly arrogates to itself the title of kingdom, which is conferred on it in the eyes of the world, not by the renunciation of aggression, but by the attainment of impunity"
 
your choices in the political arena: indeed, the plunder has become so common, and the plunderers so smug and self-confident, that their predations are taken for granted, and the thieves themselves treated with extraordinary deference! it is something akin to the stockholm syndrome. you encounter the same mugger at the same spot every day, and eventually establish a sort of bizarre relationship with him----even, eventually, thanking him for not taking more. when you are given the opportunity to replace him with another mugger, you vote for the incumbent---sticking with the devil you know, unless his opponent offers to share more of his loot with you.

** clipping from the spotlight news paper - 1990 press picture (not 1989)   click here
 
** clipping from the nj news paper the trentonian  
august 25th 1990 - nj governor jim florio and walter burien (aka: bubien)
(link to the article below) notice that the reporter uses the word "budget" over and over again when it is the nj state cafr that is at issue 
*** in fact:  if you look on the table, that is the nj 1990 state cafr opened in front of me. governor florio signed the inside cover: "to hands across new jersey, governor jim florio"
you will see all of the cameras hovering over the table, abc, cbs, cnn, nbc, wor, all of the networks were there filming every minute of the 45-minute encounter. there had to be at least 100 reporters jammed in around the table. 
during the discussion i said to governor florio: 
"governor florio, myself as a financial advisor, if i had a stock offering and sold 100% of the stock in my company and made a 10-million dollar profit this year but told my share-holders i made a 1-million dollar profit and paid dividends only on 1-million dollars to the share-holders this year, #1 that is misrepresentation, #2 that is fraud, #3 i would be arrested and thrown in jail. the state of new jersey has inacted statutes that allow them to do what is totally illegal for any public company to do." 
well, i thought he would try to skate around that comment or ignore it. the reporters were on the cliffs edge squeezing in their hand held recorders and boom mics being on their tippy toes to get as close as possible to hear the reply. what governor florio said to my amazement was: "i know, i have been trying to do something about that."
well, every recorder and network film camera caught my statement and his reply. the reporters almost fell over when they heard the governor's reply. now if this was truly a free country "in any respect" you would expect to see that statement and reply on every front page and on every network news broadcast that night and picked up by the national broadcasts. 
** what happened in reality was: not a peep from any. not a word in print nor a network news film shot second. this was the first stop of a scheadualed two-week tour for governor florio to stop throughout the state promoting the largest tax increase in the state of nj to date. he was supposed to make three or four stops a day over that two-weeks. they cancelled the tour and the first stop was his last.

cafr  -   government   -   and you

filling in the void of government "collective" investment and gross income totals 
 

 

old hebrew for: "the teacher is here"    
 
the cafr shell game-the revolution-be a part of it!
      "gross" income of government is now 1/3rd "tax" income and 2/3rds non-tax income derived from: return on investments and money generated from government enterprise projects.    any company or in fact country can be "made" or "broken" through the use of those government investment funds. china and india in 2007 restricted new us "government" investments, now several trillion dollars strong in china and india so that us government investments would not further increase control  (take-over) in  their own markets. china and india learned by seeing what happened to mexico then russia when the us government investment machine came rolling on in. if us government cashed in just 20% of their international investment chips (held outside of the dollar), in conversion back to the dollar, the dollar would shoot through the roof, with the dollar index jumping from 70 from its low to over 94 in the snap of a finger -  dollar index chart get it? (post note: they are doing it!)   a complete government and (taken over by government) syndicated news media blackout has existed for over 60 years and it started back in 1946, due to the money involved!    wake up! this is fact, not fiction and it affects your every day life!    
 
** the #1 profit makers for government on their investments are: the pharmaceuticals; banking/finance/insurance; oil companies; war industry;   and "international investments outside of the dollar" - (400% to 600% profits)  

government pension fund cafrs give a clear showing of the investments held. to see "one" for ny click here( 2006 - nysr-cafr )    or for ca  ( 2006 - calpers - cafr ) a .pdf file. to see many cafrs, click on the big red staples button that says "cafr downloads" and to see many government links to cafrs, from the "2002 - 2012 articles" link at the top and bottom of this page, click on it and look for the link to "government cafr listings". towards the bottom of that page will be the government pension links where a site search for cafr will pull up many cafr reports for government pension funds. (collective totals there are about 24 trillion) 

   
as you and others die, or become slowly impoverished government profits! you are the minnow, government is the shark, get it? i hope so... government and the syndicated media "entertains" you "in every way" good or bad so that you look in left field as they masterfully conduct business as usual in right diminishing your wealth as you channel surf on the tv each and every day! catch the comprehension now as to how your wealth and productivity are being drained folks or the next step  soon to be is they will be draining the blood out out of your corpse and at that time it is to late to learn or have an effect on the outcome of your circumstance. most people scratch their heads saying: "something is wrong here, but i just can't figure it out." 
the problem my friends is:   due to the money involved!   
local and federal government's gross income in 1999 was 8.5 trillion dollars and the entire population's of the usa gross income, "net after taxation" 4.8 trillion dollars.
   would you like to see a government accounting office (gao) audit of the irs? then click here (to save this file you have to scroll to the end of the report for it to finish uploading then it can be saved)  jump to page 89 and 90. (data for the 1999 report gives 1997's info shown)      personal individual income of the usa is listed as 5 trillion dollars (add across all in gross income column)  and  corporate at 15.5 trillion dollars (add across all in total receipts column)    after corporate deductions it left the largest corporations with about a 1.5% tax bill and   for personal income (page 89) after deductions for the largest personal individual incomes a 27.04% tax bill.   smile comrade, it could be worse? or could it?

tribute to gerald klatt - a retired 30-year federal auditor - commander of special investigations - us air force
mr. klatt died 07/11/04. the following link at archive.org will bring you to the archives of the pages from his site as a "snapshot" updated the month before his death. after his death someone, somehow deleted and modified much information from the pages on his site. the links on each page, most are archived and when clicked on go to the same date archive of that page:
https://web.archive.org/web/20040708041151/https://www.cafrman.com/
mr. klatt died on his birthday, july 11th 2004. i found out about his death when gerald's son from a previous marriage in 2006 could not find his father. i checked his house in tucson, az - sold. i checked his phone, email, and website information - no longer valid. i then searched the ss death records and discovered he died on 07/11/04. i  then called and informed his son from gerald's first marriage of his fathers death. the circumstances of gerald klatt's death to me are still unknown. the son who was living with gerald klatt, skip (troy) klatt was an attorney. what happened to him is also unknown to me. 
**no other party from government, organized education, or any political party has ever openly made a cafr review available to you out of their own self interest or fear of reprisal due to the money / control involved! please copy from the archives mr. klatt's cafr reviews for your state and distribute to all responsible parties within your state. read and learn from the archives of his linked pages. 
use the example of his work to conduct your own cafr reviews. do a google search for cafr "and" your local city, county, school district, state university, state retirement fund, etc., download their cafr reports and do reviews for yourself. mr. klatt can no longer do it for you and it appears no one else from within government will do it for you either. they are much to busy spending and taking your money. also to include you in the "loop" it appears to be a violation of their exclusive club rules... state cafr reviews - if all local governments cafr reviews from "within the state" were included in with the state reviews, potential surpluses would be much greater! i briefed and then requested of mr. klatt in 1999 to use his expertice as a federal auditor to launch a cafr review site. mr. klatt agreed and six months latter cafrman.com was launched. 
please copy and distribute mr. klatt's cafr reviews and info you consider noteworthy from his other pages. his reviews are from 2003 but can be used as a guide for any other year forward.
 
please download, share, and view the following .pdf file. it is a copy of a letter from gerald r. klatt to walter burien from 1999. i attached at the beginning a cover letter i composed 11/27/12. gerald wanted me to keep his name confidential in 1999 but being that he died in 2004, i am releasing his letter at this time. the file is an image file of 7 megs so it will take a while to load. copy and distribute - http://cafr1.com/states/1klatt1999-read.pdf
 
** keep in mind that the trf as recommended on cafr1 is the long term fix! after you look at a state cafr review, then look at your many city, county, school district, state university cafr. government enterprise operation such as toll ways, bridges, ports, water, sewer, power, recycling, cafrs should then be looked at.
pensions, self-funding debt financial authorities, self insurance authorities cafrs should be looked at also. as of 2012 there are over 184,000 "individual" annual financial reports (the cafr) produced by just our local government operations. each with their own investments and cash accounts..
the composite totals of investment assets held internationally by usa government is staggering. between local and federal government, the total of liquid investment assets held internationally as of 1998 was a conservative sixty (60) trillion dollars. come the year 2007 the collective totals topped a conservative (110) trillion dollars.
download the 1997: federal consolidated financial statement: click here and then the federal 1998 cfs . for 1995 through 2013 - https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/reports-statements/financial-report/previous-reports.html
(the 1999 report) shows the populace of this country had gross income of 8.2 trillion dollars.
as of 1999 the public's income after deducting for taxation: local gov (1.6 trillion dollars - "local government's cafr data") federal gov (1.8 trillion dollars)
this left the population with: 4.8 trillion dollars net after taxation.
local and federal government's "gross" income brought in 2x the money then the entire population of the usa did net after taxation!
3.4 tax + 5.1 nontax = 8.5 trillion dollars
 

only 1/3rd of government's gross income was tax income..


get it? i hope so!

you now know the primary reason why gorbachev went democratic, more money - more control! 
 
we showed him the better blueprint for true communism with a capitalism and fascist twist.
russia from the past, the state openly owned everything. in the usa the state truly owns everything, but through walls of well masked corporate veils created over the decades. (scary point is: the us local and federal government is now run and maintained primarily by attorneys. your elected officials, almost all attorneys)
us government now has more control over and wealth amassed from the people then the old russia ever thought or dreamed was possible. the trf (tax retirement fund) can and will help put thing back in line where they were intended to be based on the wishes of a free people with the public as the "first line benefitiary".
 
it is time to regain our freedom at all costs and without delay! 
are you ready to make it so? --------------------------------------------- 
the gross income is how much? 
that is right, government is making much, much more than you ever thought. the figures are on this and "their" sites. look and you will see.
keep in mind, government only wants you to see one side of the picture; coin; etc. the debt, you will turn your back to the debt in fear or disgust and look the other way.
then look at how much money they have to hire; buy off; and control; the best marketers; psychologists; strategists; takeover specialists; entertainment propagandists; etc.; etc.; etc;.
 
please look at the other side of the coin
 
learn the basics please!
"gross" income of government from all: sources, tax and "other"
                              
 
see, learn, think, communicate, then act! save your country while you still can! future generations of this country and the planet depend on it!!!
don't fail them please
do you know how many trillions of dollars your local and federal government has invested with mexico, china, the old soviet block countries? investments held in foreign currency? government investments that greatly profit from that cheap labor abroad and a lower dollar. 
 
investments that profit even more when the dollar drops in value due to foreign currency exchange rates?
 
you should know! 

could it be that our own government over the last several decades has been promoting to those fortune 500 companies, of which government owns most through bond - loan investment / stock ownership [examples from 1999: 82% stock ownership of microsoft corporation, disney 61%, aol - time warner 58%, exxon 72%] to manufacture abroad so that government would realize greater returns on their investments at the peoples of the usa's expense in jobs and wealth retention.
accomplishing: laying the groundwork for balancing world wealth, the primary foundation block of the nwo - new world order! nah, our government wouldn't do that for a few extra trillions of non-tax-income dollars right?
well, sorry to say it to you but wrong!
in the 60's, most government investment funds were restricted to a cap of 5% to a maximum of 10% invested outside of the usa. by 2000, that restriction has been increased in many a case to over 45% and in some cases no restriction at all per percent of international investments held. (guess who or should i say "what" made the big overall profit from the 911 event?) could it be? let's not go there! to many bubbles may burst.....
is the big picture coming into view for you yet? i sure hope so! correction is needed!
that is if you still own your country to make a difference. well do you? own it that is? well, do you? if you answered yes to that question, you are wealthier than you thought.
wishing for a better future for all of us.  yours truly, walter burien 


 
no longer an intact family since 11/23/05 upon the use of armed force for the kidnapping of mr. burien's seven year old son john by some representatives of a criminal government from nj and az, in a state of insurrection, paid with by money liberated from you and me. i have noticed one consistency to identify our country's criminals. many bear titles such as: attorney, judge, or commissioner. that is good! it makes them easy to identify if needed. as of 12/25/12, i have not been able to see my son for seven years after extensive effort applied to do so. when the fix is in throughout a corrupt judicial system, they do not play fare and the criminal maleficence from the courts is pervasive.
 

court and court related communications files - 1994 to 2012 - all 
it appears that many attorneys have now taken over the city councils, county board of supervisors, house, senate, and governor's office. the separation of powers doctrine mandates attorneys being officers of the court (judicial branch) that they should not be able to run for public office being from two branches of government. (executive / administrative branch) stop this now!the root of the corruption / graft / destruction of our country is coming from this breeding grounds. here is why you are being bled dry! the very corrupt from the judicial branch have slithered their way into elected and appointed positions within the executive / administrative areas of government.again, it is the nature of this beast to bleed you dry, if they can that is..if you from this point forward vote for an attorney running for office, you are more than foolish, you aid in the assured degradation  and plunder of your own country. remove these attorneys from public office now! mandate a ten year lapse from being an officer of the court before an attorney can run for public office and ten years after leaving office. this is a must to do now. it is not an option. make this the law now in your city, county, and state. you now know why you are being bled dry. it is the nature of this beast. 
   
 
 

** they say this is a country of laws, well, when the law itself is lawless by application and when the intent of the law is for extortion of wealth or reprisal over protection of the people, then the letter of the law itself becomes mute and the application thereof a crime in itself to be repudiated.
