welcome to the java community process!













welcome to jcp.org, home of the java community processsm (jcpsm) program.  the jcp is the mechanism for developing standard technical specifications for java technology.
anyone can register for the site and participate in reviewing and providing feedback for the java specification requests (jsrs), and anyone can sign up to become a jcp member and then participate on the expert group of a jsr or even submit their own jsr proposals.
 

to get the most out of the site, register now.  

for more information about the jcp program, refer to our overview page.
