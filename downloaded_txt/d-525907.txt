the triumf/isac beta nmr homepage


β detected nmr
is an
exotic form of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) in which the nuclear
spin precession signal is detected through the beta decay of a
radioactive nucleus. it takes advantage of the  new world
class
radioactive ion beam facility (isac)
located on
the campus of the university
of british
columbia. 
we have recently developed a beam of low
energy
hyperpolarized radioactive nuclei for applications in condensed matter
using an optical polarization scheme. the nuclear method of detection
along with the high degree of spin polarization means that
βnmr at isac
is about 10 orders of magnitude more sensitive than a conventional nmr
experiment. the beamline and associated instruments are 
unique in
the world and open a new window into the magnetic and electronic
properties of ultrathin films, nanostrucures and interfaces. the
central question to be studied is how do the local electronic and
magnetic properties near an interface or
surface of new  materials (e.g. a high tc superconductor)
differ from those of the the bulk?  β detected nmr  is a
natural
complement to the renowned muon
spin
rotation program at triumf. both are part of the triumf center for molecular and materials science.
