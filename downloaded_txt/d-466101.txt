mastering the art of french cooking:  case studies in first edition identification

the beck/bertholle/child groundbreaking publication of mastering the art of french cooking, one of the 20th century's seminal cookbooks, is massively 
misrepresented in commerce as a first edition when it is anything but. and i'd be hard put to come up with a title that creates as many issues as this one. 
for once it's not the publisher's fault!

how to price inventory: part i: current and historical pricing resources

when discussions pop up about what a specific book is "worth," somebody often points to prices of copies that are currently listed for sale, whereupon 
somebody else reminds us that those are prices of books that haven't sold, the implication being that so-called comps (or comparables) 
of unsold books are all but useless for pricing your own stuff. what's needed instead are historical prices - that is, prices of books that 
have actually sold. this is the gold standard, right?









 









the nigger bible: robert h. decoy's controversial masterpiece

it as groundbreaking; others voiced less favorable opinions.

sourcing inventory: how to turn a $5 book into a $150 sale

shortly after publishing last month's newsletter, i received an email from a subscriber asking me if i would write something about sourcing inventory. it's certainly one of 
the more talked about bookselling topics out there, and i've written a number of articles about it myself, primarily in past gold editions. but, how about something new on it - 
and free? i should warn you, however, this is an angle you might not expect to hear. or want to.











from the editor

two short articles on cookbook authors today, the first on a fairly new entry into the marketplace, and what a splash she's making, the second on somebody who for decades 
has provided me with bookselling opportunities. here's the kicker: i may be wrong, but i suspect that most of you have never heard of either one. finally, i couldn't resist taking 
a stab at an analysis of the current state of bookselling.









 









brenda gantt: flash in the pan or in it for the long haul?

today a video can be uploaded to a high traffic platform, and a star can be born near instantly, assuming all the essential ingredients are in place. this happened 
to one brenda gantt, only there was at least one unusual fact: she was born in 1947. do the math.









 









nitza villapol: the cuban julia child

nitza villapol was a fixture on cuban tv for decades, not to mention a legend. her appeal had at least something to do with her recipes themselves, 
but a lot of what drives values here was and remains poverty and food shortages in cuba. she had a gift for doing much with little, whether it was devising 
delicious recipes out of lower cost ingredients or simply doing without some ingredients and ingeniously substituting with others. 









 









the state of bookselling: 2023

maybe it was naive of me to expect that, in the early 2000's, what was mostly wild west bookselling then again) would gradually evolve into 
something more professional - that competition would weed out many amateurs over time, leaving primarily booksellers who actually took the trouble to 
learn the trade and get paid consistently in kind.











special announcements

two feature articles appear today - a review autograph dealer stephen koschal's new book, authenticity for sale, exposing the 
incompetence in autograph authentication, the importance of choosing the right autograph dealer and my own take on an alarming trend in the interior dã©cor biz, namely, 
shelving books backwards.









 









matters of signature authentication

the topic of signature authentication comes up perennially, and two questions in particular repeat themselves: 1. how do i know if my signature is genuine? 2. do i need a certificate of authenticity? 
though we have covered this ground more than once at bookthink ...









 









shelving books backwards

i've put this off as long as i could. for a few years now there's been a growing trend to shelve books backwards - and it's become epidemic, especially on tv shows that focus on home 
decor. some contend that ...

it's getting close to year's end, and some of you might be thinking about a purchase or two that could
mitigate some of your tax consequences next year. if you're operating a bookselling business, any purchase you make from bookthink can be written off as a business expense. to this end ... 









 









the death of the forum?

i can't begin to count the number of booksellers who have lamented the death (or decline) of online forums. 
sure, there are other ways to connect with our fellow booksellers - book fairs, facebook, etc. - but you and i know it's just not the same. perhaps this trend is no 
more apparent than on ...











update announcements

i attended an estate sale a few days ago - thirtysomething miles away but an hour-and-a-half drive. i suppose i need to get used to this, 
the breathtaking traffic in the dc area. if nothing else, it slashes the number of sales i can get to in a morning. in this case it was only two. the first sale was â¦ 
interesting on several counts ...









 









tactics for establishing contacts

i was thinking back today - way back - and in all my years as a bookseller, i can't recall doing business with a single liquidator who knew much about books.
oh, there were two who hired so-called book specialists to price their books, but it didn't take long to discover that neither of them had a grasp of more than
a few niches - and were clueless about most everything else. i'll never forget how one of them ...










from the editor

about a month ago i completed a move to another state. it's been a crazy year, and, in a perverse sort of sense, moving fit right into the craziness. the huge downside to moving has been losing 
all the local contacts i had spent many years cultivating (and befriending). the upside is that i'm now planted in an area that's well known for its enhanced inventory opportunities ...   









 








estate sale strategies for booksellers

experienced booksellers who depend on local estate sales, auctions, etc., for inventory acquisition no doubt have proven strategies for maximizing their efforts to grab the good stuff amidst competing booksellers, especially when both other booksellers and books are many. sometimes it's an 
all-out athletic event, sometimes less challenging, but, if you're new to the game, some sort of strategic approach to a roomful of books is helpful. mine is more or less three-pronged.

bookthink's proverbs of bookselling: the eighth five

when i first started selling books on ebay eons ago, almost nobody posted photos with their descriptions, and those that did most often took photos with conventional cameras, 
had the film developed by a third party and scanned the resulting prints into their computers. it was a multi-step process - both time consuming and expensive. i didn't bother. 
then digital cameras arrived ...











update announcements

there are numerous things that betray the amateur - or inexperienced - bookseller as an amateur. often the description alone gives 
it away via exposing a lack of command of bookselling terminology. or not using something resembling the standard format. but perhaps just 
as often it's what's not in the description. 









 








turkey talk: a bookseller's guide to charley harper

as a bookseller, early on, i recall doing market research on ebay almost daily - and almost daily coming across a seemingly ho-hum looking book titled the giant golden book of biology. 











from the editor

no question there are significant advantages to specialty bookselling. for one thing, it presents you with the opportunity - maybe i should call it a requirement - to truly 
know your subject, and when you do know it, you can consistently get the best prices for your stuff. it also enables you to focus your efforts on inventory acquisition. we live 
in a time when ...









 









surf's up!: approaching a bookselling specialty

confession: i have never in my life been on a surf board, but surfing has always intrigued me, and somewhere along the way it's become one of my cluster of bookselling 
specialties. perhaps being born in california has had something to do with it, but i know there's more to it than that. in his introduction to 200 years of surfing literature: 
an annotated bibliography, steve pezman captures some of the mystique of early surfing: " ... the numbers of surfers grew increasingly noticeable. but even as our numbers grew, the 
ride itself remained an intangible ...

as my family and friends know, this has been, health-wise, a difficult year for me, and in a sense it began in november, 2016 when i contracted a strep infection followed closely on its heels by a 
bout with bronchitis that would persist for many months. this triggered, in turn, three er visits, four ekg's and numerous additional tests along with visits to various specialists in an attempt 
to diagnose why i was having, among other things, serious low blood pressure episodes. a latest event - this has been especially fun - has involved an elevated psa. i'm sure that the last thing most of you want to hear is a tale about somebody's health issues, but i'm telling you mine because i feel as though i've let some of you down, maybe more than some, 
by being slow issuing both free newsletters and paid reports. if there's good news, it's that i think that all of this health junk has been solved, and i feel better than i have in months. i'm also 
feeling enthusiastic about bookthink - and very much want to get on with things here. 











special announcements

years ago, the ebay bookseller's forum, aka the bsb, was a fount of useful bookselling knowledge. one of its more prominent contributors often posted what i guess you could call 
bookselling aphorisms - concisely worded, generally applicable truths about bookselling. one such aphorism, re-posted recently by a surviving bsb member on the "new and improved" (not) 
ebay forum, was the following: "most new bookdealers burn out within three years ... " i've seen more than a few of them burn out myself over the last, now almost twenty years, but still, 
some don't. coincidentally, for those who don't it seems to take a similar period of three or four years for them to actually get it, as in, "ohhh, now i see what i need to do to make 
this bookselling thing work." 









 









experiments in bookselling: le miracle du professeur wolmar

when purchasing inventory, no matter what venue it happens in, there is always risk. the best we can do, it seems, is to make educated guesses on what will sell for a profit and hope to be 
right most of the time. having access to historical pricing obviously lessens the risk, but collector interest - for that matter, institutional interest - can change at any time, and even what 
happened yesterday is no guarantee of what will happen again. but there are times when, if you're like me, you take what in gambling parlance is called a flyer. a flyer goes beyond educated guessing 
and is perhaps better characterized as wild guessing. i like to think that i'm better at this sort of thing now than i once was, if for no other reason than experience seems to enhance my instincts - 
and taking a flyer on something is almost purely instinctive, if not totally so. 










update announcements

one would think that the passing of an author who wrote a book that, to date, has 
sold over 50 million copies would merit something more than a yawn, but no fireworks have gone off since robert james waller's 
passing a few days ago. more in today's feature article. 









 








robert waller's the bridges of madison county: we'll always have paris

author robert james waller passed away on thursday, march 9. there wasn't much fanfare about it, certainly nothing on the order of a few others recently deceased. prince, say. 
or arnold palmer. typically, authors don't achieve celebrity status, and why should they? at best they lurk in the background while we read - and sometimes get lost in - something 
they've written, their faces nowhere to be seen. and it doesn't seem to matter much if somebody like waller penned one of the bestselling novels of all time - the bridges of 
madison county. over 50 million copies sold to date. 










from the editor

as most of you know, popular movies and television shows often drive sales of associated material - books, for example, magazines, and so on. in the 
case of the recently concluded history channel reality show series, the curse of oak island, this phenomenon has certainly been afoot. today's feature 
article gets into more detail about this. 









 








buried treasure for booksellers: oak island's money pit

perhaps no buried treasure story is more intriguing than the one long circulated about the money pit on oak island in nova scotia - a deep tunnel dug near the 
shore of the island, presumably in the early 1700's. peculation has it that it was used to bury pirate booty, though other theories abound, including one that a cache 
of shakespeare's manuscripts are down there. through an ingenious system of tunnels ...

so. another year. bookthink was founded in 2003, nearly 14 years ago, and much in bookselling has changed since then, not the least of which is there's no longer easy money to be made - 
at least not that i know of. but there is money to be made - still - and it can largely be done without getting up from your chair. opportunities for purchasing inventory online 
abound now, and if you find this process at all daunting, let me suggest that you start on a venue that you might already be comfortable with ...









 








how to buy books online: a case study

though i purchase a significant amount of inventory elsewhere now, i still spend time most days on ebay searching for things i can make a buck on. what makes ebay a good starting 
point is that you don't have to risk a lot of money. today's feature article offers a case study on how this can be done even if you've never seen the book you're buying nor 
heard of its author. 











special announcements

something i've long observed feedback i've received at bookthink is that there are, more or less, two types of buyers for our reports. there are those who want what i would call hot 
information - tips - that will help them make fast money. and there are those who realize that this approach to bookselling - scoring big and soon - is little more than a recipe 
for disillusionment. the latter are more interested in the foundational knowledge required to build a successful business on. though some of bookthink's reports do emphasize what to buy, i've always attempted to keep most of the focus on what's needed in a more fundamental sense. 
if you're new to this game, it's important to know that you can succeed - and do it in more than a modest manner - but it's perhaps more important to know that nobody gets there overnight.  









 









bookthink's proverbs of bookselling: the seventh five

bookthinks proverbs of bookselling continues today.











update announcements

not so many years ago international sales comprised about 25% of my sales. today it's down to about 15%, 
but i hear reports from not a few booksellers that their international sales have all but gone away. today's feature article examines reasons for this and suggests at least 
a partial solution.  









 









have your international sales gone away?: a packaging suggestion that might turn things around

recently, i participated in a discussion on a bookseller's forum in which somebody declared, "i ship everything in a box," then later noted that his packaging cost alone was about a 
buck a book. a buck a book? this is far from the first time i've heard this sort of thing. the use of boxes by booksellers seems to persist, stubbornly, as though there was something 
sacred in it. or that, once one graduates to using boxes exclusively, one has arrived as a bookseller. what a bunch of applesauce.  











from the editor

just back from vacation, this year to russia, the baltics and several scandinavian countries - and no, not once did i darken the doors of a bookstore. i understand that bookselling 
is pretty much a 24/7 undertaking for most of us, but i've discovered that it's a good idea (for me) to drop everything remotely related to bookselling for a few weeks once a year and 
let the world catch up to me. and clear.  









 









a bookseller at antiques roadshow: the "reality" of reality tv

last month i attended a filming session of the long-running pbs series antiques roadshow. this was staged in a huge hall at the orlando convention center, and approximately 
10,000 people moved through at various times during the day, each bringing one or two items for evaluation. the footage, once edited, will comprise three episodes of the show 
and be aired sometime next year.

what you might be doing better at estate sales: the power of attitude adjustment

do you depend on estate sales for part or much of your inventory? if so, how is it going? do you enjoy getting up in the middle of the night to be first in line? once inside, what then? 
is it fun, fun, fun battling other booksellers for books? paying more and more for the books you are able to grab? or maybe, too often, you come out 
empty-handed, having burned an entire morning for nothing? been there. i have felt the pain. but perhaps there is a better way to go about this? some suggestions in 
today's feature article.









 









a cheap, safe and practical method for packing books from scratch

i was never happy with commercial book boxes. they seldom fit right, aren't sturdy enough and still cost money. envelopes and bubble mailers were not an option 
unless i could fit boxes into them, so by minor trial and error i've developed a very simple, common sense, geometrically oblivious method for safely packing books that 
works within my one man business. my customers have responded quite positively over the years so, even when i came close to purchasing commercial boxes during the most 
prosperous times, i decided to stick with what works. plus, the method is inherently friendly to recycling.

bookselling proverbs are back today, #26-#30.









 









bookthink's proverbs of bookselling revisited: the sixth five

as it is with so many professions, in bookselling there are things that must be done pretty much every day - or at least often. books to pack and get out the door, sales to attend, 
emails and phone calls to address and so on. and then there are things that can be put off until there's time to do them, listing books being one of the more crucial activities. but 
when have you ever arrived at the end of a work day and said to yourself, "my work is done." it isn't done; it can't be. there is always something that is left undone. 











update announcements

sell many cookbooks? if you don't, it's likely you're leaving money on the table again and again. next to bibles, i consistently come across more cookbooks worth bothering with at sales 
than anything else. if cookbooks are something you're serious about - or intend to be - there are some bibliographies that can prove useful. today's feature article takes a close at them.









 









if you're serious about cookbooks: the essential bibliographies

when i got into bookselling, i knew next to nothing about cookbooks, nor was i overly interested in learning about them. but it wasn't long after i began to do market research that my 
interest perked up considerably. i discovered that there were a handful of cookbooks i encountered at sales time and time again that sold for real money online - $50, $100 (and more) real. 
in the ensuing years i've continued to learn more about them, and this has genre evolved into one of my specialties. in very recent years i've begun to focus on mixology as well. 











special announcements

some things in bookselling change; some things, seemingly, never do. one of the changes often cited is that the internet has leveled the playing field among more 
experienced and less experienced booksellers. or has it? today's feature article offers a case study to ponder.









 









food chain bookselling: does it still apply?

take a look at most any book with more than a few copies listed on most any major bookselling venue and, more often than not, you'll see an array of prices - sometimes a dizzying array. 
there are a number of factors that can explain this, at least potentially. condition might come to mind first, and it can be a huge factor in some instances, as can the presence or absence 
of a dust jacket - or other factors that play into the issue of completeness. and one's business model may affect things, say, in the case of a mega-dealer who needs to move stock 
quickly to keep a business viable, and thus price to sell. and - e-books and pod's are there in spades to complicate things.











special announcements

low cost, sturdy shelving for booksellers

over three decades ago i walked into a used bookstore in the historic district of a midwestern town and beheld an extraordinary array of bookcases that shelved what had 
to be over 100,000 books. i wasn't there to buy books; i'd been called to the scene by the proprietor, who needed even more bookcases. a friend of hers had built the original 
units but was no longer available, she explained, and, after leading me up to one of them, then asked, "can you build me something to match this?" "i can," i said, "but i won't."











special announcements

today's newsletter isn't a newsletter as such but a sort of addendum to last week's newsletter - namely, some feedback from it. 
i've put together five representative opinions in the following article, which i think you might find interesting. if you don't know 
what a bookjacker is, you'll soon find out.









 









fraud in the book biz: some feedback

a few representative opinions on last week's newsletter.











special announcements

fraud in bookselling is an age-old issue, and even in our time - a time when it's so much easier to out somebody who isn't 
doing the right thing - it persists. in today's feature article i present a case study of an ebay seller who has been getting away with murder for years. 
i would appreciate your feedback. 









 









fraud in the book biz

i'm not much of a policeman. i spend a lot of time buying books on ebay, so it's inevitable that i run across misrepresented books - a lot of misrepresented books. 
to be charitable, i assume that most of them aren't deliberate misrepresentations, and mostly i just move on when i see them. even if i felt so inclined, there wouldn't be 
time to address every last one of them, and if i tried, i'm not sure it would foster much goodwill or even change most seller's practices. i sometimes make an exception 
when a book is represented, for example, as a first edition, is anything but, and it's getting bid up and up - and it's clear that the buyer will be hugely over-paying 
for something that isn't what the seller says it is. mostly i get polite replies from sellers. sometimes no reply. much less often do i get push back. i guess this 
is some indication that most sellers want to do the right thing. but certain things nag at me some.











update announcements

2016 has arrived, and with it a fresh start. the primary focus at bookthink will be, as always, on buying and selling books, and several projects now in the planning stages will help the cause. 
look for announcements soon. 









 









low-cost, sturdy shelving for booksellers

some of you may recall that, in a former lifetime, i designed and built furniture. for one reason or another, i probably built more shelving - or bookcases - than anything else. after you've 
built your first 100 or so bookcases, you get a feel for what works and what doesn't; after 1,000, you don't even have to think about it anymore. you just know, usually at a glance, even 
if you're looking at something you didn't build yourself.











from the editor

2016 is almost upon us, and how are things looking for you? are holiday sales brisk? as bookthink 
moves into its 13th year i can safely report that bookselling is a different game than it was in 2003, but 
it's a game that can still be won. a few observations in today's feature article.









 









looking ahead to 2016 bookselling

several months ago i purchased a turntable for my son's birthday. you can connect it to most anything - computer speakers, tv, whatever. toss a record on it, and you're ready to go. 
no expensive components to purchase, and at about $100, not a budget buster. the thing is, though he grew up in a different time, he likes how vinyl sounds, and so do i. so do many of 
us. but i never anticipated i'd be buying a turntable for any purpose in 2015. 











special announcements

feedback for the november 22 bookthinker - "critical mass bookselling" - was, let's say, above average, and it pointed to some things 
i probably should have clarified the first time through. thus a second look in today's feature article.









 









a second, deeper look at critical mass bookselling

as these things go, response to the november 22 bookthinker was fairly brisk. when i was writing it - specifically, the article on "critical mass" bookselling - 
a small voice said, "maybe you shouldn't use yearbooks as an example without elaborating on it." based on some of the feedback i received, it appears as though that 
voice was right.  











special announcements

there are many viable approaches to bookselling, and any one bookseller may not settle on one but take on two or more. i know i do. but one approach that doesn't seem to come 
up for discussion much is what i call critical mass bookselling - the topic of today's feature article. 









 









critical mass bookselling: in it for the long run

other than buying low and selling high, what, if any, is your strategy for purchasing inventory? one possible approach - and a successful one for at least some booksellers - is to 
purchase books (as cheaply as possible) with the best amazon sales rankings. not so many years ago i knew several booksellers who did this, maintaining inventories of about a thousand books, 
and they did quite well, achieving turn rates of one quarter to one third monthly. when is the last time you sold one third of your inventory in one month? to be sure, this is 
short-tail selling on steroids. but wouldn't it be nice to keep your inventory at this level and still make good money? what a time saver it would be! or would it?











update announcements

in the process of searching a digitized text, how many times have you received a "no results" reply, even in situations where you know darn well the information you're 
looking for is in it somewhere? i have, more times than i can count, and it often occurs in situations where there is no alternative source for the information - or at least 
one that's remotely convenient. if you haven't already noticed, a significant percentage of digitized texts are comprised of poor scans - and are either unusable or nearly so. if you're researching a potentially valuable 
book in an online bibliography, for example, this can be frustrating because you want very much to maximize its outcome. fortunately, there is hope, and today's feature 
article explains why.     









 









are you searching digitized texts and coming up empty-handed?

say what you will about the effect the so-called digital revolution has had on the print book marketplace, i for one have found myself accessing digitized books and other 
publications often of late - for research, mainly - and am thankful that i can. though far from complete, at least some of the reference materials that booksellers once had to 
darken doors of libraries to access (or spend big money to acquire) are now freely available in various digitized formats at the hathi trust digital library, the internet archive, 
etc., not to mention numerous institutions. better yet, unlike print content, these publications are readily searchable. or are they?

bookthink's proverbs of bookselling revisited: the fifth five

john carter, of abc for book collectors notoriety, defines a reader's (or reading) copy as follows: "a usually apologetic but occasionally slightly defiant term meaning that the 
book is not in collector's condition. a reading copy will probably look worse than a second-hand copy but better than a working copy." in turn, he defines a working copy as "the humblest

cataloging dates: a primer

it's funny how often learning a trade involves unlearning. one of the first things i "learned" as a bookseller was that grosset & dunlap was a reprint house, and i labored under this 
half-truth for perhaps a year or so before i unlearned it. of course, grosset & dunlap has issued countless reprints over the years, but, as booksellers, if we don't familiarize ourselves 
with the many first editions they published as well, we're likely to miss some important opportunities.

100 reasons your book won't sell: and somebody else's copy will

before in one form or another: the quickest way to learn how to sell books is to buy books. i'm going to take my bookseller's hat off today and take you on a buying trip to show you what 
i mean from a buyer's point of view.

another group of five bookselling proverbs today, elaborated on. 









 









bookthink's proverbs of bookselling revisited: the fourth five 

when i first started selling books, i sold on ebay only. then amazon. then other venues. as i added venues, i enjoyed a bump in sales every time, 
and later, i began to sell books off-site, by other means (see #18), and experienced more bumps. but multiplying footprints isn't the entire story. if 
you look back over the past twenty or so years, it's clear that ...











from the editor

when is the last time you heard another bookseller complain about not having enough books to list? when is the last time you complained about it? never? if anything, 
the story is more likely to be, "i have all of these darn books i haven't listed yet, and i keep buying more." and, so often, the spouse is complaining that books are taking 
over the house. if this sounds familiar to you, and especially if you're experiencing a downturn, it might be a good time to look at some reasons for not listing a book 
at all. there are many, and it can pay to heed them. today's feature article discusses five of the most common.









 








five reasons to think twice about listing a book

i have a question to pose: if you knew that the last book you listed will never sell in your lifetime, how would you feel? i concede that the process of listing some books 
can be an educational experience in itself, and if this is the case, okay, time well spent. but how often is it? a more specific question: if you knew that only five or ten 
of the last hundred books you listed would sell in your lifetime, how would you feel? i don't know about you, but i'd be thinking long and hard about the criteria i was 
using for listing books, not to mention buying them. time is too precious not to. 











special announcements

for me, sales are usually somewhat quieter over the summer, and so it naturally becomes a time to do things that have been put off some. like re-pricing. 
i'm not a bookseller who re-prices much. once a year at most, and even then it goes pretty quickly because not too much needs to be adjusted. almost from the 
beginning i've attempted to acquire inventory that doesn't need to be re-priced, though sometimes doing this is easier said than done. often this means 
listing books that are uncommon, much sought after or are special in some other way - signed books, for example. if you're re-pricing a lot, 
have you considered why?

ultimately, if you don't learn how to do at least some basic book repairs, you'll be leaving a lot of money on the table. and this is the purpose of bookthink's bookselling hack series - 
to show you how to accomplish them as competently and efficiently as possible. today's hack - #3 in the series - demonstrates how to repair stapled booklets that are falling apart.









 









bookthink's bookselling hack #3: replacing booklet staples

replacing a booklet's staples might seem like a repair that anybody with half a brain could accomplish without referring to a tutorial, 
but if the staples have rusted and eroded the paper they're stapled to, the approach isn't as straightforward.

so, how has bookselling been going for you lately? for many years i've made a point of reading and sometimes posting on bookselling forums to help me stay in touch 
with what's happening in the trade. also, via bookthink, i hear from many of you. it seems that things are somewhat more difficult for some of you now, but still - still - 
there are those of you who are doing just fine. there are reasons for this. this is why bookthink is still here.









 









bookthink's proverbs of bookselling revisited: the second five

okay, so, whomever gets to the book first gets the book, assuming it's priced right. if it's an estate or fol sale, get there at five or so

bookselling hack #2 is up today, and the topic is spine roll. this is usually a straightforward fix, but the issue of binding tightness does come into play. 









 









bookthink's bookselling hack #2

spine roll, or spine cocking, is seen more often in softcover books than hardcover - and perhaps most often in comic books. for collectors it's a moderately serious fault. 
to give you a feel for how serious, a rolled spine automatically reduces the comic book standard cgc grade, assuming no other issues, from 10.0 (mint) to 4.0 (very good).

certainly bookselling is much about acquiring knowledge. the more you know, the better, right? right. but there are intangibles too, and today's feature article takes a look at some of them.









 









bookthink's proverbs of bookselling revisited

have you ever noticed how some booksellers seem to succeed almost effortlessly and others have to grind it out - and usually come up short? as much as i emphasize the need to acquire knowledge here - 
and this is crucial - it's important, i think, to acknowledge that there's more to it than this. there's wisdom as well. wisdom isn't what you know; it's what you are.

the word "hack," which has numerous, often pejorative meanings, has taken on a somewhat more hip meaning recently: a quick, often clever solution to a 
problem, as in, say, a hard-boiled egg hack, which might show one how to peel one without stripping half of the darn thing away with the shell. there are certainly 
no shortage youtube tutorials that demonstrate solutions for just this, perhaps my favorite being the so-called ninja method. well, booksellers have problems like 
anybody else, so i thought it might be useful, occasionally, to offer some bookselling hacks in the bookthinker. today's hack demonstrates a somewhat quirky 
but effective approach to repairing a softcover book whose cover is, let's say, mangled.  









 









bookthink's bookselling hack #1

one of the first big buys i made years ago was a library belonging to a professor of spanish literature. no surprise, there were many spanish language books, 
and many of these were decades-old trade softcovers published in spain and various latin american countries in central and south america. most of the text blocks 
were sewn, so they were pretty sound overall, but many of the covers were in various stages of disrepair.

we've been publishing the bookthinker now for some 11 years. in cyber-time, this seems like an eternity. so much has changed since 2003. 
but not everything has, and in antiquarian bookselling, given that it's a centuries old trade that's more about selling older things than newer, 
it's no surprise that most of the changes we've seen in recent years have been associated with what we sell, not how we sell it. 









 









booksellers and book fairs

like hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other booksellers, i work out of my home, toiling in relative obscurity. while it's nice to work from home - 
i can work around my kids' schedules and other family demands - it can sometimes feel as if i'm working in a vacuum. i don't get to meet my customers and find 
out more about their book interests. i don't often get the opportunity to develop relationships with other booksellers, something that is crucial for success 
in the antiquarian book trade. 









 









the 12th annual houston book fair

on saturday, november 8th, i participated in the 12th annual houston book fair. it was my first fair. set up was friday. at cabs they told us that no matter how many book 
fairs we do, we will always be anxious about at least two things: (1) low or no sales;(2) fellow dealers will think my stock stinks. to assist in ameliorating those fears the 
faculty gave us a detailed list of what we would need to set up and strongly encouraged us to prepare a mock set up at home for our very first show. i over prepared and

as it is with authors, we booksellers have to start somewhere, and overnight success rarely happens. years of apprenticeship is the more likely path, as is 
selling lower-dollar material at the outset. however, even if you aren't ready to buy and sell the bigger stuff yet, there are some maybe-not-so-obvious things 
you can do on the edges of the higher-dollar marketplace than can accelerate your progress. this is the topic of today's feature article.... 









 









hidden profits in public places

everybody has to start somewhere, and typically, with the inevitable exceptions, those few who become famous for what they do don't do so overnight. years of

it seems to me, at times, that just about any bookselling question could legitimately be answered, "it depends." 
it isn't just that there are so many exceptions to rules - though are there ever - it's also that it depends on who

victorian decorated trade bindings1830-1880

in the recently published 
chapter 6 of bookthink's guide to online bookselling, i suggested that inexperienced booksellers study catalogs of mid- and upper-tier auction houses to accelerate the process of learning how to describe books. the better catalogs are accompanied by clear, color illustrations, and by referring back and forth between these illustrations and their textual descriptions, one can start to learn not only how to describe a book's condition but also its important physical elements - each with terminology that will suggest that you know something about books. and the latter is important because it establishes trust between you and potential buyers and, more importantly, allows you to ask for and achieve good prices. in turn, if you can achieve good prices, you can compete more favorably in the marketplace for inventory - pay better prices for it, that is. and so it goes until you wake up one day and realize that you've figured out how to make money at this!

i am a bibliophile: i love books. most of you - i think i know bookthink's audience pretty well by now - also love books. we share this gladly. as bibliophiles, we are concerned about the survival of the printed book, not only because its departure, immediate or by attrition, will negatively impact our chosen profession of bookselling, but also because printed books enrich our lives broadly and profoundly in a manner that google results can never.

but it isn't always easy to articulate why. the digital revolution has inspired much conversation about this, but most of it has been and remains focused 
on the interaction with books as physical objects - the feel of them in our hands, their aesthetic beauty as objets d'arte on a shelf, or perhaps the quiet, deeply receptive experience of reading text illuminated by reflected light, an experience that cannot possibly be replicated by the direct-lit assault from a blaring, pulsating computer monitor or e-reader (though kindles have taken a first step to mitigate this).

built-in trust
the amazon fba program
is it time to make the move?


yes, i'm late to the party. fulfillment by amazon has been available to sellers for several years now, and i just got on board late last year. the fba concept is simple: 3p sellers bulk ship their books or other items to one of amazon's warehouses, and when something sells, amazon packs and ships it. couldn't be easier. what this does is expose your inventory to market segments you previously had no (or indirect) access to - namely, customers who use amazon prime, super saver shipping, not to mention gift wrapping. it also enhances your position in search, and most important of all, provides built-in trust. customers who otherwise might be reluctant to purchase items from 3p sellers are not at all reluctant to pull the trigger under the amazon umbrella. fees are somewhat higher and apply to both sales and monthly storage, but in my limited experience these are more than offset by increasing my prices, which i can get away with because of the above competitive advantages. also, i realize significant savings on shipping by taking advantage of ups deeply-discounted rates to bulk ship to amazon warehouses.

pretty little things
an interview with jilliane hoffman



in this fast-moving novel jilliane hoffman paints a frighteningly real picture of the vast playground the internet provides for sexual predators and the vulnerable teens and children they target. thirteen year old lainey emerson has gone missing, and fdle special agent bobby dees is on the case. head of the department's crimes against children squad in miami for more than a decade, dees is haunted by the unsolved disappearance of his own daughter throughout the investigation, leading him alternately through a maze of hope and despair. it's a high-pitched suspense, skillfully written in a totally engrossing (but not gross) style of this difficult subject matter that will have you riveted to the pages of this book from start to finish.
