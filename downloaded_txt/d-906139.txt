tifa lockhart - final fantasy 7 brainstorm challenge 15










barret was a lot of fun, i had to do tifa. it was a personal hurdle for me, especially dealing with female characters but i'm pretty happy with the outcome! unfortunately, the brainstorm challenge on fb has already ended. if time permits, i might do more, but real work comes first though!

barret wallace - final fantasy 7 brainstorm challenge 15









a little something for the brainstorm group on facebook. i usually refrain from such things, simply because the amount of talent in there is just crazy, but i had this simple idea that i felt like attempting. final fantasy 7 will always be a landmark moment in my gaming youth, so i was even more compelled. and since i love chunky characters, barret was naturally the first choice!

tree studies




























some studies of trees and plants. i don't usually draw them, but they're essential especially in painting environments.
