1992 f250 
    super cab 3/4 
    ton 4x4.  it is 100% rustfree from california.  this is a very 
    clean, straight, and original extended cab.  it has a nice 
    proud stance, with only 146k 
        miles.  the paint is still original and the body hardly has ding in 
    it.  even the bed is clean inside.  it has had a factory ford bed 
    liner since new.  this is a one owner truck has been well cared 
    for, and not used as a work truck.
this is 
    basic truck with just the right options.  it features a strong fuel 
    injected 5.8l, nice shifting overdrive automatic, a/c, tilt, cruise, class 
    iii receiver hitch, dual tanks etc.  it also has a nice sounding 
    factory am/fm/cassette stereo.  it has the preferred manual 
    transfercase with the automatic front locking hubs.  you don't have to 
    get out and get all wet or muddy when you need 4x4. 

the 
        interior is also very clean, in every regard.

mechanically 
        this truck need nothing.  

the exhaust is sound, the brakes stop nice, and the 
        suspension is tight.  it has brand new 255/75/16's load range e 
        heavy duty all terrain tires on nice aluminum 
        wheels.  we also installed a new front tank fuel pump module, and 
        radiator with new thermostat.

the lcd display 
        for the odometer is discolored, and illegible, but the old oil change 
        sticker, and carfax verify the miles to be in the 140k range.

clean low mile f250 
        super cabs are real tough to find.  they don't get much nicer than 
        this.
this is a no excuses hop in and 
    drive heavy duty 4x4.

    survivor 4x4 dodge.  

it runs and drives 
    excellent.  the 4x4 system works as it should.  i included a 
    picture of the dic showing the 4x4 engaged.  it has 98k on the 
    odometer, but it doesn't seem to be working.  the speedometer is 
    glitchy, but seems petty accurate at 60 mph.   overall, this is an 
    awesome survivor.  drive it as is, or put in your cummins drivetrain 
    out your rusty dodge.  i don't find many of these w250 dodges.
