why & what this means

advances in programming and development may mean that maintaining older software becomes cost prohibitive. 
it may not be an effective use of development and technical support resources to commit time to older software with low customer utilization. 
newer products may supersede older ones, including bug fixes and enhanced functionality. 


note: end of life (eol) does not mean that the application will no longer function - you may continue to run the application using any web host.
