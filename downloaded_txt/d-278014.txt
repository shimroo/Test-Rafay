we do something radical — we listen 











when you come to atkinson & kelsey, the first thing we want to hear is your story. we are not practitioners of one-size-fits-all law. all our services are custom-tailored to the client’s stated goals and preferences.once we understand your goals, we fashion the legal strategy that has the greatest chance of success. the emotions surrounding divorce — anxiety, fear, anger, loss — can have a distorting effect on your case. our approach, therefore, is to conduct ourselves calmly, objectively and professionally, but forcefully, focusing on your objectives. we keep our eyes on the long term, on the new life that is awaiting you.some firms believe in turning up the volume, but shouting doesn’t win cases. atkinson & kelsey achieves success for clients through logic, experience and knowledge of the law. our lawyers are especially respected for their analytical prowess in the areas of complex divorce litigation, custody disputes and high-value asset identification and division.in addition to divorce-related services, we assist with family law issues such as grandparents’ rights, responding in cases of domestic violence, estate disputes and estate planning. we also help couples to plan ahead with prenuptial and postnuptial agreements.
