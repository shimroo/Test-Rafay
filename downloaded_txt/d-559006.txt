blues music education
blues is an american art form, and part of what we do at stlblues is share blues music in a variety of ways. from reaching countries like chile & nigeria through 'america's corners', to our festival & instrument workshops,   lectures and performances! blues in the schools (bits) is one of our favorite events, as it holds our record attendance -- 1,800 kids on one day! 

blues education crosses the disciplines of history, geography, social studies, and of course, music. who knows...beyond creating the next generation of blues music fans & helping to keep the blues alive, we may even spark the next etta james or b.b. king! 

                                            no matter what your event, contact us today at stlouisblues@swbell.net to add some blues power!
                                            we work with the finest performers and educators in st. louis, and across the nation. 

'the blues highway', featuring st. louis blues - and the fab foehners





“st. louis public schools music classrooms look forward to the full-scale launching of the blues in  the schools program.  the early pilot was immensely successful in both elementary and middle schools, engaging hard to reach students to participate and question the presenters, who responded with “real world” examples.   the national blues museum’s effort to energize education about blues and blues artist’s for the next generation is dynamic and thought-provoking.  we look forward to being able to expose more students to a rich musical heritage that is a uniquely american creation.”


“the blues in the schools program conducted by dave beardsley was a 'train the trainer' workshop for our southern core conference. dave encompassed several disciplines in his presentation, from history to geography, and used blues music to take the viewer on a timeline from the late 1800's up to today. educational and entertaining!"
