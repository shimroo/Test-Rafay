eagle scout
information        
      


 
the purpose of this web site is to
provide information to life
scouts as they prepare to become eagle scouts, to their parents, and to
their scout
leaders.  the eagle rank is a very significant accomplishment
for any
scout, which can only be achieved through commitment and hard
work.  as
with most difficult endeavors, knowing what is expected, and the
necessary steps
of the process, makes the journey go more smoothly.  the
purpose of this web site
is to pull together as much information as possible to help you through
that
process.
the information on this web site is
from a variety of sources,
including official boy scouts of america publications and many other
sources.  the information presented is not necessarily the
official
position of the boy scouts of america or any subdivision of the bsa. 
the forms and paperwork handling
instructions on this web site are specific to chester county
council.  if you are from any other council, you are welcome
to use any information here but you should check with your local
council on what forms and procedures you should use.

this web site is the result of the
accumulation of information
and experience from 33 years as district and council advancement
chairman and the
process of
shepherding over 1200 scouts through the life to eagle
process.  it also
includes input and ideas from many scouts and scouters who have been
involved in
the process.  it is my firm belief that virtually any scout is
capable of
earning the eagle scout rank if they are willing to make the decision
that
the goal
is important enough to them to make it a high enough priority to do
what
needs to
be done.  at the same time, it is not a goal that can be
forced on a scout by
parents or scout leaders if the scout is not willing to make the
commitment.  
if you have made the decision that
you want to become an eagle
scout, congratulations and good luck.  the best advice i can
give you is
that you diligently gather as much information as possible about what
you are
about, and follow the advice given carefully.  that is the
purpose of this
web site.  not only is there detailed information about how to
approach
each step in the process, but there are links to many other references
for
information about how to plan and carry out projects.  in
addition, use
your library, scoutmaster, troop eagle advisor and/or eagle project
coach, fellow scouts, and other
resources.
you are setting off on one of the
greatest adventures of your
life.  remember to always do your best in everything you
do.  you will
get only as much out of life as you put into it.
