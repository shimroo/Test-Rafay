excellent class. sensei dave was very detailed in his instruction. his students and instructors follow his steps. it’s a like a family with everyone coming together to learn, train, and have fun. i enjoyed the demos with learning to control yourself in a situation but also allows for techniques to be practiced and learned more effectively. definitely will be back.

our son applied his teachings this week to defend himself. sensei dave's teachings are clear; walk away, tell them to stop, if they touch you - apply what you know and our son did. the student got a 2 day suspension.all the great sensei's at the studio have helped our son, dania develop his self confidence and assert himself in defending himself. the fact that dania didn't think twice because it was a girl, is a big accomplishment for him. we are very proud of him. thank you to all the wonderful senseis!

i've trained with dave for the better part of 25 years. i've watch both young and old people gain self confidence, maturity and an education in "street fighting". you cannot put a price on any of those attributes. thank you dave for your dedication no only to the "art" but to the spreading of your knowledge to so many people who need it.


tim 





a great place to learn self defense!


ronald 





wish i could give more than 5 stars. i trained there for a long time and not once did i regret going. it is a very safe place and the teachers genuinely care about those they are teaching. everyone is super kind and are some of the greatest people i know. hope i can go back one day very soon.
