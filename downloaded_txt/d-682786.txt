- student '17
one of my favorite things about rippowam cisqua, is the caring nature of both the students and teachers. we are a strong community and we look after each other, care for each other, and help each other.




- student '19
education at rippowam is a team sport. my peers are as excited as i am when i achieve my goals and remind me not to worry if i don't. i have 360-degree support.











- parent '24
the search for the right school for our daughter ended the moment we stepped foot into rippowam cisqua. it is a place where our daughter has grown and so have we. and, it is a place where every staff member makes you feel like your child is their favorite. i could not imagine this incredible journey anywhere else.




- parent ’18
from a child's first moments at rcs, there is a profound bond with the teachers. this is a place where the relationship between faculty and students sits at the very heart of the learning process. these talented and nurturing professionals help rcs students to not only achieve academic excellence but also to become confident, well-rounded individuals with a true love for learning.




- parent ’22, ’24, ’26
the school's devoted faculty provide each of our children with exactly what that child needs. we feel beyond blessed to give our children an education where their current selves are the utmost priority, and not the, albeit unparalleled, result.











- parent '16, '17
rcs students stand out in any crowd; they are the ones who are confident enough to stand in front of a room and fearlessly address groups whether they are peers or adults.




- parent '18, '21
the teachers at rippowam cisqua have worked miracles for our children. our girls have learned to self-advocate, to persist, to trust themselves, to feel confident. the faculty cares deeply about each child, and it shows. as a parent, i feel like i am in partnership with the wonderful teachers here in the business of raising successful, happy, well-adjusted kids.




- parent '18, '21
the physical education, art, music and other special programs at rcs have given our kids such wonderful exposure to new experiences and ideas. from sports they've never tried before to artists and mediums they're being made aware of for the first time, each "special" has expanded their view of the world and of themselves.
