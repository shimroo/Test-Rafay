st. thomas weddings / romance
did 
					you know that... many couples are opting to save the 
					money (not to mention the stress and hard work) of a big 
					wedding at home by escaping to a caribbean island for a 
					combination wedding/honeymoon. upon their return, they can 
					share the event by showing the video and photographs at an 
					informal reception.
					all the islands are beautiful and, on some, weddings have 
					become a major promotional tool. so why should you choose 
					st. thomas above others?
