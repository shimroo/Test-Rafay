what parents are saying about us




i love children's lighthouse because they meet the needs of my family.  the staff are great, the building is clean and safe, and they have a fabulous educational program.  their curriculum encourages exploration, good communication skills and engages in fun-filled learning activities from the time they are an infant.

my husband and i visited several child care centers to and none of them compared to children's lighthouse! you get what you pay for here because not only is the facility great, but the staff is wonderful too!! we highly recommend children's lighthouse to anyone!

i worked as a professional nanny for 10 years and as a result i am very particular about the childcare i choose for my daughter.  this school has surpassed my expectations.  the teachers work with each child so patiently and make them feel cared for as if they were their own.
rebecca idallas, tx 

this is the first time my children have attended a childcare learning school, and they love it.  they get excited when time comes to go to sleep, so that they will get to go to school the next morning again.  they love their teachers, food, games and most of all the learning times.
