asp.net mvc antiforgerytoken





i recently came across a new security feature that microsoft has added to the asp.net mvc futures framework to assist in preventing cross-site request forgery (csrf) attacks.  i was going to write about it, but i did a quick google search and found a great blog post that gives the appropriate background information, as well as a demonstration of how to prevent csrf attacks by using the asp.net mvc framework.  if you're an asp.net developer interested in developing secure web applications, be sure to check out the post: http://blog.codeville.net/category/security/
