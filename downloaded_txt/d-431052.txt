what matters to us most

we take the utmost pride in blending our teas to your satisfaction. murchie's tradition of excellence is a longstanding promise of quality and care - a promise which has kept us in business for over a century, and a promise on which customers can rely.
                  
                  in today's world, the art of blending tea and roasting coffee may be a humble act, but we consider it a prestiguous honour to create timeless blends to enjoy with friends and family.
                  






canadian-made quality

murchie's is proudly a canadian brand since our founding in 1894. we are canada's oldest tea company, and british columbia is our home. we cherish the communities alongside which we've grown, and the beautiful country that supports us.
                    
                    our products represent who we are: sincerity, quality and care are woven into each batch. while tea leaves & coffee beans are imported, we blend them for our neighbours and friends around the world, so we give each of our products the attention they deserve.
                  






130 years of tea blending

from the age of sails and horse-drawn carriages to the digital era, much has changed - but our heritage remains.
                    
                    our expertise in the art of tea blending is a murchie's tradition, passed down for generations. while historians have diligently recorded the history of tea, our role is best learned through experience and taste, thus the oral traditions of our founders are carried forward.
                    
                    throughout the years, this renown and experience has given us the honour of blending for several landmarks of canadian culture as well as british royalty. our books hold hundreds of family blends - each a custom creation to the exact preferences of our valued customers.
                  






rigorous quality testing

our products are tested and retested many times before they ever reach you. these detailed checks allow us to deliver a consistent experience. 
                    
                    in both cases of tea and coffee, we perform at least three thorough quality inspections and several tastings before blending or roasting. once made, every product is tested against its previous batch history and catalogued for future testing to ensure its flavour keeps consistent throughout its shelf life.
                    
                    why so many tests? natural changes in tea leaves and coffee beans can occur from year-to-year. drought, rainfall and harvest time all have effects on the harvest, so it is important to consider each ingredient uniquely rather than broadly by name.
