 welcome to harlem dowling-west side center for children & family services


as a not-for-profit child welfare agency, harlem dowling-west side center for children & family services works to develop confidence, resilience, academic skills, and adult/family support that enables the children we serve to become responsible, self-sufficient adults. founded in 1836 as the colored orphan's asylum, the organization provides family preservation, family support services for children with development disabilities, after school programming, evidence-informed interventions, groups, and emergency food pantry services to individuals residing in the new york city area.

we keep families together by offering an array of services to meet their needs.  our programs are strength-based and family-centered with 98% of the children remaining safely at home with their families in a nurturing environment.  we provide after school services to more than 500 children daily while our emergency food pantry provides food packages to more than 5,000 new yorkers each year.

families helped since 1836
















harlem dowling has been more than a financial resource. their concerns and the eventual financial assistance received, greatly relieved me of my stress, improved my emotional and psychological well-being. their assistance has brought back tremendous balance into our lives in that we are able to walk with our heads high and maintain a sense of dignity. our lives have been made normal again through their undivided attention and assistance. my faith in the organization is profound. i am elated to share my family's story so that any other family seeking help, can, without reservation, trust and seek them out for support.

new york, ny














this is my family.  we have been through long, difficult months.  we were broken by bad decisions, no communication, frequent arguments, and alcohol use.  kemraj was not spending time with the children â there were a lot of tears and frustration.  looking back, because of the services we received, we have much to be thankful for.  the agency helped my husband and now he no longer drinks and we have lots of family time.  we learned how to have a healthy relationship by talking to each other, respecting opinions, and most importantly, listening to the other person.  i also learned to trust my family to support us when we are struggling.  i am truly happy that harlem dowling helped my family stay together.  the most important thing is the love we have for each other.
