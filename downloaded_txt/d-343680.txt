the important points of the bible are in this review 
everyone should learn something about the bible, regardless of his religious preferences. the bible presents a historical religion and is very difficult to read and understand. for these reasons, the biblenotes were written as a compilation of important points from the viewpoint of a scientist/engineer/researcher. there has been no attempt to discuss or debate these points, merely to present them in summarized fashion.

      biblenotes was published on the web march 12,1997. the summaries took one year to complete. millions of readers have used this site for information, education and review. 

    biblenotes has been awarded a five star rating in 2000 by schoolzone's panel of over 400 expert teachers. the hot site for the day was awarded to biblenotes on june 16,1999 by usa today.
