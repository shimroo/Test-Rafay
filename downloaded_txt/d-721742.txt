improve your life! improve your relationships
life is difficult and there is help along the way. john r. fishbein, ph.d. provides solution-oriented counseling that empowers clients to live fuller, healthier, and happier lives.  he utilizes cognitive behavior therapy (cbt) and other cutting-edge modalities to provide effective, cooperative, and compassionate counseling.  since 1975, originating in san jose, ca, he has assisted individuals, couples, and families locally, nationally, and internationally.  whether you are looking for someone to assist in getting relief from debilitating and distracting feelings of anxiety, anger, fear, or depression or for help reconnecting in better ways to those you love, dr. fishbein's experience, expertise, and passion to find solutions can give you an effective way forward.
john is the author of "emotional first aid: a practical approach to common concerns," and knows how to help clients transform their lives with collaborative counseling (he and the client working together to accomplish the client's goals, rather than either one doing most of the work).
one of the helpful things we have learned this year (2020-2021) from the covid pandemic is that many professional services are effectively provided online without having to meet in a physical office. for the past year and a half, dr. fishbein has successfully met with the majority of his clients on video platforms such as zoom, facetime, and google hangouts. not only is this a lot more convenient for most people, but it is also just as effective. even people living near an actual office are taking advantage of meeting online.



options suited to your life 
you deserve therapy and couples’ counseling that works with your schedule. that’s why dr. fishbein offers telephone, video, and in-office sessions. choose the one that’s most comfortable and convenient and get the help you need in the way that feels right. no matter which one you choose, you’ll have the full attention and support of a highly experienced professional.
trained in cognitive behavior therapy and other modalities, dr. fishbein is the author of “emotional first aid: a practical approach to common concerns,” and knows how to help transform lives with collaborative counseling. get in touch with him today and experience the difference the right help can make in your life. he proudly serves clients in los gatos, saratoga, los altos, san jose, campbell, sunnyvale, mountain view, palo alto, fremont, and nationwide.
