fukushima radiation 
alert 

not necessarily the end of the world, as in our planet earth 
exploding, but the end of our world as we have known it and could live in with a 
relative amount of certainty that life would go on in a reasonable manner. 
life as we knew it before fukushima will never be the same; those who survive 
this era for an extended period of time and on to the next generations will have 
a heavy heart to carry.

angels 
don't play this haarp: advances in tesla technology
by dr. nick begich and jeane manning,  1995
 
introduction and scenario of the haarp the u.s. government is playing
by dr. colette dowell, n.d., 1995
 
i loved to watch the old black and white twilight zone on tv when i was a kid. 
the situations that were dramatized were far beyond my capabilities in the 
dreamtimes state. i remember the one episode where only one man was left alive 
after the big nuke and he found himself sitting alone on the footsteps in front 
of a library. the only problem was his glasses broke and he was left with 
nothing; wow - that impressed me.

 

 



the stone balls in zavidovici, bosnia



  in 
1932, there was a terrific storm and earth shattering rain and flood. the 
grandfather heard a very loud crashing noise. after the storm had passed, he 
went out to his creek to find it washed away. the bank was now eroded and had 
fallen to a great depth; it was at this time the balls of stone were exposed.


       
the 
stones were charcoal gray in color, some lighter, some darker, they had the feel 
and texture of slate some what. there were broken pieces (large and small) of 
stone everywhere consistent with the same quality of earthen material the 
balls were created from. you could see circular chips on the creek side. if 
you took a part of a broken round stone and hit it with anther rock, it split 
off like an onion layer.

a 
simple ancient egyptian timeline 


due to the many articles 
published about egypt, i thought i might place this here to give the readers a little understanding of how 
this great civilization developed through the millenniums. it keeps it simple 
and there are photographs to enhance your educational experience. 
 


for those 
of you who are interested in construction theories of the great pyramid  - 
2 theories; one theory is for an internal ramp, the other is for an external 
ramp - see below.
 


khufu 
	- cheops - cheope - kheops

great pyramid 



jean-pierre houdin - internal ramp theory 




with a large power point presentation modeling his theory
 




over eight years have now passed since jean-pierre houdin 
and his devoted wife bulle plexiglass (michelle) fused their lifes equity 
into a passionate architectural affair with the great pyramid, located on the 
giza plateau in egypt; a ramp theory - an internal one; enclosed; 
continually winding its way up to the apex of the great pyramid by means of 
turning 90 degrees corners; encasing workman hauling blocks of stones weighing 
tons; using rope, cranes, sleds, scaffolds and any other means by which a hefty 
stone could be maneuvered; builders hollaring and lots of sweat. the energy to 
create such an internal ramp can be measured and defined if calculated in 
detail; jean-pierre has detailed his architectural renderings and has come up 
with some staggering factors.

of construction of 



the pyramids of the




valley of 
gize /giza

eduardo rodríguez varona

on top of the pyramid of the sun

bosnia.....


"i looked for the bases of the pyramids, there were none, there 
were no defined ridges, the faces of the hills were not aligned with the 
cardinal points; at times depending on where you were standing, they were out 30 
degrees or more from straight alignment. there was no methodology of intelligent 
design applied to any layout of any structure or the pyramidal complex; only 
random points of excavated areas. there were no foundations of any kind, no 
concrete, no man-made blocks, no walls, joints or beams, corners, arches, 
geometry or constructed facets of any ancient structures."

nutritional cleansing  diet is the governing factor for introducing 
proper nutrition into your body. proper nutrition is essential for well being. 
assimilation of nutrients however, is not possible as long as the paths in which 
they follow are obstructed and blocked. it is within the small intestines that 
most of our nutritional substances are obtained. therefore, a proper cleansing 
program for both the large and small intestine is required.

confessions

of a radical traditionalist

  i 
am always pleased to read a book that brings me joy and educates me in some sort 
of fashion leaving me on a greater note of happiness, 

and more in tune 

one might say. 

for those who follow 
john 
michells writings 
as well as 
those of you who are new to him, "confessions of a radical traditionalist" is 
a witty anthology of johns great ability to ascertain truths and speak frankly 
about his observations.

    

    
joscelyn godwin 
brilliantly introduces johns character with candor conveying his innermost 
qualities of an ingenious soul. joscelyn carefully and thematically arranged 108 
of johns 
essays spanning a 10-year period of contributions to the oldie.

semir osmanagich 


a paper on the controversies surrounding the 
ancient inscriptions


 on the t1 and the t2


megaliths found in the ravne tunnel

 having originally claimed "the world's largest pyramid" was 
erected in visoko, bosnia, 12,000 years ago, semir osmanagich needed a propriety culture represented in 
the archaeological record suited for such a grandiose endeavor. when perplexed 
academics challenged semir to demonstrate such a race, 
conveniently and in salvation, conspicuous marks on massive stones suddenly 
appeared in a tunnel he was boring.




colette dowell

nadija nukic 


i present original photographic images, and point out inconsistencies that 
appear in the various reports written by, and comments made by, semir and muris 
osmanagich, as well as others. 

 the inconsistencies are 
outstanding and blatant 
 public 
notice



"articles seeking to discuss the questionable activities of semir osmanagich and 
his bosnian pyramid of the sun

foundation frequently meet with a 
torrent of 
 
cumber and curious retorts/denials 
from its members, associates and co-workers  
by means of, as some believe, wild tales of conjured fancy 
or with indiscriminate threats of legal action."

on january 17th, 1961, president 
eisenhower addressed the united states with his farewell speech; in closing he 
stated: 
 "we pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have 
		their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity 
		shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may 
		experience its spiritual blessings; that those who have freedom will 
		understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are 
		insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; that the scourges 
		of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the 
		earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live 
		together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect 
		and love."

bosnia --the ongoing hype
 


i went to visoko, bosnia in august, 2006, to 
investigate the excavation sites of the so-called pyramids. i found absolutely no evidence 
to support any claims made by semir osmanagic and his foundation, 
politicians & investors. flash forward to 2008 and still ---- 
despite official reports negating real pyramids in bosnia from specialized scientist's and international 
associations, the 'bosnian pyramid clan' continue their 

agenda trying to mislead the international public into believing there are real pyramids in bosnia by promoting them as real.
the foundation is marketing pyramids for commercial tourism & 
trade to boost bosnia's economy and control over certain political 
sectors. semir osmanagic repeats, "this tiny country bosnia....will 
gain respect." 
there has never been any 'real' evidence 
presented providing proof of authentic pyramids or of an ancient 'alien civilization' in bosnia that semir osmanagic and others claim there to 
be. bosnians want no more excavating (the proud and honest bosnians that is). 
help stop semir osmanagic from excavating the hills!
