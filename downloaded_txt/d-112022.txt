make sure your doctor is aware of any long-term or severe symptoms of adhd or depression you might be showing. you may ask your doctor to recommend medicine instead of other non-medication options.

there are telemedicine services like hello ahead, done first, adhd online etc. which can get your adhd or other mental health issues diagnosed online, and prescribe script accordingly. however, getting adderall prescribed might still be as difficult as offline diagnosis and these services usually prescribe strattera; its generic version, atomoxetine; guanfacine; and bupropion.

how are adderall prescriptions given by doctors?
to determine whether a patient is a good candidate for adderall, a doctor would first examine the patient. there are several reasons why adderall might be prescribed to people who are unable to concentrate.
in addition to treating adhd, some physicians may also prescribe adderall to treat depression, chronic fatigue and other associated conditions, such as anxiety and insomnia.
there are good chances that the doctor might also initially give some other medicine for your underlying health concerns. and if those meds don’t work, your doctor may prescribe you adderall.
even if a doctor does diagnose one with adhd, usually he will start prescriptions with non-stimulant adhd medications on first visit.
these non-stimulant adhd treatments, unlike adderall, are safer and less addictive. if the non-stimulant drugs don’t work, physicians may ultimately prescribe medications like ritalin and vyvanse that are less intense than adderall.
doctors may prescribe adderall if these secondary drugs fail or if your health concerns worsen over time. however, the procedure of getting adderall might take a while.
adderall may only be prescribed by a neurologist, psychiatrist, or primary care physician. make an appointment with a psychiatrist, since psychologists do not have the authority to prescribe medicine.
find a good psychiatrist near you and stick with him or her for the long haul.
how difficult is it to get adderall prescribed?
adderall is usually prescribed as the first medication only if it’s identified that patients are born with adhd.
if, on the other hand, it is determined that these symptoms have just recently developed, then other alternative drugs may be administered instead of adderall. so, if you want your doctor to prescribe adderall, you should let him know whether these symptoms have persisted for a long time and are frequent occurrences.
as a result, your doctor may recommend non-medication options before handing over a prescription and/or increasing the dosage gradually. another option is to explain to him that if other treatments don’t work, you’re open to stronger meds or on adderall & ritalin together.
however, some physicians and insurance companies may approve the prescription of adderall xr (addy 30) after a neuropsychiatric assessment (also called neuropsychological) for adhd, so keep that in mind. typically, these examinations might last for many hours and may need the use of computers.
obtaining a prescription through the internet
you may get an online prescription for adderall as well through telemedicine services. once an online appointment with psychiatrist has been scheduled, the doctor will send the prescription script to a local pharmacy. following that, the pharmacy will verify if adderall is covered by insurance before dispensing it.
since adderall is a controlled substance, the law states physicians must undertake an in-person assessment of patients before prescribing adderall. many physicians won’t want to write an online prescription for adderall because of this, and most will prefer an in-person meeting.
however, it was declared in march 2020 by the department of drug enforcement administration (dea) that “practitioners may issue prescriptions for all schedule ii-v restricted narcotics to patients who have not performed an in-person medical examination”. doctors can now prescribe controlled legal medications to patients who saw their virtual doctor through telemedicine/telepsychiatry /mental health video platforms.
 
make sure you’re familiar with the laws in the state where-ever you’re migrating, regardless if you need to use telemedicine for adderall prescription or not. check with a pharmacy in the state where you want to have your prescription filled to see if any restrictions change from state to state.
 
getting adderall without prescription- legal drugs similar to adderall
conventional adhd medications typically target the catecholamine brain chemicals most closely associated with attention: norepinephrine and dopamine. in theory, nootropics that support those same brain chemicals might help with attentional performance, as well as other executive functions that may be affected by adhd.
that’s why ordering over-the-counter legal adderall like mind lab pro and brain pill are getting so popular, and are a great way to receive the same adderall benefits without having a prescription.
 
tips/advice from real people on getting adderall prescribed
below are some tips & opinions on how to get adderall prescribed from real users, adhd patients, students etc. from around the internet forums, reddit etc.
be smart
if you’re smart, i suggest being direct with your primary care doctor. i have never been clinically determined to have add but i have encountered symptoms of it. it was constantly a struggle to sit down and do the homework. long story short, i’ve never consumed adderall, nevertheless i’ve been aware of it and was having thoughts. i visited my doctor, discussed add, told him my warning signs and that i don’t believe i need to be identified as having a condition like add i was just wondering if adderall would assist with motivation and studying habits. he concluded and quite simply told me that he has not got add either, but he has a prescription of adderall as well, that he uses it as needed, i.e. sleepless nights, extremely busy days, etc.
so he prescribed me a copious amount of 5mg ir tabs and had me try dosage to see what would work for me. came back about a month later and got prescribed 20mg ir twice a day. this might be easiest way to get prescribed adderall and if it doesn’t work you always have otc generic alternatives like mind lab pro and brain pill.
basically, my advice is be smart. if you begin taking it every day and observe that you are being required to up the dosage, stop using it for a week and restart the process. if you can’t cope with recreational drug use or performance enhancing meds just dont take them.
anyone thinking of faking adhd & tricking the doctor will have tough time
 
this is the dsm-iv criteria for diagnosing ad/hd on cdc website. 

some symptoms that cause impairment were present before age 7 years.
there must be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, school, or work functioning.

anyone thinking of faking these two conditions will have a tough time. so, in general, it is extremely difficult to get adderall prescribed without adhd and otc non-prescription alternatives like mind lab pro and brain pill would be better options.
begin by visiting a therapist or psychologist
 
begin by visiting a therapist or psychologist to talk about your issues. good therapists would be able to get you started with non-medical mechanisms that will help you stabilize. you need to commence with these techniques before starting medication to optimize the advantage from any drugs you may take.
in due course, you could possibly be referred to a psychiatrist. they’re physicians who can prescribe medication. that would be the person who would prescribe you adderall or ritalin or vyvanse should you need it, modify your dosage or modify your prescribed medication as required, and help you get the utmost benefit from it. vyvanse is much weaker than adderall and you’ll probably get it first.
some pcps are okay with prescribing something
if you haven’t been clinically determined to have something that calls for stimulant treatment, your odds of talking or tricking a doctor into giving you some simply to help you get by are really low. then again, if you believe you have chemical conditions that have an impact on focus/thought/task completion, you would probably gain from asking your doc to evaluate you. some pcps are okay with making the general assessment and prescribing something given you also consider therapy/psych evaluation.
make them believe that you need this drug to be normal
the typical adhd patient is actually quite different than the stereotypes. it is important to convince the psychiatrist that your daily routine is severely impacted by symptoms of adhd. challenges staying on top of tasks, failing to remember things, battling school/work/errands/chores. make them believe that you need this drug to be normal. also advise them you on a regular basis cannot focus while accomplishing things such as driving and are worried that you might get into an accident because of it.
where to buy adderall – is it legal?
getting adderall if you have a prescription either through an in-person visit or through telemedicine, is legal. buying adderall or ritalin online without prescription is of-course illegal and it’s best to try over-the-counter non stimulant generic adderall/ritalin substitutes we mentioned above.
no – you can’t simply go to amazon and buy adderall like you would with nutritional supplements.  but what you can do is arrange a virtual appointment with a company / practitioner who can diagnose and start treating you for adhd (if they believe you do struggle from it).
the nationwide public health emergency that was set in effect in the us has made telehealth more robust than ever before. so although you can’t really buy adderall online, it is possible to have the standard mechanisms for diagnostics, treatment, and receiving prescription medication (if applicable) – all online.  it’s still fully legal, fast, and makes sure that you’re taking these meds under adequate medical supervision and guidance.
adderall prescription without insurance
you can get adderall without insurance. without insurance, it typically costs around $280 for thirty tablets of 20mg brand name adderall out of pocket, while walgreens providing at much cheaper prices. the generic pills will cost around 70% less.
how to get diagnosed with adhd online?
instead of booking a scheduled visit with a psychiatrist at a standard clinic, several telehealth companies that support adhd treatment, like like hello ahead, done first, adhd online etc. enable affected individuals to connect with licensed doctors.
the process itself is very straightforward:

fill out a simple intake questionnaire of basic information (15 mins or so).
if the survey suggests adhd as a probable issue, then you’ll arrange a time to meet with a doctor (virtually) to confirm the diagnosis.
usually, 24-48 hours of sending the questionnaire, you’ll get a call informing you of next steps. but generally, you can expect your appointment to be 2-3 weeks out, because their services are in such high demand.
any medication will be sent to your door, and you can talk with your fully-licensed provider for checkups and to discuss dosage etc.

if you’re reading this wondering “will i just automatically be prescribed adderall?”, the answer is a big no! adderall is a controlled substance for a reason. what these telemedicine companies offer is really the only legal, reliable, streamlined way of diagnosing and treating your adhd online, and potentially getting a prescription like adderall or ritalin if deemed appropriate.
bottomline
many universities across the country have seen an increase in the illicit usage of adderall by students for both studying and partying, according to research.
adderall is also sold to non-prescribed college kids by their classmates to boost productivity during the most academically stressful parts of their semester.
as many as 9.4 percent of american children have been diagnosed with adhd at some time, according to a cdc poll in 2016.
it’s also possible that some kids who no longer require their adhd medication decide to give it out to other students in their class selling them for $5 a pill.
in other cases, kids may be more likely to take adderall over the counter or generic adderall xr/ritalin pills illegally than other medications since they can get it from a buddy.
adderall abuse may be linked to society’s increasing focus on higher education. to keep up with their friends on certain college campuses, some students may feel they need a little additional boost from study aids overnight.
many students who previously avoided college due to their inability to focus are now utilizing generic adderall or mail order adderall, amphetamines, phentermine & adipex otc as a means for performance enhancement.
some students, however, believe that buying the medication illegally is not a huge concern because of the substance’s limited side effects, unless taken in huge doses like 120mg or 200 mg of adderall in 24 hours which can land a person in er with high blood pressure, heart attack or stroke.
it’s not difficult to locate adderall or ritalin pills in college campuses or black market and the institutions usually have no power to restrict students from selling or using the substance illegally.
