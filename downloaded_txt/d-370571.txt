hi. we're skylab.org. what a nice experience to see you.
we're an old internet cooperative providing shared services.
what's here?








our services
skylab.org community-driven internet co-operative








email & multi-user shell access
lots of users want an easy to remember email address and friendly webmail. some others want a command-line bit of fun. unix and derivative systems were meant for multi-user access. come hang out and interact on a system with other users, the classic way! 






personal web hosting & development tools
we used to host a bunch of personal and random websites. we've scaled back a bit, but hey, let us know if you need your stuff easily hosted. we're also loaded with fairly well updated dev environments and tools. we're experimenters too. and we like jokes.






ongoing conversation outside of social media's watchful eye
we share ideas about plenty of technical, personal, and dumb but casual thoughts in our community chat. come join us in #skylab on libera.chat









users & groups
local users and affiliated hosted groups on our system.

about
so there's a history behind our little internet co-operative...











1997-2001
magic.hurrah.com



				    in 1997, four portland, oregon based tech-enthusiast friends (chris, james, ryan & michael) fresh out of a technology magnet school got together and pooled their resources together and purchased a tiny 486 computer running linux, starting out with 16mb of ram and 170mb of disk space. it kept growing with friendly users, moved between internet-connected dorm rooms, employer server rooms and hosting sites. internet services at the time were expensive, so a co-operative made sense to provide low-cost services to the young userbase. user count: about 100.
				    









2001-2009
growing up, scaling up


some of the original cohort graduated or moved away, but as the internet became more popular, interest in our services (mail, web hosting, online community) and low-cost pricing kept us cash-neutral and successful.   mahlon and ged did great work on architecting/sysadmin when we needed them and zetan and chuff were often called upon before we invested in official remote hands and hardware control.  user count: about 200.









2010-2016
the "free" cloud vs. hardcore users



				    by the time the early 2010's rolled around, a new breed of cloud hosting platforms existed with a free tier for experimenters and test-users. userbase in both americas, europe, africa and asia made life fun and interesting for a little while.  however, overall usage decreased, zombie accounts got retired. backing up personal user data became less important when everyone already had services and data in the global commercial cloud. having a physical computer to host data stored elsewhere did not justify the cost for the remaining hardcore users still using the system.  so, a big cleanup happened, and we moved house again. user count: about 50.
				    









august 2017 - present
the essence of the community.



				    we're grown up but still love fun. running freebsd, was formerly a part of the tilde.club community network, and cautiously welcoming new users still. the resurgence of the bbs is symbolic of this desire to connect, and we're here for those who love both future technology and the fun of connecting with others on a multi-user computer system.   maybe you want to join us. user count: ?
				    





be part
                                    of our
				    story!

we expect our skylab.org users to follow the rules.

 use policy

skylab.org provides personal account for noncommercial use.

skylab.org does not tolerate any malicious, abusive or illegal behavior by its users. in particular, the following activities constitute a policy violation:

  * cracking or performing dos attacks 
  against the skylab.org's infrastructure;
  * cracking or performing dos attacks against other entities on the internet;
  * interfering with other users or with the skylab.org's infrastructure;
  * sending unsolicited or bulk email messages (spam);
  * hosting illegal material;
  * hosting of fraudulent web pages (e.g. phishing);

  network scanners (such as @nmap@), scanners for security vulnerabilities or exploits are proscribed regardless of their intended purpose. if you want to use our servers to perform specific security audits against your own equipment, you must contact us about it.

 undesired activity
there are other activities that are not strictly illegal or abusive, but still are not desired on skylab.org. these are not wanted for reasons or system or network performance or simply because they are not withing the intended purpose of this project. these activities include:

 * commercial use of your account;
 * hosting material that promote racism, discrimination or intolerance;
 * hosting of pornography;

   for long periods of time);

   * we will never sell or pass user data on to third parties;
   * we will not read or search your incoming or outgoing mail other than to protect you from spam.

   unfortunately providing an open environment also attracts people who intend to misuse and abuse the system, so we can't provide anonymity for users. this means that quite a few things are logged, and that if this use policy is violated, logs and user data may be used as evidence of incident.

   remember that privacy should not be delegated, so it's your duty to ultimately protect your data and your communications. encryption tools and anonymity networks are at your disposal.
