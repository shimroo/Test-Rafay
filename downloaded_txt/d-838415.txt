every ocean master boat offers plenty of wet and dry storage, numerous seating configurations and plenty of options for fishermen, divers and family boaters. our boats are built semi-custom for each owner, so you can be assured you will get the boat you truly want, whether it's for offshore fishing, cruising, watersports or just spending time with your family on the water.
 
our boats are legendary for their seaworthiness and safety. overbuilt and rock solid, they have long been the favorite of professional fishing captains, charter boats and tournament anglers. ocean masters are also in use by commercial towing and rescue operations worldwide - even the us navy has used our boats in one of their toughest offshore locations!
 
we are based in stuart, florida and have been building and selling semi-custom boats for four decades. you can visit the factory showroom page to see examples of some of the boats we have for sale here in florida.
