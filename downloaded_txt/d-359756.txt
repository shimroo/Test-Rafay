the best value and quality!



        we here at netriceuticals believe in one thing above all: to bring you the best natural health supplements at the greatest value and with a hassle-free experience.  customer service is the name of our game, and we have been making thousands of customers happy for the last 15 years.  yes, we have been in business far longer than many of the other sites, but we strive to bring a far more personal experience for you.  that's why we have always been pharmacist-owned and pharmacist-run.  we provide you with great health articles and advice from our pharmacist, something other sites only wish they can do.  all this content is at your disposal, and all it requires is you to apply for free membership.  yes, membership is absolutely free -- what more can you ask for?
        
        now netriceuticals offers you even more value than ever before.  we now offer free domestic shipping on all our products, and we continue to offer quantity discounts on nearly all of our items.  that means the more you buy, the more you save! 
        
how to use this site:

        netriceuticals is different. we are not product driven so we don’t stock everybody’s vitamin c , for example.  our approach is an information and formulary one. what does this mean?
        
        we have gathered information about health conditions and natural substances that promote health. in the members’ section you will find a list of health conditions. mentioned in each page is a link to one or more substances or ingredients that affect the condition. you can then read more in each substance’s monograph that will also have a list of products that contain that substance.
        
        we choose products according to the integrity of the manufacturer, the uniqueness and value of the product,  credibility of the information, and the usefulness of the product for various health conditions. we think this approach will save you time and better inform you about your possible choices. it is geared to those who want to take charge of their health in partnership with their health provider.
