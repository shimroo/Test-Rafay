the marill family web site




   


      



welcome to our family home on the web!
daisy and ed marill created this site in 1998, while living in san jose,
california, primarily to keep their family and friends up to date with their whereabouts and adventures,
since that time, we (ed and daisy) have
found, much to our amazement, that our web site can serve additional purposes as well.
we hope that you
will enjoy its diverse and dynamic content. get comfortable and rummage through all its many
passageways, sharing our experiences, interests, and latest news. we invite
you to email us a note from time to time, and update us on your whereabouts as
well...see our email address
in the
about us
section.
       
please be patient. it takes a while to load all the pictures in our home
page. scroll down.

in october 2008, we upgraded our 1989 toyota rv with a newer rv,  
a 2007 winnebago view, of the same size.

 

we found this two-year old winnebago "mini" rv from a private 
party near tampa. this rv is built on the popular mercedes diesel-powered dodge 
sprinter chassis and reflects 20 years of technology improvements. we love it!

our feline family: "smudge" (below, left) and "sniffles" (below, right).
 
early
in 2004, we
adopted an
abandoned female cat who had been left behind by her previous owners here in the
keys. our smudge
(see left
picture
below) is
no kitten. she is a mature cat, although lovable and really cute. and she has a definite
personality, as all cats do.
and then, in the spring of '07, our neighbors relocated and asked if we would want 
to keep "sniffles" (below, right). up until that point, sniffy had 
always been
an outdoor cat. he is now an indoor cat, and a lot of fun to have around. he is 
really enjoying his new lifestyle, don't you think?
