on-demand webinar: 
mapping heterogeneous interfaces using single-entity electrochemical microspectroscopy
in this exciting webinar, dr. prabhakaran will discuss the distinguishing features of seccm and his recent work employing this technique to answer challenging questions in energy- and corrosion-related applications. he will demonstrate how seccm may be combined with microspectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which ultimately enables spatially resolved correlative mapping of both electrochemical activity and the capture of transient intermediate species at functional interfaces, therby providing a powerful new methodology to characterize technologically relevant surfaces.



speaker: venkateshkumar prabhakaran, phd, pacific northwest national laboratory
date: thursday, april 25, 2024
time: 11:00am et/5:00pm cet
