bach by popular demand




“bach in the city is a new musical organization based at st. vincent de paul church in chicago. the primary purpose of this new enterprise, successor to the beloved bach week festival in evanston, is to present the choral, orchestral and chamber music of johann sebastian bach and other composers whose music would come to life in the splendid acoustical and visual setting of this historic church in the city’s lincoln park neighborhood.”

— - richard webster, artistic director

 











embraced by st. vincent de paul 
we’re bach in the city, which means we have found a new home and st. vincent de paul parish in the beautiful chicago neighborhood, lincoln park.
