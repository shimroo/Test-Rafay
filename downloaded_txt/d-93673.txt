a lot of our clients are really interested in eecvis and have been requesting them. the new format works really smoothly, and the clients can just log in and enter their trip information as needed.

gvl customer service is fantastic. they are so nice and always find a way to help. we try hard to provide that same level of care and support to our own clients.

as a veterinarian who uses globalvetlink on both the small animal and equine platforms, i love the ease and efficiency of the program. globalvetlink has cut down on countless hours of paperwork allowing me to be more attentive to my patients as well as enjoy my off time (instead of drawing coggins photos after hours). i appreciate being able to access the program at any time, making farm calls a breeze. importantly, the globalvetlink team is constantly updating the system and accepting feedback to better help veterinarians and staff.

the time it takes us to put these documents together is cut in half. our doctor’s time is very valuable. they have sick pets in the clinic, and the fact that they don’t have to do much with these documents is invaluable. they can just log in, click a button, do their exam, and be on their way. time is the biggest savings we’ve found with the platform!
