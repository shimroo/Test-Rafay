 myrwa wishes to honor and acknowledge the indigenous communities native to this region and its past, present, and future. to our knowledge, the watershed is on the colonized lands of the massachusett, nipmuc, and pawtucket tribes. the name “mystic” comes from the term that these tribes used for the river — “missi-tuk,” which means “great tidal river.” as you explore the watershed, we encourage you to learn with us about its past and current indigenous heritage.
