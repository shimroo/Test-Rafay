due to inclement weather, the clendening library will be closed on tuesday, february 18th, 2025.
the clendening history of medicine museum was founded as the object-focused portion of the clendening history of medicine library. the museum seeks to illustrate the history of medicine to the staff, students, & faculty of the university of kansas medical center, as well as the wider community. drawing from scholarship in the history of medicine and a collection spanning from ancient times to the 20th century, it provides historical context for the educators and innovators of kumc who are shaping the future of medicine. 
for questions about visiting the clendening library, please contact emma malinee, emalinee@kumc.edu, 913-588-7244.
for questions about kumc history and historical documents, please contact alex welborn, awelborn@kumc.edu, 913-588-7243.
