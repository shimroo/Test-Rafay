      frontier
      families of missouri from the upper louisiana territory
this database is based upon the pioneer families of missouri,
      by bryan and rose. it consists of early tax lists, spanish land grants,
      census records, military records and extractions from the history of
      missouri, by louis houck. this is an on-going project with periodic
      updates. there are over 20,000 linked families as of july 1999.
      coordination of data entry was done by the hancock family organization,
      descendants of william hancock who settled in st. charles county in 1797.
 


 
      about the mogenweb project
      in march and april, 1996, a group of genealogists organized the kentucky
      comprehensive genealogy database. soon after, the u.s. comprehensive
      genealogy database was organized. the idea was to provide a single entry
      point for all states and counties in the united states, where collected
      databases would be stored. in addition, the databases would be indexed and
      cross-linked, so that even if an individual were found in more than one
      county, they could be located in the index.
      at the same time, volunteers were found who were willing to coordinate
      the collection of databases and generally oversee the contents of the web
      page. the person responsible for this county is rhonda
      stolte darnell. contact me if you would like to add your information to the
      database.
the state coordinator is
	mel owings.
	the assistant state coordinator is
	lea 
	robertson.
