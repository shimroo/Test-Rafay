bruce willis: celebrating the cinematic legacy of an unbreakable hollywood icon


on a nondescript wednesday morning in the waning days of march 2023, one of the biggest movie stars on the planet called it quits. it was a sad conclusion to the storied career of a man who had at one point been the highest-paid actor in hollywood. that career is the subject of sean o'connell's bruce willis: celebrating the cinematic legacy of an unbreakable hollywood icon, a definitive survey of willis the actor, the cultural icon, and the man. here, o'connell compiles exclusive, original interviews with directors who have worked with willis, as well as film critics and journalists who have analyzed his career, into a celebratory compendium. it also features the author's analysis of willis's films, his career arc, and the industry that made him a star. and it includes capsule reviews of every bruce willis film, making this a complete handbook to a true american original.











the let them theory: a life-changing tool that millions of people can't stop talking about


if you've ever felt stuck, overwhelmed, or frustrated with where you are, the problem isn't you. the problem is the power you give to other people. two simple words--let them--will set you free. free from the opinions, drama, and judgments of others. free from the exhausting cycle of trying to manage everything and everyone around you. the let them theory puts the power to create a life you love back in your hands--and this book will show you exactly how to do it. [robbins] teaches you how to stop wasting energy on what you can't control and start focusing on what truly matters: you. your happiness. your goals. your life. using the same no-nonsense, science-backed approach that's made the mel robbins podcast a global sensation, robbins explains why the let them theory is already loved by millions andhow you can apply it in eight key areas of your life to make the biggest impact.











when the band played on: the life of randy shilts, america's trailblazing gay journalist


randy shilts was the preeminent lgbtq+ reporter of his generation. he was the first openly gay reporter assigned to a gay beat at a mainstream paper and one of the nation's most influential chroniclers of gay history, politics, and culture. shilts wrote three seminal works on the community: the mayor of castro street, on the life, assassination, and legacy of harvey milk; and the band played on, detailing the failure of politics as usual during the early aids epidemic; and conduct unbecoming, a history of the us military's mistreatment of lgbtq servicemembers. yet the intimate life story of randy shilts has been left unwritten. when the band played on tells that story, recognizing his legacy as a trailblazing figure in gay activism, journalism, and public policy.











supremacy ai, chatgpt, and the race that will change the world.


a webpage was posted online with a simple text box. it was an ai chatbot called chatgpt, and was unlike any app people had used before. it was more human than a customer service agent, more convenient than a google search. behind the scenes, battles for control and prestige between the world's two leading ai firms, openai and deepmind, who now steers google's ai efforts, has remained elusive - until now. in supremacy , olson, tech writer at bloomberg, tells the astonishing story of the battle between these two ai firms, their struggles to use their tech for good, and the hazardous direction they could go as they serve two tech goliaths whose power is unprecedented in history. the story focuses on the continuing rivalry of two key ceos at the center of it all, who cultivated a religion around their mission to build god-like super intelligent machines: sam altman, ceo of openai, and demis hassabis, the ceo of deepmind. supremacy sharply alerts readers to the real threat of artificial intelligence that its top creators are ignoring: the profit-driven spread of flawed and biased technology into industries, education, media and more. with exclusive access to a network of high-ranking sources, parmy olson uses her 13 years of experience covering technology to bring to light the exploitation of the greatest invention in human history, and how it will impact us all.











the incorruptibles: a true story of kingpins, crime busters, and the birth of the american underworld.


this harrowing tale of early twentieth century new york reveals the true stories of an immigrant underworld, a secret vice squad, and the rise of organized crime.  in the early 1900s, prior to world war i, new york city was a vortex of vice and corruption. on the lower east side, then the most crowded ghetto on earth, eastern european jews formed a dense web of crime syndicates. gangs of horse poisoners and casino owners, pimps and prostitutes, thieves and thugs, jockeyed for dominance while their family members and neighbors toiled in the unregulated garment industry.   but when the notorious murder of a gambler attracted global attention, a coterie of affluent german-jewish uptowners decided to take matters into their own hands. worried about the anti-immigration lobby and the uncertain future of jewish americans, the uptowners marshalled a strictly off-the-books vice squad led by an ambitious young reformer.   the squad, known as the incorruptibles, took the fight to the heart of crime in the city, waging war on the sin they saw as threatening the future of their community. their efforts, however, led to unforeseen consequences in the form of a new mobster class who realized, in the country’s burgeoning reform efforts, unprecedented opportunities to amass power.   in this mesmerizing and atmospheric account, drawn from never-before-seen sources and peopled with unforgettable characters, dan slater tells an epic and often brutal saga of crime and redemption, exhuming a buried history that shaped our modern world.
