					publishing the firebible 
around 1.45 billion people in the world don’t have a bible in their first language. this number represents about 20% of the global population. our goal is to print the firebible in the top 100 languages of the world. this would resource 75% of the world’s population with a one-book biblical library in their very own heart language!
explore our wide range of languages here.
