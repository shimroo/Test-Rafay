what we believethat there is that of god in everyone and each person is capable of a direct and unmediated experience of the spirit. this inward experience of god transforms us and leads us into outward expressions of faithful living, witness and action. our understanding and experience of god’s truth is continuing and ongoing and is nurtured and enlarged by being in community with one another.














“you can't separate peace from freedom because no one can be at peace unless he has his freedom.”—  malcolm x
