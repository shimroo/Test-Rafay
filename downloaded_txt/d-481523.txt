my thoughts, processes on pet loss and my urns. 					












hello,
i want to welcome you to my custom pet urn memorial site, dedicated to all the dogs and cats who await us on the rainbow bridge of our hearts.
i have been a metal artist for the past 35 years. i have also been picking lost pets up off the street and finding homes for them for just as long. both are my love.  and i know what it is like to lose a dog or cat that you love so much. we know they wait for us over the rainbow bridge, but for us down here, our hearts still grieve.
i hope i can ease your loss today. i started creating these pet memorials and urns as small memorial sculptures, so as well as holding your pet, they also look beautiful and can hopefully bring forth happy memories as well. every single one of these pet cremation urns are designed and made by hand especially for you. no two are ever alike, all are signed, dated, and each urn can be personally customized to your specifications. they make a wonderful, sweet memorial to keep with you always.
again, i am sorry for the loss of your pet. yet i hope by owning one of my pet memorials you will be reminded of the joy and happiness your dog, cat or other loved one brought to you and your life. this is a hard time, harder than most people admit. memorializing your loved cat or dog in one of our hand crafted urns will help heal your heart of this loss.
remember, even if you are scattering or burying your pet’s ashes, you can order one of these pet urn sculptures to keep in your home as a beautiful memorial to your loved one. it does not have to be a “cremation urn” but rather a memorial work of art.
pet memorials
the loss of your pet can be a devastating time. often it is too emotional to even think of what to do with the body or ashes. later we may regret that we did not cremate our loved one so we could have a pet memorial in his or her honor. this is ok. i created these pet memorials for you to use with or without ashes. you can simply put a letter in the memorial and then seal it. or you can request the cremation urn without an opening at all and then your pet memorial becomes a true sculpture honoring your little one.
they really do wait for us.
i look forward to hearing from you,
alexandra

mission statement:it is so sad when our pet dies. my heart breaks every time i receive an order for a pet urn because i know the sorrow that is on the other side of the phone, or email. i am so sorry you have to go through this. but maybe, even just a tiny bit, i can help relieve you of some of that sorrow. that is what i am here for.
