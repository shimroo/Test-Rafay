acknowledgement of ancestral lands

 

 



we acknowledge that this land on which we are gathered today is part of the ancestral land of the chippewa, odawa, and potawatomi peoples, referred to collectively as the anishinaabeg. it is through the connection of the anishinaabeg with the spirit of the land, water and air that we recognize their unique cultures, traditions, and values. together as treaty people, we have a shared responsibility to act with respect for the environment that sustains all life, protecting the future for those generations to come.
