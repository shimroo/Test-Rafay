working to reduce poverty in america

					catholic charities usa supports a national network of agencies 
committed to encountering those along the margins, regardless of their faith. 
join us in providing help and creating hope for those in need.				






















statement
ccusa responds to freeze on aid for nonprofit service organizations
last year, 92 percent of the services provided by catholic charities agencies covered basic needs — access to food, housing, health care, and other necessities. the millions of americans who rely on this life-giving support will suffer due to this unprecedented action.

affordable housing
catholic charities agencies are among the nation’s largest providers of safe, decent, affordable housing, with more than 38,000 permanent units for families, seniors, veterans and others, as well as temporary and emergency housing.  

about the program
















food and nutrition
catholic charities provides healthy food options for those at risk of hunger via food banks and pantries, schools, child and adult daycare centers, summer lunch programs, group dining settings, community farms and more.    

about the program
















integrated health
through care for the whole person — physical, mental and spiritual well-being, or integral human development — everyone can realize their full potential. agencies offer services including counseling and mental health care, addiction recovery and support, case management and caregiver support.   

about the program
















disaster relief
ccusa is the official domestic relief agency of the u.s. catholic church, providing critical, immediate humanitarian support and long-term aid to rebuild lives and restore hope in communities devastated by natural and human-made disasters. 

about the program
















social enterprise and workforce development
these programs offer strategies to improve an individual’s potential in the workplace while contributing to the alleviation of poverty. social enterprise business models build community alliances and healthy communities, and workforce development programs encourage innovation and job growth.   

about the program
















immigration services
catholic charities agencies provide care to all our sisters and brothers, many of whom come to us in their time of greatest need. our ministry to vulnerable people on the move is a cornerstone of our catholic identity. 

about the program
















foundational services
rooted in the belief that every person is made in god’s image, catholic charities responds to clients’ economic, social, cultural, personal and spiritual needs, from conception to natural death. programs help those served — especially those living in poverty — reach their full potential. 

about the program
















parish engagement
catholic charities has a more than 100-year history of engaging with parishes and supporting their efforts to live out the gospel, to care for the poor and vulnerable and to work for justice.
