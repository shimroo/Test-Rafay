welcome

what is sustainable living?
on a personal level, sustainability is about living within our individual means, physically, emotionally and spiritually. on a more practical level, sustainable living is about valuing our health and wellbeing, our relationships and community and our personal and spiritual growth above the need to consume and exploit.
in a broader sense, living sustainably simply means living in a way that minimises our negative impact on ourselves, others and the planet in the first instance and moves ultimately to living harmoniously on all levels. 
whilst there are many examples of how to do this in a practical way, behind the scenes there is much inner work for us to do in order to engage with the behavioural changes necessary to truly live in alignment with our purpose in being here as human beings. i call this ‘inner reskilling’.
