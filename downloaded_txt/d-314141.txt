in order for an environment to thrive, plant life is vital 













cleaner air

cleaner air means less employees getting sick. it’s really a win-win…win. plants, as we know, convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, but they also help to eliminate toxins and harmful compounds.











increase productivity

plants add more to a space than just a decorative touch and a trendy vibe, research has shown that plants can increase productivity and employee satisfaction by up to 15%. the proof is in the peonies, plants make people happy!











reduce stress

active interaction with indoor plants (like touching & smelling) can reduce physiological & psychological stress. even the potting soil contains microbes that work as natural antidepressants.
