the gnostic order of christ home page: 
may your journey be light!



















from: the secret teachings 
that the living jesus taught 
and that didymos judas thomas recorded.

and jesus said:
whoever comprehends 
the true meaning of these teachings 
will not experience death.

and jesus said:
let the one who seeks 
continue seeking 
until what is sought is found.
when that which is sought is found 
the seeker will be wise.

once wise, the seeker 
will transcend all 
and will attain rest 
and will be at peace 
concerning everything.
