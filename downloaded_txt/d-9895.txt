pfas sampling and ccr solution launched to support utilities navigating evolving regulations

120water, a water quality compliance saas platform, has announced its pfas
sampling and consumer confidence report (ccr). this innovative tool simplifies
regulatory compliance while strengthening public trust and operational efficiency
for water utilities.
to date, more than 7,000 utilities across 48 states have successfully utilized the
platform to create and submit service line inventories and deliver required mail
notifications. with these milestones achieved, utilities are now well-positioned to
seamlessly prepare for the next regulatory actions they’ll need to take this year.
building on these achievements, the tool can equip utilities to seamlessly tackle
the next wave of stricter regulatory requirements, including epa’s lead and
copper rule improvements (lcri) and baseline pfas sampling required by 2027.
this tool simplifies this process by providing:

comprehensive testing: access to accredited labs ensure accurate, reliable
results.
centralized data hub: real-time sample tracking and reporting in one
platform.
regulatory guidance: expert advice to navigate new requirements
confidently.

with service line inventory data and semi-annual reporting requirements
beginning in 2027, ccrs are increasingly critical. this solution transforms the
process by:

streamlined processes: automated workflows for easier preparation and
distribution to save time and resources.
customizable options: flexible delivery methods like mail, email, and qr
codes to meet community needs.
expert support: professional templates and tailored messaging to elevate
outreach efforts.
community engagement: integrate communication into public
transparency dashboards to build trust and strengthen community
connections.
