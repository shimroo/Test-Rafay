        mel gibson settles child custody dispute with ex-girlfriend


 september 8, 2011

in an end to what is one of the bitterest                                  child custody disputes                                   that                                  pasadena divorce lawyers                                   have come across, mel gibson has settled his child custody dispute with his ex-girlfriend, oksana grigorieva. no doubt, the settlement was hard to reach, considering that this dispute involved allegations of                                  domestic violence                                   by oksana grigorieva and battery charges against the actor.                                                                                     both the star and his ex-girlfriend arrived at the los angeles county superior court where attorneys announced their settlement. under the terms of the settlement, oksana grigorieva will live at gibson's california home until their daughter, lucia, who is currently two years old, reaches eighteen years of age. when that happens, the house will be sold and the proceeds of the sale will be put into a trust for the child. gibson will also pay oksana grigorieva $750,000 in three installments.                                                                                     gibson and grigorieva had been involved in a relationship that resulted in the birth of their daughter. however, in 2010, allegations of domestic violence began to emerge after grigorieva claimed that gibson had hit her and broken her tooth. in march, the two ended up in court where gibson admitted that he slapped his ex-girlfriend during an argument because of his concern for his child. he entered a no-contest plea, and was sentenced to three years of probation. the pair broke up and agreed to a $20 million settlement.                                                                   ﻿                                                                  the dispute between the two at some points grew so ugly that it was hard to believe any settlement would be reached at all. among other things, gibson alleged that grigorieva tried to extort money from him beyond the settlement amount.

 




      wife alleges investment banker maintained three mistresses, rejects $20 million settlement


 august 31, 2011

its not every day that                                  pasadena divorce lawyers                                   find a divorce lawsuit involving an investment banker make it to the front page of the new york post. the media however, has been hanging on to salacious details of the lawsuit filed by kathy duffy, soon-to-be ex-wife of john duffy, who is the ceo of keefe, bruyette, & woods investment bank.                                    the lawsuit alleges that duffy has been engaged in “public and notorious adulterous relationships” that had him giving lavish and extravagant gifts to other women. kathy duffy is suing her husband for more than $20 million, alleging in her lawsuit that her husband has maintained three mistresses in three different countries in extravagant lifestyles.                                    the lawsuit doesn't mention the mistresses, but one of them is reported to be a “blonde and tattooed” rock star. she was allegedly given expensive watches, cars and gifts with a total value of more than $700,000. the other two mistresses, according to the lawsuit, were maintained in canada and the dominican republic. these mistresses received equally expensive gifts ranging from a condo in yonkers and a connecticut estate worth more than $400,000, to a home in the dominican republic. the mistress in the dominican republic was also given extravagant furnishings, a new car and had her education expenses covered by duffy.                                    the lawsuit details the value of the dozens of gifts that duffy allegedly lavished on these women. not surprisingly, mrs. duffy rejected a $20 million divorce settlement. her husband is believed to have an annual income of more than $3 million.                                                                   ﻿                                    john duffy maintains that these homes, estates and cars were not gifts but were purchased for investment purposes. he also denies that he was involved in any sexual affairs outside of his marriage.

 




      california child custody, divorce disputes will now take longer to resolve


 august 2, 2011

family law disputes, including those related to                                  child custody                                   and                                  divorce                                  , are likely to take a much longer time to be resolved after the san francisco superior court announced financial cutbacks. this means that people who want a quick resolution of their dispute will have to pay for expensive private judges. similar delays are likely in other parts of the state as well.                                                                                     this week, san francisco superior court presiding judge kathleen feinstein announced cutbacks in order to close a $13.75 million deficit. as a result, all types of cases, including family law-related cases, are likely to move at a snail's pace from this point on. for instance, uncontested divorce proceedings are now likely to take eight months to settle, while child custody disputes, which used to earlier settle in about six weeks, now take six months to be completed.                                                                                     those san franciscans who want to get their family law disputes resolved quickly will have to shell out big money for private judges. having a private judge could cost between $2,500-$10,000. that is not counting your                                  california family lawyer’s                                   fees and other legal costs. those who can't afford those kinds of fees will find that their divorce or custody dispute drags on for months.                                                                                     what's more, judicial budgets are being slashed across the state, and as a result, there may be such cutbacks and consequent delays in the resolution of family law cases across california. alameda county superior court is likely to have its budget slashed by $6.7 million, while at santa clara superior court, judges are talking of cutbacks of close to $7 million. similar cuts are in the pipeline for other jurisdictions as well. the judicial council of california is meeting soon in san francisco to discuss the distribution of financial cutbacks across the state.                         ﻿
