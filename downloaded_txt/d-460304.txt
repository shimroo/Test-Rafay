here's where you'll find high quality images of famous screen stars, mostly from the 1940's and earlier.  we've scanned 8 x 10 
    glossy movie stills and publicity photos, and the resulting full-size pictures are 
    presented for your viewing and downloading pleasureall free.

there 
	are pictures of many popular movie stars, and some lesser-known 
	actors.  the artists shown here are 
     
    an eclectic group, as you can see in the 


    galleries (which 
	contain our scans) and in 
	
	the annex (which showcases scans from 
	our guest 
	contributors).  
    we've also provided 
movie summaries 
    for photos that we can identify as being from films, including 
	poster artwork wherever possible.  a thumbnail of each new scan is displayed 
	on the 
	news page for your 
	convenience, so check there often for the latest updates.  we also have full-length 
	
	radio shows,
	
	movie fan magazines,
	
	movie books, and songs for many 
	of the stars (in their 


    galleries).

it's hard to find full-sized, top 
	quality movie images, so we decided to create this site.  each scan can 
	take up to several hours to 

prepare properly to achieve the 
	desired quality.  
our goals include:  
    high quality pictures, frequent updates, easy site navigation, accuracy, no ads, pop-ups, 
	banners, 
	or cookies--and everything 
    presented in good taste.  we hope you'll agree that we've met these 
    objectives and download all your favorites.
we welcome your feedback about the site on the email 
	page.  also, let us know if you find any errors or have other 
	comments/suggestions.
note to ie 11 users:  
	please add doctormacro.com to compatibility view (tools/compatibility view
