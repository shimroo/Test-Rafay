welcome




since 2002, militaryhops.com has been dedicated to being the premier index of information about space available (space-a) military flights that qualified people can travel on. our goal is that if the information you seek on this subject is on the internet then you can find it from here. 

you can find it from here. jump to our pick of the top 12 most useful
            websites.
background:
it should be noted that while flying on u.s. military aircraft is usually without cost, it is not a reliable means of travel. unlike a commercial airline there are usually no backup flights if the plane is diverted or if there are not enough seats. so your ability to fly to a destination depends on:

the plane actually arriving at your destination
the plane being needed at the other destination (if not the flight could be cancelled or diverted)
space available seats being available on the flight
your flight category being high enough to qualify for one of
              the space available seats












we highly encourage active duty military members to buy a military discount airline ticket through militarytravel.com. unfortunately, if you cannot catch a military hop for some reason then you will be stuck buying an airline ticket at the last moment which is the most expensive way to travel as well as the least assured since commercial airlines can also overbook flights. if on active duty, you may also be stuck somewhere burning up leave and hotel money as well as risking a non-judicial punishment hearing for unauthorized absence (ua or awol) if you do not return on time. 


for these reasons, we highly recommend that space-a travel on a military hop be limited to true leisure travel for those with time to spare::



retirees - backup tickets can be purchased from vettravel.com. 
dependents- eligible to use the militarytravel.com discount airfares
rotc/service academy students with the summer off

last but not least, for security reasons it can be difficult to come by actual flight information for these military aircraft. for about eight years the military tried using a facebook page for each space-a terminal to put out the 96-hour schedules for military hops at each location, but there is a renewed push to move back to official webpages to host that information.





 top 12 websites related to military travel  







 air mobility command 
100% recommended
space available travel rules and regulations 
 official space available travel rules and regulations
if you don't know the rules, you can't play the game. this is a constantly updated site run by the people who manage the military's space-a flight system (at least the air force's part of it). this site has points of contact for each of the terminals as well as websites for most of the bigger terminals with 72-hour flight info for them. it also has the travel request form that you will need to fill out. it is the starting point for all questions (who can fly, who has priority, how much luggage, etc.) and is always superior to internet sites and blogs that may not be up-to-date.











 militarytravel.com 
90% recommended
military discount airfares for active-duty, dependents, and reservists 
this partner site has had a major upgrade since our last report and now active duty military and their dependents (as well as reservists) can book military discount rate airfares here! in addition to being much cheaper, these fares usually can be changed without cost. through this site you can also book rental cars and hotel rooms at discount or government rates. 

what makes this site so valuable is that it is your best alternative to a military hop. "space available" flights are just that... dependent on the space that is available. your military career on the other hand is highly dependent on you not being absent from your unit when your leave expires. to protect themselves, many military families seem to have the military member buy a discount round-trip airfare while their dependents fly home (and back) on a military hop as it becomes available.











 social media 
80% recommended
social media 
ten years ago this really wasn't a thing. but now facebook, twitter, and all the rest can be real-time resources for people traveling space-a. there may be people who are currently sitting in a space-a terminal that you want to fly out of who will post that there are no lines and no waiting lists... or that the lines are long and so are the waiting lists. obviously that can be valuable information although it may or may not be reliable. other people tell their stories about their latest military hop to hawaii or wherever and give suggestions for how others should do it to avoid problems. as an example, here is a sample "community page" from facebook that we think is currently well done...

https://www.facebook.com
in fact, until recently each terminal had its own official facebook page where 72-hour flight information was available. however, amc is now pulling that data back to its own website and terminal web pages.












 state dept. travel warnings and information sheets 
60% recommended
worldwide travel advisories 

the state department is not just where you go to get your passport (required for all u.s. citizens traveling to and from america since 2008)... it is also a great resource for learning about the countries you will be visiting while abroad. 

while most military personnel think in terms of military or terrorist threats, the biggest threats to your well-being in a foreign country are usually criminal activities of various types or police crackdowns on activities which might not be illegal in america (such as religious missionary work). check out what the state department is advising travelers before you depart for a particular country. 

for an added bonus we recommend that you visit the united kingdom's foreign 
travel advisories because they may be more up-to-date or offer you a different flavor of conditions on the ground of wherever you are visiting.













 american automobile association (aaa) 
50% recommended
international driver's permits 
aaa has a whole section of its website dedicated to driving in foreign countries. but the main thing you neeed to be aware of is that it is the official source for international driver's permits in the u.s. for many of the countries where you may travel, you will need not only a valid driver's license in the u.s. but you will also need an international driver's permit. you can get one from an aaa office (you will need two passport photos or they can be made there) or through the mail (they will need a photocopy of your current driver's license). this website will ask you for your zip code and then redirect you to the local area aaa website. aaa also has other road products for overseas travel preparation.












 foreign clearance guide (fcg) 
50% recommended
foreign clearance guide 

you cannot just jump on a space-a military flight and expect to be allowed to go anywhere in the world without being in compliance with the rules of wherever the plane is going to land (and this includes intermediate stops). this guide has all of the rules for military hops and their flight crews and passengers. make sure you are in compliance with all of these rules or it is unlikely that you will be allowed to board the aircraft in the first place.

for what it is worth, the new amc terminal pages seem to have the most important of this information and they are accessible from public computers and smart devices.














 blogs and websites 
50% recommended
blogs and websites 
having done this for twenty years we have seen some "space-a warriors" who have websites and blogs about military hops both come and go over time. one of the original "three amigos" with the best of these sites actually passed away in that time. and new people have gotten interested in military hops and have created new sites that are well worth reading. 

it used to be a retiree thing but lately the best new sites are by military spouses. obviously there is no way we can list all of them (that is what google is for)... or which ones fit your own needs best. but some of the better ones that we think are currently worth reading are:  

spacea.net - one of the longest-running websites related to space-a travel, this one has an associated facebook page with updated news of importance to military travelers 
spacea.net
mommytravels.net - as you might guess, this is a website with the experiences of a younger military traveler. not exclusively about space-a travel but a really valuable trip planning tool nonetheless... particularly for young families like her own.
mommytravels.net
poppin' smoke - a newer website of a military retiree's spouse with lots of useful information from someone who is globetrotting using military hops!
poppin' smoke
dirk pepperd's space-a message board - another of the long-time websites about military hops. for a while dirk was even having space-a conferences! there is also an associated facebook page that hopefully he will start updating again now that amc is allowing passengers on military flights.

 vettravel.com 
40% recommended
for retired veterans 

there are lots of websites that you can make regular airline, hotel, and rental car reservations through. but it wasn't always so and there were (and are) few that cater to the military retiree community. for now we still recommend vettravel.com even though we had to lower our recommendation percentage due to a lot of the useful information to military retiree travelers being stripped out in the latest version (such as military lodging links and space-a packing tips). it still allows you to select senior citizen rates for wherever you wish to travel. please take note that you need to select the senior citizens box when requesting a price quote to get the discounts. a militarytravel.com related site, hopefully it will have some of the better information restored in the near future.















 united services organization (uso) 
40% recommended
assistance for military travelers 

it is amazing how often people forget that the uso helps military travelers. or how widespread its services are. if you get in a jam they can prove to be a lifesaver for you and your family in terms of housing while in transit and other services that you might need.












 ride sharing apps 
30% recommended
ground transportation 

quite frankly we weren't real sure what to call this category. one of the critical parts of every military hop is figuring out how to get from the terminal where the planes land to the front gate of the base! they are not usually very close together. if you don't figure this out before you leave home, then you are almost guaranteed to be toting children and/or luggage for miles... in the heat, snow, and rain. which is not a fun way to start a trip.

every base is different. some bases allow uber, lyft, and other ride sharing drivers to pick you up. some only allow approved cab companies. others will let you rent a car on base... and hopefully that rental office is near the terminal.  other bases have a base shuttle bus that you can use to get to the front gate where more options await... but the shuttle may not run 24/7.

please figure this out before you leave. it applies both to the terminal that you are leaving and the one that you are arriving at. don't assume that a friend can get access to the base if you aren't with them if they don't have a military id card. don't assume that you can just leave your car in a base parking lot for a month while you are globetrotting. 

do your research ahead of time. figure this out.













 dodds school schedules 
30% recommended
department of defense education activity calendars 

usually known as department of defense dependents schools (dodds)... the reason that these dodea calendars are important to military travelers is that they will tell you when these schools let out for summer and other breaks. that is important for trip planning because military dependents returning home are category 3 travelers on military hops... which means they have priority over travelers in categories 4-6. and there are a lot of these kids (and families) who will travel space-a to visit grandma during the summer or at christmas... so it will be harder for lower priority travelers to get a seat on a hop at those times. if you can schedule around those breaks then you will be better off.












 coast guard space-a regulations 
10% recommended
us coast guard space-a flight program 

we don't want to say "last but not least" because we have barely scratched the surface of what is out there on the web about space-a flights. however, for those who are eligible the u.s. coast guard runs a similar program. they are not part of the department of defense and the rules (and eligibilities) can change over time. but if you think you may be eligible to fly space-a on a uscg flight then you may want to consider them. this link is to the latest version of their official program rules so it may be of limited utility. you might just want to stop by a uscg air terminal and find out how things work there.
