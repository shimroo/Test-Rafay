worldwide
a candle in the window hospitality network is a growing online, worldwide network of christian  households delighting in hospitality. our hope is to multiply the blessings we have experienced in our own home through hospitality as our members travel, share a meal and open up their homes to one another.
our mission is to provide an ever expanding online database to our members, and a secure communication network through  which to contact potential hosts to set up a conversational dinner and/or an overnight stay when traveling through or to their location.
