   identification 
        of haviland china patterns

click here for pattern pictures
there are 30,000 to 60,000 patterns of haviland and co, charles field 
            haviland, johann haviland and theodore haviland limoge china.  
an online way  to search out a pattern name is to look on 
        e-bay- haviland category  and do a search on "haviland 
            schleiger"  and many of the more common patterns will be 
            listed.  you can also contact the haviland dealers found through 
            the haviland collectors international foundation (www.havilandcollectors.com) 
          to aid in identifying your pattern or use the schleiger books   

 what is a schleiger 
            number? this is the identification system used by haviland dealers 
            due to the large number of patterns of haviland china. follow the link for 
            a better explanation. 
          the books by the schleiger family  
            are the identifying sourcebook for patterns (black and white drawings).
          these are where all the "schleiger" identification 
            system of the 60,000 haviland patterns came from.  the later 
          the book edition, the more current the identification. 




  hints: to match the schleiger book picture, pick a cup 
              saucer and match that. also there may be 6-12 variations of  
              your pattern, so look at more than one saucer to match the pattern.




what is a blank?- the haviland china limoges plain whiteware comes 
            in several dozen different shapes. to help with identification, blanks 
            have been numbered in the schleiger system.  plain blanks were 
            also sold for people to paint their own china at home. 

star blank (blank #5) list of pieces 
            sold in early 1900's. 

torse blank  vs. cannele blank -think of the h& co. 
            cannele droit as "straight fluted", and the schleiger #413- torse 
            as "twist"
