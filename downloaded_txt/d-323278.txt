  "we moved into our home last year. we needed our 1st tuneup before heading out of town especially since temps are to be in high 90s. they were very responsive on getting us an appointment. andrew came out and was prompted on arriving ,very knowledgeable.. excellent t customer service. i highly recommend!"

  "found h & h mechanical via the bbb, and i can't recommend them enough. we needed an "emergency" ac repair before we left town for two weeks. called early and lauren moved schedules around to accommodate us. jesse came out almost immediately, diagnosed the problem and fixed it on the spot. service was prompt, professional, and--most importantly--effective: the ac is back on, and since it's july, that's a life saver. i doubt h & h is the cheapest around, but they're solid. you're gonna get the job done right."

  "h&h mechanical is my “go to” hvac company. why? i’m a realtor and property manager who needs a company that is reliable, honest, quick, efficient, friendly and easy to worth with. h&h is all of that and a bag of chips!!! i kissed many frogs until i found my “prince” in h&h mechanical! i can not say enough good things about this company and it’s people. i love me some h & h mechanical! ❤️"

  "shane and his team were very professional in their job. completed very efficiently and neatly. did not try to up-sell new gutters, and instead offered repairs that were needed, at a reasonable price. will call them and use them every year."
marsha o. in alpharetta, ga


 
  "paul fixed our compressor for us in our ac unit after it died! they were quick to get on the job and quick to knock it out too! a larger ac company had given us an estimate it would take twice as long as h&h ended up taking and the larger company didn’t have the parts on hand. we were super grateful it was taken care of so quickly with the july heat. highly recommended!"
