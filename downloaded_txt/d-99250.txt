	 oscar blandi acqua marina styling gel
	 
    


this styling gel works really well to hold my hair style all day. i have tried other styling gels, but found that they left my hair tacky feeling. this product holds without being stiff or sticky. i only need to use a about a dime sized amount for my shoulder length hair, so the tube last a pretty long time.www.insiderbeauty.com

	 kinerase intensive eye cream
	 
    


this product really does seem to help moisturize the skin around my eyes and reduce the appearance of fine lines. i like to apply it under my eyes before i use concealer. it helps my concealer to go on easier and keeps it from getting cakey looking. this product contains the highest level of kinetin available.www.insiderbeauty.com

	 phytolaque hair spray with silk proteins
	 
    


i started using this about a month ago and have been very pleased. i spray my hair section by section as i use my flat iron. it really does improve the results you get from your flat iron. it also helps to hold your style throughout the day.www.insiderbeauty.com

	 loreal de-crease eye shadow base
	 
    


i recently read about this product in a magazine and decided to give it a try. some of the eye shadows that i use crease after they are on for a while. this product kept my eye shadow from fading and creasing for hours. this is definitely a great buy!www.insiderbeauty.com

	 city cosmetics lip plumping treatment
	 
    


i was pleasantly suprised to find that this product actually does what it says it will do. it made my lips fuller without any stinging sensation (just a very slight tingle). i especially liked the fact that it was not the least bit sticky. the lines on my lips are actually less noticeable than before. this product makes my lips feel softer and more moisturized.www.insiderbeauty.com

	 secret platinum antiperspirant with olay conditioners
	 
    


i have tried many deodorants over the years, but this is by far my new favorite. i used the original secret antiperspirant in the past, but i had to stop using it because it irritated my underarms. when i saw that they had a new secret antiperspirant with olay conditioners, i decided i would give it a try. i was thinking that the olay conditioners might prevent the previous irritation that i had experienced. i have been using it for over a month now without any irritation. it also keeps me drier than any other antiperspirant that i have tried.

	 t3 tourmaline professional ionic straightener/curler
	 
    


i have had several flat irons over the last few years. i always bought the cheaper drug store brand straighteners. they worked fairly well at straightening my hair, but they would snag on my hair causing breakage. after doing some research online about different straighteners, i finally decided on the t3 tourmaline straightener/curler. i have been using it for about three months now, and i have been very happy with it. it glides through my hair without snagging it. this straightener uses infrared heat which is supposed to be better for your hair. i have the t3 tourmaline professional ionic 1" straightener/curler, but they have other models to choose from.www.insiderbeauty.com

	 olay body quench body lotion
	 
    


i decided to give this body lotion a try this summer after i noticed my skin was looking a little dry from being out in the sun. it goes on really nice, without being the least bit greasy. that is a big plus for me. it also has a nice scent that isn't overpowering. i use the kind for extra dry skin, but they also sell one for normal to dry skin and one for sensitive skin.  i like to apply it following my shower, especially after shaving. if you apply it while your skin is still damp from your shower or bath, it will help to seal in that moisture.www.insiderbeauty.com
