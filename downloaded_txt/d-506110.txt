some thoughts on religious services, plus guided meditationsrsadellemarch 4th, 2017last week i listened to this episode of insights at the edge (transcript also available at the link) where the guest was rabbi rami shapiro. rabbi rami was a congregational rabbi for twenty years, and now teaches on being a holy rascal and what he calls "perennial wisdom." tami, the host, asked him about moving away from judaism. he describes judaism as, "it's all about god as a male superpower somewhere," talks about issues with the idea of jews as the "chosen people," and says that many organized religions treat a service as something to just get through. the whole time i was listening to that, i kept thinking, "that's a really narrow view of judaism." then i went to a saturday morning torah service, and thought, "oh, now i see what you mean." it felt like we were just doing things to get through them without any time to think about what they meant. also, i discovered that where i know the friday night service very well, i knew almost none of the saturday torah service.there's another part in the podcast where rabbi rami talks about the "house-church movement where people who don't feel comfortable at church are just getting together. they pray something, they read something, and then they just have conversations. ... i think what people were hungry for was conversation," which made me laugh because conversation is the last thing i want out of a religious service. i'm not even all that interested in the teaching part - i have a lot of other avenues in my life for that. the other thing that made me laugh is when he says, "we didn't have a cantor so we had whale song instead—recorded whale songs," because i thought, "you don't need a cantor; just sing!"the combination of listening to rabbi rami's thoughts on judaism and going to a saturday morning torah service (with a cantor) really helped me define what i want out of a religious service. first, i want a slow, gentle approach to prayer where you get to really think about and feel what you're praying. this is particularly true for me in a jewish service because i don't read hebrew, so i'm always trying to follow along with the transliteration while skimming the english translation to see if there are things i don't want to say. secondly, i want to sing or chant with other people. we chant in my yoga class, and my yoga teacher has various things she says to get people to not feel embarrassed or weird about it and just chant. i find chanting easy because i grew up jewish without speaking hebrew, so for me, singing with other people in a language i don't speak is my idea of collective spiritual practice. part of what i like about friday night services versus the saturday torah service is that we sing a lot of songs i know, and when i started going to services on occasion again, what i wanted was to sing with other jews. lucky for me, our current rabbi does a contemplative service one saturday morning a month that's an hour of chanting and guided meditation. it's really lovely, and i do really feel a connection with the divine during that experience. (i feel a little bit guilty sneaking out after the contemplative service instead of staying for the torah study afterwards, but, again, the conversation/learning part is not the valuable piece to me.)in february, the rabbi's adult education class was "an intro to jewish angels," so at the february contemplative service, she did a guided meditation with angels that i found really moving. (also interesting: i had a very clear image of the personification of three of the four of them.) it probably helps if you've already done some chanting and breathing first and pause to breathe into each of these, but here it is as best i can remember it: close your eyes. take a few breaths. now imagine to your right the angel michael, the one who is like god. you may feel some warmth or see a light. now imagine to your left the angel gabriel, the power of god. in front of you, imagine uriel, the light of god. at your back, imagine raphael, the healer. now feel the angels surrounding you in their warmth or in their light. rest in their light. now from above, feel the light of god pouring over you like honey.i really love the divine light guided meditations the rabbi's done at both of the contemplative services i've been to so far. for a secular version of a filling yourself with light meditation, i also recommend danielle laporte's light scanning contemplation (at her site, registration-free soundcloud version).this entry was originally posted at http://rsadelle.dreamwidth.org/516623.html. please comment there using openid.tags: faith, goings on in my head, recs, recs: other

fic rec: bond/q angels and archangels aursadellefebruary 18th, 2017espionage is a family affair (78403 words) by nagapdragonchapters: 41/41fandom: skyfall (2012) - fandom, james bond (craig movies)rating: maturewarnings: no archive warnings applyrelationships: james bond/q, minor or background relationship(s)characters: james bond, q (bond - craig movies), eve moneypenny, female m (james bond), q | major boothroyd, alec trevelyan, miscellaneous double-0s, r - characteradditional tags: angels, magic, slow build, dysfunctional familysummary:it's common knowledge that angels make good weapons and terrible soldiers. they're hard to kill, hard to catch, and leave a swathe of destruction wherever they go. that's why mi6 likes them.james bond, agent 007, is one of the most devastating weapons mi6 will admit to having. explosions follow his every whim and he's nearly impossible to kill, despite the best efforts of terrorists worldwide. he's second only to the weapons mi6 pretends don't exist- archangels are only a theory, after all. aren't they?what i liked: this story is so good in such a creative way that when i made a quick list of highlights of 2016, i put reading this story on it. i reread it this week, and it was just as engrossing and amazing the second time around. while it is a bond/q story, the main focus is on q, his family, and the plot.one of the most incredible things about this story is the worldbuilding. nagapdragon builds a whole culture and history around the angels, their existence, and their powers. each chapter begins with a passage from an in-world reference work, mission report, or gossip site that gives us the background that fills out the world around q's experiences. one of the other strengths of the story is the mix of strong relationships. in the story, q and his twin sister vivi are m's children, major boothroyd is their uncle, and eve is their cousin. we get a really good sense of the strength and meaning of those relationships, as well as q's relationships with the double-0s who make up their chosen family and the characters we meet later who i won't spoil for you. i also enjoy a lot of the little bits around the angels. when i think about this story, i usually think first about the blueberries.there is a fair amount of canon-typical violence and a bit of textual nudity. there is no sex in the story, so it is safe for work.this entry was originally posted at http://rsadelle.dreamwidth.org/516271.html. please comment there using openid.tags: bond fandom related, recs: fic

what i'm doing with my time (while not on twitter)rsadellefebruary 16th, 2017i'm going through a periodic recalibration of how i spend my time and energy. i find this happens every few years when i look at what's important to me and how i'm actually spending my time and try to realign my life so those match better. some things that contributed to that this time around:lakeeffectgirl went on a twitter hiatus, and then i discovered how much of my twitter interaction was with her. because of that, i started reading twitter only when i was at home. one of my rules for myself is that there are twitter accounts i only read when i'm at work. those are the accounts that tweeted and retweeted a lot of political things. i found that i was calmer and less anxious when i wasn't reading those all the time. now i'm checking twitter only once a day, and i've turned off retweets on or muted a few more people so it's manageable. me constantly feeling anxious and upset wasn't doing me or the world any good.i listened to this interview with nancy colier (a transcript is also available at the link). she's the author of a book called the power of off: the mindful way to stay sane in a virtual world, which my library has so i might read it at some point. what i really liked about her perspective was that it isn't "no technology ever!" but rather to be mindful about how we're using technology and how that affects us. that framing helped me to notice how i felt different when i wasn't reading twitter all the time, and to think about how much time i really want to spend reading things i don't really care about that much on the internet versus doing other things i want to do.a side effect is that when i'm not reading twitter all the time and therefore (a) not hanging around to see what people might tweet and (b) less anxious, then i'm more likely to turn off my computer earlier and either go to bed early or go read a book and then better notice that i really am tired and ready to go to bed on time (or early).i've been trying to remind myself on a semi-regular basis that i want to feel light, giddy, deeply present, and connection. sometimes that's helping me put whatever's happening or what i'm feeling into perspective.some things i'm doing instead of compulsively reading about the state of the world:reading books. i belong to two book clubs now, both of which meet once a month. i'm trying to read about a book a week which means i read the two book club books and then two whatever i want to read books each month.writing. i had a really hard time writing for the first month or so after the election. there didn't seem to be any point. writing fic seemed so frivolous. plus, i had a hard time doing much of anything that wasn't trying to absorb reality. i saw a few things about the importance of making art in dark times, but none of them really stuck until i read this piece from sophia mcdougall. this was the thing that let me find inspiration: "but if they hadn’t been there? i thought, looking at my friend. who was fierce and bright-eyed and smiling. those useless satirists and artists and musicians pouring their spirits into their art and watching it land on the floor of history like that dropped custard pie?  what if there was nothing to look back on in those times but a culture in militaristic  lockstep, or perhaps worse, slumped in dead-eyed indifference?" there are a lot of things i can't do or change about the world, but i can write stories for other people to enjoy. i can do my part to make sure that the world isn't all despair. and i can do this easily because i find writing easy. "it's not enough. it's not enough," mcdougall says. it isn't, and i'm not sure how much i believe art can really change the world for the better anymore, but the alternative seems even worse. and then there's this: when i'm having a rough time and the world seems bleak, fan fic is where i turn for comfort, solace, distraction, the vision of a different kind of world. i can be that for someone else. that seems worth doing.connecting with people. part of my goal in joining the two aforementioned book clubs was to meet new people who might be potential friends. the first one i joined is run by our apartment complex social directors, and i liked it so much that i joined a second one, which is sci fi/fantasy book club through meetup organized by a queer woman i also met at a local acquaintance's holiday party. i've been making more of an effort to reach out to and make plans with my two local friends. i've been sending more emails, both as part of a what we're up to on twitter hiatus thread with lakeeffectgirl and as a practice of sending more frequent brief notes from whatever's happening in my life to our larger friend group. in doing this, i've been thinking about gretchen rubin's family's updates emails: "our motto is 'it's okay to be boring.'"this entry was originally posted at http://rsadelle.dreamwidth.org/515908.html. please comment there using openid.tags: happiness, life on lj, tales of real life

weekly check-in sheetsrsadellefebruary 4th, 2017i promised i would share this if it worked for me. i uploaded a pdf version and an .odt (libreoffice writer - should probably be openable in word) version. note: the .odt version does not look right in google docs because of the formatting stuff, but i thought it would be useful if you wanted to download it and make some adjustments to it.the hard part about this is that i find i'm putting some of the same things on the "what didn't work" and "to do/change/fix" lists every week. i'm really working on not reading fic late in the evening and consequently going to bed too late.this entry was originally posted at http://rsadelle.dreamwidth.org/515678.html. please comment there using openid.tags: happiness, project announcement

the fire starter sessions audio coursersadellejanuary 31st, 2017a follow-up to my best books i read in 2016 post: the fire starter sessions was on that list, and i got around to reading it because danielle offered the audio course (the audio version of the book minus the introduction plus fillable/printable pdf versions of the worksheets) for free last year. i already had a copy of the book, so i read the chapter the evening before, listened to the audio in the morning, and worked on the worksheets off and on during the day. she's offering it for free again this year (you have to sign up for her email list, but you can always unsubscribe if you don't enjoy it), and if it seems interesting to you at all, i definitely recommend it. i enjoyed spending focused time on it every day so much that i've since made it a practice to do/read/listen to something inspirational at least a few times a week.this entry was originally posted at http://rsadelle.dreamwidth.org/515161.html. please comment there using openid.tags: books: nonfiction, happiness, recs: books

the best books i read in 2016rsadellejanuary 13th, 2017i read either 40 or 44 books in 2016, depending on whether you count unique books read or instances of reading a book. of those, a little more than half (23) are things i read for the first time. (methodology note: this only considers books finished; i left out the one i gave up on halfway through.)top 5 books/series i read for the first time in 2016conjured by sarah beth durst - ya mystery/thriller with magic that does some amazing things with point of view and verb tense.the graces by laure eve - ya, witchcraft, mysterious/charismatic family, new girl in town, somewhat reminiscent of the craft.shadows cast by stars by catherine knutsson - ya dystopia with magic that i both enjoyed and kept thinking about for days afterwards.his fair assassins trilogy (grave mercy, dark triumph, mortal heart) by robin lafevers - this is the medieval assassin nuns of the god of death ya trilogy i never knew my life needed.the fire starter sessions by danielle laporte - i found this very inspiring, even taking into account that parts of it are more directed at entrepreneurs.top 5 books/series i re-read in 2016the glass lake by maeve binchy - by far my favorite maeve binchy novel.chalion series (the curse of chalion, paladin of souls, the hallowed hunt) by lois mcmaster bujold - good fantasy novels with a fascinating theology and people with intense feelings.cordelia's honor by lois mcmaster bujold - sci fi, interesting politics, including the gender politics. the only scene i vividly remembered is on page 563. the book is 590 pages long.the labyrinth gate by alys rasmussen - this is my second favorite fantasy novel built around a tarot-style card deck, and i enjoyed rereading it.attolia series (the thief, the queen of attolia, the king of attolia, a conspiracy of kings) by megan whalen turner - this is another excellent fantasy series with an interesting fictional religion.this entry was originally posted at http://rsadelle.dreamwidth.org/514808.html. please comment there using openid.tags: books, books: annual list, books: fiction, books: nonfiction, recs, recs: books

2017 goalsrsadellejanuary 2nd, 2017i took a slightly different approach to coming up with goals this year. i really like danielle laporte's year in review exercise, so i did that, and looked at what the new year looks like if it's full of what works and the themes from the highlights of the last year. i've also been revisiting the desire map and reworking my way through the core desired feelings process, and here are the feelings i think are going to work for me (at least for now): light, giddy, deeply present, and connection; or, possibly, the more syntactically parallel: light, giddiness, deep presence, connection. (i think the first three might be different flavors of the same thing, but they feel different enough that it's worth keeping all three.) i thought about those two exercises when making goals for this year.do regular life check-ins. i think i'm going to create a structure/worksheet for this (i'll share it if i do). the basic idea is that i want to check in with myself every week to see what's working, what isn't, what was great, what i want to change, and what i want to stop doing.create and strengthen connections. do at least one thing every week to strengthen connections with existing, new, or potential friends. do this with local people at least once a month.go on vacation/take time off. take time off from work at least once a quarter. go to the beach (any beach). take a vacation of some sort with molly.attend to my spiritual life. do something every day that draws inspiration from something outside of me. i have a daily yoga and meditation practice, and there's a different sort of inspiration/spiritual lift that comes from taking in wisdom/inspiration/spiritual teaching from outside of myself.make time to take in art. take in some sort of beautiful, unusual, and/or innovative art every month. this may include: attending dance performances, reading something very different from what i usually read, spending time with beautifully illustrated children's books from the library, going to an art exhibit.speak up. part of this is an intention around making the world a better place over the next year(s). for a specific, measurable goal: write something non-fiction every week. i'm not sure if these are things to post here or on tumblr or if i should start a wordpress blog like a real blogger. advice, suggestions, and opinions welcome!take care of my health. specifically here: get the gum grafts done, and start taking melatonin before it really becomes summer to see if it works better that way.tags: desire map, friends, project announcement

2016 year in review - goalsrsadellejanuary 2nd, 2017save money. this did not happen. on the bright side here, i pretty much broke even.take care of my car. i had the timing belt replaced, got the recall-based maintenance done, and had the check engine light looked at (repeatedly - it's mysterious and temperamental, but at least they were able to smog it).take care of my health. i saw a new doctor; did some things that made my summer depression better; and took time off once a quarter, including three non-consecutive weeks during the summer. i did not get the gum grafts done.local connections. things i did to create and strengthen local connections: i joined a couple of meetups, and tried befriending some people i met at one of them. (they later moved two states away.) i joined my apartment complex book club. two local friends and i have been doing coffee shop writing dates every few weeks. i also went to services a couple of times (one friday night and one saturday morning), which was nice and i will probably do again. socially, it's kind of weird since we moved here when i was three. it's hard to feel like i can just be myself when half the people there know my mom and knew me when i was a kid and probably have some idea about me that may or may not have any relation to reality. i would take any advice anyone has about navigating that sort of social situation.tags: friends, project announcement

some thoughts for the turning of the year in two partsrsadelledecember 31st, 2016part 1: i feel scared to talk about how scared i feel for fear that the admission of vulnerability will make me more of a target, for either negative comments or well-meaning dismissal of my fear. i'm a woman, a lesbian, and a jew. one side of my family is jewish. the vast majority of my friends are women, queer people, people of color, and/or people with ongoing health issues that require care. i feel terrified about what will happen to us, to other vulnerable populations, to our country, to the world in the next year, four years, however many decades the next president's nominees sit on the supreme court.part 2: a prayer for the new year and always:may our hearts be open.may we be thankful.may we choose love over hate, kindness over contempt, compassion over fear.may we choose creation over destruction, peace over war, hope over despair.may we choose the liberation of all over power for the few.may we believe the stories of others and may our stories be believed in turn.may our wishes for life, health, and happiness extend beyond the borders of our own families, our own communities, our own countries.may the entire universe be filled with peace and joy, love and light.may our hearts be open.tags: faith, goings on in my head, politics
