televisionary






january 14, 2021








back in 2006, i founded a television blog called televisionary (the very one you're reading now).  at the time, it was a little side-project that i stared while working in television development: something to do during the off-hours or (my infrequent) down-time or at my desk during my lunch breaks.  over the next few years, televisionary morphed into a full-time job as i watched almost everything on television and cataloged my thoughts, penning reviews, conducting interviews with talent, breaking news, and aggregating the day’s entertainment news headlines and major listings every morning.  it got noticed by entertainment weekly  and the new york times , the chicago tribune and cnn, deadline and variety . televisionary took on a life of its own. it became discussed in hollywood and i was always surprised to discover that actors or producers or executives who read my tv blog. it was a secret at first, one that i eventually shared with a few friends before spreading outwards, th...

bbc culture: matthew weiner: mad men’s creator on its final episodes









april 05, 2015









the creative force behind the period drama talks about where his characters are as his show begins its final episodes. “we left off with everyone’s material needs being met in an extreme way,” says mad men creator matthew weiner of where we last saw the characters on his critically acclaimed period drama when the show went on hiatus 10 months ago. “then the issue is, what else is there?” that is the central question with the return to us tv of the amc hit, one demanding to be answered by both the show’s characters, and its creator whose success is the envy of the television industry. mad men has been a defining part of weiner’s life for the last 15 years. he wrote the pilot script on spec while he was a staff writer on cbs’ ted danson sitcom becker in 1999, using it to land a writing gig on hbo’s the sopranos in 2002. it would take another five years, filled with multiple rejections, before the first episode of mad men would make it on the air. someone with less determination ...

buzzfeed: abc family’s campus rape storyline goes where scripted television hasn’t gone before









february 14, 2015









switched at birth , which kicked off a multi-episode arc last night about campus rape featuring one of its main characters, might just be the bravest show on television. the anger directed at hbo's   the newsroom   in december in the wake of   an episode that attempted to capitalize on the debate surrounding the scourge of college sexual assault   crystallized the complexity of emotions surrounding the very complicated issue plaguing campuses nationwide. at the time, the   rolling stone /uva debacle was dominating headlines — a magazine story that was meant to serve as crusading journalism, peeling back the lid of insidious behavior at the virginia university and bringing awareness of the situation to a larger audience, instead had the opposite effect as the story's factual basis was attacked and the magazine backed away from supporting the writer. any platform that the story could have provided rape victims — particularly those on college campuses — was undone,...

buzzfeed: meet the tv successor to "serial"









february 02, 2015









hbo's stranger-than-fiction true crime documentary the jinx   — about real estate heir robert durst — brings the chills and thrills missing since serial   wrapped up its first season. serial   obsessives: hbo's latest documentary series is exactly what you've been waiting for.   the jinx: the life and deaths of robert durst , like sarah koenig's beloved podcast, sifts through old documents, finds new leads from fresh interviews, and seeks to determine just what happened on a fateful day in which the most foul murder was committed. and, also like  serial  before it,  the jinx may also hold no ultimate answer to innocence or guilt. but that seems almost beside the point; such investigations often remain murky and unclear, and guilt is not so easy a thing to be judged. instead, this upcoming six-part tantalizing murder mystery, from director andrew jarecki ( capturing the friedmans ), is a gripping true crime story that unfolds with all of the speed of a ...

buzzfeed: “parenthood” came full circle in its perfect series finale









january 30, 2015









  farewell, team braverman. it couldn't be more fitting that  parenthood , which wrapped up its six-season run on jan. 29, ended with a baseball game. the pilot episode of the jason katims-created show ( very  loosely based on the 1989 feature film) ended in the same fashion: after a negative experience, max braverman (max burkholder) doesn't initially want to play in his baseball game, but when he changes his mind, the entire braverman clan races to get him there in time.  there's a beautiful sense of symmetry, therefore, to how  parenthood 's final episode ended, with the bravermans uniting to celebrate one of their own, zeek (craig t. nelson), on the baseball diamond, fulfilling his wishes and bringing each other closer together in the process. with the series bookended both by the most american of sports — crosby (dax shepard) once refers to baseball as the bravermans' "religion" — and by sarah (lauren graham) finding her true place (moving in with her...

buzzfeed: what’s behind our obsession with “too many cooks” 









november 08, 2014









adult swim’s surreal satire of sitcoms subverts our expectations of nostalgia. you might be able to go home, but it will never be the same. "too many cooks" began as an adult swim parody that aired on cartoon network's late-night block for a week or so at the end of october, but since then, the surreal and twisted 11-minute video has gone viral in a way that even its creators,  chris "casper" kelly ( squidbillies ) and paul painter, have been gobsmacked by . what is it about this short that has exerted such a magnetic pull on so many? "too many cooks" is, on the surface, initially a parody of 1970s and 1980s sitcoms that once populated the television landscape. these are the types of shows you might recall watching from the couch of your grandparents' house, shows like  the brady bunch ,  three's company ,  family matters , and  perfect strangers  with their familiar theme songs and title sequences, once hallmarks of the sitcom form. they'r...

buzzfeed: "the good wife is the best show on television right now"









october 13, 2014









the cbs legal drama, now in its sixth season, continually shakes up its narrative foundations and proves itself fearless in the process. spoilers ahead, if you’re not up to date on the show.   at buzzfeed, you can read my latest feature, " the good wife  is the best show on television right now,"  in which i praise cbs' the good wife  and, well, hail it as the best show currently on television. (yes, you read that right.)   there is no need to be delicate here: if you’re not watching the good wife, you are missing out on the best show on television. i won’t qualify that statement in the least — i’m not talking about the best show currently airing on broadcast television or outside of cable or on premium or however you want to sandbox this remarkable show. no, the legal drama is the best thing currently airing on any channel on television.  that the good wife is this perfect in its sixth season is reason to truly celebrate. few shows embrace complexity and risk-taking in t...
