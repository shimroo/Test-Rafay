pms boobs : best natural breast enhancer?





ok, so i know that this might offend some women, or be a little on the rough side, but i've found that my breasts look their most magnificent right around the time of the month i usually dread. in other words, what is the worst time of the month for most women, those days of pms, happen to be when my boobs look their best.

they are way bigger, more pillowy and soft, and seem to have grown sometimes at least half a cup to a full cup size! my husband actually loves this time, and he can usually even tell when it's happened because on me it's quite obvious.

of course, you also get all the other headaches of pms that come with this fluctation of estrogenic hormones that also happens to make your boobs look bigger and more fabulous.  the reason they seem to get bigger is because they actually are swollen. your body is preparing for the time of the month when your hormones are changing, and therefore you can get water retention and a swelling of the breast tissue.

this can also come with breast tenderness, so they may be very sensitive to the touch, or they may even be irritated or feel very constrained by bras.  at least more so than they usually do :)

of course, pms time usually also means all the other unsavory parts of this time of month like a bloated belly, anxiety and irritability, headaches, sleeplessness, hot flashes and back aches.  it's still really no fun and in the end, is it worth the larger, more voluptuous breasts? i say nah!

fat injections for larger breasts






one of the more novel approaches to achieving larger breasts is a "technically" nonsurgical, but still somewhat invaisve method of fat transfer.  fat transfers are still somewhat in their infancy, but they have come a long way already in the few years they've been in practice.

fat transfers are when fat cells are harvested from other areas of the body, then subsequently injected into another part of the body that the patient desires to be fuller looking, or less crevaced, such as the lips or areas of the face that have lost facial fat and make you look older.  

see other suggestions for natural breast enhancement as well for some good suggestions after reading this article about fat transfers.

the common problem with fat transfers is that they often don't stay where they are supposed to. sometimes the fat actually "migrates" back to different areas of the body, creating a strange appearance where the injections were put.

in addition to the migration problem, some of the fat cells injected may not live, and so the patient may see a decrease in initial volume of the breast enhancement after some time.  

the benefits of course are that you enjoy having your very own fatty tissue as your "implant". this makes it an undetectable form of breast enhancement and a very low pain and low recovery form of breast augmentation. the cost is still pretty astronomical though, especially considering that you may need more treatments and some of the cells may not survive or may migrate.

as they perfect this treatment more and the cost comes down though, it may really be a viable option for naturally enhancing breast size that you can look in to.

breast success and other products





if you've ever been in the market for a natural breast enhancement product, then you may have heard of a product called breast success. it is an herbal breast enhancement supplement that now also includes an optional cream that can be paired with the supplement for greater benefit.

the interesting thing about this company is that they do have a lot of good reviews.  they do not seem to be "planted" as some other phony sounding reviews do. you make up your mind for yourself.  

you can first read a review of breast success and then see what people have to say on their own site about their various experiences with the natural breast enhancing product.  enjoy!

the role of estrogen in your body and breast development





estrogen is quite a precious hormone for women. even though guys have a small amount of this feminine hormone, us women have a lot more which makes us well, er - women.  we also have a small amount of the male hormone testosterone in us as well, it's just that it is minimal compared to our sex-dominant hormones.

estrogen makes women's skin softer than a man's, it causes us to develop soft, larger, feminine breasts, it makes our lips larger, and it causes us to have less muscle as well as less body hair - all traits of the female sex in the human world.  

when you take estrogen away, it can cause a lot of side effects that not only make you feel less feminine, but also that can cause mood swings and depression. this is why many women have such a hard time dealing with menopause, which is the time in a woman's life when her natural estrogen levels begin to severely decline.

many herbal supplements for breast enhancement offer what is called "phytoestrogenic" compounds, which are plant-derived compounds that mimic the hormone estrogen in the female body. this can lead to more feminine characteristics, such as softer, larger breasts, less hot flashes, and other typical side effects of again having enough estrogen in the body.

with the decline of popularity of medical hrt (hormone replacement therapy) which is the use of synthetic estrogen to get the levels back up in a woman's body, many women turn to plant based options.  hrt got a bad name when it was linked to heart and stroke issues as well as a potential boost in the likelihood of breast cancer.

breast implants feel hard?





a common complaint of women with breast implants is that there is really no consistency in how they feel. one day they may feel like they should : soft and pliable like real breasts. 

the next day they could feel as hard as rocks. often times women with breast implants even feel self conscious about hugging people because they feel like their breasts are obviously sticking out in an unnatural way that feels hard.

one way to help improve the feel of breast implants and keep them more consistently pliable and soft is to make sure you massage them daily. it is a requirement to massage them every day since you have to keep them from forming scar tissue and becoming hard. 

this massage helps to break up any scar tissue, which also makes breast implants feel hard.  even the fact that you get cold can make your breast implants feel hard. they are less likely to be hard when your body is warm.  

think of it as similar to how your muscles are when they are warmed up versus cold - they are more likely to harden and feel uncomfortable as well as get injured more easily because they are not as flexible - same thing with breast implants really.

telltale signs of fake breasts







real or fake? 

although breast implants have certainly come a long way in terms of looking natural, there are still certain telltale signs that a woman has fake breasts. even the untrained eye can tell in many cases if they just look for the physical attributes of breast implants in the chest area.

the first and most obvious sign, if you actually see the entire naked breast, is scarring.  breast implants always leave at least a faint scar, depending on the point of entry where the implants were inserted into each breast.  this scar can be under the breast, around the areola, which is the darker skin surrounding the nipple, or under the arms.

another telling sign of implants is looking at what a woman's breasts do when she lays down.  natural breasts, unless they are unusually dense tissue, or happen to be very large, will lay down when you lay down.  this means that they tend to "shrink" back into the body when it is in a lying down position.

breast implants, because they are stiffer and are not real tissue, will not retreat into the chest, and instead will stand erect when a woman lays down.  

in addition, when a woman with breast implants is hugged, often times you can feel her breasts as being a bit harder than women with natural breasts. it depends on how large their natural breasts were before she got the implants too, and how much natural "padding" she already had there.

breast that are not real also tend to look much rounder than real breasts. although round is the typical shape for women's breasts, real breasts come in a variety of shapes and sizes whereas fake breasts come in a circular form, and when implanted they tend to make the breasts take on this shape.

when they are pushed up in a bra for example, fake breasts tend to have very rounded tops. think of women who are tiny to begin with who have huge breast implants, like pamela anderson or victoria beckham (who it appears has since had her breast implants removed).  

when they would wear cleavage bearing outfits, there breasts would look like perfect orbs, a little too perfect if you know what i mean.  women with real breasts actually have more "pliable" and softer looking cleavage. it doesn't look like the skin has been stretched over a bowling ball in other words. 

you can just tell by the naked eye when breasts are too "hard" to the touch. the skin always looked a bit like it's been pulled taut, like a facelift.  

these are just some of the signs of fake breasts. i'm sure you may have seen more in your day, if so, feel free to joing the conversation and add your comments:)

how to give your breasts a natural lift





there are a lot of women who seek natural ways to give their breasts a lift rather than undergoing the surgical breast lift method, which costs just as much as a full on operation for breast implants.  

breast implants and breasts lifts run around the same, at anywhere from $5,000 to $8,000 depending on your doctor, your area and what you want done.

this is because most breast lift operations involve not only snipping and clipping and lifting the tissues of the breast to bring them back up higher, but also implanting a small implant beneath them. this is so that they "sit" on top of the implant and they look much higher and firmer than they did before the surgery.

the reason for breast lifts are many. often times, women want their breasts to go back to their pre-baby appearance after breast feeding, which often can leave the breasts with a sort of deflated appearance.

another common reason cited for breast lifts is simply age and gravity. as we women age, our breasts tend to sag more due to the simple fact that gravity takes its toll.  

also, our breasts lose tissue density with age, which means they are not as firm and not as likely to stand at attention as they used to be when we were younger. indeed, aging does pretty much stink in the breast department, just like it does for facial wrinkles!  



but rather than spend thousands of dollars on a professional, surgical breast lift, there are definitely nonsurgical options out there to firm and lift the breasts. first off, there are herbal and natural breast enlargement supplements that can help to build up tissue density again and help you regain firmness.

there are also topical breast creams that help to stimulate the tissues of the breast and make them firmer - kind of like certain firming wrinkle creams help to firm up your face and thicken your skin again like when you were younger.
but these methods should always be accompanied by breast firming and lifting exercises, which help to tone and lift the muscles that support the breast tissue.  follow the link for breast lifting exercises and you will find an array of moves that can help you get that firmness back and lose the sagginess.

hello everyone!  it's been a while since i've posted some new info for you, but i wanted to let you know there are some interesting developments in natural breast enhancement since we last spoke.  

for one, there are now fat transfer breast augmentations that may use your own fatty tissue, clone it, and then re-implant it in your breasts so you have larger breasts that are all real. it is still in its beginning stages since it uses a sort of stem cell technology, but looks promising (if not expensive) as a future more natural way to enlarge your breasts.  

there is also of course the continued success of one of my favorites in natural breast enhancement, bountiful breast, the patent pending supplement that uses a very effective technology that is not herbal in nature to help you achieve breast growth after your body is done with puberty and long past its natural breast growth stages.  

there are also still many herbal breast enhancement supplements that are on the market. some are more effective than others, and they all utilize a mixture of estrogenic herbs to achieve breast enlargement.  there are some improved formulas, such as the breast actives formula which now combines its herbal supplement with a topical cream that contains the immensely popular herb called pueraria mirifica, an herb of asian origin that women in the orient have been using for decades to help firm and enlarge their breasts.

more to come on natural breast enhancement as we continue to bring you the latest and most exciting news for women who don't want to go under the knife but rather want to enlarge their breasts the natural way.
