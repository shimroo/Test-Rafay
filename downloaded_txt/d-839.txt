welcome 



cold spring harbor laboratory is a leading international center for research and education. as part of its mission, each year cshl organizes 25-30 scientific conferences, 20 banbury center meetings and 30 advanced technical science courses, with organizers, instructors and participants from all over the world.
news: with the news from stockholm in early october '24, we added an additional four nobel prize winners to the long list of laureates who have participated in cshl meetings and courses, including the joint winners of the 2024 prize in physiology and medicine victor ambros and gary ruvkun, who have both attended many of our symposia and meetings and also lectured in our courses. we were able to celebrate the power of worms with a zoom toast with the laureates at the 2024 germ cells meeting, just two days after the announcements from stockholm. one of the two winners of the 2024 nobel prize in physics, john hopfield, has also attended multiple cshl and banbury meetings, while one of the three laureates in chemistry, david baker, participated in the 40th anniversary of the protein data bank, one of the earliest open-access public data repositories of macromolecular structures, first discussed at blackford bar during the 1971 symposium. our congratulations to all this year's laureates.
phishing scam alert: please be aware of spam email messages circulating that are not associated with cold spring harbor laboratory (cshl) but appear to offer help arranging accommodation at cshl.  the phishing scam asks for information regarding arrival and departure dates, and may include a docusign document requiring a credit card to guarantee your spot for the upcoming meeting at cshl. this is should be ignored and deleted, as should any other third party spammers who present themselves as being involved in organizing any elements of the cshl meeting, including housing or travel.
