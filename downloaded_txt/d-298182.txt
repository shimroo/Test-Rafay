learnings from life


miss you all
he called my name.
                                        from where he did stand.
                                        my eyes lit up bright.
                                        'he is a dear friend!'

even through the mask
                                        his smile was grand.
                                        my teeth, too, gaped wide,
                                        but held back my hand.
across the street, we talked.
                                        words were bland.
                                        just - 'how are you?s'!!
                                        and ran about our errand.
not long ago, we hanged,
                                        for hours on end.
                                        now, these new found restrains - 
                                        we, hardly, could suspend.
all said, corona
                                        once you leave our land
                                        'll have to learn again
                                        how to hug a friend.
