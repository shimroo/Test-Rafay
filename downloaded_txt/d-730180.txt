the north carolina psychology board was created in 1967 to carry out provisions of the north carolina psychology practice act. the board’s mission is to protect the public from the practice of psychology by unqualified persons and from unprofessional conduct by persons licensed to practice psychology. the board is comprised of seven members appointed by the governor to staggered terms of three years. at all times, three members are licensed psychologists, two members are licensed psychological associates, and two members are members of the public who are not licensed under the act.
