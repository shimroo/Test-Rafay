welcome tochi-town harley-davidson®
when asked what the harley® experience is all about, dealer george tragos sums it up in a few simple words, "it's about having fun and creating adventure." with that in mind, tragos has created a dealership environment that invites people in to experience all that chi-town has to offer - namely good times, great people, and quality products.

"everyone leads busy lives these days," says tragos, "and it's our mission to provide customers with the products and services they need and want to be a part of the experience."

in support of that mission, tragos made the leap in 2001 from a modest store in homewood, illinois to the new 39,000 square foot full sales and service facility known as chi-town harley-davidson® in tinley park, illinois. best described as "chicago's southside dealer," the tinley park location is uniquely positioned to serve both urban and rural customers.

the facility provides plenty of room for the impressive selection of new and premium pre-owned motorcycles and the large product offering of apparel, general merchandise, and motor parts and accessories.
