more than a museum
from our museum in portland to our desert and coastal camps to our online learning modules—omsi is spreading steam education across the northwest. 

we believe our collective potential can be unlocked when curiosity, learning, and community unite. our differences are what make us amazing, and we celebrate those who dare to question: the explorers, the tinkerers, the storytellers, and the innovators. welcome to omsi.



 






upcoming events
from science pubs to omsi after darks, find the perfect steam-filled event for you!
