testimonials... 




i am incredibly thankful to the alachua business league for awarding me the entrepreneur scholarship for 2023. their generous support has been a true blessing in my life, allowing me to open my dream storefront boutique right on alachua's main street shortly after winning the scholarship. the opportunity to create a space where i can share my passion with the community has been nothing short of amazing! 

balancing my responsibilities as a boutique owner and a college student pursuing a nursing degree has been challenging, but the scholarship has made a significant difference. it covered many of my college classes, enabling me to allocate more of my personal funds toward the boutique. this financial relief has not only allowed me to focus on my studies and business but has also given me the confidence and resources to grow and succeed in both areas.

the support from the alachua business league has been a pivotal moment in my journey, and i am deeply grateful for their belief in my potential. their generosity has allowed me to pursue my dreams without the overwhelming financial burden that often accompanies students my age.

as i reflect on this incredible opportunity, i am reminded of the bible verse, jeremiah 29:11: "for i know the plans i have for you," declares the lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future." this verse perfectly encapsulates the hope and future that the scholarship has provided me. 

thank you, alachua business league, for your unwavering support and for helping me turn my dreams into reality.
