important information
before renting a limousine service, be advised that in this industry, most limousine companies lie about the size and year of their vehicles. in addition, some are not legal, carrying the proper insurance and most importantly, qualifying their drivers to make sure they are background checked, drug and alcohol tested and have a clean driving record.  remember, you are entrusting your and your friends’ lives with someone you don’t know.  instead of just getting a price quote, and  comparing  “apples with apples,” your first step would be to read our “mission statement”. this will teach you how to check out a company and not get scammed in this industry. secondly, we would like to speak to you, because it would be a lot more efficient and personal in explaining our services. our phone hours are 9a-9p everyday.  lastly, and most importantly, you should go and see the vehicle you are considering renting.  if a limousine company has spent thousands, if not millions of dollars on their fleet like we have, and doesn’t invite you to their office, that should raise a red flag.
our showroom hours are sunday-thursday, 9a-9p; directions are on this website.  please call before coming out to see us!
