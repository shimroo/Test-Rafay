i am nfda





while in d.c. for the advocacy summit, we took the opportunity to talk with nfda members to learn about the importance of advocating for the brave act and the consensual donation & research integrity act.

















while in d.c., we spoke with nfda members about their experience meeting with members of congress.

















“i was delighted to learn about the new gm competitive assistance program for nfda members. we were about to trade for a new 2020 suburban to add to our fleet and this discount saved us substantially! it was easy too; i just downloaded the form from the nfda website and presented it to my dealer to enjoy the savings. thank you to nfda for being our professional partner and lobbying for the interest of our members. well done!”
kenneth r. howe, cfsp
holman-howe funeral home | lebanon, mo












“nfda is the only funeral service organization with a full-time lobbyist watching out for our interests in washington d.c. your support enables your advocacy team to act promptly and positively for nfda members and all of funeral service.”
robert "bob" t. arrington, cco
former nfda advocacy chair
