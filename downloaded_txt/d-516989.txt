oh trusty <ul> tag. i like it so much because it mimicks how i talk. here we go: i went snowboarding for the first time in whistler, bc, where the 2010 olympics will be, and planted my ass firmly and repeatedly in that famous snow. the following weekend i went again in america, and with home field advantage, i learned how to link my turns. as it turns out, snow can be good for something. but it's nice that it's all gone by the time we get back home.  after being rejected by amazon, ben got a job with google. they're going to pay him more money and he'll live and work in zurich. i'm all, "i'm sure switzerland's great and all, but can you snowboard there?" a european vacation is sounding pretty good for late 2007. since my crew is about to scatter (which actually brings foul andy to my hill) there's an excessive spring break trip planned for cabo san lucas. i've been saving for mexico for nine months, so technically this is a planned expense. new apartment. moving day is saturday. since real mail spammers don't harvest addresses from the internet, here's my new address: 105 harvard ave e apt a1, seattle, wa 98102. i am moving roughly two blocks. probably the least significant move of my entire life. still seeing the girl from the last post. she's independent and doesn't cause problems, but she puts up with me when i show neither of those qualities. she doesn't talk much, so i'm learning how to dominate conversations. girl friends get frustrated that i don't say much about her. even my mom thinks it's strange i don't mention her. but the truth is (and i believe the internet reflects this) all my girl stories are bad for the girl. the exceptions are those stories that take place entirely within the confines of sex and do not involve me actually saying anything. i'm living a good engineer's life. last week i made some repairs and cooling upgrades to my computer, the one that's so loud sometimes i can't sleep with it on. the engineer part? the repair involved electrical tape and soldered paperclips, and the upgrade require a spring clip made from a coat hanger. it's probably true that my great engineering superpower is not building great things but getting damn near anything to run. if we lived in a time before the internet, before steel and modern construction, you can bet i'm not the ambitious go-getter who would have invented the shuttlecock. people like me stood in the back and said "i agree it's an interesting proof of concept, but for the price of your horseless carriage, i could just as easily buy four more horses."  yo voy! i'm going to bed. two more nights before the move. i'm fucked.

	 cash moves everything around me
	 
    


haven't blogged in awhile, don't have funny stories. if you like funny, just skip this shit.i bought a bed worth two months' rent and immediately switched back to sleeping flat on my back. all this time i thought i was sleeping on my stomach out of insecurity. no, turns out i needed a new mattress. gave the old bed to my new neighbor, who just moved into old crazy's apartment, which meant i didn't have to pay to have it taken away, and i made a new friend who feels like he's eternally indebted to me for my shitty old mattress. hey, turns out it's really easy to make friends when you're rich. who knew?aeon flux was total shit. there's some twirling, some one-piece futuristic costumes and sets, and a story...where do i start with the story? someone bought the rights to the characters and set them in a completely random story with literally zero similarity to any story that ever appeared in the original series. i never thought i'd ask this, but why couldn't this movie be more like beavis and butthead do america?speaking of doing america, big ups to ed and pals as they do new orleans again. pour some yankee money into flood town and blow some shit up. i'm gonna do it urban and cold this year, but hopefully i can still get a black eye out of the night.speaking of falling in love, i narrowly escaped a brush with a relationship this week. man, that was a close call! can you imagine? me being all lame and not going out because i'm too busy having sex? good thing she just got out of a relationship because really, i don't need the complications. or some chick throwing her perfect body at me all the time, like what am i gonna do with that? do you know how awkward it is when i'm trying to have a conversation and i put my arm around your waist and i accidentally stop speaking? call me when you've got a little beer belly, ok sugar?or how about you call me when you're ready to date somebody again. i'm not going anywhere. k, i'm out, pool with the boys. let's. get. krunk.

	 some beach
	 
    


seventy percent of the world's population lives within a hundred miles of the ocean. that means most people are a couple hours' drive from the beach. forty-five percent of valencians (the city, not the region. the region can fuck itself) go to the beach once a month or more. even if you have to work all week, on saturday you just grab a towel and bus it down to the beach. even though their sand is kind of smelly and dirty, it works the same way all over the world: you lay down for an hour, then you get too hot so you get in the water, put more sunscreen on (unless you're brown or black, you lucky thing) and do it all again.fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck i hate winter. even in seattle, where it's not so bad. best skiing on the continent, sure, great. but please let's be honest with ourselves. beaches are better than mountains. california is better than washington and everybody knows it. too many people in california? that's because it's great there! chicago, seriously, that's not a real beach, but way to make do with what you have.my aunt sharon bought a plane ticket to tampa when she was my age and just didn't get on the plane home. she sent for her things and married a pilot. she's picked up a barely noticeable cuban accent from twenty-five years of teaching in florida schools.in conclusion, i like the beach.-phillip

muchachos y muchachas:i'm coming back for christmas. i'll be in springfield about 9:00 on the 23rd, and i have to be back at o'hare by the morning of the 29th. which means probably no stop in champaign. that means somebody in springfield has to have sex with me. i'm 6'1, rich, sexxy, disease free, and i swear to god i'll be driving a van with a wheelchair lift in it. you heard right! i have a van!here's a bit of trivia you'll probably enjoy: i haven't had sex in sangamon county since 2002.so let's make it happen! i mean it. this can be my christmas present from the town. designate one girl to take one for the team, and the whole town gets by with not buying me a present. it's like sacrificing a virgin so i spare your town for another year. fear godphilla, king of monsters!

something keeps reminding me of the hippie who stole matt's power drill in the spring.i've started carrying treats in my pocket because i'm sick of city dogs being unimpressed by me.i smoked out a 75-year-old man named ed. twice. he always carries a pipe and a doctor's note saying it's for his glaucoma.sam's coming to visit a week from tomorrow, and he's requested that i not take him to bars. melissa thinks he and his girl probably already had a conversation about it.i don't know what i'm trying to pull here, i can't write. i'm furious and i hate this city sometimes.

	 poor guy
	 
    


i told christine a story last night and she asked me if it was true. "i know you like to embellish," she said. but she only knows that because i tell her so, not because she ever caught me doing it. tonight's story is true only in the sense that i tell it as i experienced it, and you would be justified in suspecting that the rest is entirely false.tommy is my neighbor, which lately only increases our difficulties. i don't dare tell him when we really first met, or that i still have his skull. it's not my style really. sure i like skulls and all, but this one's all electric acid trip, and he printed it out on his inkjet. if the original is a watercolor like he says, tommy has a gift. a real gift with skulls. and demons, and s&m chicks, and hearts and flames, but that's pretty much it. he told me what separates himself from da vinci, really, is not drawing ability, but imagination. if da vinci had been limited to skulls and tits, he'd have done tattoos too.but that was way back in august, when it was still warm out. he's wearing long sleeves now, otherwise i'd recognize him. maybe not by the skulls covering his arms, but by the hepatitis sores covering the skulls. i don't know how tommy got hepatitis, but i think i can explain why he's having a hard time establishing a client base in seattle. maybe he should try chicago. the sores might give him good cred out there. seattle isn't interested in street cred. maybe i'll suggest chicago. one thing's for sure, tommy needs to get out of seattle."we need to talk." i said ok, and i put down my book and followed him out to the balcony. i didn't remember him, but here i was treating him with the same indifferent neutrality as before. that's just how i am with strangers these days. if you stop me on the street i'll give you a cigarette and five minutes of undivided attention. he looked sketchy, so odds are decent he wants money, or he has something crazy to say, or...well something tells me he's a neighbor and he seems uncomfortable like he doesn't want to talk to me, so maybe it's about noise or some other neighborly complaint. "i need to know if you're tapping my phone, cause if you are just tell me." relief hits me. if this had been about my music, i'm sure we would have had an awkward argument and then we'd be weird around each other in the halls or out on the street. but i'm completely innocent of any phone-tapping, so i have the luxury of being completely honest in this conversation. i don't even have a phone. the previous occupant spliced cable into my apartment, but i don't hook it up to my tv, and my internet is shared wirelessly with my neighbor. i wonder if the cable has something to do with this. i heard the splicing was causing my downstairs neighbor to not get his hbo. "oh, are you in 203, the one with the fucked up hbo?" he is. well, this gets even easier. i can fully appreciate his situation, since i don't get hbo either. "well the guy who stole the cable could easily have spliced the phone line too. you should bug the landlord to get the whole damn thing fixed." he agrees. we both know no amount of hounding will get these things fixed. satisfied, i'm ready to go back to my dinner and my book, but tommy is still upset. "i told l___ about this and he's like, 'you're crazy tommy, nobody's bugging your phone. and then i dumped out this pile of microphones i pulled from the lights, and he still says 'what you want me to do? this doesn't prove anything. so, like, i don't even know what to think. i don't feel safe here. my intercom has been rewired into a microphone. fucking microphones everywhere, and the phone wires are goin straight to your apartment. i made l___ show me the wires in the basement, and it said '303'. so, like, i hate to ask you, you seem like a normal guy and all, but can i take a look, just to see?"well tommy is more than justifying the time i'm spending with him. "of course you can!" and i was better than my word. i gave him the grand tour. we looked at the wires to my intercom. i showed him the phone jacks i knew about. i showed him behind the entertainment center and the desk, to prove nothing was hooked up to anything besides a socket. we looked in the kitchen, in my living room closet, everywhere. i'm delighted, because i have nothing to hide. when tommy sees the weed on my desk, he even cracks a joke. "well, i guess you're not a cop." it's not really a joke. the weed is strong evidence that i'm not a cop, and he seems to feel a little better. he explains how he found microphones in the lights. he shows me the extra wire running to my intercom, disconnected for now, but there, just in case. i am incredulous, but polite. he shows me where he pulled out some sort of phone line in the hallway. my intercom hasn't worked for a while.when i took my garbage to the dumpsters behind the building later, tommy was at the door when i came back in. i gave a friendly "hey." he's probably not even the tenth person to see the inside of my apartment, and i think that qualifies us as friends. "man, everywhere i go, there you are. like you're following me." i give a dumb laugh, because it was a dumb joke. he gets mad. i get mad back when i realize he was serious. i'm covering up a faint sense of relief. there's a possibility this guy could be a problem. but he doesn't make dumb jokes, and i like that. after assuring tommy a second time that i'm not a cop, he gets over the initial shock of seeing me again so randomly. he tells me about the manager, the neighbors, what he hears, what he knows, what he suspects. i get so much dirt. in the end he advises me not to have lots of friends over and not to do lots of drugs. this place isn't right, he says. just watch your ass.when the pigeons land on my windowsil to get out of the rain i act like it's the most natural thing in the world, trying to buy time to get my camera before they get spooked. i just nod and thank tommy for the advice. he's my new favorite neighbor, and i don't want him to get spooked.

	 dear blog
	 
    


i have a desk now! and all my clothes came! including $0.65 kona gold tshirt from san francisco channahon peewee football league tshirt that some girl thought was great on unofficial this year until i admitted to buying it in a thrift store, at which point she rolled her eyes and said "oh god, whatever". i'm not bitter, and i hope she fulfills her dream of fucking a genuine peewee football player. ten white tshirts. welcome to the return of laser guns, a big fonzie 'eyyyy', and not looking like a homo nike warmups that a bird crapped on the day i brought them back to illinois i just went back and looked at the pile to remember what else some oversized tshirts and love-making boxers (one pair has metallic red license plates sporting phrases like 4 a hug and kiss me. the state? state of love. oh, seriously.) thank you, high school. ten dollars from my dad to cover the cost of picking up the boxes at the ups store. it melts my heart because we both know how unnecessary it is pot holders. my parents have taken to sending me everything they don't want from their kitchen. my mom admitted once to giving me things she knew she'd have to replace, so she could justify buying new ones. i will have to ask them to please stop sending me old kitchen items, as i'm now forced to use the same box they shipped my care package in to take half of it down the hill to goodwill our game: a history of baseball. and a book on mutual funds by john bogle. these will be sold. still no sign of my prized hundred-year-old sexual psychology book, or its outlandish appendix b, a scandalous letter by ben franklin which i did not make up. when i tell you the story though, you become one of probably no more than a hundred people in the world who know that ben franklin once encouraged a young man to put baskets over old women's heads and fuck them. a stack of cds from my dear departed trunks. these will be chucked at poor people after my ipod arrives this weekend. packing peanuts. because i needed more ground into my carpet. more journal articles from grad school. sometimes i burn them a little before throwing them away. bet me i don't. climbing chalk. "white gold" brand. i thought it was a clueless name until i saw the tagline: "the first high is always free". i don't know which sucks more, natural high people or coke heads. there's some kind of suck/blow joke in there somewhere. bonus points if you figure out how to make it work. and the anti-diarrheal tablets dad insisted i buy for spain. he worries about me when i travel. i guess the image of me robbed, lost, hurt, unable to get home, and shitting my pants was too much to bear.  the rest is a snippet of a conversation with british matt, who is funnier than everyone else i know put together:"so, i just went to the amazon talk. there were a couple of quite clearly non-tech girls there. you should've come and been all like 'yeah, it's pretty good i guess. i mean its a job, right?' then we coulda got on the piss."

	 struck dumb...here's a quote
	 
    


it was shortly after the british red cross arrived, though it may have no connection, that a very large quantity of lipstick arrived. this was not at all what we men wanted, we were screaming for hundreds and thousands of other things and i don't know who asked for lipstick. i wish so much that i could discover who did it, it was the action of genius, sheer unadulterated brilliance. i believe nothing did more for these internees than the lipstick. women lay in bed with no sheets and no nightie but with scarlet red lips, you saw them wandering about with nothing but a blanket over their shoulders, but with scarlet red lips. i saw a woman dead on the post mortem table and clutched in her hand was a piece of lipstick. at last someone had done something to make them individuals again, they were someone, no longer merely the number tatooed on the arm. at last they could take an interest in their appearance. that lipstick started to give them back their humanity.-lt. col. mervin willett gonin dso(and that dickhead banksy's manifesto)

this is my five-year plan: work travel ??? ??? profit  i'd like to thank south park for the business advice.this weekend i bought six books: some toni morrison book from 1998 a book justifying the spanish empire narrative of the life of frederick douglas the bluest eye an alice walker collection, including the color purple, meridian, and some short stories and an old bound copy of gulliver's travels  treasures! i paid $11. matt bought a tv. $800. he said "with all that money you're spending on books you could buy yourself a tv." i already have a tv. i watched black cat, white cat on it tonight and it made me want to be in love. but i am going to need a bigger bookshelf. somehow i bought a second copy of sula and an old abridged copy of black boy, before the part about communists was restored. they'll make good presents, or i can sell them. ooh, that's how i'll make space! sell all those old logic textbooks! logic, as you might have guessed, has no place in the five year plan.

i started emptying the scraps of paper out of my bag left over from vacation, cause there were a few people from the northwest i wanna get in touch with. i look at most of the names and think "aw, i remember this one. we sure had fun. i should write more emails." but there's two names in there written on the back of a crêperie i never went to (so it could be literally any crêperie) and i don't recognize either of them. but one of them lists a website, and it turns out he's a musician in seattle. cool, right? i almost wrote him until i found his photos page. you should check it out yourself, because it contains the sissiest image ever recorded by man. top-left, take a look. yes, that's a rainbow on his cheek, and you're right, it is streaked with tears. i seriously don't recognize this guy, and i don't know what i was doing hanging out with such a total pussy.

holy shit i just found out all the photos i wanted from granada and toledo were already on my computer. i just couldn't see them before. pictures are so important to remembering experiences, and i feel like i've just recovered one of the best weeks of my life. there's one of me posing with a pair of quebecoise. lemme see if i can make blogger put it up. ok, it's up. you should see it below this post. nice, eh? they're very pretty, as well as intelligent, independent, and open-minded. and we got to hang out for one night in granada. you can just sense that some people are good for you. and you can't stop to think about what great friends you could have been if only you had more than just one night because there are too many people, and if you're moving fast enough to see good ones like this, you're moving too fast to keep them around and i think that's the hardest part about traveling. the hardest part is opening yourself up to one person after another and having to leave them all, and there's no question of whether you'll see them again because you won't, so you don't say anything about how the situation makes you feel because we all know how poor we are in time. if someone brings it up, it just hangs in the air and makes everyone uncomfortable, because we were trying not to think about it so you do the only polite thing and take a picture and you all smile how you want to be remembered, not how you feel at the time because all you feel is rushed and sad but you can tell how we feel anyway. it's in the existence of the picture, not in its content. it's how late we were and how we were running to the bus station already, and how we totally forgot or ignored all that when we saw them sitting here and threw off our packs and took a picture.there was a nice group of us in barcelona that had to break up because ilonka and june had to go home to holland, and ollie and i walked them to their bus stop and helped them carry their bags, and they really wanted mcdonalds before they left, and ollie bitched about it to no end (for good reason) and he was extra bitter-sounding because he's british. and ilonka told him he was going to miss them, and of course he denied it and she said "if you weren't going to miss us, then why walk us to the bus stop and eat shitty food with us instead of getting decent food and going to the beach?" and ollie couldn't say anything he just got a sheepish look on his face and that's how we all knew he was going to miss them.sorry if you wanted to say goodbye to me and i didn't give you the chance. please don't take offense. i've just had to say a few too many goodbyes lately.

	 fuck the south
	 
    


read fuckthesouth.com and come back when you finish. i'll give you a minute.ok, what did you think? tell me if you get the chance, but here's my reaction. this guy really got me mad.i'd ignore the site entirely if this wasn't exactly the kind of attitude i get from suburban chicago kids who pass blanket judgments on everyone south of i-80. george bush is aesthetically a texan, but his politics are northeastern old money. the faceless multinational nasties, war-mongering carpetbaggers, and blissfully unaware consumers who support them from the safety of their suvs are mostly concentrated in the northeast (and chicago). (and california). my point is this: no, i don't think you can blame religious conservatives in the red states for "what's wrong with this country." the american animal is way more complex than that.you know what i like about the america i see today? i like that it's becoming latin. and it's happening independently from and in some cases in spite of what's going on in the national consciousness. i like that we helped make mexicans so poor, and they're responding by showing up on our doorstep.i'm self-conscious to post something that makes it obvious what i've been reading and who i've been speaking to, but here it is and it's honest.

i'm out here now. seattle. my weeklong tour of the country was great. spent a final two days with matt and ben (my champaign boys) and roy and andy (my chicago boys) and christine (my girl, through it all) in chicago. matt and i met up with his little sister louise and spent four days in san diego. hell of a town. we almost went to mexico for a night, but that's fine, because by god i'm going next year and who knows for how long. louise is a nice girl, less crazy than her stupid brother but just as fun and definitely better looking in a bikini. i got one night with jessica and bonk in la and was made to realize that the more i travel (or is it simply the more i experience?), the more important old friends become. and now i'm here. rental car, temporary apartment, one week until work starts. i'll keep living out of a backpack for as long as it takes, but the big bed is mine for a month. i have my own kitchen. closets. free internet, laundry. i haven't been this alone in nearly four months. tomorrow is the fourth of july. i'll probably check into the hostel down the street and make some friends to drink and blow shit up with. have you ever seen a truer sign of addiction to human contact? something about it isn't right. maybe something about avoiding myself. some sort of insecurity maybe, maybe the same thing that makes me dislike sleeping alone. on the other hand, i'm happy for the opportunity to get some writing done finally.

my time in spain was incredible. the most memorable month of my life. and my life is going to go a lot differently now because of it. but i can tell you about that later. the most important thing for me to do in these precious first few days back is to record what happened. i've been telling my stories over and over, and now they're ready to be written down. let's start with one of my favorite barcelona stories: the night i slept in the street. this story is good because it sets up a much better story for later.so i'd found a group of really chill kids in barcelona and was getting together with them for sight seeing, drinking, eating, everything. but our circumstances were not good. we were being big tourists, hanging out at one of barcelona's sketchier tourist traps, a place called travel bar. travel bar organizes a pub crawl literally every three nights. if you sign up early, you go for 10 euros (how do you do a euro symbol on a us keyboard?). most people pay 15 though. for 10, you don't do too badly. for 15, you're getting ripped off. 100 people go, they buy overpriced drinks at all the bars, and travel bar gets kickbacks from the bars in addition to the price of your ticket. so we knew it was a scam, but it's a huge party and everyone everyone gets some.the night ended at a club in barceloneta (on the waterfront, 20-minute walk from our hostels), and i had my first non-white makeout: an asian girl who was probably american because i know her friends were. that part of the story is fun, but it's not the important part. the problem was that the club started clearing out at 3:30. my hostel was locked from 3 to 7. fuck! i thought we were gonna be out until dawn and go to the beach for a while. nope! but an irish guy named mike offered to stay out with me as long as i wanted, despite the fact that he was with his new girl, a badass chick from portland named malaika. we must have walked for an hour and a half, but eventually romance took its toll and they had to leave. i understand. they only had three or four days together and they were mad for each other, and this might have been the one night they ever got to spend together. so we split up and agreed to meet the next morning. i had to find somewhere safe to hang out for two hours. and if you've ever been to barcelona, you know that being a drunk tourist there at 5am just isn't safe. i turned my black tshirt inside out to hide the english words written on it, pulled out my knife to feel mean, and started literally stalking through the alleys, staring at everyone i saw, trying to give them the impression that robbing me wouldn't be easy. i had two hours to look tough before i could sleep.but that's a tough place. the nigerian hookers mob you and a dozen hands grope you trying to pick your pockets. you won't even see the purse snatchers. the very fact that you're alone and on the street makes you a target. two hours is a long time. i had to find a safe place without people. and i found one. the one perfect place in barcelona: a small plaza with a church and a history museum. clean, with a couple stoops in the shadows, and the best part: only one entrance. i checked all the shadows for other sleepers and found none. i put my head on my knees, my back to the wall, and slept on and off until dawn. the next day found me pretty tired. i went back to the hostel about 7:30 and crashed for a few hours, then met up with my friends to go to a museum. if i can find a way to post pictures easily, i'll show you some from that following day.i was happy to have made it through the night safely, but when i saw mike and malaika the next day, i felt so lucky. on their one romantic night alone, their first chance to be together with no one else around, they got mugged. less than five minutes after we split up, and junkie pushed mike, smashed a wine bottle, and held it to his chest. he only spoke enough english to say "money". but mike didn't have any. the guy was shaking, because he knew he only had a few seconds before someone else came by. mike showed him his empty wallet, and the junkie was satisfied that he didn't have any. but noticing a camera strap hanging from mike's pocket, he settled for that. "camera". the exchange was done. the junkie ran away. he never went after malaika or her bag. just a camera. he could sell it on the streets or at a pawn shop for maybe 20 or 30 euros and that would be food and a fix for the day.they say you can buy anything on the streets in those two hours before dawn. but how do you buy from a guy who'd rather just stab you for your money than give you a camera for it? maybe it's better to get your camera from best buy. or steal it from someone a little less dangerous. maybe a tourist.

i miss writing. i have a stack of postcards i bought in barcelona and haven´t written a single one. spain is amazing. three weeks is not enough time. there are people out here spending years travelling around the world, and i´m spending a piddling three weeks in three or four cities in spain. it´s reaching the point where i´ve met too many incredible people and become overwhelmed. i´m struck by the unfairness of having to meet them all for two days and then leave them forever. the problem is that i´m getting a new appreciation for how large the world is, and now my mind needs to expand to take it all in.somehow my trip to japan made me see how large the world was and scared me, making me appreciate where i came from a bit more. but here, i can live. there´s a whole world of people out here too big for one place. i can´t let myself get settled in seattle. don´t be surprised if i stay there one year and move on. more to come later. it´s my last night in valéncia.
