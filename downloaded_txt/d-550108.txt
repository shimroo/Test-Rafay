welcome to the first congregational church of san francisco              (ucc & doc)
we are moving!we are in the process of selling our beloved building on polk street. though we are selling our building, our congregation will continue to worship and serve in our dear city! we are celebrating our 175th birthday this summer and look forward to many more years of ministry in san francisco. there has been a delay in the closing of the sale of our building so for the next few weeks we will continue to worship in our building. here is the schedule of our services:sundays, 11am @ 1300 polk street, san franciscoa little bit about us: first congregational church of san francisco (fccsf) is an inclusive community of faith in the heart of the city–where lower nob hill meets the tenderloin and little saigon. we believe that spirituality and faith are less about fear and control, and more about connection, compassion, hope and love.we are an open and affirming congregation. what does that mean? it means that we believe in the sacred worth of every human being! we celebrate, affirm, empower, honor and welcome the glorious diversity of lived experience, gender identities, sexual orientations, cultures, abilities, ethnicities and ages of humanity! everyone is welcome to participate in communion, leadership, membership and worship!this is why our community life is integral to our life of faith: some call it radical hospitality, we just do our best to practice it.   we believe that being connected to community is essential to quality of life–people who know you for your whole self, and continue to care for you in times both good and bad.  it may be that we can provide a place where you can have an impact on your life and the lives of others.we are a member of two progressive denominations: united church of christ and the christian church (disciples of christ). whoever you are, wherever you are on life’s journey, you are welcome here!
