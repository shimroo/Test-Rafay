hockey goon
the most effective hockey enforcers, fighters and goons of all time





hockey goon - introduction
toughness and grit are long sought after traits in professional hockey players. but there is a line in the sand where these sought 
after characteristics and goonery. fighting is a controversial though common aspect of ice hockey. the game is well known for 
its own form of on-ice vigilante justice and the men who enforce the law - the hockey goons. also known as 
enforcers, toughguys, pugilists and fighters, these players often play the game for their one on one matchups rather than the 
usual hockey strategies.


the hockey enforcers are typically players of less than star capabilities who generally play on the third or fourth line and see 
very limited ice team. they often act as protection for star players and typically face off against the opposing team's enforcers.


over the history of the hockey, thousands of players have made the national hockey league on the basis of their toughness. they 
have performed at various levels and some have been more effective as others. this website looks back at some of these great 
hockey goons and uses basic statistics to create a list of the best tough guys.


behind the numbers
the basis of this statistical analysis is to evaluate the fighters at what they do best - fight and take penalties. so we started 
off by penalizing these players for what is not their core competency - goals and assists. the formula we came up with is as follows:

(-1 x goals x 10) + (-1 x assist x 5) + (penalty minutes) / career games


the only requirement is that the player have atlest 1,500 career nhl penalty minutes.
