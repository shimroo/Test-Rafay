here at adirondack stone works, we craft natural bluestone pet memorials and pet grave markers. we are not a reseller of stones. we make everything that we sell. this is why we are able to make our stones so affordable and are able to get them to you so fast, in about a week from when you place your order. although we do mostly dog memorial stones and cat memorials, in the past we've done memorials for rabbits, horses, chickens, donkeys, hamsters and ferrets.


dear pellani family,
i received the stones for my beloved cats today and would like to tell you how happy i am.
the quality of material is undeniable and your craftsmanship is exceptional.
blake's custom paw prints make me smile. i am very grateful for the extra time and effort you spent to make this
happen.
i could sense your professionalism and integrity through your emails. this whole experience with you has been
a pleasure and these stones give me a sense of peace and serenity at this very difficult time. thank u very much.

good afternoon,
we received our two pet memorial stones yesterday. as sad as we were to order these stones, we were extremely pleased with the prompt order processing and delivery. above all the quality and appearance of the stones is just beautiful. it’s a pleasure to deal with a company that takes pride in their product and i just wanted to express my appreciation. we now have two beautiful reminders of our cherished family pets. thank-you.
sincerely,
carolyn
