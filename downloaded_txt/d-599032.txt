a replyi've never slept on a sleep number mattress before. however, all the rooms in this hotel have them and i've decided that i'm buying one each for the white house and the house in manchester. jed has long complained that the matress is too soft, but this way we can have the best of both worlds. why didn't i think of this sooner?you know, i've just had nother thought. why doesn't harvard make life easier and schedule both the college and medical school board meetings on the same day? i was just here for a meeting and i'm back again.

a replyi'm in manchester right now, as i'm sure the majority of you know, since it's your jobs to know my and my family's whereabouts most of the time. easter was nice. it was nice to be home. dinner was surprisingly uneventful, we got through it without any arguments and without any national emergencies. it was lonely without ellie though. i know that the work she is doing means a lot to her and as a doctor and a woman, what she's doing is remarkable and important. but as a mother, i miss my daughter immensely. zoey looks extremely tired, for a few moments there i thought she was going to fall asleep sitting in the dining chair. she's so busy with school-that's why she's so tired. i stopped to say hello to charlie the other day and he looks just as exhausted. these kids-they need to rest and breathe for a moment. elizabeth is fine, she looked well. josiah is getting so big, maybe when we're done with the white house i'll be a full time grandma, and just watch him all day. annie looks good, happy. i'm glad that whole ordeal is behind us, to think what could have happened-we could have lost her.jed actually managed to convince leo to join us today, and it was very nice. mallory is away and he needs to spend more time with the people who love him and not just sit in his office. of course, he flew back to washington tonight, you can't convince him to stay away for too long. jed's flying back in the morning and i'll be back on tuesday. i'm addressing the women voters of new hampshire's conference tomorrow and i have a board meeting at harvard medical school. well, jed and zoey just walked by the door to my office on their way to the den, and judging by the look of horror my daughter gave me, i think it's dr. bartlet to the rescue. that's all zoey needs, as tired as she is, a 3 hour lecture on the origin of the brussel sprout.

a reply[private]ellie's been accepted to doctors without borders. i'm happy for her because this opportunity is tremendous and will allow her to be the person she truly is. i know she's never liked the attention at being the daughter of the president and this will get her out of the country and take some of the annoyance away.i'll miss her though. it's been nice to have my daughters relatively close and now it's going to be different with ellie far away. she's coming for dinner tonight. jed doesn't know yet, let's hope he doesn't flip out or anything.[private]

a replyi'm sitting in my suite at the hotel in san francisco.  i really forgot how beautiful this city is. i had a meeting today with the california league of women voters. it was very informational and let me honestly converse with these women who see public service as so important. our country has so many problems and there's so much we could do to fix those problems.  we have a little over 365 days left in office and we need to make it count. we need to get serious about healthcare and social security and all of the programs that are going to keep our country safe and prosperous after our time here is done.
