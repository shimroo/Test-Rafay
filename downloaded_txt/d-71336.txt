welcome to stavanger, norway. in 2025, stavanger is celebrating the city's and the cathedral's 900th anniversary. 
in addition to the cathedral you will find cozy, 
old fashioned cobble stone roads, the colorful street ("fargegaten"), cruise boats that dock in the middle of town and festivals including food (happy food), music, comedy and sports. stavanger is the energy capital of norway and the gateway to fjords, pulpit rock and kjerag. stavanger has a lot to offer.
 


stavanger is the gateway to the norwegian fjords. one of the most popular attractions is pulpit rock around 350,000 people hike to this cliff, 600 meters above sea level - annually.
 
in stavanger you will also find our cathedral from 1150 ad and the charming old city, consisting mainly of small, white wooden houses.
 
if you are into more modern culture, may we suggest you try some of our restaurants and coffee shops, the petroleum museum or maybe even search for our modern street art. 
 
"fargegaten", the colorful street, is a must where old wooden houses have been painted with bright colors. here you will find cafes, a hairdresser and small boutiques.


if you are looking for a playground for the children, try the geopark right next door to the petroleum museum.
