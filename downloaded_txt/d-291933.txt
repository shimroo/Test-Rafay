pumpouts

regular maintenance is essential to keep a septic system working correctly. the septic tank needs to be pumped out every three to five years to remove the accumulated sludge and scum layers. this prevents the tank from becoming too full and overflowing into the drain field, which can cause significant damage to the system and the surrounding environment. neglecting maintenance can lead to system failure, which is costly to repair and can pose health hazards.
