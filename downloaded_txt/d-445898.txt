    the center for american war letters



the center for american war letters (cawl) is a unique and extensive manuscript collection of war letters from every american conflict, beginning with handwritten missives composed during the revolutionary war and continuing up to emails sent from iraq and afghanistan. these personal war-related correspondences are a vital record of the collective memory of the american people, as witnessed and articulated by service members, veterans, and their loved ones, who experienced these wars firsthand.
the center for american war letters is committed to the ongoing collection, preservation, and promotion of these incomparable records of the american experience through various projects and media, including:

the production of plays and live readings throughout the united states
documentaries and video recordings of troops, veterans, and their families telling their stories in their own voices and/or reading their letters
traveling exhibits
articles and books that incorporate the letters
educational guides to assist teachers and community leaders with the interpretation of these primary sources in the classroom
additional materials that will encourage americans to recognize the extraordinary historical, cultural, and literary value of these irreplaceable documents

ultimately, the center will work to expand its collection and strive to become the nation’s largest and most preeminent archive of personal wartime correspondences. the center for american war letters is directed by andrew carroll.
