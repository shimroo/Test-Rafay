full-time television analyst and part-time nascar driver parker kligerman says he will appeal his disqualification that cost him the truck series win at daytona. parker claimed the checkered flag for the season opener and promptly planted it in the grass by the track logo. kligerman called it the “biggest win of my entire life” in a raucous postrace celebration. but it was a short party: nascar disqualified kligerman when his truck was found to be too low in a postrace inspection. corey heim was declared the new winner, and the adjustment to the standings gave actor frankie muniz his first career top-10 finish. read morenascar disqualifies kligerman for too-low truck after flag-planting win at daytona. he is appealing

kyle larson will try to snap a 0-for-11 skid in the daytona 500, and the associated press will be embedded with his no. 5 hendrick motorsports team. daytona has never been good to larson despite three poles. he is actually 0 for 21 in the cup series with nine did not finishes, and his daytona national series debut was terrible: larson flew into the fence on the final lap of the 2013 xfinity series race and demolished his car. but larson has started this year on a hot streak with wins in sprint cars in australia, the chili bowl, and his first gator trophy at volusia speedway park’s annual dirtcar nationals last week before he shifted into daytona 500 preparations. read morenascar star kyle larson is on a tear in 2025. can he keep it going with a daytona 500 win?
