supreme court rule 122a allows certain nonlawyer stakeholders to efile documents. if a court is operating on odyssey, stakeholders can efile in that court. if a court is operating on fullcourt, stakeholders will not be able to efile until the court transitions to odyssey. nonlawyer stakeholders can ask oja for a username and password to efile. registration information is on the judicial branch website.sheriffs should efile documents such as returns on summonses, subpoenas, orders to appear, contempt citations, state tax warrants, arrest, and bench warrant returns. they should not efile citations. they cannot efile a bond sheet or search warrant request on a case that does not already exist in the court. we are working on standard operating procedures for this process.
