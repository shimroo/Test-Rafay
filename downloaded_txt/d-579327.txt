our mission
the essig museum of entomology on the campus of the university of california at berkeley houses an active research collection of over 5,000,000 terrestrial arthropods. from humble beginnings as a teaching collection over a hundred years ago, through exponential growth as the california insect survey beginning in 1939, and ongoing research projects, the essig museum is now one of the largest and most important university-based research collections of insects in north america. primarily a collection of specimens from the western hemisphere, regional emphasis is on the eastern pacific rim, in particular california, mexico, and central america, and the islands of the central pacific.

the mission of the museum is utilization of the collection to facilitate research, teaching, and outreach in arthropod biology, evolution, and systematics, and document changes in insect populations in response to climate, land use, and other environmental changes. we are committed to making the information contained in our collection accessible to researchers, students, and the broader community, through loans, specimen digitization, outreach events, and museum research projects, and foster interactions within the berkeley natural history museums consortium, as well as with national and global collaborators.
