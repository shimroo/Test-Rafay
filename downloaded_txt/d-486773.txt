			notice: promulgation of instruction relics in the church
			16 december 2017

		vatican city - the vatican has published updated guidelines for 
		preventing abuse of the relics of saints and the blessed. 
			

		   the instruction relics in the church: 
		authenticity and preservation highlights the prohibition of the 
		sale of relics, reinforces recognition protocol, states the process for 
		obtaining certificates of authenticity and protects the consent of the 
		heirs of the saint or blessed. 
			

		   through these instructions, the vatican reminds 
		that relics cannot be displayed for the veneration of the faithful 
		without a proper certificate of the ecclesiastical authority who 
		guarantees their authenticity. it also insists that relics must only be 
		exhibited where their security is guaranteed and not in profane or 
		unauthorized places. another important aspect is that relics must 
		be preserved and honored with a religious spirit, avoiding every type 
		of superstition and, above all, preventing their commercialization. 
			

		   the instruction outlines the correct procedure 
		when transporting relics on pilgrimages and reinforces recognition 
		protocol involving the remains of people who could be beatified or 
		canonized. for example, it prohibits the dismemberment of significant 
		body parts without permission from the congregation for the causes of 
		saints and stipulates the presence of a certified doctor and two 
		witnesses during a relic᾽s extraction. 
			

		   the instruction ultimately aims to protect both relics from 
		theft, falsification and fraudulent sale and also the faithful who 
		devoutly venerate them.

			notice: promulgation of maiorem hac dilectionem
			11 july 2017

		vatican city - the voluntary and free offering of ones life for others 
		[oblatio vitae], resulting in untimely death, has become a new 
		cause for the beatification and canonization procedure, distinct from 
		the causes based on martyrdom and on the heroism of virtues 
			

		   this was established today, 11 june, when pope 
		francis promulgated the apostolic letter maiorem hac dilectionem. 
			

		   the decision particularly facilitates the study 
		of the beatification causes of individuals who had lost their lives for 
		doing an extreme act of christian love (popularly called martyrs of 
		charity), even if it cannot be easily proven that they heroically 
		practiced virtues throughout their lives. 
			

		  the apostolic letter affirm that the heroic offering 
		of life, inspired and sustained by charity, expresses a true, complete 
		and exemplary imitation of christ, and thus is deserving of that 
		admiration that the community of faithful customarily reserves to those 
		who have voluntarily accepted martyrdom of blood or have exercised 
		christian virtues to a heroic degree.

		it is also necessary that their study be performed with serenity,

		and then, at a different level, by the meeting of theological consultors 
		and by the session of cardinals and bishops, eventually reaching the 
		decisive approval of the holy father, who has the exclusive competence 
		of acknowledging an extraordinary event as a true miracle. these 
		regulations obviously concern only the good functioning of the medical 
		board, whose task appears increasingly delicate, demanding and, thanks 
		be to god, appreciated both inside and outside the church.
