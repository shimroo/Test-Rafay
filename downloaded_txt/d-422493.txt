"a subtlety" is the large-scale sugar-coated sculpture by american artist kara walker. the sculpture features a sphinx-like black woman, 35 feet high and 75 feet long in brooklyn’s legendary domino sugar factory.a subtlety was dominated by the sphinx, but also included fifteen other sculptures. these banana boys, as they were called, were 60-inches-tall and weigh 300-500 pounds a piece. five were made of solid sugar. the other ten were first built from sugar as well. however, they collapsed under the heat, and were replaced with versions made of resin and coated in a layer of molasses, made by sculpture house casting.photography: jason wyche

handmade molds
all molds are made by hand. simple forms can be cast easily, but often it’s more complex and molds will be made in different segments and divided in parts. it requires a lot of experience to create the perfect mould. the rubber mold is made with two-component rubber, that is mixed, made vacuum to get the air out - it resembles cooking -  and then poured over the prepared object that will be cast. when the mold is ready, the resin is poured into the mold and placed in a pressure tank to get the air bubbles out.

carnegie hall
ornamental plaster & repairfor the restoration of carnegie hall in 1985 we created all our moldings by hand. usually, the architect or designer provides us with the specifications of the molding in a line drawing that includes sizes like drop and projection ask well as the radius of the curves.then the outline of the molding is cut into a piece of sheet metal and fastened to a wood jig. plaster is added to the bed while the metal jig is drawn across it. this is done multiple times until the metal template cuts the exact impression in the plaster.once dried, the finish molding is ready for install. the molding is installed with plaster, screws, and adhesive. all joints and screw holes are patched to make the molding seamless. the pictures below were taken during the restoration of carnegie hall.
