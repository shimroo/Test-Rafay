       hi-res!                                             1999 - 2017                                                     hi-res! was a groundbreaking, award-winning creative agency founded in 1999 by  alexandra jugoviÄ‡ and florian schmitt. with studios in london, new york, hamburg, and berlin, we crafted memorable experiences through beauty, otherworldliness, emotional impact, and compelling stories.our work spanned diverse industries, such as luxury, fashion and beauty, fmcg, automotive, and entertainment, showcasing our versatility. we have collaborated with icons such as darren aronofsky, massive attack, the beatles and brands like chanel, diesel, and ibm.at hi-res!, we believed in perpetual novelty, approaching each project with a fresh perspective and never becoming specialists. our mantra was, "if you know what you're doing, you end up doing only what you know." this philosophy drove us to push creative boundaries and continually challenge ourselves and our clients.during 17 years, we created everything from books and magazines to websites, campaigns, site-specific installations, immersive experiences, and live performances.hi-res! stands for 'handsome information - radical entertainment systems,' and we are proud of the legacy we leave behind.                  given the ephemeral nature of the web, not much of the work we did is still around, but some of it is documented on vimeo.
