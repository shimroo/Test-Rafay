how should i be formatting my homework?
neat homework can aid your comprehension and might make your teacher like you better. purplemath's "homework guidelines for mathematics" will give you a leg up, explaining in clear terms what your math teacher is looking for. the guidelines link to examples of common errors, and demonstrate techniques that your instructors will love! in addition, students who get in the habit of explaining themselves clearly in their homework gain greater understanding of what they're doing, and therefore tend to do much better on their tests.
english teachers tell their students explicitly how to format their papers: what fonts, what page margins, what style guides, etc. math teachers, on the other hand, frequently just complain amongst themselves in the faculty lounge about how messy their students' work is. meanwhile, their students wonder why they've lost points on homework and tests.
study these guidelines, print out this "formatting" pdf, and improve your learning, retention, and test scores. don't leave easy points on the table!
go to the guidelines!

how can i measure my study skills?
many students, from time to time, wonder, "do i have what it takes to succeed in math?" much of one's success or failure in algebra can be laid at the feet of one's study habits. do you have good math study habits? take this survey and find out.
