welcome neighbor!thank you for visiting! 
























beliefs and values
i often joke that my religion is freddism.  this is because fred rogers and freddie mercury are the pillars of my personal ideals.  i try to hold those tenets in everything i do but especially in business where it is often all too easy to make choices you might not otherwise simply because it's "good for the business."be kind - to yourself.  to others. to the planet.  i repurpose and reuse anything i can. that might mean there's some waste plastic in your art.  it might mean the packaging materials are old bubble mailers.  it might mean i salvaged some wood to make that frame!be fabulous - don't make yourself small or quiet to please anyone! and that goes for art too.  i love that i can draw inspiration from anywhere and i'm okay if it isn't everyone's favorite thing.  i know when i am passionate i do my best work!be you - you are great.  you are not perfect. you have a lot to give.  i want you to know that these are things i struggle with believing about myself, and it is okay if you do too. but you are enough.  and it is my hope that pulped fiction can be a community, a sanctuary for you, whoever you are.be kind. be fabulous. be you.
