the four pillars of our work













build movementswe strengthen the organizing capacity of often-marginalized communities, with an emphasis on gender and racial justice.













develop leaderswe provide training, leadership development, and organizational capacity support to social justice movement leaders.

defend democracywe help communities and civil society effectively respond to anti-democratic social movements.







































the commons 2025civil leadership cohortlaunching in february 2025, this cohort creates space for participants to wrestle with the big questions that undergird our democratic society and movements for justice and equity: how do we define the moment we’re working in? how did we get here? what vision for justice and equity are we working toward? what and who do we need to get there? what stands in our way?

what if the january 6, 2021 insurrection had been successful?written by alan jenkins and gan golan and illustrated by will rosado, 1/6 asks and answers the question: what if the january 6, 2021 insurrection had been successful?the graphic novel chillingly illustrates how close we came to authoritarian rule in america and the threats to our democracy that we still face. in the tradition of speculative fiction from george orwell’s 1984 to margaret atwood’s handmaid’s tale to the twilight zone, it explores themes of autocracy, scapegoating, strategic disinformation, and more, all told through a compelling, character-driven story.drawing on real-life events, 1/6 travels the road that led from back-room meetings, white supremacist rallies, and the four seasons landscaping parking lot to a violent attack on the capitol that left several americans dead and shook our nation to its core. the 4-issue series debuted in early 2023 with the first and second editions now available. written by alan jenkins and gan golan. artwork by will rosado. colors by lee loughridge. with additional contributions by comics masters shawn martinbrough, jamal igle and more. volume 2 is now available!

post-election update



dec 12, 2024




the re-election of donald trump brings us to another disheartening moment in our nation's history. the dangers of trump and his allies returning to power are significant. they’ve made clear their intent to rewrite the rules, target our communities and replace democracy with authoritarianism. in many ways, the last decade laid bare again the dangers of white nationalism, xenophobia, bigotry, and political violence. like trump's first presidential victory, western states center is not surprised — we’re ready.
