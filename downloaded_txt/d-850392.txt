why i am slim despite how much i eat





i remember very well that when i was younger, however much i eat, i still remain skinny. similarly my son, despite how much he eats, he is still slim. perhaps this article in bbc news will answer the whys of that situation:

five things you might be surprised affects your weight.

these in summary are the five things:

1. gut microbes (intestinal tract microflora). microflora diversity (having a healthy and varied diet, rich in different sources of fibre, has been shown to create a more diverse range of gut microbes and reason for you being slim)

2. the gene lottery: some people are born with genes which tend to make them slim while others more unfortunate have genes which explain why they tend to be fat and obese.

3. the time of your meals: the later you have your meals. the biological clock is such that the body is better able to handle calories in the early part of the day. the old saying "breakfast like a king, lunch like a lord and dinner like a pauper" has much truth in it.

4. tricking your brain: behavioural scientist hugo harper suggests a number of ways to subconsciously change your eating behaviour, such as removing visual cues. rather than rely on calorie counting.

5. hormones

natural remedy to prevent hair loss





dr klenk's research, head of the dr kurt wolff research and development institute, found evidence that once caffeine penetrated deep into the hair roots, it could protect the hair from negative testosterone impact and premature hair loss. however, it cannot reverse hair loss.

also, drinking coffee will not help as he estimate one will need to drink as many as 40 to 50 cups of coffee to have the same effect. he says by drinking coffee, the caffeine would be quickly diluted and excreted by the body

natural remedy for depression: mindfulness-based cognative therapy





here is hope for those suffering depression but do not wants to take anti-depression medicine on a long term basis or who wants to take reduced dosage. it is called mindfulness-based cognative therapy or mbct in short.

scientists in the united kingdom got a group of patients suffering from clinical depression to participate in a course of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (mbct where patients are trained to focus their mind on the present, spot early signs of depression, then respond in such a way so as to not trigger further re-occurrences. 

compared with another group of patients who continue to take medication, they were found to have similar proportion of patients suffering relapse. encouraged by this study, doctors in england and wales are already being encouraged to use mbct on their patients but were cautioned not to use it on patients with suicidal tendencies.
