work : redefined 


with covid-19 restrictions throughout the u.s. in a state of flux and virus variants continuing to spread, employers are constantly met with new challenges that were unimaginable prior to the pandemic. our coronavirus taskforce has worked with thousands of employers to comply with the latest agency guidance, confront wage and hour issues associated with a remote workforce, address employee leave issues, assess mandates for masking and vaccinations, and take advantage of pandemic-related federal aid available to certain employers and small businesses. 

learn more : coronavirus taskforce 


as businesses evaluate reopening after more than a year of the covid-19 pandemic, work from home continues for some and the transition back to work is occurring for many. to help businesses adjust to our "new normal," our return to work team is actively working with employers to navigate the new workplace. 

learn more : return to work 


the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security act (cares act), signed into law by president trump on march 27, 2020, is a $2 trillion relief package aimed at helping alleviate some of the impact that the covid-19 pandemic has had on u.s. businesses. fordharrison's cares act team along with our coronavirus taskforce are closely monitoring developments related to the act and advising employers on the specific provisions related to the workplace.
