 partnerships for parks    
 


 
 who is partnerships for parks?partnerships for parks is a unique public-private partnership between city parks foundation and nyc parks that supports and champions neighborhood volunteers by providing the tools needed to advocate and care for neighborhood parks and green spaces. we equip people, organizations, and government with the necessary skills and resources to transform these spaces into dynamic community assets.



 
 what do we do?public parks are the settings for our shared experiences. they improve the quality of life for all new yorkers by providing spaces for social and civic engagement. by developing occasional volunteers into community leaders, we build long-term investment in public space and strengthen the social fabric of our neighborhoods.



 
 why do we do it?there are currently over 1,700 parks in new york city. these places are our backyards, where we connect, play, and celebrate life’s moments. when people come together to care for these spaces, they thrive. and when parks thrive, neighborhoods thrive. parks are spaces where community members and decision makers can work together to create our city.
