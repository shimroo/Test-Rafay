 bandana’s bar-b-q is southern style bbq – seasoned with a dry rub and cooked sauceless, then hand-cut to order straight from the smoker.all bandana’s pork, beef, chicken, and ribs are specially prepared over a pit of select hardwoods to create our signature smoked flavor. this slow cooking process – 14 hours for pork butts and special beef cuts, 5 hours for ribs and chicken – makes the meat tender and tasty, and gives it a reddish color known as a “smoke line”.our real wood smokers operate 24 hours a day, so you can “smell that smoke” any time you visit bandana’s!
