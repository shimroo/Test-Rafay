welcome to gardentrucking.com
we bring you reality at model scale trucking and construction equipment that real works by radio control. we do not sell you a model in a box and say goodbye. if you wish to buy a truck from precision model distributors you will do the same things here as you do in a real truck dealership. you first need to determine a brand of truck, peterbilt or freightliner, what you want the truck to do; haul oil, haul dirt, or haul bulk freight. you will need to determine your wheelbase, your power requirements, transmission requirements, and drive axle ratios and level of reality. these are a few of the real details involved in our trucks and construction equipment. if it is a dump truck or a caterpillar wheel loader when you talking hydraulics we mean real with real oil. transmissions metal transmissions with ball bearings, and three gears that you shift on the go by radio control. realistic engine sound and a full lighting system interior cab lights if you want them. how about a realistic tow truck if you get stuck in the mud? from a light duty tandem axle to an ultra heavy duty eight wheel drive unit. just like a real truck we have many accessories to add sparkle to turn your work horse into a show horse. we even have 1:16 scale driver available, union and non union depending on the part of the country you are working in.
