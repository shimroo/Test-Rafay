are egypt and israel stumbling toward war?                  



most in the west believe an egyptian-israeli war is unthinkable. that assumption should be reexamined.
david wurmser | the editors | feb 12, 2025
the gaza drama is putting egypt’s peace with israel under new strain. this is not the result of only events in the past weeks but is rather the culmination of much longer-term dynamics that cannot easily be mastered and reversed at this stage. the conflagration that hamas began on october 7, 2023, may have triggered a chain of events that exposes these long-term trends and failures and brings them to a head — perhaps even including a broader war.
egypt’s abysmal behavior in allowing its common border with gaza to be used for the dangerous smuggling of weapons, money, and material to hamas built the problem that exploded on october 7. hamas could arm only to the level that egypt enabled it. once exposed, rather than help israel fix the problem it enabled, egypt manufactured tensions with israel to divert attention from its own culpability. egypt tried to bury the legacy of its failure by focusing on israel’s taking control of the philadelphi corridor along the gaza-egypt border. the egyptians claim, inaccurately, that israel’s presence violated the egyptian-israeli peace treaty.
the philadelphi diversion did not solve the basic problem, which was that, for israel, october 7 had rendered obsolete the reemergence of a gazan population under the control of either hamas or the palestinian authority. after october 7, for israel to allow palestinian agency so close to its heart became too dangerous, a threat to israel’s existence. resurrecting the status quo, even dressed in some modification, was no longer feasible. but this meant cairo could no longer contain the gazan problem across the border at arm’s length. so it began to reinforce its border — not to stop smuggling, but to stop the potential outflow of palestinians. this, however, solved nothing, and again dumped the entire gaza problem — a problem that egypt had inflated by failing to control the border — on to israel. further complicating the situation, cairo recently began to deploy armor and troops nearby, in violation of the egyptian-israeli peace treaty. the demilitarization of the sinai is the alpha and omega of the treaty. its violation is itself a gravely serious affair.
what has unfolded since october 7, and is accelerating now, is no doubt a failure of immediate policy in the biden presidency, as well as obama’s. but it is a far greater failure that is indigenous to the region and dates back for most to the last century. egypt’s policy on gaza was just one manifestation of the typical regional pattern of dealing with problems emanating from ideological danger: indulge and reconcile with the problem by exporting it to others who will deal with it.
that pattern solves nothing. the problem returns, but having acquired a far more dangerous form. egypt did that with the gamaat al-islami, and it returned. saudi arabia did that with bin ladin, and it exploded back on 9/11. syria mobilized the palestinians in the camps in tripoli, lebanon in the 2000s to create ansar al-islam and al-qaida iraq (musab al-zarqawi). both eventually returned to haunt them as isis and jabhat al-nusra/haya at-tahrir ash-shams (hts). the arab world’s proclivity to export its problems outward for someone else to deal with rather than directly resolve or erase them consistently comes home to roost. gaza, indeed the palestinians as a whole, are no exception.
so, the palestinian/gaza problem returns to haunt egypt. egypt’s 75-year policy of appeasing and paying the palestinian piper under the assumption it is israel’s problem has finally come home for egypt itself. israel can no longer tolerate palestinian agency in gaza, and the destruction there will leave no real option for israel other than the removal of the population of gaza — perhaps temporarily, but more likely permanently. both jerusalem and washington have now come to this conclusion, resulting in the trump plan for gaza. egypt opposes the american plan to resettle gazans to safer lands because doing so would import the problem it so desperately exported. it would move it inside the house.
though this is a circumstance of egypt’s own making, it places egypt in a difficult position.
on one hand, egypt fears for its regime’s survival if it accepts the trump plan. it would position cairo as a participant in a second disaster, or “nakba.” it knows from its own history; king farouk was overthrown in 1952 in part for his failure to prevent the first nakba in 1948. any leader that fails to stop a second nakba, let alone participates in it, risks losing legitimacy and being seen as weak. the perception of buckling on the palestine issue also resulted in egyptian president anwar sadat’s assassination in 1981. egyptian president el-sisi risks being seen by his own population as too weak to stand up to israel or the united states, as not upholding his manliness.
ultimately, this could prove fatal. if egypt buckles, el-sisi would be seen as a wounded fish by the region’s sharks. turkey, qatar and iran — cairo’s true enemies — will gather around the limping egyptian nation and incite the population against the government in an invigorated attempt to carry to power in cairo the islamist sweep that in december seized damascus. that threat could topple the government.
on the other hand, refusing the trump plan will drive a wedge in us-egyptian relations, and likely will terminate the u.s. aid and weapons sales, which have totaled more than $80 billion since 1978. el-sisi may figure that he can weather the u.s. opposition but cannot weather an upheaval from below fomented by qatar, turkey, and iran. and indeed, if current reports coming out of qatari news channels are true, el-sisi already has made his choice and decided to postpone indefinitely the trip to washington that had been scheduled for next week. in these circumstances, it is possible that egyptian-u.s. relations may have already entered into a much deeper crisis than is widely appreciated.
how far can this go?

the trump administration is upping the pressure on cairo to accept the u.s. president’s plan to resettle large parts of the population of gaza on egyptian territory.
on thursday, the qatari outlet al-araby al-jadeed reported that the pentagon had reached out to warn egyptian officials that part of the over $1.4 billion in annual military aid might be cut if cairo won’t accept president donald trump’s plan.

the ‘first amendment’ dodge at uc berkeley                  



peloni:  in an enlightened society, it is unbearable to tolerate such yokes of depravity which seek to draw the modern world back towards an age in which such barbarity and oppressive subjugation of jews was both publicly commonplace and institutionally popularized, and yet, this is exactly what has been accelerating across american campuses.  not one more day should pass before the investigations, indictments and prosecutions should begin.  if civilization is to be preserved, it must immediately move to purge its most basic institutions of any support or even tolerance for the call to savagery against jews, which has been masked as some perverse re-write of the freedom of speech.
the issues on campus and elsewhere extend beyond free-speech protections.

in “mr. trump, investigate my campus” (op-ed, feb. 3) prof. steven davidoff solomon calls for an investigation of incidents of antisemitism at the university of california, berkeley. chancellor rich lyons suggests that such an investigation isn’t needed, citing the first amendment (“no need to investigate my campus, mr. trump,” letters, feb. 6).

the solution-seeking business                  



peloni:  facilitated emigration has always been the only real solution to resolve the pal cleft which has been weaponized against israel.  of course this weaponization was the very basis for the arabs and collective west to refuse to consider any pal emigration as viable.  for israel, it was the dependency on the hashemites as some form of necessary ally to their survival which held them addicted to maintaining the cleft in place, even though the hashemites were neither necessary nor even a reliable ally to israel.  for these reasons, the cleft has been maintained in place over the decades where the pals have themselves become the victims of this cruel game, and whereby their well trained savagery brought about attack after attack on innocent jews, and the response was consistently and inexplicably leveraged by israel’s allies and enemies alike towards demands of greater and greater concessions from israel without any beneficial effect.  it is time to exercise the legitimate option of facilitated emigration to resolve this conflict, and a rational and efficient plan has in fact already been formulated and proposed towards this goal.  it is the jordan option as described by ted in his the ultimate alternate israel-palestine solution (jordan option), memo to kushner, and other essays listed at the top of the main page of this site.  we will hopefully see this plan come to fruition in the not too distant future.  in fact, the description of the creation of a city for the pals in jordan, as mentioned by trump, was one of the many elements which was described by ted and mudar in the jordan option.
meanwhile, egypt proposes to continue keeping the weaponized cleft in place, as if doubling down on maintaining the existential threat against israel were the ultimate goal, which of course, for egypt and many others, it is.

uae envoy says no alternative to trump’s gaza plan for now                  



peloni:  the reality is that either the pals will remain as a existential threat to israel or they will find accommodations in some third party nation or nations.  the connections between the pals of gaza and jordan and egypt are relevant and significant, and their continuing role in amplifying the violence against israel from hamastan is quite evident.  when this plan is finally implemented, it will completely alter the dynamics in the middle east, in a way which is both stabilize the region, and strengthen the us position against its peer rivals.

peloni:  williams provides a particularly rational overview of the us negotiations with russia, and why ukraine and its supporters might have significant reason to be concerned.  ukraine can not win this war, and they can’t even fight it without the us support, which trump is offsetting to europe, which has likewise no means by which to back up their empty words which have always been characterized to fight to the last ukrainian.  i recommend focusing on the first 25min.

rfk confirmed as sec. hhs                  



peloni: rfk is finally confirmed to lead the hhs, so it will be refreshing to hear him comment on the coming stargate nightmare which was announced during his confirmation period, while he remained noticeably silent on the subject.  the use of mrna has been shown to be highly toxic and has been linked to unknown numbers of literally untold tragedies.  it is time for this silence to be ended, and for rfk, now as the sec of hhs, to directly address the elephant in the room which is the tragedy and consequences of having used and intending to continue using, mrna shots under the indemnified liability protection of being a ‘vacccine’.

resettling gaza                  




linda goudsmit:  another excellent analysis by daniel greenfield. for me, what is missing from this article is the fact that iran’s proxy, hamas, declared war on israel october 7, 2024 when it invaded israel and slaughtered 1200 israelis. in what universe is israel not entitled to the spoils of that war? israel never should have surrendered gaza in its ill-advised 2005 land-for-peace deal, and now gaza belongs to israel once again. never again is a reference to the reality of the holocaust, but it should apply equally to any land-for-peace deal. why? because israel’s muslim enemies, including the arab muslim settlers in gaza, are doctrinally committed to israel’s extinction and to the annihilation of the jewish people. so, this american jew agrees with president trump on resettling gazan muslims in arab countries, because again and again and again is the inconvenient truth and reality of the middle east!
daniel greenfield | feb 12, 2025

is it the right thing to do and can it work? yes it can.


after president trump proposed resettling the arab muslim settlers currently living in gaza, there was an outbreak of furious objections from politicians, activists and media outlets.
