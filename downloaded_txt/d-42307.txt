robert prince






mia
coaching staff









personalize your rotoworld feed by favoriting players





nfl network’s tom pelissero reports the saints interviewed dolphins wr coach robert prince.

prince was hired less than a month ago as the dolphins wr coach but could once again be on the move. prince spent one season with moore and the cowboys (2022) and first joined the nfl ranks in 2004 as an offensive assistant for the falcons. his last offensive coordinator came at boise state (2012 to 2013), but most of his work has been as a receivers coach. prince, along with eagles’ qb coach doug nussmeier, are two early candidates to land the saints’ oc vacancy, with nussmeier expected to speak to the team early this week.







christian  parker






phi









sports illustrated’s albert breer reports the saints are interviewing eagles db coach christian parker for their defensive coordinator vacancy.

newly-minted head coach kellen moore continues to bring in familiar faces. like former chargers head coach brandon staley, who worked with moore in 2023, parker and moore served on the eagles’ championship coaching staff this season. moore has been a defensive backs coach for the last four seasons and was hired as the eagles’ db/pass game coordinator last season after previously working with the broncos from 2021 to 2023. he played a key role in reshaping an eagles secondary that ranked among the worst in 2023 to one of the best in 2024 and ultimately proved capable of shutting down patrick mahomes and the chiefs in the super bowl. if he’s hired, this would mark the first time in his career that parker has served as a defensive coordinator.













justin tucker






bal
kicker
#9









the baltimore banner reports that seven additional massage therapists have come forward alleging misconduct by ravens k justin tucker.

tucker has now been accused of misconduct by 16 different therapists across eight different spas. like the others, these new accusations also include allegations of tucker exposing himself to therapists, rubbing himself on them, and at times, touching their thighs. all 16 of tucker’s accusers are women with similar stories. whether they say it or not, it’s growing increasingly difficult for the ravens to justify keeping tucker, 35, around as allegations continue to mount.













darren rizzi






den
special teams









broncos hired former saints interim head coach darren rizzi as their new special teams coordinator and assistant head coach.

the signing reunites rizzi with broncos head coach sean payton, who hired him with the saints back in 2019. the broncos already featured a solid special teams unit, ranking eighth in the nfl with an 87.5 pff special teams grade. rizzi’s top-tier coaching should only further strengthen it. the assistant head coaching role will help rizzi develop his leaderships skills and increase his odds of securing a future head coaching role.













raheem mostert






mia
running back
#31









dolphins released rb raheem mostert.

mostert spent the 2022-2024 seasons with the dolphins. his miami tenure is highlighted by a highly productive 2023 showing in which he rushed 209 times for 1,012 yards and 18 touchdowns and caught 25-of-29 targets for 175 yards and three touchdowns. the 32-year-old could find work as a speedy, part-time player but it would be unsurprising to see him retire at this point. with mostert gone, second-year rb jaylen wright steps into the no. 2 role behind de’von achane.













allen lazard






nyj
wide receiver
#10









the athletic’s zack rosenblatt believes allen lazard will be a cap casualty for the jets this offseason.

rosenblatt lays it out pretty clearly, writing that lazard “was always getting released after the second year of a disastrous four-year, $44 million contract he signed as a free agent in 2023.” the price for playing ball with aaron rodgers when the team traded for him was to sign his long-time buddy lazard, who spent five seasons with rodgers in green bay. as many expected, lazard hasn’t proven to be much of an offensive upgrade for the jets through two seasons, amassing 60 catches for 841 yards and seven scores thus far. after getting off to a strong start in 2024, in which he posted a 30-412-5 line through the first seven games of the season, lazard became an afterthought following the trade for davante adams and only cracked 50 receiving yards once after week 7. the jets can save $6.6 million in cap space if they designate him as a pre-june 1 release while taking on a $6.5 million dead cap hit. however, the savings move to $11 million with a dead cap hit of $2.1 million if he’s designated as post-june 1. regardless, it won’t cost the team much to part ways with a receiver who has struggled to live up to his gaudy contract thus far.













c.j. mosley






nyj
linebacker
#57









the athletic’s zack rosenblatt believes jets lb c.j. mosley is “most likely” to retire this offseason.

in an article where he looked at the jets’ 2025 cap situation, rosenblatt said mosley is likely to be released by the team or retire this offseason while adding that “the most likely outcome is that he retires.” mosley’s 2024 was limited to just four games due to a neck injury, and he managed just 17 total tackles in the games he appeared in. it wouldn’t be the first time we’ve seen neck injuries for early retirements, as the cowboys saw a number of neck injuries prematurely end leighton vander esch’s career last offseason. mosley will turn 33 this off-season and has just one year left on his deal. if he is released, the jets can save $4 million against the 2025 cap while taking on a dead cap hit just north of $8.7 million.













trevor lawrence






jax
quarterback
#16









espn’s michael dirocco reports a jaguars source called any rumors of a trevor lawrence trade “ridiculous.”

the jaguars source added that there was “no chance” they would consider trading lawerence. these comments were spurred by a report earlier in the day that said the steelers reached out to the jaguars inquiring about a potential trade for the fifth-year signal-caller. while anything remains possible, the idea of the jaguars trading lawrence seems highly unlikely given that he was just signed to an extension last offseason. the steelers need help at quarterback, with russell wilson and justin fields both set to hit free agency, but early reports are they will attempt to re-sign one of the vets this offseason.













clyde edwards-helaire






no
running back
#23









saints signed rb clyde edwards-helaire.

ceh will be back with the saints for the start of the 2025 offseason. the former first-round pick was active for two games last season for the saints, rushing 13 times for 46 yards while adding another three catches for 24 yards. with new head coach kellen moore now in town, the saints are sure to have some roster turnover this offseason, but edwards-helaire could have a chance to battle for a roster spot if he sticks around until training camp. 













alvin kamara






no
running back
#41









saints coach kellen moore said alvin kamara will “continue to be a really important piece” to the saints offense.

kamara will be 30 at the start of next season but still turned in a solid 2024 season, racking up 1,493 yards from scrimmage and eight total touchdowns while catching 68 passes for 543 yards and two scores. kamara’s fantasy managers have long profited from his work in the passing game, as the veteran back has caught 68 or more passes in six of his eight years in the league. kamara signed a two-year, $24.5 million extension last october. as long as he’s still producing at a high level, we would expect him to see workloads similar to what we’ve seen in years past.
