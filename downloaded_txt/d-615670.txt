the
          premier polyester collection is made from 230 gram polyester
                      fabric and designed with quality and style in mind. this
                      extra thick and comfortable range of cushions is boxed
                      with a double piped edge. a detachable pillow is supplied
                      with the recliner, steamer and lounger cushions. this can
                      be used as either a headrest or lumber support. every
                      product in the premier polyester collection boasts a
                      leatherette logo. all cushions are packed in
                      zipped hanger bags.
the
          contemporary cushion range
                      this range is made from 180 gram polyester and is
                      therefore naturally rot, fade and stain resistant. this
                      simple range of cushions is pinched with a single piped
                      edge.
the
          flexible collection is made from 180 gram
                      polyester. the flexible cushion fits most garden chairs.
                      this flexible cushion is flanged with a series of eyelets
                      running down either side of the back to make adjusting the
                      height of the cushion easy. 
complete
          parasols  - 2.0m, 2.5m and 3.0m parasols are available in
          five plain colours; green, navy, terracotta, natural and black. the
          parasols have removable covers to allow for machine washing 40£c.

          hattersley: by selecting only the finest timbers, designs and
          joinery methods we believe this teak collection is second to none. teak has quite an unmistakable contoured
          grain, together with a high retention of natural oils held within the wood which gives it a texture like
          silk. our teak collection combines the characteristic look of this beautiful timber with ergonomic
          designs giving you the ultimate in comfort. hartman: hartman teak offers a range
          of furniture selected from quality durable teak, which means that this
          product can remain outside all year. from a large garden to a balcony
          setting this this teak furniture will give a touch of class for you to enjoy with your family and friends.

          barbecuers - used to be at a distinct disadvantage - there
          were no weber gas barbecues. 
          but then in 1985, after two years of intensive research, invention,
          and design, weber developed a gas
           barbecue excellent enough to bear the weber name - the
          weber spirit. the unique burner system
           delivered even heating with no hot spots for consistently great
          cooking
