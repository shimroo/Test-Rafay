wed. so you can have the quality products which you are used to.  jim

art from god  was established in 1992 with only a 12 pound rock
    tumbler and has grown to be one of the largest and most respected rock shops in the
    nation. we specialize in brazilian products including amethyst, agate book-ends, quartz
    crystals, gemstones, rough and finished mineral specimens, carvings, agate ends, small and
    large decorator pieces, and polished phantom crystals. some of our inventory includes
    rough slabs, frosted selenite clusters, pyrite specimens, tumbled stones, thick and thin
    slabs, mexican opal, fossils, spheres; and pakistani onyx carvings. we sell by the piece
    or by the barrel, depending on your needs. we have mine-direct contacts in brazil and
    mexico, as well as contacts with many dealers who own their own mines. products can be
    ordered by e-mail, phone, our secure shopping cart,  or come on in to the
    store.  cash, check, money orders, visa, and mastercard  are accepted.  if
    you have further questions, feel free to call us at 1-800-569-4648, or send us an e-mail
