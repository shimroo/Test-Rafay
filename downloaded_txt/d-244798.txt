sandburg's 

							  hometown 
by barbara schock




							  http://www.sandburg.org/sandburgshometown/

 


							 
							   almost ten years ago, february 4, 
							  2013, we began posting barbara schock's sandburg 
							  hometown series on our carl sandburg historic site 
							  association website.   
















this week's post is the 
							  series finale
							  
							  



							  #401!!














							

							  it is with much sadness and heartfelt appreciation 
							  that we must announce that barbara schock is 
							  retiring her "sandburg's hometown" series by the 
							  end of 2022.  thank you, 
barbara, for sharing your extraordinary gift of these vignettes of galesburg & 
19th century american history.  four hundred and one wonderful articles leaves 
							  quite a legacy.

charles "chuck" j. bednar
march 7, 1936 - september 18, 2018















it is with great sadness that 
							  we announce the death of charles "chuck" bednar.  
							  his mother, juanita, was a driving force in the 
							  purchase, restoration and early operations of carl 
							  sandburg's birthplace cottage.  chuck 
							  followed in her footsteps and was involved with 
							  the site and its support group over the years.  
							  after returning to galesburg in retirement, chuck 
							  served six years on the board of directors of the 
							  carl sandburg historic site association and as 
							  president (2011-2014).  the impressive 9-foot 
							  statue of carl sandburg centrally located in 
							  galesburg's downtown was realized due to chuck's 
							  visionary leadership.  he had a great 
							  knowledge of sandburg and american history and 
							  literature.   chuck will be deeply 
							  missed.

letters from a docent 

#15
january 2025

by dr. john w. quinley






 dr. john w. quinley, 
a retired college administrator and faculty member, was raised in maywood, 
illinois, just a few blocks away from where sandburg lived 30 years earlier. he 
served as a docent for carl sandburg home national historic site for several 
years, and is the author of  discovering carl sandburg: the eclectic life of 
an american icon   (2022). he and his wife, melissa, live in hendersonville, north 
carolina, just a few miles from sandburg's former home.  
  



a note from the author! november 2024
 
hi friends,
 
books about sandburg either present his life and 
		accomplishments in a chronological manner (like penelope nivenâs 
		800-page volume) or trace his life thematicallyâlike my book. this 
		letter provides a table that shows sandburgâs pursuits over his lifetime 
		by decade and theme as well as the intensity of activity. 

 
upcoming letters will paint a picture of his life 
		and pursuits during the chicago years (1900â1927), michigan years 
		(1928â1944), and the north carolina years (1945â1967). 
 
thanks for your interest in carl sandburg,
 
john

						originally posted on our sandburg.org website over a 
						10-year period from 2013-2022.  schockâs articles 
						focused on the people, the institutions and issues that 
						shaped late 19th-century galesburg, illinois, during 
						carl sandburgâs boyhood.  many articles were 
						inspired by sandburgâs autobiography always the 
						young strangers published in 1953.  numerous 
						historical images illustrate schockâs entertaining and 
						informative articles. 


 
the publication of 
						sandburgâs hometown was made possible in part by a 
						grant from the galesburg community foundation, as well 
						as generous support from the late j. michael hobbs.

endowment campaign
carl sandburg historic 
							  site association




thank you!
with all of the 

							  challenges facing museums and historic sites in 

							  illinois, it is time to redouble our efforts to 

							  protect the carl sandburg state historic site and 

							  the legacy of our native son and national 

							  treasure.  to accomplish this goal, the carl 

							  sandburg historic site association (cshsa) was 

							  chosen by the galesburg community foundation 

							  (gcf) to participate in an endowment match 

							  program.  prior to the june 30, 2016 deadline 

							  the cshsa raised just over $12,000 

							  toward an endowment to support the historic site 

							  and the gcf has matched our efforts with the 

							  $10,000 matching grant.this is our initial 

							  effort to start an endowment and we hope to see it 

							  grow to a point where the interest from the 

							  endowment will be significant enough to enrich the 

							  carl sandburg historic site in the future. 
thank you, especially, to the galesburg 

							  community foundation for their efforts and support 

							  for preserving the heritage and history of 

							  galesburg.current
