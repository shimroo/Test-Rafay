when i decided to move my investments to g r baird financial, graeme set up the proper procedures to ensure my beneficiaries would receive maximum benefits upon my death, avoiding probate where possible. my wife moved her rifs to g r baird financial, with no pressure from graeme, just clear explanations as to how we could proceed. i consider this a testimony to how confident we both are with how all our investments have and are being handled by his company.

roxanna and her team at baird benefits plus are true professionals, always looking out for our best interests and generous when sharing their expertise with our team. we feel confident in their judgment and care – we know they work hard for our benefit.

within the past month, i have transferred my five grandchildren’s resps, totalling over $350k from my bank to graeme. graeme is always a gentleman, with the genuine ability to explain our holdings in such a clear manner to both my wife and i.  as i am challenged both on the computer and in understanding investments, graeme continues to guide us, never ever, showing any signs of exasperation or impatience. 

-  ab, nepean




baird benefits plus is a firm made up of caring owners and staff. as a client, i know that they will be there for us and our staff. roxanna, meghan among others treat all of our requests with respect and efficiency, no matter what the topic or concern.

roxanna takes the worry out of our renewal time, fighting our fights and relentlessly getting the best program and pricing.
i have repeatedly recommended baird benefits plus and i will continue, as they never let us down!

in 1994, i retired from the rcmp and invested my buyout. my financial advisor retired in 2006 and graeme baird became my new advisor. sometime prior to 2014, i became dissatisfied with the financial advisor for my first wife’s ”investments”. when speaking with graeme concerning my own investments, he clearly explained another route that i could consider respecting all her investments.  never once did he try pressuring me to change companies.
