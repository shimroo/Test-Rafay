the mirror of her dreams

i've owned this book for over three decades, but for some reason i never got around to reading it. which is weird considering how much of a fan i am of stephen r. donaldson's thomas covenant books. in any event, both volumes of the mordant's need duology have sat on my shelves for years, all but forgotten. i came across them again while doing some house cleaning and decided that it was high time to give this series a shot.

the main problem with sff works from the 70s and the 80s is that many of them have not aged well. and sadly, the mirror of her dreams is the perfect example of a bestseller from a different era which doesn't hold up well in this day and age. the old-school gendered perspectives of the early 80s, in particular, will be a frustrating challenge, especially for female readers.

here's the blurb:

with the chronicles of thomas covenant, stephen r. donaldson changed the face of fantasy fiction forever. in the mirror of her dreams, the astonishing first novel in the two-volume mordant’s need series, donaldson shows us a world of wondrous beauty and seductive illusion, where mirrors hold the deadliest of magics and nothing is what it seems.  .  .  .

the daughter of rich but neglectful parents, terisa morgan lives alone in a new york city apartment, a young woman who has grown to doubt her own existence. surrounded by the flat reassurance of mirrors, she leads an unfulfilled life—until the night a strange man named geraden comes crashing through one of her mirrors, on a quest to find a champion to save his kingdom of mordant from a pervasive evil that threatens the land. terisa is no champion. she wields neither magic nor power. and yet, much to her own surprise, when geraden begs her to come back with him, she agrees.

now, in a culture where women are little more than the playthings of powerful men, in a castle honeycombed with secret passages and clever traps, in a kingdom threatened from without and within by enemies able to appear and vanish out of thin air, terisa must become more than the pale reflection of a person. for the way back to earth is closed to her. and the enemies of mordant will stop at nothing to see her dead.

although the mirror of her dreams is a bag of fantasy tropes, you can always count on an author of stephen r. donaldson's talent and imagination to subvert them and keep readers on their toes. the worldbuilding, as least in this first installment, is not as rich and detailed as that of the land in the thomas covenant books. still, i liked how the author played with the chosen one cliché and turned it on its head by making a timid young woman from another world mordant's champion. the concept of the imagers and the congery is interesting, and so was the tale of how king joyse united the realms to form what became the kingdom of mordant. the plot probably would have benefited from a more detailed back story of mordant's enemies and the members of the congery. like terisa, readers are more often than not left in the dark and are forced to move forward with no understanding of what's going on until we reach the last part of the novel. for that reason, it's difficult to fully get into this one.

the characterization is what leaves the most to be desired. which is a bit shocking, as this is usually an aspect in which donaldson truly shines. as mentioned, the dated gendered perspectives will likely infuriate many a reader, especially women. teresa, though well-drawn and three-dimensional, can be exasperating at times. if it was only a question of her being so weak-minded and self-effacing, it wouldn't be that bad. but the sexual tension every time she encounters master eremis, as well as the portrayal of women in general, will make a lot of people want to throw the book across the room. poor geraden, clumsy in mind as well as in body, is a much easier protagonist to root for. thankfully, the supporting cast features some interesting people, chief among them myste, mad adept havelock, and artagel. on the other hand, some, like castellan lebbick, appear dense on purpose, just to keep the plot moving.

stephen r. donaldson's works are never fast-pace affairs, so it will come as no surprise that the mirror of her dreams suffers from pacing issues. the rhythm remains slow for the duration, with the action picking up a little just before the end. though it's never dull, the book is never truly fascinating either. donaldson offers a few golden nuggets along the way, just enough to keep you interested, but never making the novel hard to put down. you go through the motions, but you're never quite excited to find out what happens next. still, the author managed to keep me intrigued enough to continue, so there is that.

the endgame, if you can call it that, doesn't really elevate the story to another level. we finally get some answers that were long in coming, yet those inevitably raise more questions. as expected but more than 550 pages later, terisa finally finds the willpower to stand up for herself. but it's a little too late, to be honest. sure, the ending makes you want to read the second volume, yet it doesn't exonerate the slog that was the mirror of her dreams.

i have a feeling that it would have been a more enjoyable read back in the early 90s when i bought it. in 2025, well. . .

the final verdict: 6.5/10

you can get your hands on one of science fiction's most beloved classics, william gibson's neuromancer, for only 1.99$ by following this amazon associate link. this onelink will take you to the nearest amazon site serving your country and you'll see if you can take advantage of this sale.

here's the blurb:

the matrix is a world within the world, a global consensus-hallucination, the representation of every byte of data in cyberspace . . .

case had been the sharpest data-thief in the business, until vengeful former employees crippled his nervous system. but now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run. the target: an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence orbiting earth in service of the sinister tessier-ashpool business clan. with a dead man riding shotgun and molly, mirror-eyed street-samurai, to watch his back, case embarks on an adventure that ups the ante on an entire genre of fiction.

hotwired to the leading edges of art and technology, neuromancer ranks with 1984 and brave new world as one of the century’s most potent visions of the future.

you can also download andy weir's artemis for only 2.99$ by following this amazon associate link.

here's the blurb:

the bestselling author of the martian returns with an irresistible new near-future thriller—a heist story set on the moon.

jasmine bashara never signed up to be a hero. she just wanted to get rich.

not crazy, eccentric-billionaire rich, like many of the visitors to her hometown of artemis, humanity’s first and only lunar colony. just rich enough to move out of her coffin-sized apartment and eat something better than flavored algae. rich enough to pay off a debt she’s owed for a long time.

so when a chance at a huge score finally comes her way, jazz can’t say no. sure, it requires her to graduate from small-time smuggler to full-on criminal mastermind. and it calls for a particular combination of cunning, technical skills, and large explosions—not to mention sheer brazen swagger. but jazz has never run into a challenge her intellect can’t handle, and she figures she’s got the ‘swagger’ part down.

the trouble is, engineering the perfect crime is just the start of jazz’s problems. because her little heist is about to land her in the middle of a conspiracy for control of artemis itself.

trapped between competing forces, pursued by a killer and the law alike, even jazz has to admit she’s in way over her head. she’ll have to hatch a truly spectacular scheme to have a chance at staying alive and saving her city.

jazz is no hero, but she is a very good criminal.

that’ll have to do.

propelled by its heroine’s wisecracking voice, set in a city that’s at once stunningly imagined and intimately familiar, and brimming over with clever problem-solving and heist-y fun, artemis is another irresistible brew of science, suspense, and humor from #1 bestselling author andy weir.

you can now download r. f. kuang's the complete the poppy war trilogy, which is comprised of the poppy war, the dragon republic, and the burning god, for only 3.99$ by following this amazon associate link. this onelink will take you to the nearest amazon site serving your country and you'll see if you can take advantage of this sale.

here's the blurb:

a "best of may" science fiction and fantasy pick by amazon, barnes and noble, audible, the verge, syfy wire, and kirkus.

a brilliantly imaginative talent makes her exciting debut with this epic historical military fantasy, inspired by the bloody history of china’s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic, in the tradition of ken liu’s grace of kings and n.k. jemisin’s inheritance trilogy.

when rin aced the keju—the empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from rooster province could pass without cheating; to rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. that she got into sinegard—the most elite military school in nikan—was even more surprising.

but surprises aren’t always good.

because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at sinegard. targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.

for while the nikara empire is at peace, the federation of mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. the militarily advanced federation occupied nikan for decades after the first poppy war, and only barely lost the continent in the second. and while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a third poppy war is just a spark away . . .

rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. but as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.

you can now get your hands on the digital edition of robin hobb's fool's assassin for only 3.99$ by following this amazon associate link. this onelink will take you to the nearest amazon site serving your country and you'll see if you can take advantage of this sale.

here's the blurb:

nearly twenty years ago, robin hobb burst upon the fantasy scene with the first of her acclaimed farseer novels, assassin’s apprentice, which introduced the characters of fitzchivalry farseer and his uncanny friend the fool. a watershed moment in modern fantasy, this novel—and those that followed—broke exciting new ground in a beloved genre. together with george r. r. martin, robin hobb helped pave the way for such talented new voices as scott lynch, brandon sanderson, and naomi novik.

over the years, hobb’s imagination has soared throughout the mythic lands of the six duchies in such bestselling series as the liveship traders trilogy and the rain wilds chronicles. but no matter how far she roamed, her heart always remained with fitz. and now, at last, she has come home, with an astonishing new novel that opens a dark and gripping chapter in the farseer saga.

fitzchivalry—royal bastard and former king’s assassin—has left his life of intrigue behind. as far as the rest of the world knows, fitzchivalry farseer is dead and buried. masquerading as tom badgerlock, fitz is now married to his childhood sweetheart, molly, and leading the quiet life of a country squire.

though fitz is haunted by the disappearance of the fool, who did so much to shape fitz into the man he has become, such private hurts are put aside in the business of daily life, at least until the appearance of menacing, pale-skinned strangers casts a sinister shadow over fitz’s past . . . and his future.

now, to protect his new life, the former assassin must once again take up his old one. . .

a hugo award nominee for best novel

matt cairns is a twenty-first-century outlaw programmer who takes on the shady jobs no one else will touch. against his better judgment, he accepts an assignment to crack the marshall titov, a top-secret orbital station operated by the european space agency. but what matt will discover there will propel him on an extraordinary and quite unexpected journey.

i've been giddy ever since i was offered an early read of guy gavriel kay's forthcoming written on the dark!

every couple of years, kay comes up with a new novel that never fails to amaze me. with such unforgettable titles as tigana, the lions of al-rassan, under heaven, river of stars, sailing to sarantium, and lord of emperors, kay has set the bar rather high throughout his career. and if children of earth and sky, a brightness long ago and all the seas of the world are any indication, it appears that like a fine wine, the author only gets better with time. these books showcased a master of the craft writing at the top of his game. yes, kay is that good!

understandably, i had lofty expectations for kay's newest work. and for the most part, kay met them. but something's missing, even though written on the dark follows the same recipe as his last three novels. the main problem is that it's an incredibly short novel. regardless of what pagecounts the various editions state online, my e-arc was only 265 pages long and i have a feeling that this hurt the story in several ways. i often complain that books are too long and padded with filler material, but the opposite can also affect a tale in negative fashion. the long and the short of it is that events and characters featured in written on the dark aren't fleshed out the way they were in the middle sea works that came before. if i'm not mistaken, this could well be kay's shortest novel to date and i'm wondering why some events are just glossed over or why he didn't feel the need to elaborate more on certain facets of the story.

don't get me wrong. it's a very good read. i devoured written on the dark in just three sittings. still, i was left wanting once i reached the last page, which came way too quickly for my taste. its short length precluded the sort of depth that usually makes a guy gavriel kay novel so satisfying.

here's the blurb:

from the internationally bestselling author of tigana, all the seas of the world, and a brightness long ago comes a majestic new novel of love and war that brilliantly evokes the drama and turbulence of medieval france.

thierry villar is a well-known—even notorious—tavern poet, intimately familiar with the rogues and shadows of that world, but not at all with courts and power. he is an unlikely person, despite his quickness, to be swept into the deadly contests of ambitious royals, assassins, and invading armies.

but he is indeed drawn into all these things on a savagely cold night in his beloved city of orane. and so thierry must use all the intelligence and charm he can muster as power struggles merge with a decades-long war to bring his country to the brink of destruction.

as he does, he meets his poetic equal in an aristocratic woman and is drawn to more than one unsettling person with a connection to the world beyond this one. he also crosses paths with an extraordinary young woman driven by voices within to try to heal the ailing king — and help his forces in war. a wide and varied set of people from all walks of life take their places in the rich tapestry of this story.

both sweeping and intimate, written on the dark is an elegant tour de force about power and ambition playing out amid the equally intense human need for art and beauty, and memories to be left behind.

long-time fans will be pleased to learn that the tale takes place a few years before the fall of sarantium to the asharites. richly detailed as only a guy gavriel kay work can be, written on the dark captures your imagination from the get-go. probably due to the extensive amount of research he puts into every project, the author came up with another evocative narrative and an arresting imagery. it usually takes him a while to set the tone and draw you into his tale, but in this one he sucks you in from the very beginning. like the majority of his books, kay's latest is another interesting blend of history and fantasy. as surmised from the blurb, the historical backdrop is about charles vi suffering from bouts of insanity, the duke of burgundy, joan of arc, henry v, the hundred years' war, and more. as you well know by now, kay takes lots of liberties and twists events and protagonists to fit the story he's trying to tell. hence, as always, expect the unexpected.

as mentioned in previous reviews, around the time when children of earth and sky was about to be published, kay told me that as much as anything, he wanted that novel to be about non-powerful (not same as ordinary) people on borderlands in a time of war, trying to shape their lives (very differently) in difficult times. they intersect, some of them, with power, but that isn't the heart of the story. for the most part, the same could be said of a brightness long ago and all the seas of the world. the difference was that the protagonists were "less important" people in the greater scheme of things who get caught in the periphery of influential men and women whose actions will cause world-shaking ripples that will change the world as they know it. in that regard, written on the dark is more akin to these last two.

it's no secret that guy gavriel kay possesses a deft human touch. which is why his past novels are all filled with memorable characters. indeed, it's the superb characterization that makes his books impossible to put down. not surprisingly, the author came up with another group of disparate men and women whose paths will cross unexpectedly and whose fates will be spun into a vast tapestry of love and tragedy. but it's in the characterization that written on the dark leaves a little to be desired. thierry villar is as well drawn as any of kay's past protagonists and makes for a great main character. the same can be said of robbin de vaux, the king's provost in orane, and sylvi, one of the poet's friends. and yet, a number of characters would have benefited from a bit more depth, chief among them medor colle, a serjeant, gauvard colle, his uncle and a man acquainted with the half-world, as well as marina di seressa, the court poet. given their importance in the greater scheme of things, i believe they deserved to be further fleshed out. lots of fans are curious to see what kay will do with the joan of arc analogue. this is by far the biggest pop culture figure he as ever tackled. alas, don't get your hopes too high, for she gets about as much air time as ser patrek of king's mountain (the character george r. r. martin based on me in a dance with dragons) did. seriously. but in the end, what probably hurts the characterization the most is the portrayal of laurent de barratin. as the main antagonist of this tale, i feel that he deserved a bit more focus. though his storyline looms over the entire plot, he never becomes a fully realized character.

although all of guy gavriel kay's works can be slow-moving at times, their pace is seldom as uneven as it is in this one. yet after a great start, by the middle part of the book everything begins to meander and lose a bit of focus. it's never dull, mind you, but weighing in at only 265 pages (at least that's the length of the e-arc i got), written on the dark is way too short to allow itself to drift a bit aimlessly the way it does in the last 100 pages or so.

even if the characterization is weaker than what the author has accustomed us to and even though it's meandering in terms of plot, with kay's lyrical prose the narrative is a joy to read from start to finish. and let's be honest. even a subpar book by kay is better than 90% of what's out there. i'm well aware that what i consider shortcomings might be seen as nitpicking by some readers, so your mileage may vary regarding this one. in any case, don't miss out on a chance to return to the world of sarantium!

the final verdict: 7.75/10

return to the world of the liveships traders and journey along the rain wild river in this standalone adventure from the author of the internationally acclaimed farseer trilogy. guided by the great blue dragon tintaglia, they came from the sea: a tangle of serpents fighting their way up the rain wilds river, the first to make the perilous journey to the cocooning grounds in generations. many have died along the way. with its acid waters and impenetrable forest, it is a hard place for any to survive. people are changed by the rain wilds, subtly or otherwise. one such is thymara. born with black claws and other aberrations, she should have been exposed at birth. but her father saved her and her mother has never forgiven him. like everyone else, thymara is fascinated by the return of dragons: it is as if they symbolise the return of hope to their war-torn world. leftrin, captain of the liveship tarman, also has an interest in the hatching; as does bingtown newlywed, alise finbok, who has made it her life's work to study all there is to know of dragons. but the creatures which emerge from the cocoons are a travesty of the powerful, shining dragons of old. stunted and deformed, they cannot fly; some seem witless and bestial. soon, they become a danger and a burden to the rain wilders: something must be done. the dragons claim an ancestral memory of a fabled elderling city far upriver: perhaps there the dragons will find their true home. but kelsingra appears on no maps and they cannot get there on their own: a band of dragon keepers, hunters and chroniclers must attend them. to be a dragon keeper is a dangerous job: their charges are vicious and unpredictable, and there are many unknown perils on the journey to a city which may not even exist...

you can now download eoin colfer's highfire for only 1.99$ by following this amazon associate link. this onelink will take you to the nearest amazon site serving your country and you'll see if you can take advantage of this sale.

here's the blurb:

from the new york times bestselling author of the artemis fowl series comes a hilarious and high-octane adult novel about a vodka-drinking, flashdance-loving dragon who lives an isolated life in the bayous of louisiana—and the raucous adventures that ensue when he crosses paths with a fifteen-year-old troublemaker on the run from a crooked sheriff.

in the days of yore, he flew the skies and scorched angry mobs—now he hides from swamp tour boats and rises only with the greatest reluctance from his laz-z-boy recliner. laying low in the bayou, this once-magnificent fire breather has been reduced to lighting marlboros with nose sparks, swilling absolut in a flashdance t-shirt, and binging netflix in a fishing shack. for centuries, he struck fear in hearts far and wide as wyvern, lord highfire of the highfire eyrie—now he goes by vern. however...he has survived, unlike the rest. he is the last of his kind, the last dragon. still, no amount of vodka can drown the loneliness in his molten core. vern’s glory days are long gone. or are they?

a canny cajun swamp rat, young everett “squib” moreau does what he can to survive, trying not to break the heart of his saintly single mother. he’s finally decided to work for a shady smuggler—but on his first night, he witnesses his boss murdered by a crooked constable.

regence hooke is not just a dirty cop, he’s a despicable human being—who happens to want squib’s momma in the worst way. when hooke goes after his hidden witness with a grenade launcher, squib finds himself airlifted from certain death by…a dragon?

the swamp can make strange bedfellows, and rather than be fried alive so the dragon can keep his secret, squib strikes a deal with the scaly apex predator. he can act as his go-between (aka familiar)—fetch his vodka, keep him company, etc.—in exchange for protection from hooke. soon the three of them are careening headlong toward a combustible confrontation. there’s about to be a fiery reckoning, in which either dragons finally go extinct—or vern’s glory days are back.

a triumphant return to the genre-bending fantasy that eoin colfer is so well known for, highfire is an effortlessly clever and relentlessly funny tour-de-force of comedy and action.


you can also download matt dinniman's dungeon crawler carl for only 0.99$ here.

here's the blurb:

the apocalypse will be televised!

you know what’s worse than breaking up with your girlfriend? being stuck with her prize-winning show cat. and you know what’s worse than that? an alien invasion, the destruction of all man-made structures on earth, and the systematic exploitation of all the survivors for a sadistic intergalactic game show. that’s what.

join coast guard vet carl and his ex-girlfriend’s cat, princess donut, as they try to survive the end of the world—or just get to the next level—in a video game–like, trap-filled fantasy dungeon. a dungeon that’s actually the set of a reality television show with countless viewers across the galaxy. exploding goblins. magical potions. deadly, drug-dealing llamas. this ain’t your ordinary game show.

welcome, crawler. welcome to the dungeon. survival is optional. keeping the viewers entertained is not.

the cover art that will grace both the canadian and american editions of guy gavriel kay's written on the dark has just been unveiled.

here's the blurb:

from the internationally bestselling author of tigana, all the seas of the world, and a brightness long ago comes a majestic new novel of love and war that brilliantly evokes the drama and turbulence of medieval france.

thierry villar is a well-known—even notorious—tavern poet, intimately familiar with the rogues and shadows of that world, but not at all with courts and power. he is an unlikely person, despite his quickness, to be swept into the deadly contests of ambitious royals, assassins, and invading armies.

but he is indeed drawn into all these things on a savagely cold night in his beloved city of orane. and so thierry must use all the intelligence and charm he can muster as power struggles merge with a decades-long war to bring his country to the brink of destruction.

as he does, he meets his poetic equal in an aristocratic woman and is drawn to more than one unsettling person with a connection to the world beyond this one. he also crosses paths with an extraordinary young woman driven by voices within to try to heal the ailing king — and help his forces in war. a wide and varied set of people from all walks of life take their places in the rich tapestry of this story.

both sweeping and intimate, written on the dark is an elegant tour de force about power and ambition playing out amid the equally intense human need for art and beauty, and memories to be left behind.

you can now download terry pratchett's men at arms for only 1.99$ by following this amazon associate link. this onelink will take you to the nearest amazon site serving your country and you'll see if you can take advantage of this sale.

you can also get your hands on pratchett's night watch and interesting times for the same price.

here's the blurb:

the fate of ankh-morpork rests on the unlikely shoulders of newly promoted corporal carrot and his hapless charges in the city watch in this wildly wacky discworld novel from the legendary new york times bestselling author terry pratchett.

corporal carrot is now in charge of the new recruits guarding ankh-morpork from barbarian rribes, miscellaneous marauders, unlicensed thieves, and other dangerous discworld denizens. it’s a big job for an adopted dwarf keeping the likes of young coppers lance-constable cuddy (really a dwarf), lance-constable detritus (a troll), lance-constable angua (a woman. . . most of the time) and corporal nobbs (disqualified from the human race for shoving) in line.

especially since someone in ankh-morpork has been getting dangerous ideas about crowns and legendary swords, and destiny—which points its crooked finger again when an ancient document reveals that ankh-morpork has a secret sovereign.

what's more, captain sam vimes is getting married and retiring from the watch. for good. which is a shame, because no one knows the streets of ankh-morpork or its criminal underworld better than him.

it’s the beginning of the most awesome epic encounter of all time (or at least all afternoon), in which the fate of a city—indeed of the universe itself!—depends on a young man’s courage, an ancient sword’s magic, and a three-legged poodle’s bladder.


you can also download katherine addison's the witness for the dead for only 2.99$ here.

here's the blurb:

katherine addison returns to the glittering world she created for her beloved novel, the goblin emperor, with book one of the cemeteries of amalo trilogy

locus award finalist and mythopoeic award finalist!

when the young half-goblin emperor maia sought to learn who had set the bombs that killed his father and half-brothers, he turned to an obscure resident of his father’s court, a prelate of ulis and a witness for the dead. thara celehar found the truth, though it did him no good to discover it. he lost his place as a retainer of his cousin the former empress, and made far too many enemies among the many factions vying for power in the new court. the favor of the emperor is a dangerous coin.

an anthology more than half a century in the making, the last dangerous visions is the third and final installment of the legendary science fiction anthology series.

provocative and controversial, socially conscious and politically charged, wildly imaginative yet deeply grounded, the thirty-two never-before-published stories, essays, and poems in the last dangerous visions stand as a testament to ellison’s lifelong pursuit of art, uniting a diverse range of science fiction writers both famous and newly minted, including max brooks, edward bryant, cecil castellucci, james s. a. corey, howard fast, p. c. hodgell, dan simmons, robert sheckley, adrian tchaikovsky, mildred downey broxon, and cory doctorow, among others.

the historic publication of the last dangerous visions completes the long-awaited final chapter in an incredible literary legacy.

you can now get your hands on the digital edition of jim butcher's the olympian affair for only 2.99$ by following this amazon associate link. this onelink will take you to the nearest amazon site serving your country and you'll see if you can take advantage of this sale.

here's the blurb:

the fate of the cinder spires may be decided by crossed swords in the next exhilarating fantasy adventure from the author of the dresden files, in this new york times bestselling series of noble families, swordplay, and airships.

for centuries the cinder spires have safeguarded humanity, rising far above the deadly surface world. within their halls, aristocratic houses rule, developing scientific marvels and building fleets of airships for defense and trade.

now, the spires hover on the brink of open war.

everyone knows it’s coming. the guns of the great airship fleets that control the skies between the last bastions of humanity will soon speak in anger, and spire albion stands alone against the overwhelming might of spire aurora’s armada and its new secret weapon–one capable of destroying the populations of entire spires.

a trading summit at spire olympia provides an opportunity for the spirearch, lord albion, to secure alliances that will shape the outcomes of the war, and to that end he dispatches privateer captain francis madison grimm and the crew of the ams predator to bolster the spirearch’s diplomatic agents.

it will take daring, skill, and no small amount of showmanship to convince the world to stand with spire albion–assuming that it is not already too late.

she was born on a night of storm and terror, raised in protected concealment, then banished from the only home she had ever known—an ancient enemy’s final stroke in a war begun centuries before.

secret studies of hidden lore reveal the truth of the prophecy that heralded her coming. dark dreams teach lessons of war and duty, of strategy and magecraft, that she could not learn in a thousand lifetimes.

she does not have a thousand lifetimes. she has just one—and time is running out. for the prophecy spoke not just of her, but of a great darkness that would destroy the elven kingdoms. a darkness that is coming ever closer.

she is vieliessar farcarinon and she must save her people. even if she must shatter custom and destroy the world she was born to rule . . .

i was taken aback when i saw that, on top of all the awful crap he's been accused of, there were claims that neil gaiman had based the sandman on tanith lee's tales from the flat earth series without giving her any credit. given that i've been in the field as a reviewer for twenty years now, plus being a fan of the genre for almost as long before that, i'm perplexed by the fact that i've only heard about this supposed ripoff in the last few days.

my curiosity piqued, i elected to give the first volume, night's master, a shot immediately. interestingly enough, at least on amazon, the folks from daw books recently changed the blurb and now openly claim that lee's series was the inspiration for gaiman's magnum opus. as for me, based on this first volume, i can say that there is absolutely nothing in common with the sandman so far. but i imagine that this could change as i go through subsequent installments.

here's the blurb:

night's master is the first book of the stunning arabesque high fantasy series "tales from the flat earth," which, in the manner of "the one thousand and one nights," portrays an ancient world in mythic grandeur via connected tales. long time ago when the earth was flat, beautiful indifferent gods lived in the airy upperearth realm above, curious passionate demons lived in the exotic underearth realm below, and mortals were relegated to exist in the middle. azhrarn, lord of the demons and the darkness, was the one who ruled the night, and many mortal lives were changed because of his cruel whimsy. and yet, azhrarn held inside his demon heart a profound mystery which would change the very fabric of the flat earth forever...

come within this ancient world of brilliant darkness and beauty, of glittering palaces and wondrous elegant beings, of cruel passions and undying love.

discover the exotic wonder that is the flat earth.

i wasn't expecting to be drawn into night's master so quickly, but tanith lee captured my imagination from the very first page. like one thousand and one nights, the book is a collection of interconnected short stories/vignettes that form a bigger and more far-reaching narrative with each new tale. though each one stands alone to a certain extent, most build on one another and are linked in various and sometimes unexpected ways. taken as a whole, this first volume encapsulates the mythological and whimsical nature of fairy tales. yet these are not innocent children's tales. the sex, the violence, and the themes explored make tales from the flat earth an adult fantasy series.

this was my first experience with tanith lee and i was impressed by the quality of her writing. simply put, the imagery is absolutely amazing and the prose lyrical and otherworldly. the universe, the landscapes, the protagonists, and everything else are richly depicted. night's master makes for an incredibly immersive reading experience.

azhrarn, prince	of demons and one of the lords of darkness, is the closest thing to a main character found in this book. and though he influences every tale in various ways, be it mischievous, cruel, or good-natured, he only takes center stage at the beginning and at the end. it's the diverse cast that makes night's master such a memorable read. some claim that lee doesn't spend enough time with most of them, yet overall i feel that the author did a good job to make each and everyone of them as three-dimensional as they needed to be in their story. sivesh, ferazhin flower-born, kazir the blind poet, zorayas, mirrash, bisuneh, shezael	and	drezaem, qebba; they all played a role in making this book such a compelling read.

my only complaint is that night's master is too short. weighing in at only 177 pages, you'll go through the ebook in no time. i wish lee had elaborated more on the worldbuilding and some stories could have been a little bit longer, but otherwise it was everything i wanted it to be. looking forward to the next one!

you guys should give it a shot, either out of curiosity or due to the gaiman allegations. it was a 1979 world fantasy award nominee for best novel, after all.

the final verdict: 8/10
