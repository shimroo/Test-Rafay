testimonials




chad weikel
a month ago



















for quite a few years i often read forums and always seen jeg often wandering what that meant.  two years ago getting officially started in the trap game i purchased my very first actual trap gun from joel and finally understood the rave in the name.  after purchasing another gun 6 months ago they have been nothing but honest, professional, and are there to help more than just to sell another gun.  i will recommend anyone looking to get into the shooting sports to deal with joel, rebecca and family.  10/10 satisfaction and thank you for helping me get started in something i officially come to love!
