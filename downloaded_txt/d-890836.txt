temple university burn center 





 5/5 




silon-tsr® demonstrated more comfort and better durability as compared to a conventional biosynthetic dressings for skin sloughing syndrome management. additionally, there were significant differences resulting in less nursing time required per dressing; decreased overall pain assessment and decreased costs using the silon® material.

awesome customer service! i ordered yesterday; order received today! can’t wait to use it! thank you! 






walter j. okunski, md 



plastic surgery associates 





 5/5 




the meshed autograft site provided an excellent basis for comparison – the silon-tsr® allowed the interstices of the graft to close more rapidly…allowed increased moisture vapor transmission…additionally, the fresh epithelium was not disrupted when the dressing was removed. 






sigrid blome-eberwein, md 



lehigh valley hospital burn center 





 5/5 




the dual-dress 50® dressing maintains a high absorbency (8.2 grams water per gram of foam) while demonstrating minimal changes in swelling or expansion (<20%) – further providing consistent graft contact. we now use this dressing on essentially all cases where mechanical protection and shielding of the wound is required and have found this to be significantly useful for difficult burn management. 






ingrid parry, ms, pt 



shriner’s hospital for children 





 5/5 




oleeva® fabric had the ideal combination of elasticity and strength to overcome mild eyelid retraction and prevent further contracture. furthermore, the silicone lining safely adhered to the skin, softening the scar and providing gentle compression – both key tenants of effective scar management. 






lisa forbes, msc ot reg (mb) 



winnipeg health sciences centre 





 5/5 




cost effective treatment – the durability of silon-sts® allows the silicone layer to last the life of the splint, far exceeding the use of other individual silicone gel sheets and splint materials for this scar application. this material provides another useful and effective treatment option for the burn therapist to employ in the management of neck and chin scar hypertrophy. 






maureen f. 



baltimore, md 





 5/5 




in the spring of this year i had surgery, used your scar shape product for 12wks, very happy with the results. you have a great product and excellent customer service, all at a reasonable price. you do have a superior product. in my work i am frequently asked for referrals, including scar management post-plastic surgery, and i am happy to recommend your scar shapes. 






heather hoffman, otr/l 



lehigh valley regional burn center 





 5/5 




use of silon-lts® provided a cost effective scar device that has reduced the contracture and hastened the need for contracture release. additionally, the combined use of pressure and silicone in this material helps to enhance compliance in the pediatric population and facilitate cosmeis with only limited use. 






richard j. ort, m.d.  



dermatology & laser institute of colorado 





 5/5 




the silon-tsr® dressing application decreases immediate postoperative morbidity and significantly reduces the severity and duration of erythema, and decreases the duration of swelling and crusting after laser resurfacing procedures. 






robert a. weiss, md 



the maryland laser, skin and vein institute 





 5/5 




advantages of the silon-tsr® include nonadherence to the wound, no tendency to reinjure the wound with removal, the accumulation of growth factors at the wound surface and oxygen exchange. patients prefer the dressing due to increased mobility, less accumulation of exudates at the base of the dressing and no adherence to the wound…patients rated cosmetic results better at 6 months as compared to our soc dressings.
