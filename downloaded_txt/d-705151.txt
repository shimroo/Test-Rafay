fine art gallery exhibiting paintings, prints, photography and sculpture















gregg laananen - up riverartist’s reception: thursday, february 6, 6 - 8 pmfebruary 4 - march 1, 2025gregg laananen is a self-taught artist living and working in the skagit valley in the pacific northwest. his artwork is primarily informed by observations made directly from nature. his imagery is discovered through processes of drawing, material investigation, and the role of chance and the intuition, the latter of which was highly regarded by the late artist friend and mentor, ed kamuda.the exhibition, up river, celebrates laananen’s devotion to those rural and remote places further east in the mountains and along the skagit river drainage. inspired by lush forests and mountains, waterfalls and flumes, swans and ferns, laananen creates new images from a familiar world in which we find connection and meaning.

richard morhous - juxtapositionsartist’s reception: thursday, march 6 - 8 pmmarch 6 - 29, 2025in the exhibition juxtapositions, richard morhous delves into the interplay of light, color, and emotion. he investigates the visual similarities found across two distinct continents, north america and europe, exploring how light and location influence his artistic choices. through his acrylic paintings, morhous captures unscripted, fleeting moments with people in cityscapes, urban architecture, tranquil parks, scenic coastlines, or the reflective poetic qualities of windows. his dynamic compositions invite viewers to closely examine his brushwork, experimental line drawing, and interconnected forms, often pushing the boundaries of abstraction. the artist’s careful selection of colors and mastery of light breathes life into his works, making them visually striking and engaging.
