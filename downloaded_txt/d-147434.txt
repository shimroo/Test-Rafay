“...i consider anybody a twerp who hasn’t read the greatest american short story, which is ‘occurrence at owl creek bridge,’ by ambrose bierce. it isn’t remotely political. it is a flawless example of american genius, like ‘sophisticated lady’ by duke ellington or the franklin stove.”  —kurt vonnegut

“camels and christians receive their burdens kneeling.” —ambrose bierce
bierce as adapted from the artist sanjin masic of sarajevo.



 


early (1929) biography of bierce by c. hartley grattan (1902-1980) he taught at the university of texas at austin, which holds his collections of artifacts from the southwest pacifica due to his two-year scholarly residency in australia. he also wrote for a variety of magazines. his bio of bierce is well meaning, but inadequate. although i liked the cover.



 


 
bierce and the railrogues
in ambrose bierce. collected essays and journalism, volume 28: 1896-1897, edited by david e. schultz and s. t. joshi, he takes on the railroad barons--the "railrogues"--in his column for the san francisco examiner and the new york american. publisher william randolph hearst was so intent on destroying a railroad funding bill he sent bierce to washington to muckrake, turning out more than 60 columns on the crusade. bierceâs attacks on the railroad barons became legendary, such as his vicious assault on railway magnate collis p. huntington: "though severe, he is merciful. he tempers invective with falsehood. he says ugly things of his enemy, but he has the tenderness to be careful that they are mostly lies." 
when his critics shot back, bierce returned fire: 
     in hope deferred, ambitious still to shine
     by hating me at half-a-cent a line --
     like drones among the bees of brighter wing, 
     sunless to shine and impotent to sting.
     to estimate in easy verse iâll try
     the controversial value of a lie.
     so lend your ears -- god knows you have enough!
     i mean to teach, and if i canât iâll cuff.



this twenty-eighth volume in the series is a classic example of muckraking journalism in america.

how ambrose bierce disappeared (maybe)
by  leon day
 once upon a time, there was a brave soldier. his specialty was going in front of the union armies with small units and making maps and sketches of the tricky spots on the proposed route, under fire. but he is not famous for this.  then he went west, exploring, and made the first maps of the black hills that were useful. he taught himself to write by reading the classics at a boring job at the san francisco mint, and broke into newspaper work. he became the top columnist in san francisco in a time when the writer stood behind his work with a gun, not a lawyer. he married rich, went to england, learned a lot from the writers there, and taught some tricks himself. but this is just a footnote.  
he wrote the first civil war fiction that included the terror and put the glory in its place. it was so good that a whole generation of professional officers became abject fans.  and every time the press fomented a war fever, he wrote on military subjects with a stark clarity that never forgot that the final result would be flowing blood and shattered bone. but this is poorly remembered.
