marianne paris sneider was a beloved friend and patron of the roar foundation.  when she passed away in june 2024, ms. sneiders estate plan provided that if roar raised $100,000 within a year of her death, the estate would make a matching gift of $100,000 to roar.  as of january 31, 2025, your donations to roar exceeded $100,000, and roar has met the requirements for the matching gift of $100,000 from ms. sneiders estate.
on behalf of the wild ones of shambala and the roar staff and board of directors, thank you for making this matching gift possible.  a wonderful reminder that when we work together, we can achieve great things!
