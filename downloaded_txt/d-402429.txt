the internet cello society, 
                  an international cyber-community of cellists, seeks to advance 
                  the knowledge and joy of cello playing around the world. we 
                  welcome cello enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels. we currently 
                  have over 30917 members representing 84 different countries of

we now believe it is time to hand the reins over to somebody else, and cellobello seems to be the perfect match. cellobello has taken things to the next level, with videos and live presentations, in addition to publishing its own wonderful articles by acclaimed artists. it has been my view for quite some time that cellobello has taken the baton from the ics, but now it's time to make it official.
