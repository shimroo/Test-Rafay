celebrating our 32nd year together!



formed in 1991, the boys of summer band made its debut performance at the harbour river cafe in buffalo, ny (now harry’s harbour place). playing just two wednesdays a month, the band grew into a full-time entertainment attraction and has gone on to be recognized as one of the hardest-working bands in the wny area.
our venues over the years have been numerous, including clubs, weddings, country clubs, festivals, and private events. the list goes on and on.  we are very proud of our induction into the buffalo music hall of fame in 2015. please help us celebrate this wonderful achievement by joining us at some of our public events throughout the year.
over the years, our goal has been to ensure the complete entertainment of every music lover, along with offering non-stop and lasting performances at your engagement. we know that you have your own choice of music and we appreciate it. our hope is that you’ll feel confident in our ability to meet all your expectations. our clients and fans are always our number one focus. we have been making memories in and around the western ny area with our music for over 30 years! we serve a vast number of clients, both business and social. from top 40, rock, pop, dance, country, or oldies, our job is to create the party of your dreams. let our experience perform for you.
