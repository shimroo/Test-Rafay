new luddites vs. biopiracy and ai 
a public talk at 518 valencia street, san francisco
ânew ludditesâ camila morena and jim thomas join us fresh from the latest conference on biotech at asilomar. up close and deep in the international negotiations on biodiversity, climate change, and synthetic biology, both of them have seen how the proponents of ai are working to inject their techno-fantasies into every realm. they share a cogent presentation of whatâs going on beyond our view, and how a new luddism is the sensible response.

routes of repair:  meet sfâs fix-it experts
a bike tour
with reenvision repair
in this bicycle tour through the bayview, mission, and soma, we visit 4 historic businesses dedicated to the craft of repair. these unique shops open their doors for us, revealing some of the city's most fascinating, under-the-radar workspaces. observe the alchemy of silver restoration, learn how antique mirrors are finished, marvel at centuries-old tools in a flagpole warehouse, and meet the family that's been keeping your appliances running for decades. hear stories from the shop owners themselves, interspersed with local history and conversation about combating throwaway culture. a couple of the shops offer personalized demonstrations for our group! be ready for a scenic 7-mile ride with some minor hills and not well-paved roadways. along the way, we point out additional repair shops and hidden gems filled with recycled treasures. you are invited to stay with us after the tour for drinks at decantsf bottle shop & bar.

ecology emerges
 discussions and reflections on the history of bay area ecological activism, based on oral histories documenting the past 50 years. 
ecology emergesâ is an oral history gathering project to explore the past 50 years of ecological activism in the bay area and the role that individual and institutional memories play in the development, policy proposals, and interrelationships that together make up the existing networks of ecological politics.â  we document the living ecological activist movement, in their own words, but also in a larger context of urban growth and globalization.
