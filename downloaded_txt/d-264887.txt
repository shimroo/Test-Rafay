zeppelinart is the internet's leading
                        presence of unofficial cd cover art for
                        led zeppelin, page, plant, jones and bonham.
                        spanning over 55 years of musical history this cover art
                        database speaks to the enduring legacy of the
                        band, the men, and their music.

                        called by many names--import cds, recordings of independent origin, 
						bootlegs, pirate tapes--unofficial 
                        recordings chronicle zep's concert history from
                        the perspective of an audience member. from the
                        early days of stamped vinyl jackets, to modern
                        cd digi-packs, cover art echoes the led zeppelin mystique.
