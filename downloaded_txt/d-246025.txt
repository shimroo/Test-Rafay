14.8.2019
the innovative version of the zetor crystal tractor, carrying the addition of hd, has been in serial production since september and customers can now order zetors with six-cylinder engines. i had the opportunity to try out the crystal hd for a while, right on the manufacturer’s premises. granted, there was no load, but even a brief ride brought a few interesting insights.
