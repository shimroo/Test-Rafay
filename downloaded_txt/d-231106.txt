big shout out to todd and christian for their support, guidance, inspiration and training for my orange belt test!  i’ve been training with them ever since we were all in lockdown on zoom, defending against invisible attackers with knives.  their words and presence uplifted us, during the bleak days of the pandemic.  much gratitude, respect and admiration for their experience.  these advanced black belts are the real deal!  having studied 15+ years of other martial arts styles (kung fu, bjj, muay thai), i continue to be impressed by their deep reservoir of knowledge and talent.lia w. , kmw - west l.a.
