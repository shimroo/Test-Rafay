                  as part of the innovative live/work project in atlanta, georgia.
                  


                  first place winner: georgia aci chapter 'outstanding achievement award, private residences'.
                  
the following standard procedures are the reason why we won.

integral color: we mix the color all the way through
                     the concrete for lasting, durable color (no plain concrete will show through after wear
                     & tear or accidental chipping of the driveway, pool deck, patio or walkway).
                     
slump: we pour concrete at a 2 to 4 inch slump! this means less water (more strength),
                     and less chance of cracking (no pea soup pours from us).
                     
sealer: we seal the work with high-quality hi-rez® sealer. this is a crucial
                     part of caring for your stamped work and prevents staining and premature fading of colored concrete.
                  
superior selection: we have 14 different patterns to choose from.
                  we have expanded into   spray & stencil crete®, a half-inch topical coating used to resurface
                  certain types of concrete.
