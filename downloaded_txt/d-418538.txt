 “we choose dcds because of the dedication to their students. dcds is lead by an amazing director and very knowledgeable wonderful instructors. each dancer receives high quality group training and individualized training. each dancer learns more than just dance, they learn time management, dedication, commitment and the importance of community. 
through the support of ms janet, ms mckennah and staff, the studio is a fun, safe positive environment.
we love dcds!! ❤️” – erika, dcds dance mom

 “dcds offers the most amazing technique, artistic style, age appropriate costuming and a place where my daughters have learned to respect themselves, work as a team, and perform in events that raise money and awareness for our community. it's our home away from home and miss janet and her staff are awesome!” – katie, dcds dance mom
 “dcds has offered me years of experience through weekly classes, conventions, competitions, workshops, guest artists, and many other opportunities and performances. my training has prepared me for my transition from competition dance to college dance. at dcds, i not only learned proper technique but i also learned how to pick up on choreography fast and am able to adapt to new/ different styles. dcds is a great studio!” – harmony, dcds alum dancer
 “the reason we choose dcds for our children is that it is about uninhibited, sing along, march along, laugh with your friends fun! my children have never, ever said “i don't want to go to dance class today” because it is a highlight of their week. i also appreciate the age appropriateness of the costumes and dance routines for young dancers.” – rory, dcds dance mom
