                                    housing.

                                    our books are available through the book 
                                    trade, internet book outlets, and directly 
                                    from us at this web site. 




our specialty is bicycle 
                                books, ranging from repair manuals to 
                                illustrated bicycle history books.

other books deal with 
                                other sports, including

ordering our books
sorry, but as of march 
                                    2014 we no longer operate a shopping cart on 
                                    this website. we now merely have a link to 
                                    the page for the book on amazon. of course, 
                                    we'd rather sell you the book ourselves, 
                                    since amazon takes a huge cut, so if you 
                                    want to get the book from us, send us a note with a check for just the price of the 
                                    book (we will not charge you for shipping, 
                                    and we will absorb any california sales tax 
                                    due). send to: cycle publishing llc, 1282
