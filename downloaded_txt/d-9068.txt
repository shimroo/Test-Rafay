          land acknowledgement:         

          we recognize that clearwater credit union operates in and serves members across the state of montana and beyond, and that montana is comprised of lands that are traditional territories for several indigenous nations. we offer this acknowledgment to affirm indigenous sovereignty and to offer our respect and honor for the indigenous people and the paths they have shown us in living with and caring for these lands. we also pay our respects to the elders past, present, and emerging, for they hold the memories, traditions, cultures, and hopes of indigenous peoples.
