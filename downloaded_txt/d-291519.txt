a fall is only a fall if you stop moving- otherwise it is a recovery and great recoveries score high




the rootsjonny gravitated to freestyle skiing from the beginning because of its progressive and innovative nature.  when the progression stopped in 1996, jonny noticed and fell in with a new generation of freestyle skiers.  using unorthodox training methods and adopting the 360 mute grab from his peers, he stretched the existing rules and won the 1998 olympic gold exhibiting the new style of skiing to the mainstream recreational skier.  after winning the us open slopestyle gold medal and an x games silver with his original trick, the dinner roll, jonny broke convention completely when he threw the off-axis 720 in the moguls competition at the 2002 olympics and changed the sport of freestyle skiing forever.
