“the frustration of seeing nothing that spoke to me on top of the pops in the early 80’s made me realise if i wanted to hear music that had something to say about the state of the world and real life, i’d have to make it myself. 18 months later i recorded my first lp. to mark the 40th anniversary of life’s a riot with spy vs spy, i’ve compiled a number of commemorative releases that trace the arc of my career since those fateful thursday nights.” billy bragg 2023

				hey facebook folks in georgia usa, do any of you recognise this monument? we came across it somewhere on the road between atlanta and athens in 1990 and couldn't resist stopping to film some spinal tap style fun. vaughn martinian, who shot the footage, refers to it in the fan memories book and i'm having trouble locating it. maybe it only appears on midsummers eve or something like that? can anyone tell me where it is/was?that's me, wiggy and cara tivey in the shots

				i've known mario asaro since the mid-80s when i first came to new york city. he was co-presenting a punk rock radio show called the truth at pratt institute, one of a myriad of young roustabouts who had been energised by the music of the clash. he was a regular at my gigs and over time his position as an art teacher in the new york public school system and his activism within its union, the united federation of teachers, transformed him into a reliable source of insights into american politics. he leafleted my gigs and challenged my anglo perspective.last time i saw him was at the bearsville theater in woodstock this past july and as usual we shared a few beers backstage after the show, two old comrades in the struggle.just a few weeks later he suffered a devastating spinal injury that has left him paralysed from the neck down. his family and friends are raising funds to help him continue to have an active role in his home and community. make a donation to his gofundme page to send mario some support and solidarity as he faces the greatest struggle of all.

				if you've been thrown by trump's suggestion of ethnic cleansing in gaza, or his on/off trade wars with america's neighbours, or his willingless to let elon musk take a chainsaw to usaid, i would encourage you to watch this short video. ezra klein's argues that, far from projecting strength, trump's actions are a sign of the fundamental weakness of his administration.how so?the republicans have wafer thin majorities in both the house and senate. if trump were to ask for congress to approve of any one of his flurry of policies before proceeding, it would only take a few dissenting republicans to bring down the initiative. if the house were to debate the pros and cons of a trade war with canada and mexico, or the constitutional right to birthright citizenship, trump's weaknesses would be exposed. letting elon musk loose on the institutions of the american state is likewise a performative attempt to appear all powerful, an illusion which seeks to dazzle the opposition. the aim is to cause panic, to make us feel overwhelmed, exhausted and ultimately supine. imagine trump in the signal box, pulling all the levers at the same time in an attempt to derail the train of state so that he and his cronies can plunder its valuable cargoes.but it's a slow moving train and the constitutional rails that it runs on are sturdy. the courts will likely halt some of trump's more egregious policies, allowing the opposition both within congress and without to mount a campaign against this attempted coup.as klein points out in the clip, trump's mandate is wafer thin. yes he won the popular vote, but the margin of his victory, 1.48% is the lowest for a winning candidate for over 50 years. he entered office with approval ratings lower than any other president in us history - 47% - ten points lower than joe biden when he took office in 2021. among trump's acolytes in the republican party and the media, anything that he says is regarded as the truth, no matter how outlandish. but his ability to make good on those statements relies on everyone outside of the maga world believing what he says too. don't believe him.
