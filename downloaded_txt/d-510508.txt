mission statement
the program in chican@ & latin@ studies (cls) offers a systematic and interdisciplinary analysis of mexican- and latin american-origin people, cultures, and collectivities within the united states.  the cls certificate and major are designed to provide students with a broad knowledge base and the intellectual tools to understand the unity and diversity of u.s. latina/o populations.  the primary objective of the cls program is to train students in the study of chican@s and latin@s and to introduce them to the central questions, topics, and applications that have emerged in this field of inquiry.  cls offers a variety of courses, some focusing on particular national-origin groups or specific academic disciplines, and others organized around comparative topics or issues.  we welcome you to join our community of learners.
