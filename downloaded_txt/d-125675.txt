public service announcment 2


oct. 24th, 2012 at 12:11 am



 


14pearl84i've decided to create a friends group filter to put my  "therapist" posts in. those who voted in the poll about what you'd like to read about being a new therapist were automatically put into this filter. people i know in real life, who are good friends were also automatically put into this filter.if you wish to be added to this filter you need to comment and say why you'd like to be added. meaning tell me your interest in these posts. next if you wish to remain on the filter let me know you are reading and i don't mean that you need to enter into intellectual discussion or anything, i mean let me know some of your thoughts, ask questions or say hmm interesting or, duh i knew that... something.there is also a few other's i added automatically because i knew they had some connection to therapy or might benefit from reading about being a new therapist.i'm going to likely be keeping this filter small, even smaller than the adoption filter. asking doesn't mean you will be added but i'll consider it. i want to make sure i know things about the people reading these posts about therapy, being a therapist etc.btw you will know if you are in the filter if you click on the tag "therapist" and see about 20-40 posts.

race religion and rescue processing the conference.


oct. 20th, 2012 at 10:39 pm



 


14pearl84i am home from the st. john's biennial adoption conference. i think i've come to be remembered as the girl that made the comment about religion and belief in night one. ill recap because it was also memorable in my mind. we were shown a film on the evangelical christian adoption movement and folks talking about their faith guiding them or god calling them to adopt a child.i commented that if you work in an area where race must be addressed we have a dialogue, we can debate race theory, color blindness and so forth, but what we cannot do is call into question a true and sincere religious belief. so i asked the audience to imagine substituting every instance of god with gods or goddess, mass or church with ritual and prayer with spell. i was feeling anxious and my body temp was rising with anxiety but apparently this caused an audible gasp in the crowd. people did approach me afterwards to talk about my perspective.i've been working to process my experience since leaving these amazing academics, researchers, friends and brethren. i noticed quickly that i was " a carrot in a bunch of peas" or so i thought. it walked into a situation where i noticed i was "only" at work i am one of only four social workers, three white, one african american and a client population of immigrants from the caribbean, south america, africa and so forth. most of my clients are significantly darker skinned than i. i am the other. i think every white person should experience this sense of people stopping and looking at you because of your skin color at least once. i say this because my clients confront this on a day to day basis, or perhaps a minute to minute basis. i must confront my whiteness.i noticed i was one of a few domestic adoptees, who is white in a white family, who didn't loose a language and a culture. i was born american. w discussed allies and otherness. i was struck by be kindness of the transracial, transnational adoptees. again i am struck by my own learning and the gift of learning from them. my clients are constantly teaching and i owe it to them to be constantly striving to deal with difference and race. one would think white adoptees perhaps don't relate to the transracial or international, transnational adoptee experience.i found this to be incredibly untrue. my story is not terribly different, and it's completely different. what i have is a new language to describe my experiences. i lost a regionalism, an accent, a particular white way of thinking. lets face it living in the city and working in an urban setting means i see and interact with many more  people of color than i would have growing up in wisconsin, despite the fact that my step siblings are biracial. what i can now talk about differently is "passing". part of how i was matched to my adoptive family is because of complexion, brow hair, green eyes. my adoptive sister has a build that when she stands near my adoptive mother, it is clear she is her daughter and because people think she and i looked similar they presumed i looked like my father, not knowing i was adopted.i have tremendous guilt about passing and allowing the lie of omission to occur, i get a choice about revealing adoption status while many do not have such an option. i have also taken to at times laughing outright at the notion that i look like someone who cannot possibly be my father, he met me when i was 12 and adopted me at 16. so the visual stuff still comes into play there. it comes more into play with my adoptive brother who could not pass being a slight olive color with dark eye and kinky curly hair. i can recall people staring if i think about it for a bit. i saw this with my korean adoptee roommates in college, people looking at them, staring because they are too white, not white enough, not asian enough, for umpteen number of reasons and witnessing them feel it. i never before had any words to really talk about what that feels like, what my experience felt like.i do not generally think if myself as a minority, yet i am double other. i am other, adoptee. i am other, religiously, wiccan. now i at times do avoid disclosure. i have had a few instances where i've gotten emotionally burned. my first week, my first year of college i went to the lgbtq group and was called "oh,one of those....your straight?! a gay lover..." i never went back. i was subsequently invited my junior year by a good friend and i immediately said no. she came back to me and asked for details and became very angry that i had been treated that way, she apologized, but the damage was done. i was clearly outside and clearly not welcome by the group and i am not someone to go where i am unwelcome or where i will make it awkward for other people who want safe space.i have also been told on many occasions at college that i was forcing my way into being a minority and that i would never understand what it is to be marginalized and that i would never truly be in a minority.  it wasn't something that happened only one time. it wasn't only one person or one group of people. forget that adoptees are such a tiny population, and that by that fact i am a minority, even when i don't think of myself that way. the same is true of being wiccan. the truth is i am in two minority groups but my primary position is being an ally to others in various ways.i cannot say there are zero times where that becomes painful. i do get called racist by clients, and get the brunt sometimes of years of suppression, oppression, hate that has come from people that look something like meat them. i'm not saying its okay, i understand the need for an outlet and to have a witness that tells them what has happened to them is not okay, it was never okay and to feel for their hurt. this is part of what i mean when i talk about my job in that setting being an honor, to be someone trusted to bear witness. to be someone who can listen and use this to guide practice with clients who are in any way different than i am.i was so very accepted by other adoptees. for some reason they were interesting in knowing my story and i feel truly heard and yeah this was awesome for me..(also got to meet people who are in my mind, famous)i thnk this is really all i can process right now. there is much more to be said and frankly, i am missing my people. my adoptee people.p.s. i also need to post about my talk.posted via livejournal app for ipad.

14pearl84if you are interesting in reading my posts on adoption you need to post a request comment to this post to be added to the filter that would allow you to read them.  i've chosen not to make ther adoption related entires public or "friends only" up to this point because there are some people who feel it necessary to tell everyone all of the contents and make a big deal out of nothing. it has happened in the past, you know who you are.if you cannot handle the truth and the facts of my life you may choose not to read  and choose not to comment, or of course just don't ask to be added to the filter.if you see posts when you click on the adoption or adoption stuffs filter then you are already authorized to read those posts, yay!.please note that even if you are added to those groups it does not mean that you will be able to read all of my journal, no one except me has gained that privalage. and a request don't gaurentee permission to read but mostly likely it does :)

so how'd that interview go?


mar. 5th, 2012 at 9:52 am



 


14pearl84yes, saturday i had an interview with the chicago tribune. the reporter was writing an article on the 2010 open records law. as of november 2011 i was able to request my original birth certificate, obc for short. i did, on the day i was allowed to do so. i heard many stories of people having their forms sent back if they sent it in too early. i've heard stories about the people who "bother" the vital records have been getting letters back that their records was "unable to be located".i spent some time on the phone with the reporter who explained that the chicago tribune is about equivalent to the new york times, that they went after the "big guys". i had no idea about that, i just thought hey, i can help the cause a bit by telling my story. so she informed me that the article despite her getting an even line on the issue had been quashed not by her editor but by that editor's editor and higher up. so apparently that's a big issue.she said watch the newspaper in the upcoming weeks for an article from another viewpoint. she said to sort of read between the lines that there were bigger politics in play in this. she also reminded me that letters to the editor are the most read parts of the newspaper. don't give up.on one hand i am disheartened because the article was crushed. on the other hand i am reassured that someone out there, a non-adoptee, is fighting for what is rightfully ours. so yes once i see a new, news article, i'll post it and send off my editor letters.bottom line, bummer!

today's excitment


mar. 3rd, 2012 at 8:18 am



 


14pearl84at 10am est i will be on candid adoption talk on blog radio with cathie :) yay! it will be me as my psychotherapist self chatting with her about adoption issues. below is the link so you should be able to listen in at about 10am and i think, you'll be able to replay the show later on if you miss it but i will clarify that for y'all.http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cathiecats/2012/03/03/chattingjean-provance-adoption-psychotherispt-open-topics-1edit**** something must have happened, the host didn't call in so right now there is no show to hear :( boo! i will update again if there is ever another show scheduled.next and perhaps even more exciting i have a phone interview with a woman from the chicago time at 11am today to talk about the open records law in illinois. the chicago tribune is a pretty big paper out there, and the reported wanted to talk to me. of all people...just for reference i still do not have my obc. i haven't heard anything from vital records. i am thinking that i won't see anything for at least 2 more months. amending my birth certificate after my name change took 6 months for me to see a copy of it and it's "only" been since november. i admit i am rehearsing in my head things i might say. i am hoping not to look bad this morning... hopefully i will be able to link the article in the chicago tribune when it is published.

two cheers for teenage mothers


feb. 25th, 2012 at 10:24 am



 


14pearl84http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-tribal-imagination/201106/two-cheers-teenage-mothers-0two cheers for teenage mothersnintety-nine percent of your female ancestors were teenage mothers.published on june 4, 2011 by robin fox in the tribal imagination i have kept promising to deal with this topic and not delivering, partly because i expect you know what i am going to say. the "problem" of teenage pregnancy is a further example of the burdens civilization puts on our evolved human natures. faced with the consequences of these burdens the media will scream "epidemic" and the social scientists "pathology" (and demand more funds to study the problem.) but let us try to assimilate the lessons of our earlier examples. what we have here in the usa, and to some extent in the developed world generally, is the "problem" of healthy, fertile, active, post-adolescent females of childbearing age having babies. what exactly is the problem here? isn't this what they are supposed to be doing?our answers tell the story. yes, they are supposed to, but not until they are out of school, married with an economic support system, and successfully launched on some route to gainful employment. but wait a minute, this is not a problem with the girls and their babies but with the context in which they have to have them. it is all very well, you will say, to claim that they are doing what comes naturally, but the world they live in is not natural. it has laid down certain conditions for them to have babies most of which require that they go through adolescence without having babies while they fit themselves for life in the world as we have defined it for them. this is indeed a world manufactured according to a male view of the life cycle in which the adolescent years should be spent proving oneself ready for adulthood, accumulating knowledge and skills, and setting up the conditions to have and support a family. in the developed world this period of transition to adulthood gets further and further expanded, as the skills needed become more and more complex. for women to "compete" in this world they have to forget any ideas of early motherhood and follow the male pattern, with the help of child care and legal abortions. the women's movement itself demands the "right" to do this and his been largely successful. to be a "success" in this man's world you have to be better at being a man than the men are. in the developing rest of the world this pattern is not set. as a rough estimate the less developed the country the higher the rates of teenage pregnancy. dividing the societies in the united nations demographic yearbook roughly into the two categories and look at the percentage of births to women under twenty. in the developed countries it is (again roughly) 40%, and in the developing 90%. until very, very recently in the world's history the latter was the "normal" rate. it was also the biologically sensible strategy. if average life expectancy was around 35, with many women never seeing menopause, and if the infant mortality rate was up to 80%, then the reproductively successful strategy would be to have children early (menarche would have been at about sixteen plus) and every year thereafter. as we saw in an earlier blog, in the developed world, ironically, the age at menarche has been rapidly dropping until now ten to twelve (and below) is not uncommon. this would have been a reproductive advantage in the past, but in the "developed" present it only compounds the "problem" of "babies having babies." we do not want them to do this in their adolescent years, but we are, probably as a result of artificial lighting, pushing the possibility to younger and younger ages. this is a real problem.is there any reason other than the massive inconvenience that it causes us because of our male-dominated career expectations, to think teenage mothers are incapable of excellent motherhood? none whatsoever. if it were so we would not be here discussing this "problem." ninety-nine percent of your female ancestors were teenage mothers. natural selection understands very well that given a support system the teenage mother is the best mother. spontaneous abortions, for example, are much less frequent than with older women. serious health problems are many times more likely with births to older women. watch a teenage mother cradling her baby and the deep intuitive sense of care that she exhibits. if something is "pathological" here it not her and her baby; it is us and the conditions that we impose on her. we can claim this is "progress" or whatever we like. but we are responsible for telling her body something it knows is wrong: that it is not ready for motherhood and must postpone this indefinitely until it meets the novel demands of (male) industrial civilization.the usa in fact with a teen pregnancy rate hovering between 50% and 60% us teenage moms could be seen as leading the revolt against the unnatural conditions of advanced industrial civilization. rates peaked in the eighties, declined in the nineties and now seem to be on the rise again. the decline in teen birthrates is attributed to legal abortions and that in pregnancies to increased use of contraceptives. no one seems able to account for the rise. lower teenage birthrates in less developed "developed" countries are often the result of aggressive abortion policies. there are differences for race, class, ethnic and religious categories and combinations of these. all these are interesting, but the fact remains that many teenage girls who could perfectly well use contraception do not do so, and do what their bodies and millions of years of evolution are telling them to do and having babies.if the whole society has to take care of them then that is a reasonable evolutionary expectation too. "a support system" of some sort or other was always assumed to be part of the scheme; young mothers were not expected to survive alone. at least they had their female relatives and some form of male help: males with a stake in the children - from husbands to maternal uncles, providing protection and bringing home the animal protein. if this is not there for them now it is not their fault but ours. the answer to the "problem" may lie not in some kind of re-education of perfectly normal young women, but in a re-thinking of the female life trajectory that we have thrust upon them, a life trajectory that is essentially male. to do this of course would fly in the face of all the "progress" claimed by the women's movements over the past fifty years. equality may have been wrongly defined in the first place. in any case, it comes at a cost. perhaps we can't put the clock back, but we can try to make better use of the time.

what babies learn before they're born by annie murphy paul, special to cnn updated 11:28 am est, sun


dec. 19th, 2011 at 10:16 am



 


14pearl84http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/11/opinion/paul-ted-talk/index.html?hpt=hp_t3editor's note: annie murphy paul is the author of "origins: how the nine months before birth shape the rest of our lives." she's now working on a book about learning, and writes a weekly column at time.com called "brilliant: the science of smart." ted is a nonprofit organization dedicated to "ideas worth spreading," which it distributes through talks posted on its website.(cnn) -- when does learning begin? as i explain in the talk i gave at ted, learning starts much earlier than many of us would have imagined: in the womb.i was surprised as anyone when i first encountered this notion. i'm a science writer, and my job is to trawl the murky depths of the academic journals, looking for something shiny and new -- a sparkling idea that catches my eye in the gloom. annie murphy paul: learning before birthstarting a few years ago, i began noticing a dazzling array of findings clustered around the prenatal period. these discoveries were generating considerable excitement among scientists, even as they overturned settled beliefs about when we start absorbing and responding to information from our environment. as a science reporter -- and as a mother -- i had to find out more.this research, i discovered, is part of a burgeoning field known as "fetal origins," and it's turning pregnancy into something it has never been before: a scientific frontier. obstetrics was once a sleepy medical specialty, and research on pregnancy a scientific backwater. now the nine months of gestation are the focus of intense interest and excitement, the subject of an exploding number of journal articles, books, and conferences.what it all adds up to is this: much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life -- the air she breathes, the food and drink she consumes, the chemicals she's exposed to, even the emotions she feels -- are shared in some fashion with her fetus. they make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself. the fetus treats these maternal contributions as information, as what i like to call biological postcards from the world outside.by attending to such messages, the fetus learns the answers to questions critical to its survival: will it be born into a world of abundance, or scarcity? will it be safe and protected, or will it face constant dangers and threats? will it live a long, fruitful life, or a short, harried one?the pregnant woman's diet and stress level, in particular, provide important clues to prevailing conditions, a finger lifted to the wind. the resulting tuning and tweaking of the fetus's brain and other organs are part of what give humans their enormous flexibility, their ability to thrive in environments as varied as the snow-swept tundra in siberia and the golden-grassed savanna in africa.the recognition that learning actually begins before birth leads us to a striking new conception of the fetus, the pregnant woman and the relationship between them.the fetus, we now know, is not an inert blob, but an active and dynamic creature, responding and adapting as it readies itself for life in the particular world it will soon enter. the pregnant woman is neither a passive incubator nor a source of always-imminent harm to her fetus, but a powerful and often positive influence on her child even before it's born. and pregnancy is not a nine-month wait for the big event of birth, but a crucial period unto itself -- "a staging period for well-being and disease in later life," as one scientist puts it.this crucial period has become a promising new target for prevention, raising hopes of conquering public health scourges like obesity and heart disease by intervening before birth. by "teaching" fetuses the appropriate lessons while they're still in utero, we could potentially end vicious cycles of poverty, infirmity and illness and initiate virtuous cycles of health, strength and stability.so how can pregnant women communicate to their fetuses what they need to know?eat fish, scientists suggest, but make sure it's the low-mercury kind -- the omega-three fatty acids in seafood are associated with higher verbal intelligence and better social skills in school-age children. exercise: research suggests that fetuses benefit from their mothers' physical activity. protect yourself from toxins and pollutants, which are linked to birth defects and lowered iq.don't worry too much about stress: research shows that moderate stress during pregnancy is associated with accelerated infant brain development. seek help if you think you might be suffering from depression: the babies of depressed women are more likely to be born early and at low birth weight, and may be more irritable and have more trouble sleeping. and -- my favorite advice -- eat chocolate: it's associated with a lower risk of the high blood pressure condition known as preeclampsia.when we hold our babies for the first time, we imagine them clean and new, unmarked by life, when in fact they have already been shaped by the world, and by us. it's my privilege to share with the ted audience the good news about how we can teach our children well from the very beginning.
