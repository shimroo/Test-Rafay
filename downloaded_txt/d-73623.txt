i am one of those unfortunate souls that broke a glow plug with a piece still in the threaded part of the head (2003 mk4 alh golf).    i am in suffolk va and being that i have maintained my tdi from day one as the original owner i can pull the head and drive it up to you if you still perform the broken glow plug removal.  is this something you still do?  please dm me either way
