blaikiewell animal sanctuary
is a small charity in deeside, aberdeenshire, uk.  it is home to over 50 horses and 
ponies, four pigs and three cows as well as dogs, cats and any other animal or bird that needs a safe place. 
   the first pony was bought on impulse in 1977 at the local market to save her from meat dealers who were bidding for the ponies.  the following week we got a friend for her, also from the meat market.  bracken was 28 guineas, and her friend willow was 96 pounds. (that put me into overdraft).   other homeless ponies began to arrive from various sources and none were turned away.
