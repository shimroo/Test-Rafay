"i worked at google for six years as a site reliability engineer, software engineer, internal startup co-founder, plus a couple of short rotations as a cs instructor. i was picking universities based specifically on the cs education research groups, and dr. kelleher's work seemed like the most interesting and the most similar to the type of thing i wanted to do."
