 how are we different from other law firms?
we are a small civil litigation boutique. our founder, edwin j. schklar, spent his first four years of practice as a prosecutor for the u.s. army and the u.s. attorney in washington, d.c. edwin returned to atlanta and practiced at one of the world’s largest law firms, jones day. edwin has conducted more than 200 trials in federal and state courts, which is extremely unusual for most civil litigators. edwin subsequently decided to create a small law firm that limits its practice solely to civil litigation and to provide the highest level of legal services in a setting that allows for greater efficiency and more reasonable fee arrangements than many large firms. in short, edwin created our firm to provide clients with better service at better prices. consequently, we successfully represent very large clients, as well as small businesses and individuals. see our proven track record of success. our firm is truly unique. we believe that we provide a true bargain to our clients.
how do we give you the best opportunity for a successful outcome?
in order to achieve success, we make sure that we understand our client’s goals. we carefully and meticulously study the factual evidence and the applicable law. we seek every competitive and strategic advantage, and we carefully coordinate every significant decision with our client. success is usually achieved through hard work, strategic skill, careful planning, and meticulous organization. we also promptly respond to all client communications and constantly keep our client well informed. we have successfully represented clients in some of the largest and most complex litigation in the country, as well as individuals in relatively simple, but equally important matters.
