  to unsubscribe my subscriptions  

 i'm not sure how many of you have the same experience as me.
occasionally, you might be interested in some companies' newsletter and you decided to subscribe to them through their website.
things were fine at first, getting the latest updates every now and then. until..
they are sending the newsletter so frequent, they look more like spam when you hear from them every single day.
you have simply lost your interest and you do not want to know anything regarding or related to them.
when you decided to stop all these spams, here comes the toughest part. how do you unsubscribe? 
usually, there are 2 ways:
if you are lucky, they will provide you with a link at the bottom of the newsletter to allow you to unsubscribe.
after you've clicked on the unsubscribe link, this is usually what happened...

over the next few months, i tried the same every time i receive the newsletter and as expected, the page is showing the 'unexpected error occurred'.
another way to unsubscribe, is to do it the same way as you subscribe, by visiting the website again and find the correct link. this is what happened in wizzair website (i was interested in them cause i was staying in hungary 5 years ago, and i still can't stop this newsletter till now).
on their landing page, you'll be very happy to see this little box showing how easy it is to unsubscribe...

and so i tried. i entered my email address, select unsubscribe and hit the save button...

hmm....ok..doesnt look as easy as i thought.
anyway, i followed as instructed and tried to login to unsubscribe. my problem is, i don't remember my password. so i clicked on the 'hint' below the login trying to retrieve my password.
what do i get? nah....

ok...give up...

  happy belated birthday  

 it was my birthday yesterday and few people have been reminding me on this blog while they wished me.
yes, it's been a while and i do feel sorry to leave this blog for such a long time, but time has not been sufficient for me to update here and of course, 90% of the root cause is because i was infected by the highly contagious virus among human mankind, called, lazitheliosis (aka i-am-lazy).
till i've found the cure, happy belated birthday to me!

  the visit to macau, the city of dreams  

 well, i know it's been a while. but since i've started the first part of my hong kong trip, might as well continue with my macau trip after that although it's long overdue. 
the hotel we stayed weren't quite fascinating compared to the one we had in hong kong.
emperor hotel

if you have forgotten my traveling team, here you go, 3 of them trying very hard to look cute. 

this is the iconic casino in macau, grand lisboa.

looks grand? i didn't enter lisboa though, as it is more suitable for 'serious investors'. tourists like us went to city of dreams, hard rock and venetian only.




there are not too many tourist spots in macau to be honest. well, macau itself is quite small to start with. we could finish visiting all the spots in a day.
first, we walked to st. dominic's church...

not forgetting, of course the most famous landmark, the ruins of st. paul's...

at night, we went to fisherman's wharf which should be visited during the day as well.

i'm pretty sure the place would be more interesting during the day, but since we didn't have much time, we just enjoyed having a taste of the local beer overseeing the spectacular bridge...


some people would ask if i would like to revisit macau again. for a non-gambler like me, i would say, no. for a tourist......well, not really. but, for food, yeeeaaaasssss !!! 
if you have read your history enough, or if you have your general knowledge broadened enough, you should know that macau's culture is pretty much influenced by the portuguese. hence, trying out their portuguese cuisine is one of the must-do in macau. we were recommended by the taxi driver to try this jumbo restaurant.

i've not really tried the authentic portuguese dishes before and i'm not sure if this restaurant really serve good portuguese dishes, but it wasn't really my cup of tea.
rather, i really lurrvvveeeee the pork chop burger...

the portuguese tart and milk tea...

and the crab porridge...

it was sooooooooooo niceeee!!!!
i'm salivating now. ok, let's plan for the next macau trip!

  the 2nd visit to the chinese pearl of the orient  

 another old post, please bear with me. 
i went to hong kong for the first time in 2009. on 13th till 15th nov 2010, i went to the same place for the second time, but this time, we skipped all the tourist spots, and focused on just 2 things, eat and shop!
i'm trying not to make this post as my travel log. so it will only be a summary of what we have done.
first, let me introduce my traveling partners...

yes, it was an all girls trip. ~pretty girls~ *ahem*. 
the above photo was taken at the royal plaza hotel lift and below would be the interior of the hotel...


not bad, huh? the room was pretty spacious and comfortable, and we didn't pay much for 4 person.
going for good food during peak hours in hong kong would mean joining in the long looonnnggg queue...

the food we had...

other than food, we visited wong tai sin temple, which was the only tourist spot we went.


it doesn't matter if someone is religious or not, shaking these bamboo sticks seems to be a must-do task when one is there.

the place has turned into such commercialized place that even exchanging a piece of paper bearing the same number with the stick would need us forking out hk$2. we then look for a soothsayer to help us interpret the fortune on the paper. of course the service didn't come for free either. there were many of them sitting right outside of the temple.

on the first night in hong kong, lewis-the-lulunee, invited us to join his friends to a bbq session at shek o beach.




on 2nd night, we went to tsim sha tsui for a drink...



the most satisfied outcome from this hong kong trip was of course the shopping experience for the past 3 days...

thanks to our 'official' tour guide...lewis-the-lulunee...

we had such a great time in hong kong, i don't mind coming again for the third time.
