worship 



stronger together 



worship at shepherd is a holy spirit empowered, christ-centered experience that bridges our past and present and allows all people to participate together to grow closer to jesus. 






worship with us















small groups 



live better connected 



small groups are at our core because god designed us for community, knowing that spiritual growth and life change happen best when we are connected. jesus himself modeled this by ‘doing life together’ with his own small group.

serving 



others first 



we believe the church exists for those inside and outside its walls. shepherd is committed to using our hands and feet to meet the physical and spiritual needs of the world around us.
