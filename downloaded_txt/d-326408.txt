    welcome to christ church




    it’s a pleasure to have you with us today




    


  my hope is that, whether you’re a seasoned church-goer or visiting our website or building for the first time, you get a glimpse of the true and living god and meet with him here at christ church virginia water.

across the website, you’ll find different people associated with the various ministries and activities which make up the life of our church. if you have any questions, or would like to know more, please do contact them via the email links, or chat to us in person on a sunday.



    it is a privilege to be vicar at christ church virginia water.
i often think of king david’s words in psalm 122, and i hope they will be true for you today as well:i rejoiced with those who said to me, “let us go to the house of the lord” with every good wish,

 




    welcome!
christ church seeks warmly to welcome everyone to our sunday gatherings and midweek meetings. we hope that you find here a place of refreshment, love, challenge, and hope. jesus himself demonstrated unflinching generosity towards people, and along with him, we wish to do the same: to all who are weary and in need of rest; to all who mourn and in need comfort; to all who fail and need strengthening; and to all who sin and need a saviour, christ church opens its doors wide, and offers the love and welcome of jesus christ our lord!
