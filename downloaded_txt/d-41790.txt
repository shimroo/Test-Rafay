a rare opportunity . . .
this area of the adirondack state park is one of the few spots in
the world where half the area is covered by clear lakes, ponds, and
rivers, high in the mountains, with solitude, yet in sight of all services
and amenities. with most adirondack park land so severely restricted
this is a rare investment opportunity. mt. pisgah is located in one of
the few areas zoned "hamlet" by the adirondack park agency, where
up to 100 housing units are permitted without agency review. this outstanding property is impossible to duplicate!
mount pisgah overlooks mountain ranges in every direction, five lakes, and thousands of acres of some of the most aesthetic parkland in the united states. visible from all directions, it stands like a sentinel, with the village of saranac lake in its lap.

located in one of the most beautiful areas of the world,
saranac lake, new york is a tourist, research and college community — the
largest in the adirondack park. it is the home of the american management association, trudeau research laboratory, four state agencies, paul smith's college and north country community college. there are airports, ski hills, country clubs, golf courses, beaches, fishing, water sports and interesting shops; making it the trading center for
the adirondack mountain area.

the internationally famous olympic village of lake placid is
nine miles away with arenas, training facilities, ski jumps, skating
rinks, boat trips, and a complete summer and winter resort community.
there is golf, tennis, water athletics, art center, performing arts theater,
a horse show, as well as excellent hotels, restaurants and smart shops.
albany is 150 miles, new york city 300 miles, and montreal is
120 miles away. although one half of the nation's population is within
one days drive or three hours by air, the area is remote, thinly populated
and unspoiled, with clean air and pure lakes.
