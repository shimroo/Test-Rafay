working mostly linux migrations
for the past serveral years many of my clients are migrating from 
netware to oes linux, either oes2 (sles10) or oes11 (sles11). oes11 is working 
well, and the migration bugs i saw early in the oes1 and oes2 days are mostly 
fixed.  i've done migrations of file, iprint, dns, dhcp, ifolder, and groupwise 
recently, and all have been successful.  filr is becoming an interesting product. 
groupwise 2012 and 2014 are working well.  aside from taking old netware shops into the 
linux world (or microsoft), i've been doing a few cisco asa projects replacing 
old bordermanager servers.  i've also been setting up vmware esxi servers, doing 
physical to virtual migrations, and setting up iscsi san's.

the bordermanager replacement is working well
the superlumin nemesis server has been released for some time now, 
and i've used it for all my network access between 2010 and 2011.  it 
has proven to be quite stable for me.   i've been starting to do server migrations, 
and i'd like to do more!  also, i have completed work on revision 1 of my 
newest book - migrating from bordermanager to superlumin nemesis.  see the link 
below.

bordermanager to superlumin migrations book
i've finished a new book called 'migrating from bordermanager to 
superlumin nemesis".  this new ebook is available online at
