ushi no tane - a harvest moon, river king, and story of seasons help site


































the ushi no tane website was started by cherubae in 2000 to help players with questions regarding their 
		harvest moon games. originally a site covering just harvest moon 2 for 
		gameboy color, it has expanded to cover 28 versions of the harvest moon game series as well as the story of seasons game series.

harvest moon is a farming simulation game with an underlining storyline that add depth to 
			break up the daily monotony of watering crops. in the games, players have 
			the option of getting married, raising livestock and poultry animals, catching fish, and attending 
			festivals to impress the local villagers.
harvest moon (bokujou monogatari) was first published in japan in 1996 by 
			pack in video; the company, after several mergers, is currently known as marvelous. 
			in north america, the game was published by natsume, inc. in 1998. natsume 
			handled the english version up until harvest moon: a new beginning. in 2014, marvelous annnounced that it 
			will be using its north american localization branch, xseed games (marvelous usa), 
			to translate bokujou monogatari into english under its own title, story of seasons. natsume still owns the 
			harvest moon trademark and will continue to develop the series independently of marvelous.
future story of seasons games will now be published by marvelous and not xseed games, as marv wants to increase 
			its brand awareness in the western markets.
outside north america, localization has been handled by rising star games, 
			marvelous europe, and nintendo of europe.

the ushi no tane website is also the only english help site that covers the legend of the river king 
		game series (kawa no nushi tsuri), which predates harvest moon in japan by six years. the first river king game was released for 
		the super famicom video game console in 1990. the rk guides on this site are for the gameboy, gameboy advanced, 
		playstation 2, and nintendo ds entries in the series. river king is basically a dead series with no expectation of future game releases.
