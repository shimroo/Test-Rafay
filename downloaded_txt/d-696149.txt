bridget did an excellent job with the sale of our home. the house sold very quickly and she
helped us navigate multiple offers. she was quick to respond and answered all the questions we
had throughout the process. she provided a clear timeline for all tasks that had to be completed
and followed up regularly to ensure a timely closing. i would wholeheartedly recommend
bridget to others looking to buy or sell a home.

gregory rowe, gibsonia, pa




ginny was extremely professional in all aspects of the sale. she was very knowledgeable of the
market. she was highly approachable and responded in a very timely manner to all my questions
and concerned. she went above and beyond to schedule and expedite the changes needed for the
occupancy inspection. overall, ginny was a pleasure to work with and we couldn't be more
pleased with her results. 

judith notarnicola, winter garden, fl




it was a pleasure working with kim and century-21. after our first meeting, it was obvious kim
new her job and would keep my best interest in mind as my aunt's house was put on the market.
thanks !!! good job !!!

mary ann worked a long time to find a home for me in pa. i appreciate her efforts. great! i'm a
satisfied customer. 

judy milliren, albuquerque nm




as first-time homebuyers, we were unprepared for the wide range of features and services that we'd have to consider when buying a home, but nicole edwards was instrumental in making the process accessible and understandable.  we also worried that we were too picky sometimes and perhaps a burden to work with, but nicole never once made us feel that way, she was always available for questions and always had a welcoming attitude.  most importantly she's very real, not aloof, not confusing...a person that has been through house-buying too; i can't understate how much that helps.  thanks nicole :).

y smith, lower burrell




it only took us a day to view houses and another day to get my offer accepted. she immediately
lined me up with houses to view and knew what price to offer. the house selection timeframe
was record breaking. during inspection, we had a stubborn seller but patti was great about
informing me of my options and very quick to communicate. i underestimated how much i
would need her for that, and beyond thankful for her help. she works great with all parties and
has local connections. you can tell she has an ideal reputation around here. as a first time buyer,
her overall experience and “nothing we can’t handle” mindset put me at ease, which was
priceless. couldn’t ask for a better experience.
