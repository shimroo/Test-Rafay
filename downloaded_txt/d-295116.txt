f h warr & sons ltd is an appointed representative of automotive compliance ltd who is authorised and regulated by the financial conduct authority (fca no. 497010). automotive compliance ltd’s permissions as a principal firm allows f h warr & sons ltd to act as a credit broker, not a lender, for the introduction to black horse financial services and to act as an agent on behalf of the insurer for insurance distribution activities only.
we are a credit broker and not a lender. we act on behalf of the lender for this introduction and not as your agent. we are not impartial, and we are not an independent financial advisor.
our approach is to introduce you to black horse financial services , who are usually able to offer the best available package for you, taking into account both interest rates and other contributions. our aim is to secure a suitable finance agreement for you that enables you to achieve your financial objectives. if you purchase a vehicle, in the majority of cases, we will receive a commission from black horse financial services for introducing you to them which is either a fixed fee, or a fixed percentage of the amount that you borrow. this may be linked to the vehicle model you purchase.
black horse financial services also provide preferential rates to us for the funding of our vehicle stock and also provide financial support for our training and marketing. but any such amounts they pay us will not affect the amounts you pay under your finance agreement; however, you will be contributing towards the commission paid to us with the interest collected on your repayments. before we propose your application, we will inform you of the likely amount of commission we will receive and seek your consent to receive this commission. the exact amount of commission that we will receive will be confirmed prior to you signing your finance agreement.
all finance applications are subject to status, terms and conditions apply, uk residents only, 18s or over. guarantees may be required.
