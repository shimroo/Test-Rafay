everybody's talking


“hello, ms. d. i apologize about emailing you during the weekend, but i couldn’t wait to tell you. gizmos is so much fun, and i absolutely love it. i actually learn something and i like the fact that it is interactive. thank you so much for making us do gizmos.”
- gizmos student, american international school, abu dhabi


“i have been able to compare my students beginning of the year test data to the middle of the year test data and have seen a dramatic increase in their fraction understanding with frax—and i haven't even begun to teach fractions yet.”
- frax teacher, dekalb county school district, ga


“science4us is a huge resource for my classroom. i love to see how the videos, songs and activities encourage students to think in new ways about the things they experience. my students look forward to science time every day!”
- science4us teacher, advance learning academy, fl


“i love using gizmos. students get the opportunity to play with science that they cannot see. and they love to explore on their own and see the product of their experiments. i have seen a huge difference in students understanding of difficult concepts and their ability to explain science because of gizmos.”
- gizmos teacher, cleveland heights-university heights school district, oh


“awesome, awesome, awesome! reflex is by far the best program out there. all but one of my students scored within the targeted norm range on our district calculations assessment. this was an increase from 50% on the fall assessment.”
- reflex teacher, stevens point area public school district, wi
