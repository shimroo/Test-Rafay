what a feast! amazing quality.
thank you,
								arthur c






i just want to thank you, for helping to make this a wonderful christmas for our family. we purchased online, a ham leg on the bone and a decent sized turkey for christmas day. fair price for the quality, great comms, and perfect despatch and arrival on the day you said it would, you have this online thing totally sorted, well done. wow, the ham was so delicious, such good quality and so tasty, we all loved it, it got absolutely smashed, i didn’t think we’d get through it all but there’s nothing left! the turkey though was just sensational, i tried to put the family 10 out of 10 rating down to my cooking skills on the primo ceramic charcoal bbq, but the family gave me an 8 (always room for improvement 🙂 the other 2 points were for the best quality turkey we’ve had for many years, so succulent, albeit perfectly cooked ;), the only left over’s are in the turkey pie for boxing day. thank you so much for such fabulous ‘quality’ meats, it really makes a difference and did make our christmas that much more special this year. bless. very happy customer.
thanks so much,
								glenn

just a short note of appreciation.  on 6th april you sent us a large ham and we wanted you to know that it arrived in perfect condition and was a major talking point at our 50th wedding anniversary function. the ham could only be described as superb.  dealing with your company has always been an experience of great service and quality product. please accept our thanks.
sincerely,
