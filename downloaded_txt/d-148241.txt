the association of northwest weavers guilds (anwg) is an association of fiber arts guilds located within the pacific northwest united states and western canada.
anwg provides services and support to its member guilds with the idea that combining resources and providing an economy of scale, services can be provided that would not be possible for the individual guilds to provide on their own.
