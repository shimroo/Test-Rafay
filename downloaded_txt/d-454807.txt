philosophy and vision


st. alphonsus/st. patrick catholic school is a direct extension of st. alphonsus and st. patrick parish, following the directive to teach as jesus did. our primary mission is to teach the truth about ourselves and our world based upon scripture, catholic rituals and tradition, and the enfolding understanding of the revelation of godâs spirit, while building the academic skills and knowledge needed in todayâs technological world.


each child is treated with respect, acknowledging his/her uniqueness and importance in godâs eyes. our school supports and assists parents in their primary responsibility as role models and educational examples for their children. parental involvement is valued as families assist our professional faculty and staff in sound educational methods throughout our full curriculum. our school stands for educational and spiritual excellence and service to others.
