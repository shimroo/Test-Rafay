stories of grace














back row to the front row
leslie nollsch
vacation bible school brought me grace and now grace is feeding my spirit through worship and filling my heart with loving christian friends. god calls us to be active in our relationships and there is no place to find more activity than vbs. i encourage all of you to come and experience it whether you bring your kids, or volunteer. you may leave tired! but you will also leave filled.

the transformation of tithing
candy and bill aldridge
blessings rained down on us in unexpected ways. things that should’ve soured – didn’t. things that could’ve been “good” came out great. unimagined grace came our way.

my call to grace
liz moran
jesus is moving here at grace. and when i left last spring to work in d.c., i would get to the end of each day and know that while god was using me in d.c. for a brief time, the place he wanted me was at grace. because there is something special happening here, and he, for some reason, had decided that i should be included.

saying "yes"
jamie horton & jenny mayo
my invitation to our church community would be to have your "yes" on the table.  it also means saying "yes" to inviting others into our church.  a simple invitation to a neighbor or a friend could be what opens the door to them knowing jesus. jamie and i are so grateful for this community and the ways you’ve loved us and invited us to use our gifts here.

a lot can happen in a year
allysa minear
being here at grace has helped me learn more and pass more of what i like to call “life-tests”. i have found a community here and i love to help out as much as i can, especially because i get to be around people that show god is working through them.

                    we make disciples by equipping every generation to share both god’s good news and their everyday lives.
                












worship
we worship to glorify god as a community centered around jesus. we hear god’s word through scripture, preaching, music and prayer and respond to god’s teaching by being a light for him wherever we go. worship is vital to being a devoted follower of jesus.
worship announcements


equip
we equip our grace family of all ages and our neighbors to learn about and experience a life of discipleship - following jesus. we do this through learning, small disciple groups and programs reflective of who he wants us to be. disciples equipped to make disciples.

in matthew 18:20, jesus said, “for where two or three are gathered in my name, there am among them.” we believe in the power of community as we engage and invest to live into faithful ministry as a church family and his children. sharing life and growing in christ together.
