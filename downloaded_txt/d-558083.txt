david econopouly, 
                                  
                                  the globe merchant, 
                                  freezing on the baltic on new year's day, 2000




thanks david -- after a couple of hours of searching 
                            on booking wiz last night i actually found a fare 
                            from pittsburgh to athens for my dates for $802 (including 
                            taxes). needless to say i purchased it. it involves 
                            three flights per leg, but the dollars i save can 
                            be better spent at a taverna. it really is amazing 
                            how repeated searches (even with the same info) can 
                            turn up radically different fares. the whole process 
                            feels like some form divination to me! anyway, thanks 
                            for your info. i find your site and your e-mails incredibly 
                            helpful. ---jeff

looking 
                                  to travel to europe? 





this 
                                    has been a terrible year so far for fares 
                                    to europe. normally there are a series of 
                                    sales that start in january and continue through 
                                    until the summer(and after). so far- nothing. 
                                    to give you an idea of what it's like compared 
                                    to 2009. last year i found flights on delta 
                                    from rdu to athens for $520 including taxes. 
                                    this year i haven't seen anything under $900 
                                    for may.

                                    i have flights booked to greece in june, but 
                                    the fare is around $1450 which is astromomical!! 
                                    i got a $200 ff miles ticket so i can live 
                                    with that fare since the two tickets will 
                                    average out to about $850 which isn't bad 
                                    for a summer fare.... but.... i'm still hoping 
                                    that fares will drop(there are over 80 seats 
                                    available on my transatlantic flight to and 
                                    from athens- so i'm holding out to buy my 
                                    june ticketes for a few more weeks(if i can- 
                                    meaning as long as the seats don't start disappearing 
                                    and i might end up have to pay more for the 
                                    flights!

                            deals primarily with flights to europe, but i have 
                            also provided information and links to inter-european 
                            flights, hotel accommodations

                            air options..
floored 
                            by the fact that the taxes for your flights are as 
                            high as !/3 to !/2 the cost of your ticket...find 
                            out what those taxes 
                            are?
nowadays, 
                            flights to europe is a funny market(read about how 
                            a wholesaler finds your tickets....and why you 
                            shouldn't feel bad that the airlines are flying half 
                            full and losing money!)... discount airlines and low 
                            fares used to be a dime a dozen. now, the fares are 
                            much higher than they have been in the past and the 
                            sales seem harder to come by. i suggest that you explore 
                            the links, find the lowest fare and come back to me 
                            with your best fare and itinerary. i'll let you know 
                            what i think- if i can sell the tickets for less or 
                            know where you can go to do so, i'll help you out. 
                            if you have the best fare i'll tell you to go ahead 
                            and purchase it.
are 
                            you concerned about the state of the airlines and 
                            whether you may lose a lot of money if an airline 
                            folds before you travel... read 
                            this.

                            for information on discount airlines in europe and 
                            other low cost discount airline ticketing sitesand 
                            eurail europe for train 
                            info. i would explore those sites as some of their 
                            discounts are excellent. in some cases their discounts 
                            are better than mine, but in other cases i have better 
                            fare. my advantage is that i can search manually for 
                            the best fare while they are automated and cannot.
remember-
the airlines are trying to sell the tickets to 
                            you for as much as they can and you are trying to 
                            purchase them for as low a fare as you can- it's a 
                            kind of airline poker- with each of you trying to 
                            bluff the other. the airlines want you to think that 
                            the tickets won't be coming down even though they 
                            need the money and don't want you to go fly with someone 
                            else and you want the airlines to think that you're 
                            not going to buy tickets until the fare does come 
                            down even though you are afraid that the ticket fares 
                            may go up. the first to blink loses!.(my job is to 
                            help advise you as to whether you should continue 
                            to play or fold!) i can't be positive we're right,
