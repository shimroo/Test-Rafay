      about us    






about usparma, the acronym for the public agency risk management association, was founded in 1974, by a group of eight risk managers. parma was the first organization of its kind, and was formed to provide a forum for california public sector risk managers to share ideas on how to perform their duties in this emerging field. at that time in the history of public entity risk management, no venue existed for risk managers to learn their trade, and most of what was being done was experimental in nature.
