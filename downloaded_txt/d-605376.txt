	 bye and thanks for all the gefiltefish!
	 
    


dear readers,i have decided to take a bow and say goodbye as one of the "staff" contributors of jewniproj.  i have enjoyed my time blogging on the sc scene and would like to thank g-squad for the opportunity to be a founding member of his team.it is clear that the blog is changing (no new posts in over a month). as i move farther and  further away geographically and chronologically, and even spiritually, from ucsc and s. cruz,  i feel that i have less to contribute that may be relevant for this blog's intended audience, and also wish to explore other themes and topics for which this blog is less suited.so goodnight sc, we love you!                                                     fedora black

	 emergency campaign for burned child in tzefas
	 
    


i recieved the following email from the nechal novea tsfat fund:rabbi binyamin  rosenberg, director of eizer l'shabbos, has called out to all "rachamonim bnei rachamonim" to come to the aid of an american family now living in tzefas, whose ten year old son akiva shimon ben doba was severely burned during bi'ur chometz near his home in the ma'or chaim apartment complex, when a youth with behavioral issues threw a can of turpentine into the fire.akiva shimon – who was standing farthest away from the bonfire – was hit directly by the explosion, and received third degree burns to his face, hands, and stomach. a chassid from borough park visiting relatives in tzefas was on the scene, and saved the boy's life by tackling him and extinguishing his burning clothing. the family spent yom tov in the intensive care unit and subsequently stayed with a burn specialist in bnei brak. it is estimated that the father will have to bring his son for treatments three times a week for the next month, and then at least once a week until it is determined if he can treat his son at home. in addition to medical expenses, the father (who works in a local seforim store) will lose much work time and income.please send your tax-deductible contribution to: eizer l'shabbos c/o rabbi zvi davis 1161 east 9th st., brooklyn,  ny 11230 checks should be earmarked "akiva shimon fund" at bottom. whatever you can give will help! also: please daven for akiva shimon ben doba – whose emunah and savlonus are an example to all. may he have a speedy refu'ah sheleimah without any scars, physical or emotional, im yirtza hashem!  the nechal novea tsfat fund and eizer l'shabbos are both legit funds that due amazing work, and i suggest that you consider sending a donation to this cause.

	 no pot for pesach....if you're ashkenazi!
	 
    


reuters reports that the israeli green leaf party has announced that rabbis consider cannibis to be kitniyos, and as such is off-limits to ashkenazi jews during peasch. kitniyos are foods such as rice, beans, and kasha that are banned rabbinically during pesach as they are similar to grain products (wheat, spelt, oats, barley, and rye) which are forbidden by the torah during pesach, and may be confused with them. sefardim never accepted the ban on kitniyos, so it would seem that if you are sefardi, you don't need to worry.isreali politics...oy vey!on a related note,  rabbi avrohom blumenkratz, z'l, writes in his "the laws of pesach" that cigarettes contain many chometz, kitniyos, and even treif ingredients, that make them forbidden for pesach and it seems questionable for year round use as well.  so perhaps smokers of all kinds should consider making this pesach a true season of freedom.

	 the end of an era
	 
    


big things are happening in santa cruz. passover is coming up in a couple weeks, which is the celebration of our liberation from bondage in egypt and our formation as g-d's people; that, everyone most likely knows. but in case you haven't yet heard, it is the end of an era for the chabad student center as well, which is moving from its location of three years at 136 iowa drive to a new location on king street. here is an excerpt from rabbi chein's most recent email, in case you're not pvrivy: there are some things you always wanted to try out. life can be busy and those things can be tried out next week. so you wait for next week, and the week after that, and then the week after that…there is no next week. following are events that will take place for the last time ever at the iowa drive chabad house!café soul – wednesday 3/14 7:00-8:30friday night live – finale 3/16 7:00 – say goodbye to winter quarter, say goodbye to the iowa drive chabad house, say goodbye to a chapter of jewish history……and be there for the opening of a new, bigger and better, chapter of jewish history: the opening of the new chabad house on king street (chabad rules – get it?!)for the first time ever a five star passover seder at 1142 king street – feel the liberation in this regal new location. rsvp now!!!crazy. mazal tov, mazal tov! continued and increased success.

	 "the producers" in hebrew
	 
    


i just got back from seeing "the producers" musical in hebrew over in tel aviv. i have to say that overall i was impressed with the translation but a little disappointed with the production since i had seen a more exciting one back in san francisco... :)the interesting part was seeing the level of sensitivity to all holocaust related material that was quite uncensored in the original movie/musical. most of the jokes were the same and obviously they still had the big "springtime for hitler" dance but at certain points in the play there was no doubt that this was a performance for israeli jews.in some ways it ended up being funnier. while bialystock and bloom are pretending to swear a blood oath to protect hitler's name they spit and mutter "imach shmo" [may his name be erased] under their breath (but loud enough for the audience to hear and appreciate.) at other points the sensitivity proved to be disappointing, since the spinning and dancing in the shape of a swastika was probably my favorite part of the original movie/musical, and it was cut from the israeli production. overall the conscientious visuals and dialogues helped add another level of humor and intelligence to an already complex storyline.if the jewish people are ready to sit and watch men in tight leather pants with swastikas on their arms dancing on a stage then i think we have reached a very good place in our growth as a people. tomorrow night my grandparents, both of whom lived through the holocaust, will be going to see the show. i can't wait to hear what they'll think of it.

	 update on the new chabad house
	 
    


i came across a nice write-up about the new chabad house on chabad.edu. here is an excerpt: challenging the generational assumption that in america, being jewish isn’t really that important, for decades chabad families have been giving jewish college students opportunities to grow through education, self-fulfillment and torah – and to have fun doing so.a case in point is the established and new-in-the-making chabad student center at the university of california at s. cruz. perhaps the most beautiful college campus in the nation – planners nestled buildings among redwood forests and bucolic landscaping not far from the ocean – the school reportedly boasts the highest percentage of jewish students amongst all universities on the west coast.with the purchase of the new chabad house, the more than 2,800 jewish students and faculty at ucsc can look forward to a larger place of their own in the near future. the building is being dedicated by philanthropists george and pamela rohr. plans call for a kosher kitchen, grand dining hall, lounge, sanctuary, event garden, guest rooms and a residence for rabbi shlomie and devorah leah chein.click here for full article.where did they get such incorrect information? ucsc is definitely the most beautiful campus in the nation. jay kay. but for real, it all sounds very exciting. much success.labels: chabad csc

	 insights from rabbi gordon
	 
    


so these are still some notes from past lessons, as i now happen to have a communist literature class that conflicts with my old schedule of mon. nights at the rabbi’s shiur. (in the future i’ll be doing write-ups from the recordings of rabbi gordon’s class thanks to asserted efforts by hebrew lecturer, tammi benjamin.) somehow our class had lent itself to the subject of tshuvah or repentance. (get it lent itself--repentance, a catholic thing, whatever--okay that was a pretty lame joke anyway and this is supposed to be a serious class i’m reviewing…) when person does complete tshuvah, the tshuvah is so powerful that the person’s particular sin from past is transcended into a merit on the individual’s part. “it’s like hashem goes back in time and tinkers with the existence of the aveirah (sin) and now somehow it works out to be a merit on the individual’s record,” the rabbi explained. the talmud brings in yecheskil: “when a rasha (a wicked person) departs from his evil behavior and does justice and righteousness, then by them he will live” (i hope i quoted this right.) this is what it means when we say in our blessings: ‘asher kidshanu b’mitzvosav…’ ‘who has sustained us in his mitzvos…’ the implication of this and the word in for ‘in his mitzvos’ is that people need to live for the mitzvos and not die by them. (the only exception to this is when there’s an instance which involves what judaism views as the 3 cardinal sins: murder, rape and idolatry: for each of these, death takes precedence over the act—for example if someone stuck a gun to you and said either you do one of these 3 things or i kill you, halakhicly it is best to be killed). furthermore, the exhortation is to live within your mitzvos.  r. chayim vilozner asks, what does yecheskil mean? somehow the debate led to: ‘by’ them (as opposed to ‘in them’) would be referring to the aveirot (the restraints) rather than the positive mitvos. so why does it say “in them?”  this was followed by a deep discussion on the hebrew ‘aleichem’ and ‘bahem’ and questions about yecheskil. as you can see i do not recall all of the details, but i remember it was resolved with: only tshuvah can reverse the aveirahs (and not the tons of positive mitzvahs that went unperformed). but when a person does all the mitvahs to the full extent (shleima), perfectly, then (if i’m not mistaken) the unperformed positive mitzvahs can also be amended for. the rabbi later delved into the kabbalistic zohar and somehow tied in an analogy to the chariot of the patriarchs as a vehicle for hashem’s presence, but i think this is enough for now.

	 tu b'shv-izzle
	 
    


so it's the holiday of tu b'shvat again this shabbat, the well-known but oft misunderstood "birthday of the trees." according to chabad.org, "on this day we remember that 'man is a tree of the field' (deuteronomy 20:19) and reflect on the lessons we can derive from our botanical analogue." some mark the day by eating fruits native to the land of israel, while others host a whole "mystical tu b'shvat seder" somewhat analogous to the passover seder. and some people just hug a tree ;)today the jerusalem shuk was filled with music and costumed entertainers putting passers-by in the holiday spirit. i was surprised to see that such a big deal was being made for what i had thought was a slightly obscure holiday. it was all very nice, but probably a climb up tree 9 would have been a more moving experience. in any case, i have translated a short digest of a sicha of the lubavitcher rebbe regarding tu b'shvat. for further learning, please see chabad.org or aish.com. please enjoy.on this shabbat falls tu b'shvat (the 15th of the month of shvat), the "rosh hashana of the trees." similar to the way that the first of the month of tishrei (rosh hashana) is the day of judgment for each individual, likewise tu b'shvat is the day of judgment for trees.there is a well-known statement in the torah (deuteronomy 20:19) that "man is a tree of the field," and it is learned from this that there are parallels between a person and a tree, in the manner of the growth of the tree. the tree is called in hebrew tzomeach (lit. "growing") since it is always growing--starting from a small seedling in the earth, then becoming a small sapling, then a great tree, a fruit-producing tree. and this is what a person can learn from a tree--to always be in a state of growth. it is not enough that today one learned torah and fulfilled mitzvahs; tomorrow, you need to reach new heights, to learn more torah and to fulfill mitzvahs even more beautifully, always striving to reach higher, and not to become content with what one is currently doing. and when a jew strives to reach new heights, he or she is ensured the aid of g-d in those efforts.(originally summarized in hebrew from likuttei sichos, section 2, pp. 518-9) i hope you guys gained some lessons from that botanical analogue. in honor of this special holiday, the chabad student center and hillel will both be hosting special fruit-themed shabbat dinners.chabad student center7:00pm - 10:00pmtaste of the tropics shabbatfruit themed shabbat dinner: full dinner with a fruity twist and a fruit assortment for dessert. on this night judaism celebrates the new year for the trees. why hug a tree when you can kiss a fruit?location: chabad student center, 136 iowa drive, santa cruzhillel7:30pm - 10:00pmshabbat dinner this week will feature the fruits of israel. after the four course meal (kosher meat with vegetarian options) we will enjoy the kabbalistic experience of a tu b'shevat seder: four glasses of wine, symbolic fruits and nuts, and a chance to explore the 4 worlds: physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. no background experience required. if you are an environmentalist, or jewish, someone who likes trees, or just someone who likes wine, this event is for you. spread the word!location: santa cruz hillel, 222 cardiff place, santa cruz

okay fine, the song flows better with nasrallah, but anyway check this out.  here's an email that's been going around (in case you haven't already recieved it) encouraging people to sign a petition regarding the iranian leader which will be presented to the international court of justice at the hague:================================i just signed the petition at: http://www.aish.com/iranit calls on the international community to indict iran�s mahmoud ahmadinejad for incitement to commit genocide.this has a strong legal basis, as the 1948 un genocide convention classifies �incitement to commit genocide� as a crime against humanity. the purpose is to eliminate the genocidal murderers before they take action.this petition that will be presented to the international court of justice at the hague.it takes less than 10 seconds to sign the petition.public outcry by a critical mass will force world leaders to take action.sign the petition now:http://www.aish.com/iranokay, this post was short and simple but i thought it was jewniproj worthy.

	 new chabad house--watch out!
	 
    


so it seems to be confirmed, the chabad student center of rabbi shlomie and devorah leah chein will be moving to a new location!  r. chein miraculously brokered a deal to get a snazzy new place on king st. (near laurel st.) and it looks like there will be much more space for friday night live, holiday services and meals, jewish learning programs, kicking it with mendel and david... you know, all the great things that chabad already does for students at ucsc. yes it will be at the former frisbee club house, for everyone who knows of it, or remembers those... interesting (well somewhat trashed) freshman nights.  okay that wasn't all of us, but for those who can recount a vague image of what i'm talking about, i'm sure it won't be very hard to adjust.  i mean a completely new atmosphere: new kind of cheers-a l'chaim!, a slightly different form of comraderie-'you're also taking physics?'  'yea, i was in israel last summer too.'  it almost reminds me of a hassidic story i heard about a yid in a tavern saying l'chaim and having the right intent in order to revitalize himself in a spiritual sense and drive the angel of death further away with each gulp and... ah whatever, i forget it.  but anyway, i'm digressing. but really, this is a serious endeavour which will hopefully have a huge impact on jewish students at ucsc and provide them with many meaningful jewish experiences to come.   quite a few of us have already become well accustomed to cramping 40-70 students into an all too modest living room for shabbos dinners, and it's about time we found a solution.  also for the cheins' sake, with two kids and a third on the way, this house will surely enable them to have more space for their family as well as for a growing multitude of starving slugs.here is an official email message that csc is put out:some time this quarter, chabad house - your jewish home on campus - will be getting a new address. to help make this happen we need your home address.your parents might want to support this tremendous endeavor, and we must give them the opportunity to do so. a beautiful brochure has been printed and we would be more than happy to send it to them.additionally, if you have any friends or relatives they may also be interested in supporting this amazing cause, so email me their address and we will send them a brochure as well.alternatively, i can give you the brochure and you can send it to them with your own letter, or a customized template we created for students who want to request the help of family and friends.mi casa, su casa – let’s do it together!shlomiechabad student centerwww.jewcsc.comso hatzlacha raba to the cheins that everything goes through with this.  also anyone who wants to donate or persuade friends and family to donate-that would be terrific.  you can also check out this link to give donations. i personally can attest that efforts from the cheins have really enhanced my jewish life in college and it's impossible to put into words all that chabad does for jewish students at ucsc and for the entire community.  (though if you want a great video on it check out g-d squad's post, 'highlights - shabbat at chabad' from a couple weeks ago.)

	 short notice: brilliant rabbi spending shabbos in sc
	 
    


i just recieved this in an email:rabbi david fohrman is coming to santa cruz this shabbat - 1/27/07for those of us who have been honored to learn torah with rabbi fohrman we can attest to his fabulous teaching – do not miss the opportunity.dear friends,rabbi david fohrman is one of the most brilliant and engaging teachers of jewish texts that it is my good fortune to know.   based on a unique methodological approach to torah that he has developed, rabbi fohrman manages to plumb the depths of the text in an extraordinary way.  rabbi fohrman is coming to santa cruz this shabbat and will be giving two classes on the theme "whispers of slavery in the book of genesis" (see below).  these talks are not to be missed.-tammiseries title: whispers of slavery in the book of genesistwo talks that will explore the background to the parshiyot we are now reading in the torah - the story behind the story of the jews' sojourn in egypt.schedual is as follows:part one: the birth of ishmael  - saturday afternoon at 2pmpart two: what does it mean to forgive? a closer look at joseph and his brothers  - saturday evening at 7pm (with ice cream)location: 144 jenne st, santa cruz.  this is off laurel and chestnut  st.

	 donate blood-it's a mitzvah!
	 
    


so there was a blood drive at our very own santa cruz hillel (located next to the 7-11 at the base of campus) and it was pretty successful.  since one person who donates the standard amount of blood can save, on average, 3 people's lives, and judging by the turn out, i'd say it was really amazing.  big yasher koach to monica and ayla and everyone else from hillel who helped organize it!  it was put on by stanford medical center (check http://bloodcenter.stanford.edu/ for more info.)anyway, i looked up some of the jewish aspects to this and it turned out there is a great deal of encouragement from leading rabbis to donate blood if one is able to. this is primarily because it is seen as pikkuach nefesh (saving of life) and, for the most part, healthy people who are capable face no risk that the operation will have any serious after effects. (one may be a little weary for the next few hours and a donor should not do anything too physically exerting at least for the rest of the day--also one should drink plenty of water and take in plenty of nutrients before the operation.)quite a bit more time has been spent ascertaining the jewish values in donating an organ which is obviously a much larger commitment. on http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/jme/jmeb1/jmeb1.37.aspyou can see that organ donations too have been up for serious debate among torah scholars. for a halachic analysis of donating a kidney and many of the leading opinions involved see: http://www.dailyhalacha.com/display.asp?clipdate=1/8/2007in general, there are four fundamental issues concerning transplantation from living donors.a. the danger to the donor.b. donation under coercion.c. sale of organs and tissues.d. the legally incompetent donor.all halachic authorities agree that where a procedure is not a life saving measure, one may not significantly endanger the life of a donor, nor may one coerce a potential donor to donate.for more of a basic summary on jewish medical ethics check: www.aish.com/societywork/sciencenature/why_jewish_medical_ethics.asp
