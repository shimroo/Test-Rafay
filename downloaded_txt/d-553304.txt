support your chapter!
local chapters are the beating heart of our organization. they know the birth culture, providers, and even laws and regulations that can affect birthers. participate in peer to peer conversations, attend meetings, and spread the word (boost their social media and word of mouth)! if you join as an ican member don’t forget to mark which chapter you’d like a portion of the member fee to go to!
