halloween: my decades long friendship with michael myers





halloween is my favorite holiday...this is the time of year where i tune in to see which horror movie is currently playing on tv as part of the annual amc fearfest at least twice a day. or i will just pull out a bunch of my favorites from the personal collection and have my own marathon. i own more horror flicks than other genres....the total number is probably in the 100s....i purposely started tlr 13 years ago this week to ensure that the anniversary would be tied to the date--no really...and it all began with john carpenter's 1978 classic halloween. like richard donner's superman--the movie helped shape my life and who i am--the scare-filled flick film did the same...




i was too young to see it during its initial theatrical run...3 years later i  remember watching the premiere of the now famous tv version....in which  12 minutes of footage was added to replace the more violent material of  the original cut. these scenes were shot simultaneously with "halloween ii"  in 1981...anyway--i was hooked--even in its edited form it scared the  bejeebus out of me! my mom was not happy with me after i disobeyed her and watched it anyway. sorry mom--so glad i disobeyed you.  



what can one say about the performances of donald pleasence as very determined dr. sam loomis and a very young jamie lee curtis as iconic heroine laurie strode...

one  of the strengths of the film is its ability to scare viewers using  suspense and shock-without having to depend on gore--to tell its story.

written by carpenter and the late debra hill--the tale follows masked killer michael myers institutionalized since the age of 6 for killing his older sister--he escapes and returns home on october 31st to continue  his spree while doctor loomis tries to stop him. the "totally" great 
 p.j. soles and nancy kyes as laurie's pals lynda and annie are quite memorable too. what's not to love about town sheriff brackett played by
 charles cyphers?           




halloween was produced on a budget of $300,000 and grossed $47 million at the box office in the united states, and $70 million worldwide, equivalent to roughly $267 million as of 2016, becoming one of the most profitable independent films ever. 

a cluster of sequels and one remake and its sequel  later--not to mention countless imitators--and here we are.. for me,  the original halloween is one classic that just can't be topped...even  after multiple viewings. in fact if you read my review of rob zombie's 2007 remake of the 1978 classic--you know that i loathe nearly everything about the film...hard to believe then that i think zombie's halloween ii was even worse!!! 

the halloween film franchise had stalled for a number of years now while everyone wrestled with where to take the series...all of that changes with today's debut of halloween (2018)!!




40 years since the original was released in theaters and carpenter is back as executive producer/composer of the score--and curtis returns as laurie strode. the new film ignores all of the sequels--including 1981's halloween ii--which picked up right where the original left off.  the reviews are very good. and it looks to make a killing at the box office this weekend.

have not seen the new film yet--but plans are afoot...all i can say right now is that i am sooooooo glad that zombie's timeline was not allowed to continue. extremely happy for curtis and carpenter who seem to be enjoying all the newfound attention! 




a special thanks to my sister karen for watching halloween on  tv with me all those years ago and sharing a very special experience with me...

and to my college room-mate mike who loves the original film as much as i do. in fact--throughout our tenure together--we watched the film dozens of times and not just in october...and quoting lines galore. yeeeesh! we would say dialogue from the film a lot--both in normal conversation and in code....to mean something else. i recall that by doing so it got me in quite a bit of trouble too. but mike had my back. this one's for you brother. always remember that "speed kills!" and beware "the blackest eyes....the devil's eyes!"

"sleep tight kids!"🎃 and happy halloween!

 this looks like a job for....





i can think of no better way to end the blog--yes this time i mean it--than by bringing things full circle--and telling you a little bit more about my life in the process. a heartfelt thanks to all of my loyal readers for supporting me and all of my nonsense over the last 12 years or so. it's been fun!

a special shout out to brittani burnham at rambling film-thanks for always having my back kiddo!! see you on twitter....@thelastreel....now on with the final reel.....






2018 marks the 80th birthday of the greatest comic book superhero of all time....superman.......created by jerry siegel and joe shuster--the character first appeared in action comics #1 dated june 1938....

if you've known me for any real amount of time-you know that save for a few struggles--i tend to orbit positive people places and things. on a basic level it's the reason i prefer star trek over star wars. instead of evil empires taking over galaxies in wars-with trek we explore the final frontier and ourselves--always striving to be better...each franchise has a complicated story and its themes are nuanced i know--but you get the broader point.

the man of steel was not just a bright light for me growing up....he was also "virtually invulnerable" and nearly flawless--having a disability since birth--his perfection was appealing to a young boy who was reminded every day that he was differently abled. despite those challenges--and with the loving embrace of my parents and siblings--i still found a way to look towards the sky smile and say "up up and away!!" although i lived a wonderful childhood buoyed by a great support system of family friends teachers and the like--all in my corner--cheering me on...i was not immune to times of struggle--self doubt-frustration and sadness. this may sound ridiculous to some of you--but--as a fictional character superman helped me get past most of the negative stuff at a young age. early on i believed (and still do) that you have to play the hand you are dealt. humor. humility grace qualities that will get you farther than you know... i chose to try and live by those words--yet not always succeeding....i am deeply and hopelessly flawed after all. superman never gave up on me though...superman i am not...a hero--surely not--but striving to live the best life possible-yep...optimistic and hopeful--hell yes!!




here's how it all began...before i read a single comic book--an origin if you like--the first time i met superman.

i was 10 years old at the time...

it was august 23rd 1979, and as usual for that time of year the weather was very warm and humid. my mom and dad were busy working around the house. four of my five siblings were out and about, doing the things that normal teenagers and young adults do. i decided to pass the time by playing a very long game of monopoly with the one sister who was home--maria. after she beat me, it was time to eat dinner. as we finished our meal, two of my brother nick's buddies--both named mike, came by for a visit. even though he wasn’t home, his two pals as they often did, had decided to stick around for a little bit anyway. this visit allowed them to give me some of those old "space: 1999" action figures and toys, which they was planning to do anyway. the duo said that they were going to the movies in town.

eventually, they invited my sister and me to come along. after getting permission and money from the folks, off we went...

little did i know, this simple outing to the movies, would have such an affect on my life and my future...

the only movie theater within walking distance from my home in woodbury nj., had only two screens, (yeah remember when movie theaters only had 1 or 2 screens!) and was located right in the center of town. the wood, (sadly, closed in the mid-80's after the cineplex took over) on broad street, was what’s known in the business as, a second run theater. this is the last place where movies would go before they show up on cable or in the video store. the fifteen minute trip ended and we arrived some twenty minutes before the 7:00 p.m. show time. the four of us sat three rows from the front. the screen looked very big to this 10 year old. in the center section, we took four seats on the right side of the row. i sat on the end. this was the first time i sat that close to the screen.

the movie i was about to see had originally been released on december 15 1978. it had been number one at the box office for eleven weeks in a row, garnered four oscar nominations, and was a hit with the the critics and the public alike. a few moments later the theater went dark and the film began...

the movie i saw that night was officially titled superman-the movie




there are many other films that have inspired me over the years. the list is long and varied. however, this was the very first film to have an impact on me, and the choices that i would make later in life. so that is why it is singled out here.

from the opening shots in black and white--the voice over of a young boy reading a comic book, dissolving into one of the most memorable credit sequences ever filmed, to its epic story and great score, superman had it all. a great cast, led by marlon brando, gene hackman, and christopher reeve in fact, it is his performance as both the man of steel and his alter ego, clark kent, (reeve later said that he modeled his clark kent after actor cary grant) that made it work. under the fine direction of richard donner, the movie and its characters came alive...

when the movie ended, 2 hours and 23 minutes later, i thought wow! as the four of us made our way back to my house, i was pumped up, and very excited!--and could not stop talking about it...when i finally made it home, i couldn’t wait to tell mom and dad all about it. it wasn’t just the movie that i wanted to talk about though. i wanted talk about everything that went into making it as well. i noticed a lot more about the movie than just the great script by late great writer tom mankiewicz. examples of what else i noticed include: the cinematography (by the late geoffrey unsworth), the music (by john williams), the set design (by the late john barry), editing (by stuart baird), and on and on... the point is that i became interested in all areas of the film’s production. even to this day, i still pay attention to the credits of films that i see....driving everyone else nuts---i remember telling my mom that night that i wanted to be a film director as an adult...

as a teenager, i went to the movies a lot, with family and friends. i was and still am the movie guy to those that know me..trips to the bookstore back then meant getting my hands on any tome about movies and how they got made...

when it came time to pick a major in college--after encouragement from my sister karen.- the choice was simple--communications with a concentration in film and tv production....my parents were never really thrilled with the idea. they wanted me to go into a more "stable profession" mom always saw me as a teacher--which is of course--very ironic--considering how and where i ultimately landed.

post graduation i made a few promotional films including one for my high school alma mater--commonly referred to as gatorland. and... profiles of interesting people that i thought could use the attention...the highlight among those films though was the completion of an indie short--that-thanks to the help of some very dedicated folks--is literally one experience i will never forget...and like superman--it will always be with me for the rest of my life thanks always to matt for going above and beyond in making the indie happen at all and to the rest of my cast/crew--it truly was something special....




my affection for, and inspiration from the celluloid medium has never really left me--and i doubt it ever will really..in some ways, one could say, tlr would not exist without 1978's stm... and that trip to the center of town 38 years ago. no matter my mood, i hear that rousing main title march and my spirit soars. i have probably watched the film in part or in its entirety some 250 times....i even got to hear reeve speak to a crowd--a few years after his accident-at a motivational appearance event in north jersey...

thank you mr donner for making a 10 year old boy believe a man can fly....and giving me a lifetime of movie memories...and most importantly helping me stay positive always.

this post is lovingly dedicated to the memory of my mom and dad, my niece kayla, my pals alex, lindsay and lastly "beccs" i miss you all every day...now and forever....always in my heart...

review: dark forrest (2015)





i recently took some time out to watch the 2015 low budget canadian  80's horror throwback flick dark forest--while it boasts a strong antagonist, some inventive kills and some fine cinematography--not all of the puzzle pieces quite fit to form a cohesive whole.




the film employs the traits of the sub genre that any fan would love. its plot is simple enough. meet emily (laurel mcarthur), she is in an abusive  relationship with peter (dennis scullard). his hold over her is so strong that she basically lives a life locked away from the outside world. emily finally decides enough is enough--finding the courage to leave peter and join her friends michelle (veronica ternopolski), jolene (weronika sokalska), and francine (jalin desloges) on a camping getaway. soon after they arrive at their destination--the ladies discover that emily's act of courage has put them all in mortal danger....

director roger boyer concocted the script with david zellis infusing the final product with a few horror tropes that made the genre so popular in the late 70's/80's; pretty people out to have fun, gratuitous shots of girls frolicking about in the water--in this case though the sequence is pretty tame when compared to many of the films of the era that dark forest pays homage to, a sex starved male character-looking to score, characters blissfully unaware of the danger that hovers around them until it's too late, among others. the cast is solid and work well--given the trappings of the horror formula here. the standout here is scullard who is quite off-putting from the start, gets creepy and then becomes downright homicidal by the end. some kills are very well orchestrated despite the flick's low budget. the gore is also there but tastefully executed.

the film loses points for me by introducing another set of characters in the middle of the story--whose only function is clearly to raise the body count--which is fine-but this tactic could have had  more of an impact if used earlier in the film perhaps. the 2009 friday the 13th remake did something quite similar with better results. the movie has pacing issues too and with a running time of just 75 minutes--it's noticeable.

those concerns aside i can still happily recommend the flick--if you are a genre devotee like me. there's plenty to like here. the film is streaming on amazon prime and platforms like youtube, itunes and vudu.




be sure to visit the film's facebook page and follow it on twitter to learn more about it and keep updated.

superman the movie and the gift of flight





sure star wars: the last jedi opens in theaters today (i am excited to see it on sunday) but i would be remiss if i did not acknowledge the other reason this date is special to this self proclaimed fanboy.....




39 years ago today richard donner's superman the movie opened in theaters--and the "modern" superhero film genre was born. while i would not see the film for another 8 months--i remember that special day like it was yesterday.

the picture gave me a love for cinema and put me on a path--that shaped my life and influences me to this very day--indeed tlr and all of its permutations on social media would have never came to be without the 1978 classic. i am thrilled that the film--along with a few other favorites of mine--was recently added to the national film registry!! beats me why it took them so long but better late than never.  








the film's late great writer tom mankiewicz talks superman....and then read superman-the movie: the inside story according to donner....

here composer john williams conducts the boston pops playing the rousing theme that he wrote for the film.

 "american assassin" peek: "it's about the mission"





a new restricted trailer for the film adaptation of "american assassin" has dropped online ahead of its theatrical release on  september 15th 2017.




based on author vince flynn's eleventh mitch rapp novel that charts a cold war veteran (michael keaton),  who would be the most feared training officer in the cia  if more than a  handful of people at the agency actually knew of his  existence.  cia deputy director irene kennedy (sanaa lathan) tasks him with training a black ops  recruit (nj native "the maze runner," and "teen wolf" star dylan o'brien)    devastated by the loss of his fiancee to a terrorist attack. the pair   is  eventually dispatched to go on a joint mission with a lethal  turkish agent (shiva negar)  to  stop a mysterious operative (former friday night lights tv fave taylor kitsch) from kicking off a global war.

 should the film spawn a few sequels lathan's kennedy could return. scott adkins and the great david suchet co-star.

"kill the messenger" director michael cuesta called action from an adapted screenplay written by stephen schiff.

lorenzo di bonaventura and nick wechsler are producing the film.

 it seems o'brien's all sorts of jacked in this film--a star rising for sure--excited to see how it all turns out for him. in the meantime  teen wolf ends its run this summer on mtv after six seasons.

 be warned the footage includes  dialogue and intense images that are not suitable for minors....proceed at your own risk

remembering my mom and movies





on what would have been her 84th birthday i would like to spend some time talking about--my mom--and the films she loved..


from a very early age, i remember spending many saturday afternoons with mom, watching a show called creature double feature, where a local host would introduce classic horror films like frankenstein, dracula, (both from 1931), house of wax (1953) the blob, (1958) i was a teenage werewolf (1957)-just to name a few.

mom's favorite film star was james cagney. sitting down with her to watch white heat was a both a treat and chore, because i really didn't understand the beauty of the black and white film yet. into my adulthood i came to appreciate it for the masterpiece that it is. when the 4th of july rolled around, yankee doodle dandy (1942) became a family tradition. when cagney died on march 30th 1986, i vividly recall her shedding a few tears upon hearing the sad news.



mom liked films about the underdog overcoming adversity. the film saga of rocky balboa was her favorite of the genre.

watching ryan coogler's excellent continuation creed in the theater for christmas of 2015--was very bittersweet. i thought about the time i saw the original film with my parents on the big screen. memories flooded back. i think she would have loved it...
 michael b. jordan and sylvester  stallone were great together. they both deserved more attention from the academy....mom would have most likely agreed with me on that. if you have not seen it yet...it's a must watch...
          




speaking of sagas...even though the first two godfather films were not meant for kids my age, the first time they hit broadcast tv in the mid 70's, i was allowed to watch them. of course i'm so glad my parents made the exception.

as mother and son we shared many other favorite films over the years. comedies like blazing saddles, young frankenstein, and high anxiety, all from the mind of a master named mel brooks. we also got a kick out of peter sellers as inspector jacques clouseau in the original pink panther movies, as well as sellers' turn in the underrated murder by death (1976).

she warned me not to watch john carpenter’s halloween the first time it hit broadcast tv--it's not like the creature features she said... sorry mom--so glad i disobeyed you. regular readers of the blog already know how special carpenter's 1978 original is to me....and the horror genre as a whole...the funny thing here is that the godfather on network tv is waaaaay more violent and disturbing than michael myers. 

when the news of shirley temple-black's passing broke in february of 2014 ..i  thought about my mom...oh how she loved watching temple's films. at a  young age i remember that she had them on nearly every saturday when the  local uhf station would run two of them back to back...at the time i  did not appreciate them. as an  adult--it's easy to see that temple had a  special kind of magic...that has never been duplicated. what i would  not give for one more chance to sit with mom to watch a temple film.

mom would also indulge me by sitting through multiple viewings of superman and various "star trek" flicks...especially star trek: the wrath of khan, star trek iv: the voyage home and star trek vi: the undiscovered country, without much of a fuss. any star wars movie, on the other hand, was a tougher sell...

when my sister karen suggested that i study film making in college--while i was still in high school--mom tried to steer me into a more "stable profession" she would say "you should be a college professor--you could teach the kids of the future so much..." i did think about the teaching idea for a bit--but the pull of cinema was too strong...here i sit...there is a bit of irony considering the path that i find myself on now though...

the last film that mom saw in the theater was the live action/cg hybrid based the classic 1960's cartoon "the flintstones" in 1994. created by hanna-barbera the show premiered in 1960 and ran for six seasons before 
going into syndication for decades. as a youngster mom latched me onto the reruns....while she enjoyed herself watching the film...i think she still preferred the series over the adaptation. her biggest joy was seeing screen legend elizabeth taylor in a fun cameo....the live action film did a good job at capturing the spirit of the tv series. it made her smile. and that's all that matters....soon after she got very ill and our family would never be the same...

sadly, cancer took mom from our family nearly 25 years ago...and now that dad is also gone--it's been an even tougher slog.




thanks mom for all of your love, support, and kindness for all of those years. i miss you every day. but i'm grateful that we shared lots of love, laughter, and of course many movie memories. 💓💓

dylan o'brien gets tough in "american assassin" peek





the first trailer for the film adaptation of "american assassin" has dropped online ahead of its theatrical bow on  september 15th 2017.




based on author vince flynn's eleventh mitch rapp novel that charts a cold war veteran (michael keaton),  who would be the most feared training officer in the cia  if more than a  handful of people at the agency actually knew of his  existence.  cia deputy director irene kennedy (sanaa lathan) tasks him with training a black ops  recruit (nj native "the maze runner," and "teen wolf" star dylan o'brien)   devastated by the loss of his fiancee to a terrorist attack. the pair  is  eventually dispatched to go on a joint mission with a lethal turkish agent (shiva negar)  to  stop a mysterious operative (former friday night lights tv fave taylor kitsch) from kicking off a global war.

 should the film spawn a few sequels lathan's kennedy could return. scott adkins and the great david suchet co-star.

"kill the messenger" director michael cuesta called action from an adapted screenplay written by stephen schiff.

lorenzo di bonaventura and nick wechsler are producing the film.



this looks like it could be really good....nice to see that o'brien's back at it in a big way following his injury last year and the end of teen wolf--which happens this summer.

 review: chris esper's "the deja vuers" 





filmmaker chris esper's certainly been quite busy since i first met him in 2013--having produced the 13 episode series in the bedroom, launching the media production platform stories in motion and directing a handful of shorts--among those the deja vuers.




the 8 minute fantasy comedy follows chuck (kris salvi) who experiences  deja vu when he spots morgan (christie devine) sitting on a park bench - a woman that he remembers from a dream but has never really met. when their paths intersect, a portal opens which takes each of their lives into unexpected directions.

esper and writer jason k. allen have concocted a whimsical little movie that examines how we relate to our past, while living in the present, hoping for a better future. the chemistry between salvi and devine is quite good--leading to some very humorous back and forth. morgan clearly wants nothing to do with chuck--while he hopes to score a date (at least). 

the fantasy element of the piece is elevated--thanks to the gorgeous cinematography by 
 evan schneider. it has a dream like quality to it with its soft lighting and use of saturated coloring. it reminds me of the way that the legendary geoffrey unsworth (2001: a space odyssey) used to photograph films.  esper's light touch certainly knows how to draw the viewer in--using a very simple filming approach and getting the most from what he has. less is more if you will. it works beautifully here.   
the deja vuers has received some well deserved attention on the festival circuit--and shows no signs of stopping.

craig capone,  j.p. valenti and adam miller also star in the film. 

 be sure to read my review of esper's short film still life and the interview i conducted with him shortly thereafter. also check out my review of "always a reason" and  "steak knives"--from his filmography. you can follow esper on twitter by clicking here. get news about stories in motion on facebook

baywatch full trailer: "i can't save you, if you're being a d**k!"





the full trailer for the baywatch movie swam ashore today....





the film puts a comedic spin on the worldwide success of the tv show that ran from 1989–2001 charting the exploits and rescues of a team of lifeguards--ala 21 jump street

dwayne johnson, zac efron, alexandra daddario, kelly rohrbach, ilfenesh hadera, priyanka chopra, hannibal buress, jon bass, izabel goulart, charlotte mckinney and haviland stillwell  all star in the film.

 series stars david hassehoff and pamela anderson are both set to appear.

in late 2011 "rescue me" co-creator peter tolan and jeremy garelick  had reportedly finished their script then--reno 911 creators and stars thomas lennon  and robert ben garant were attached to work on the pic at one point as well in june 2012, justintimberlake was  linked to play a disgraced former olympic swimmer forced to join the  baywatch crew as part of a community service. but that fell apart and  now efron fills those swim trunks

justin malen did a rewrite but damian shannon and mark swift wrote the latest draft of the script

seth gordon directed the picture.

ivan reitman, beau  flynn and tripp vinson are producing the  pic.

the paramount release is set to hit theaters on may 26, 2017.

 be warned the footage includes  dialogue and intense images that are not suitable for minors....proceed at your own risk

review:  mark battle's "here lies joe"





the short film here lies joe touches on a subject matter that, unfortunately, hits very close to home for me...suicide. the good news is that it manages to entertain while at the same time send a message of hope.




in the 23 minute film dean temple plays the title character--a depressed man who finds himself attending a support group where he meets z (andi morrow) who turns his plans for the day upside down.

director mark battle, who also co-wrote the script with pamela conway, uses what he has here and produces great product. the chemistry between battle and morrow is off the chart. the duo play meet cute in an oddly effective way given the subject matter--some hollywood produced rom-coms have less of that key element with a two hour narrative than "joe" has within its format.

battle's cinematography deserves a mention as well--the film makes the most out of its new hampshire and massachusetts locales.  the film deserves your attention--once it has it--hopefully the all important conversation can begin.....




timothy j. cox, 
 mary hronicek, and 
 j.p. valenti also appear in the film. you can check out the trailer and the sweven films facebook page for additional information about this talented team.

tlr alert--getting older sucks





late last night i pulled a muscle in my right leg....the discomfort  is there to be sure...i have already been in touch with my doctor about a  course of action. a visit will likely take place over the next few  days. i have a bit of swelling--thankfully it's not too bad. some 20  years ago i did a similar thing to my right shoulder while lifting  weights--and that took a few weeks to work its way out. i don't feel  quite as knotted this time as i did back then. of course this happens  right before a busy week. rest assured that i will be fine...things are  well in hand.

my social media presence may be lighter  while i recover. thanks in advance for understanding...remember to stay positive and live life happy...

all the best.

rip carrie fisher (1956 –2016) 





absolutely heartbroken over the death of actress and author carrie fisher...

as princess leia she was strong feisty and fun as was fisher herself--like a lot of you--a piece of my childhood was ripped from me today. sure she will live on in the star wars films that she completed, including star wars: episode viii out next year...

beyond the "galaxy far, far away" there was so much more to her. click here for details about her extraordinary life and career.





fisher  once said that no matter how she dies, all obituaries should read that  her cause of death be listed as having “drowned in moonlight, strangled  by her own bra”.

rest well....and thank you....the world will miss your talent wit and wisdom

rogue one: a star wars review






i was a big skeptic
of this new disney phase of the star wars franchise, but rogue one has won me
over. here’s why…







(note: this review is aimed to be as spoiler-free as
possible, however it’s pretty hard to talk about this movie without spoiling at
least parts of it, so if you’re intent on avoiding any and all details, i advise you skip
reading this and just go watch it yourself.)



on a scale of “casual fan” to “grandiose star wars nerd”, i
fall squarely into the second category.



being an ocd completionist since childhood, i have an
obsession with continuity, so when it came to star wars i’ve always felt
compelled to know it all.



people like me live for the insider thrill of knowing the
secret history of an alien in the background, and sneaky cameos were pretty
much the only redeeming quality of the prequel trilogy for me.



so naturally, the child in me died a little when he found
out that disney was re-setting the entire millennia-spanning storyline surrounding
the actual movies. but what about the first sith empire? the iconic
blue-skinned admiral thrawn? han and leia’s twin jedi children?? poof, gone. 



at least, gone in the sense that they no longer count
towards any new films or franchise content. and that’s a deep blow to someone
who can tell you who originally stole
the death star plans. (it was kyle katarn, in case you were wondering.)



there’s a point to this self-aggrandizing, and
it’s this: people like me are among disney’s toughest customers when it comes
to the star wars franchise. it was going to take a whole lot to get me on board
with this “new” star wars universe, and the force awakens didn’t quite manage
it. episode vii felt like a recycle of a new hope, right down to a
force-sensitive orphan starting on a desert planet suspiciously like tatooine
and a quest to destroy another super
weapon.





rogue one finally offers a large-scale exploration of this
‘new’ universe without being tied to the skywalker storyline, and it’s arguably
the biggest departure from any previous movies. no jedi here: just desperate
soldiers in a fight for survival.







in particular, we get a really good look at the rebel
alliance beyond the glossy do-gooder sheen of the original trilogy. this is an
alliance on the verge of internal collapse, full of infighting and radical
factions that threaten to turn the whole uprising inside out. even some of the
‘heroes’ have done a few things they aren’t proud of in the name of taking down
the empire.



the closest thing we even get to a jedi is chirrut imwe
(played by martial arts movie star donnie yen), once a protector of the ancient
jedi ruins on the planet jedha, now cast adrift by the imperial occupation. his
lifetime devotion to the jedi and his blindness offer him some access to the
powers of the force, but even those are very limited (think of it as a
toned-down daredevil ninja sense).



the characters in this story don’t have the benefit of
ghostly jedi appearing to give them clues or force powers to open locked doors,
either. they have to rely on their wits, luck, and a willingness to do whatever
it takes to finish the job—even dying.



speaking of which, the plot-armor of ‘destiny’ is not totally
active on these characters; people die in this film, and not just extras. this
adds a much-needed level of tension because we obviously know they’re going to find the death star plans, since we’ve all
seen episode iv. however, that certainty is overshadowed by the realization
that yes, they do find the plans, but at what cost?







this film certainly has its flaws. the absence of any real
planning before the final assault feels very unrealistic. the cgi face of peter
cushing sits too deep in the uncanny valley (the place where things are just real enough to be creepy, but not
convincing). there’s a whole lot of planet jumping, and yet we somehow still
end up spending too much time on yet another desert planet. i could go on.



but, even with my
inherent disappointment in the franchise handover, and even with all its flaws,
i was willing to put aside all of my skepticism within the first 20 minutes
because the loving care taken in world-building made me feel like i was getting another insider glimpse into the larger
star wars world.



and, at the end of the day, that’s all fans like me really
want.
