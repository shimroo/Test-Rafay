online cyber





online cyber but as many security experts expected, the cyber storm exercise (staged inearly february to attack computers supporting the u.s. and international energyand transportation systems) pointed out that much basic planning is left to bedone to prepare for a large-scale cyberattack.dhs officials and the "cyber storm exercise report" were short on details ofthe exercise and what was discovered. dhs identified "eight core findings,"including the need for more interagency coordination (such as what events wouldtrigger involving what government agency) and the need for clearer roles andresponsibilities among government agencies and the private sector.george foresman, undersecretary for preparedness at dhs, said at a septemberpress conference that other key findings cited the value of dhs's ability tostage such a large-scale exercise and showed that the government could work withthe private sector on cyberattacks.security experts who have monitored the government's cybersecurity effortssay the united states should be further along in its preparations and note thatcyber storm did not test how the country would respond to specific threats, suchas a denial-of-service attack.foresman defends dhs's performance by saying that the government has beenaware of cybersecurity issues for only 10 years. dhs plans another exercise in2008. "we ought to have processes and procedures in place that clarify" thecoordination issues highlighted in cyber storm, foresman says. "if they still exist, then we know we didn't do a good job of implementing it." you do not need more memory!memory. you may or may not know it, but most electronic devices we use in ourday-to-day lives utilize some form of temporary storage - cell phones, pdas, dvdplayers, televisions, car radios, and computers. if the system processor (cpu)had to retrieve every piece of data it...cybersoft awarded independent anti-virus certificationvfind is the only pattern recognitionsolution certified for anti-virus on linuxconshohocken, pa, may 03, 2004 - cybersoft, the leader in military gradesecurity technology, has been awarded check-mark's level 1 anti-viruscertification for vfind and uad. combined these two utilities are known ascybersoft's threat detection engine.
