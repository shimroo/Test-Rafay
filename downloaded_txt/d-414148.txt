	 the wedding day that wasn't: hugh hefner and crystal harris' cancelled nuptuals
	 
    


today would have marked the start of marriage between playboy magnate hugh hefner, 85, and 24-year-old playmate crystal harris, his girlfriend since january 2009. the wedding was set to take place in front of 300 guests in the backyard of the playboy mansion in beverly hills, california. the bride would have walked down the aisle in a pink romona cabeza ballgown and aruna seth ballet flats. the couple had even intended for the wedding to be part of a tv special.but harris took to her website on tuesday morning to announce the end of her engagement to the octogenarian billionaire. "after much deep reflection and thought i have decided to end my relationship with hef," she wrote. "i have the utmost respect for hef and wish him the best going forward. i hope the media will give each of us the privacy we deserve during this difficult time."but immediately after hef confirmed the split on his twitter page, saying, 'it's true, the wedding's off. crystal has had a change of heart,' rumours sprang up that harris was secretly dating dr. phil's younger son, jordan, and others speculated that the split was planned from the start. so though harris had said she hoped for privacy post-split, she instead defended her decision to various media outlets, including a morning-after-the-split interview on ryan seacrest's kiis-fm morning show in los angeles."i called it off because i didn't think it was the right thing to do," she told seacrest by phone. "it was mutual between hef and i. there was no fight. we sat down and we talked about it.""not seeing someone else," she added. "for a while i've been having second thoughts about everything. i haven't really been at peace with myself lately. i didn't think it was really fair to him. it was all happening too fast for me."resilient hefner, who has four grown children from two previous marriages, will be fine, harris said. "he was only getting married because he thought it was what i wanted. hef's doing great. his lifestyle isn't the most normal lifestyle, multiple girls all around. it's not the lifestyle i wanted. i respect him more than anything, and we're still going to be really close."source: us weeklyphoto credit: david livingston/gettylabels: aruna seth, beverly hills, broken engagements, models, romona cabeza

	 jesse james and kat von d planning summer wedding
	 
    


amid rumours that the pair have split, tattooed reality tv stars jesse james and kat von d have announced that couldn't be further from the truth, and that plans are moving forward for a summer wedding."we're still going strong. things are completely good with us," said james, adding that the pair are set to wed this summer on the one year anniversary of the day they started dating. added james, "that day can't come soon enough. everything is on track. i am absolutely more in love today than i was a year ago. she's the one for me."though the exact date was not revealed, the couple took their romance public last year over labour day weekend, so it looks like the pair will be married before his three children - daughters chandler, 16, and sunny, 7, and son jesse, jr., 14, return to school.the pda-friendly pair have known each other for years, but connected after james finalized his divorce from actress sandra bullock, who left him amidst revelations that he had cheated with multiple women, and while the couple were in the process of adopting son louis bardo, now 18 months, whom bullock eventually adopted on her own.the couple commutes regularly between los angeles, where she owns and operates the la ink tattoo parlour, and austin, where james moved with his children following his divorce. chandler and jesse are his children with first wife karla, with whom he shares parenting duties, while sunny is his daughter with former adult film star janine lindemulder, whose drug problems have led her to relinquish custody to the west coast choppers owner.source: peoplephoto credit: albert l. ortega/picture grouplabels: anniversaries, engagements, planning, reality tv, tv stars

	 gown commission of the year?
	 
    


though sarah burton landed the ultimate gown commission, designing kate middleton's grace kelly-inspired lace gown for the april 29th royal wedding, it's carolina herrera who's now claiming the gown-design spotlight. this past week, it was revealed that the classic american designer was tasked with creating bella's wedding dress for the next film in the hugely-popular twilight series, breaking dawn, part 1.so far, only teases of the gown have been revealed in film trailers, the dress design a closely guarded secret, as much as the new duchess' traditional gown with eight-foot train.fans of the series are already salivating, anticipating something traditional with a modern edge for the series' no-fuss main character, bella swan, portrayed by no-fuss actress kristen stewart. and it's possible that herrera's gown for bella could garner far more copycats than the duchess' long-sleeved creation.source: summit entertainmentvideo credit: (c) summit entertainment 2011/mtv movie awards via youtubelabels: carolina herrera, hollywood weddings

over the weekend, british music tv/radio host fearne cotton, 29, got engaged to her skater boyfriend of the past two years, jesse jenkins, friday night - her 29th birthday. cotton stepped out of the bbc radio 1 studios on monday with a diamond ring (among others) on her left hand.sources claim that jenkins, 24, led cotton, blindfolded, to london's richmond park, where he reportedly got down on one knee and proposed."fearne was so touched at how jesse did it - it was really romantic. it  was a big shock for everyone but fearne is ecstatic. it was the last  thing that she was expecting but she didn't hesitate to say yes. she  is so excited about being engaged that she hasn't even thought about  the wedding - that will be something she thinks about later," says the source.cotton's rep confirmed the rumours late yesterday. it will be the first marriage for both.the presenter has always spoken of her desire for marriage and family. "i've always been broody. having a family of my own is really important, more than anything. i think that's what it's all about, isn't it? it's about finding a life partner who's your best friend. what's the point of doing great things at work if you don't have someone to share it with?"source: daily mailphoto credit: xposurephotos.com; (inset) xposurephotos.comlabels: bling, british celebs, engagements, radio, tv stars

"we've been married for five years now, and i think the secret is in  always keeping it interesting. you have to make time for yourselves."five years is a stretch for almost any hollywood marriage, but aguilera, who welcomed the couple's son, max, in january 2008, tells cosmo, "it's important to be open to growing together, and when the going gets  tough, you have to see how you can make your relationship more special  and how you can spend more quality time together. everyone has rough patches, everybody grows and we all change. it's  important to give each other room to grow and to accept them for who  they are."the couple were married at the staglin family vineyard in rutherford, california on november 19, 2005. the singer wore an elaborate spanish-style christian lacroix gown for the jewish nuptuals. she traded the dress for a satin mini for the reception, where 150 guests including sharon stone, justin timberlake and then-girlfriend cameron diaz, were treated to renditions of aguilera's "lady marmalade" and "at last." the three-day honeymoon followed at a small resort in the napa valley.source: us weeklyphoto credit: getty imageslabels: christian lacroix, honeymoon: napa, photos, singers, waxing poetic, weddings
