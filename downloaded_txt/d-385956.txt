european philanthropic initiative for migration
epim is europe’s largest and longest-standing philanthropic collaborative working on issues of migration, belonging and democracy. we fund and nurture alliances and partnerships, curate the migration ecosystem and cultivate a shared narrative for belonging and democratic resilience.
our view of migration is intersectional and holistic. epim curates and catalyses the migration ecosystem beyond borders, across sectors and institutions, and provides the necessary relational and imagination infrastructures to advance narratives and structures of belonging that inherently benefit all of society, ultimately strengthening democracy.
