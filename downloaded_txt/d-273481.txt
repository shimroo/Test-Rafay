“how a direct response marketing strategist can “pipe” more customers through your doors and profits to your bottom line. “a million dollar marketing education; an invaluable lesson.”
marketing strategies and tips from a proven strategic marketer can be as important to a company as the “wind pipe” is to the newborn baby.
for the baby, a strong and healthy “wind pipe” means sufficient supplies of oxygen to nourish and sustain their growth.
without a strong and healthy “wind pipe,” a newborn may require medical treatment, hospitalization and even surgery to get the necessary amounts of oxygen to their lungs.
for the enterprise, marketing ideas and strategies from an experienced marketer can be the “wind pipe” that supplies the company with new customers and revenue keeping it alive, well and growing.
increase your sales by seeking marketing strategies from an experienced and successful marketer.
