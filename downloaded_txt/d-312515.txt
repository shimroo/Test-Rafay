space force - boots on the moon ™





how for some lighter news. the recent netflix comedy series, "space force" will likely face off against the trump administration over trademark issues. masterfully released around the same time as donald trump's hilarious space force announcement, there are questions around trademark use of the series vs. the military department. 

https://lawandcrime.com/opinion/if-trump-administration-sues-netflix-over-trademark-for-space-force-itll-probably-lose/

the question will likely surround a debate on what everyone is worried about--money. who gets naming rights for merchandise to be specific.

trademarks are filed under nice classifications and usually there's little overlap between a tv show and a branch of government. if netflix overstepped their bounds and tried to do a grab-all across all nice classes, then this will very likely be defeated.

in us trademark law it's first to use, not first to file, so as long as the us government can demonstrate that they were using this term before the series, there should be no problem in having it invalidated.

ussc can update ™ law for www





the u.s. supreme court is set to decide whether marks that combine an arguably generic term with .com are protectable under u.s. trademark law. ropes & gray attorneys suggest that such marks should be protectable upon a showing of acquired distinctiveness, and that such a result would harmonize trademark law with a modern understanding of domain names and the internet.

11 keys to follow employment law standards in hong kong





a quick primer for businesses seeking or operating in hong kong.



1. key minimum employment rights

the principal statute regulating the work relationship is the employment ordinance. many benefits and protections under the ordinance are available only to "continuous employees"—workers who are employed under a continuous contract. a continuous employee must have worked for the same employer for at least four consecutive weeks and at least 18 hours each week.

2. the employment contract

in hong kong, employment contracts can be for an open term—that is, permanent—or a fixed term. if the period is not specified in the contract, it will be deemed to be a contract for one month, renewable from month to month once the employee has worked for at least 18 hours per week for a continuous period of four weeks.

the use of agency workers is not as common in hong kong as in certain other jurisdictions in asia, partly due to the relative ease with which employers can terminate employment in hong kong./.....
