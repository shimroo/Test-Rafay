empowering minds for an evolving world



we are a school that uplifts identities, pursues academic excellence, and is guided by social justice.














social justice and social science








since its founding during the civil rights movement, manhattan country school has been an innovator in progressive education, cultivating a safe space for children to uncover and shape their identities. with an unwavering commitment to anti-racism and a rich, developmentally appropriate social science curriculum, mcs proudly stands as one of the most diverse educational institutions in nyc. our students engage in social activism and community-focused thinking, emphasizing interconnectivity and inclusivity. they are empowered to become catalysts for social change, working towards a more just world.our children excel academically through an intentional and rigorous curriculum that goes beyond the accumulation of knowledge and challenges students to think more deeply, embrace diverse perspectives, and be bravely inquisitive.

different animals at our farm (cows, pigs, hens, sheep)

































at the mcs farm our students are grounded in self and rooted in community.



on the farm, students are engaged in continuous learning, cultivating systems thinking, discovering the origins of things, and fostering self-reliance and teamwork. it offers them a valuable break from the hustle of city life and structured routines and provides a unique perspective on time and space, while nurturing a profound appreciation for sustainability.



























“there is no school more diverse racially, ethnically . . . or socioeconomically than mcs, and it kind of amazed me that it could exist.”
