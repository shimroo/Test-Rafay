3dmd applications. from healthcare to artificial intelligence.






for 20-plus years, 3dmd has enabled its worldwide customer community to successfully train ai, wear tech, and image health. with a proven clinical background, 3dmd offers industrial-strength temporal-3d (4d-motion) dense-surface camera systems for human subject applications demanding ‘near ground truth’ 3d shape accuracy including healthcare, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, humanoid robotics, wearable-tech, human factors, ergonomics, anthropometrics, ar/vr/xr, etc. with a highly efficient subject workflow suitable for recruiting thousands of subjects, 3dmd supports high-volume head, face, full body, hand, and foot performance capture exercises for many customer innovations from clinical findings and ‘real world’ ai/ml training to groundbreaking design of wearable tech, performance apparel, and efficient ergonomics. 3dmd’s robust technology has sustained the findings in hundreds of peer-reviewed investigative research publications – many of which are found here on our website.
