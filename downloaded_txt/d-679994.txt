notice
many pages on this wiki are out of date.  we are in the process of migrating currently useful content to documents on free geek's google drive [1] .  this process will take a while, but in the meantime, please help by identifying which pages are still useful.
if you see a page that is still in use, please edit it and add the following code at the top:

 {{migrate}}

this will flag the page so that we will know to migrate it.  

want to help with the migration?
to do this you will need a free geek google apps account.  (see richard.)
we are developing the best system for migrating content from this wiki to documents on our google drive.  in general, if you are migrating a group of pages you can try a work flow like this:

create a new folder on your free geek google drive.  this will help organize related documents.
allow that folder to be visible to all of free geek and editable by an appropriate group.
for each page you will migrate:
create a new google doc in that folder.  give it an appropriate name (the same as the one from the wiki?)
view the printable version of your wiki page.
highlight all text.  copy and paste into the new document.
clean up the formatting and save.
please check back to this page fairly often, as we might change the suggested workflow.
