home staging tips for crystal coast homeowners







home sellers are growing more confident in the real estate market, given home price appreciation and buyer demand. and while timing and pricing are two of the single most important factors when selling your crystal coast home, staging can make a world of difference.


these easy, low-cost projects can prime your home in emerald isle, atlantic beach, morehead city, beaufort, newport, havelock, cape carteret, swansboro or pine knoll shores for real estate success and attract the right homebuyers.



curb appeal

try to see your home through a buyer's eyes. walk around your property noting what needs to be repaired, landscaped or cleaned up. you can easily boost the curb appeal of your north carolina home by planting new flowers, giving your front door a new coat of paint, and even placing a new welcome mat outside.



furniture edit

take a quick tour of your home's interior spaces, walking outside of normal traffic patterns. do you notice obstacles in the flow of the room? it may be time to edit your furniture down to the basics to allow the room to appear larger. also, be sure the focal points of the room like a fireplace or large window are not being blocked.



declutter

nothing can turn away a crystal coast homebuyer like a cluttered home. in each space, take the time to throw away any unnecessary items like old magazines or papers and organize those that need to be kept. find a home for all small appliances and toiletries, keeping knick knacks to a minimum.



if you're ready to sell your home this year, gena gilbert real estate can help! consider our team your go-to for any questions you might having about the home selling process. we look forward to hearing from you!

what to ask yourself when buying homes or condos in north carolina







purchasing a home or condo along north carolina's crystal coast is not only an investment, but for many homebuyers, a dream. coastal carolina is an ideal place to call home and this fall, the local real estate market is making it easy to land a great deal on a fantastic property. 



however, if you're unsure if now is the right time for you, these 3 questions can help you decide about timing your purchase in emerald isle, atlantic beach, morehead city, beaufort, newport, havelock, cape carteret, swansboro or pine knoll shores.



ask: why am i buying a home?

when you know your main reason for purchasing a new home on the crystal coast, you can move forward. set your finances aside for a moment and get down to the basics. a few strong reasons might include: 


a good place to raise your family
school districts
a place where you feel welcome, at home, or safe
more space
more control over your home



ask: where are mortgage rates going?

mortgage rates are a huge factor to consider when buying a home or condo in north carolina. but you're in luck! right now, mortgage rates are lower than they have been in over a year. 



ask: where are home values going?

another important factor to consider if you'll be selling your current property in emerald isle, atlantic beach, morehead city, beaufort, newport, havelock, cape carteret, swansboro or pine knoll shores. home values will continue to rise as we move forward— experts suggesting by 4% in 2015. by 2018, cumulative appreciation may range from 11 to 19 percent.

mortgage rates down, great time to buy a crystal coast condo!







homebuyers are constantly looking for the best time to make a move, curious about how to time the local real estate market just right. well, the look is over. the time is now! current market conditions, including the current mortgage rates now at historic lows, have paved the way for coastal carolina homebuyers to purchase their dream home!

mortgage rates have just taken a tumble and in fact, haven't been this low since june 2013. this week marked the fourth straight week for declines, meaning now is more affordable than it has been in over a year to buy a home or condo.

but mortgage rates aren't the only reason why crystal coast homebuyers should take advantage of current real estate market conditions. housing prices are also rising and will continue to do so over the next five years.

if you're a crystal coast home seller, this could mean great news for the success of selling your home at a great price. on the other side of the real estate fence, north carolina homebuyers looking to find the best deal or purchase a home at a lower price, should act now!

according to the home price expectation survey, including over 100 economists and market analysts, home values will appreciate anywhere from 11.2 percent and 27.8 percent over the next five years.

gena gilbert real estate can help you take advantage of this exciting window of opportunity in the crystal coast real estate market! with mortgage rates this low, waiting no longer makes sense— contact us today to find the perfect waterfront home or condo in emerald isle, atlantic beach, morehead city, beaufort, newport, havelock, cape carteret, swansboro and pine knoll shores.

understanding your crystal coast, north carolina homeowners insurance 







you've just purchased a waterfront home or condo on north carolina's beautiful crystal coast— now is the time to get to know your homeowners insurance policy. the last thing any new homeowner wants is a surprise when the time comes to file a claim. 

a recent survey discovered that over half of all homeowners couldn't answer simple questions about their own policy, with many who hadn't even taken a look at the text. but you can be a savvy coastal carolina homeowner this year with just an hour or two of reading. 

below are a few key features to spot and study in your policy:

know what is covered
as a homeowner in emerald isle, atlantic beach, morehead city, beaufort, newport, havelock, cape carteret, swansboro and pine knoll shores, it's important that you know the exact breakdown of your policy. don't assume everything is covered— look for the areas marked for structural (your home itself), liability (protection from others) and contents (your belongings).

look for updates
have you recently inherited any valuables? have you just added onto your crystal coast home or made changes to your condo? you need to update your policy to reflect these! work with your provider to determine what is and is not covered in this area.

determine if you're covered for all risks
a homeowners insurance policy is often determined as "all risk" or "named peril" which is the difference between a variety of damages and a limited, specific list. if you find you are covered for the latter, consider updating accordingly.

as your local team of real estate experts, gena gilbert real estate has years of experience to assist with both your home purchase and home sale. contact us today with any questions you might have!
