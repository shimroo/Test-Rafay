					for more than 150 years, the atlanta humane society has stood as a pillar of support for animals and people in our city. when you give, you are helping homeless animals find loving homes, offering medical care to those in pain, and supporting outreach programs that uplift our entire community.				
support our work



our vision for the future
our goal is clear and deeply motivated by our desire to keep pets in their loving homes: we seek to improve the lives and well-being of pets and people, collectively and perhaps most importantly, one life, one need, one animal at a time.

your gift impacts pets and people in our community. and, just last year, so many lives were changed because of your support.
