stefanie powers still a globe-trotting activist









stefanie powers gives no hint of jet lag during an afternoon conversation - despite having flown in to los angeles a night earlier from kenya, by way of new york. youthful, dynamic and beautiful at 72, the red-haired actress also gives no hint of slowing down. she divides her time between performing, globetrotting and the wildlife conservation issues that melded with her animal-loving nature during her near-decade-long love affair with the late william holden back in the 1970s.


she is here to talk about love by the book, the hallmark channel original movie debuting tomorrow (january 24), in which she has a small role as proprietress of a book store coffee bar - a woman attuned to the romantic and business woes of young store owner leah renee.


“they have a wonderful formula - putting the young ones who have the problems with the older ones who have the voices of wisdom,” she says of the cable channel’s exceedingly popular flicks.  powers admits she’s surprised by some of the hallmark channel devotees she has come across, “friends of mine who are terribly sophisticated, who you might expect to dismiss these movies as too corny. they love them.”


of course, a few of her friends are emoting for the hallmark channel cameras themselves - like former hart to hart leading man robert wagner, who recently did a santa claus cameo, along with wife jill st. john as mrs. c., in northpole. the thought of a wagner-powers reunion movie makes powers smile. “any chance to work with him i’d love,” she says.


most of the work she’d like to do is in theater, and she has plans brewing both for the west end and broadway this year and next. powers maintains homes in los angeles, london and kenya and travels often. she’d love to see more of mongolia, where she enjoyed playing polo. she’s also played polo riding an elephant in nepal. as if that weren’t extreme enough, a few months ago, the life-long rider tried extreme cowboy racing, which combines cowboy skills with an obstacle course.


“i had so much fun, i can’t wait to do it again,” she says.


in 2009, powers lost her mother, with whom she was very close, and fought lung cancer. she says she came out of it healthy, but with an intensified awareness of the passage of time, and a more acute desire to accomplish things she wants to do. those things include saving endangered species — a passion she shared with tom carroll, one of the directors of the william holden wildlife foundation she established in 1982, and her long-time partner until his death last year. she sadly admits the battles to save creatures on the brink of extinction are fraught with terrible frustration.


“i’m not sure i don’t get disheartened, but i’m also angry - and if you still have anger in your belly, you do something about it,” declares the actress, who works not only through her foundation, but is involved in efforts to save jaguars in central america, wild horses in north america, and elephants in africa.


some 11,000 students a year visit her mount kenya wildlife reserve — students powers hopes to fire up enough that they leave ready to “preach the gospel of conservation.”


it appears that age is no stumbling block for her. how does she feel about the weight of years? “one day it will come down,” she says, “but until then, i’m not going to hesitate to tackle anything.”

stefanie powers in love by the book





stefanie powers stars in a new hallmark channel original movie.

a whimsical bookstore owner discovers that her own happily ever after might not be by the (story) book in love by the book. leah renee plays an impassioned bookstore owner who tries to balance her budding romance with a dashing suitor,
played by ryan bittle with proving her business prowess to her investor, played by television veteran john schneider. chiming in with sage love advice is television veteran stefanie powers who plays a friendly bookstore co-worker with endless romantic wisdom.

bookstore owner emma believes in fairy tales. although she has yet to be swept away by prince charming, she sees real knight in shining armor potential with a new suitor, landon. as emma balances time with landon and saving her bookstore with once irritating business consultant, eric, however, she weighs storybook romance against genuine commitment. while
she sorts out her feelings toward landon and eric, as well as toward love and romance, emma begins to realize that fairytale endings aren't always by the book.

love by the book premieres saturday, january 24, 2015 at 9:00 p.m. on the hallmark channel.

a walk on the wild side





she had dodged plenty of armed killers while starring in classic tv series hart to hart and the girl from u.n.c.l.e. but this time the bullets were real and close. 

“scared? of course i was scared,” says powers. 

she was at her villa on mount kenya, home to the wildlife reserve founded by her former lover, hollywood legend william holden, and knew that the gunfire brought danger. 

“when you hear a rat-a-tat-tat from ak-47s and you only have a shotgun you’re not going out,” says the actress. 

“we had three rhinos. poachers came to our ranch with ak-47s and murdered them.” 

but powers finally summoned the courage to confront the poachers with a handful of her staff. 

“they didn’t get the horns because they were finally chased off but poaching is a serious problem,” she says. “in east africa we’ve lost 100,000 elephants in the past three years. i’m 72 and we could see the extinction of elephants in my lifetime.” 

she hopes to evade her own extinction at the hands of armed poachers, saying: “i try to be careful. one never knows.” 

powers, who finished filming two tv movies that will come to british screens in 2015, is an intriguing mix of hollywood aristocracy with her jet-setter insouciance and down-to-earth conservationism. 

she is the sort of global adventurer who can say, “on a trip to india after i had been playing polo on elephants in nepal, my mother decided to have a diamond put in her nose at the age of 80,” and equally happily confide: “i make my own compost.” 

yet stefanie powers is all hollywood glamour: a svelte and vivacious redhead who looks decades younger than her years, every inch a star. 

well, almost every inch. 

“i’m never going to do any hand or nail commercials,” she admits. “my nails are short and my hands are always dirty, showing the wear and tear of horses and gardens.” 

animals are her life. she has more than 20 horses spread between homes in africa, los angeles and london, along with nine dogs – all rescues – and 37 species on her kenyan ranch including zebra, eland, oryx, buffalo and wildebeest. 

you might envy her amazonian yellow nape parrot papuga, who has the run of her los angeles mansion. 

“she has been with me for 42 years, longer than most relationships in hollywood,” says powers. “she has a trust fund so if she outlives me she is definitely going to be taken care of.” 

powers is no pampered diva and, though she was the first voted off i’m a celebrity, get me out of here! in 2011, she insists: “i was the only person in that entire group who had ever spent a night out of doors. i know what it takes to survive in the wild. i like to sleep under the stars. 

“it’s a demanding lifestyle in kenya. there’s no corner market so we have to plan ahead. i have my own chickens and grow a lot of carrots, potatoes, turnips and beets. 

“some women enjoy jewellery and dresses but i’m afraid my horses have more clothes than i do. in america i’ve taken up a new sport called extreme cowboy racing, which is as much fun as i’ve ever had on a horse. it’s an obstacle course with challenges like cutting out a cow from a herd at full speed and keeping it isolated for as long as you can. i have so many horses because i don’t sell them and several are at least in their 30s.” 

her passion for animal conservation was shockingly instilled at an early age when her stepfather, a racehorse breeder, took her to a slaughterhouse to see how many horses ended their days. 

“we saw them waiting to be killed – pretty horses, little horses, young ones, old ones, all of them were going to become some dog’s dinner because somebody couldn’t make that ultimate commitment. my father believed that animals weren’t toys and that if you made a commitment to an animal it was lifelong.” 

though she loves animals it was actor william holden, the oscar-winning star of films including sunset boulevard, stalag 17 and network, whom she calls “the love of my life”. 

he was 24 years her senior but she cherishes their decade together until his death in 1981 aged 63. 

“he was the greatest influence on me and it was a deep and passionate love.” 

though holden was an alcoholic he managed to stay sober for lengthy periods while with powers. 

“he was a person of great depth, fun and adventure.” 

it was holden who bought a kenyan estate and founded the mount kenya game ranch and after his death powers launched the william holden wildlife foundation to continue his work. 

“everything he wanted to teach me i wanted to learn,” says powers. 

the men she married never fulfilled her in the same way: actor gary lockwood for six years until their 1972 divorce and in 1993 she wed frenchman patrick de la chenais for another six-year marriage. 

as much as powers loves to answer the call of the wild, her conservation work is costly and she says: “i have to keep working. i like to work. there’s a lot to support.” 

she runs the william holden wildlife foundation, campaigns for the conservation of panthers and the asiatic lion and is working on a documentary about jaguars. 

“there were times when i devoted much more time to conservation than i probably should have ,” she admits. “no one pays for my air fare to get to kenya, no one pays for my car, no one pays for my petrol, no one pays for our office, our insurance, our director’s insurance. i don’t take a salary. i pay for everything with the money raised. the house is paid for by me and not with donor money. that is very important to me.” 

a long-time smoker, powers was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009 and had part of a lung removed just two weeks after her mother had died. 

“those two events were the most significant double punches i’ve ever had in my life,” she says. “we shared a home for the last 27 years of her life. she died in my arms at the age of 96. they were life-changing. but i’m a lucky girl. i’ve fully recovered. cancer changes everybody. but i’ve always been concerned that i won’t have enough time to finish everything i want to accomplish.”

she is soon to take to the stage in australia starring in a play about hollywood legend tallulah bankhead in a show she hopes to bring to the west end, and is developing a movie set in asia. 

she also has two romantic comedies coming to british television this year: ring by spring and love by the book. powers still relishes her years starring opposite robert wagner in the hit television series hart to hart from 1979 to 1984, playing wealthy couple jennifer and jonathan hart who moonlighted as amateur detectives. 

“people always thought we were married in real life,” she says. “and for five years robert and i spent more time with each other than we did with our families.” 

but she laments the way hollywood has changed since her debut more than 50 years ago. 

“young actors barely have a chance to hone their skills. there are no more regional theatres, the studio system has gone and kids go to acting school to learn how to become reality show actors. 

“celebrity is like kleenex and people are used up so rapidly. stars are instantly replaceable. i wouldn’t want to be starting out a career now. i don’t think i’d last.”

she has had plastic surgery that she adamantly won’t discuss but works hard to stay in shape, saying: “cross training is extremely important. i’m out with my horses all of the time, i still take dance classes and although my leg doesn’t go quite as high as it used to it still goes pretty high. 

“i’ve no plans to retire. i’m happy to keep working until they haul me off. i hope i’m that fortunate.” 

at least her parrot will never have to worry.

prudential auditor who romanced actress stefanie powers dies at 72





thomas carroll, who announced his retirement in june as chief auditor at prudential financial inc. and had a brush with celebrity through his 14-year relationship with actress stefanie powers, has died. he was 72.

he died on aug. 12, according to a notice on the website of frank e. campbell funeral chapel in new york. no details were provided.

in 2001, during carroll’s 15-year tenure as chief auditor and senior vice president, newark, new jersey-based prudential became a public company following 125 years of ownership by policyholders.

he “was instrumental in supporting the demutualization of prudential and ensuring that we manage our company in a manner consistent with what our customers and shareholders expect,” vice chairman mark grier said in the announcement of carroll’s retirement. prudential is the second-largest u.s. life insurer by assets behind metlife inc.

carroll joined prudential in 1999 from bankers trust co., where he had been general auditor, managing director and partner. he was global chief auditor and a managing director at credit suisse first boston from 1991 to 1996. he began his career in 1965 at the accounting firm that today is kpmg llp, according to a news release announcing his move to prudential.

manhattan meeting

it was in 2000 that he met powers at a benefit concert held at an apartment on new york’s west side where she was among the singers who performed, according to her 2010 memoir, “one from the hart.” powers, a television star since the 1960s, is best known for “hart to hart,” which aired from 1979 to 1984. in it, she and actor robert wagner portrayed glamorously wealthy husband-and-wife amateur detectives.

the host of the 2000 benefit fixed her up with carroll, who was attending as chairman of the building’s board.

when they met at the apartment door, “i think i saw his smile before i saw his face,” she wrote. “it was a very attractive smile, and it belonged to a very attractive face. he was the all-american boy, healthy, fit, a notre dame irishman. clear-eyed, and unattached, he looked like a movie star in his suit and tie.”

they made a date to go sailing the following day.

twice married and divorced, powers said she initially resisted becoming involved again. but, she added, “there is an abiding decency in tom that makes him a rare and special person.”

kenya charity

carroll became a director of the foundation that powers founded to honor william holden, the academy award-winning actor who was her romantic partner until his death in 1981. the william holden wildlife foundation, based in beverly hills, california, raises money to support a conservation and education center in kenya, where holden created a safari club in 1959.

a 2009 article in prudential’s employee newsletter described how carroll created a pen-pal program connecting students at alexander street school in newark and guara primary school in nanyuki, kenya.

“i wanted to help inner-city students here learn more about the world and the environment directly from kids their age,” carroll was quoted as saying.

thomas joseph carroll was born on aug. 30, 1941. his parents were patrick carroll and the former mary jennings, according to a 2012 death notice for his sister, patricia carroll hayden.

he graduated from the university of notre dame and was an officer in the u.s. navy.

according to the funeral home statement, he was a member of the new york yacht club and the larchmont yacht club. his sailboat, the siren song, was the top irc boat on long island sound, sailing world reported in 2011. he ran the new york city marathon nine times, once finishing in less than four hours, according to the notice.

in addition to powers, survivors include a son, tom carroll jr.; a daughter, cathy locabucci; and three grandchildren.
