our values





biblical
 
god’s word is entirely true and trustworthy. every ministry and mission must be saturated 
with scripture.
(nehemiah 8:1–12; 2 timothy 3:16–17)



missional
 
all true believers are missionaries for jesus regardless of age, stage of life, or vocation. god can use anyone, anywhere as his witness. 
(luke 10:25–37; acts 1:8) 
 
 
 
 



intentional
 
evangelistic intentionality must characterize all 
ministries and missions as we fish for people and not simply maintain the aquarium.
(matthew 4:19 & 28:18–20)



charitable
 
we can joyfully express our abiding love for the lord and others by generously and cheerfully giving the best of our time, talent, and treasure. 
 (2 corinthians 9:6–8)
