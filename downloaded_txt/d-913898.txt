saint of the month - january/february 2025 - st. theodosios the great

st. theodosios the great-jan 11

saint theodosius the great lived during the fifth-sixth century and was the founder of cenobitic monasticism. he was born in cappadocia of pious parents. endowed with a splendid voice, he zealously toiled at church reading and singing. saint theodosius prayed fervently that the lord would guide him on the way to salvation. in his early years he visited the holy land and met with saint simeon the stylite (september 1), who blessed him and predicted future pastoral service for him.
