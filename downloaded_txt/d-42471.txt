motivating the world in moments



  what's new this week?
feb. 9  - feb. 15

"hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. it is the trust that they will not last forever, that hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. it is faith that a source of strength and renewal lies within to lead us through the dark into the sunshine."
--- elizabeth a. chase
