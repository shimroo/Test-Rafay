               over the last year we as a family have lost two of our most beloved family members,  in junewe lost our lucy she is the one lying in the chair she had, had arthritis for years but the last three months had become very ill and on her last night with us she had a stroke which made it impossible for her to move her right side and control her bladder.  the next morning my son took her to the vet and she was put to sleep.  we were all heart broken, includding my little rikki.  who unknown to us had cancer he went down hill very fast so at the end of oct.  i did the hardest thing i have ever had to to in my life i had to put my baby to sleep.  all i can say because again i am crying i miss my little guy so so so much.  but he is in a better place and no longer in pain and he is with lucy.  for i firmly believe all dogs go to heaven  where god can take good care of them. so after you read this go and give all your dogs and cats and pets a hug and love them while you can...

hi i know it has been awhile





hi everyone i know it hass been awhile since i have posted, but ihave been really going nuts but it should calm down soon. have you ever been in seach of a new home well right now my mother and i are searching for a new apartment. it isn't easy the first problem is we have a dog, a lot of people with rental property don't want a dog and a lot of the ones that do have huge rents. so it is taking longer than i had hoped it would. i am still hoping to be settled by the new school year. so how are you all. i have changed my blog format a bit hope you all like it.as alwaysdeb :)
