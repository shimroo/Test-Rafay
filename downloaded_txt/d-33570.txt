peter stubbs (1945-2023)
 it is with great sadness that we pass on the news that peter stubbs, the founder and driving force behind edinphoto, passed away peacefully at the end of 2023.
over the past 25 years, peter spent countless hours creating, maintaining and updating this website. his sole purpose was to share his extensive knowledge of edinburghs early photographers, the citys history, architecture and workers, and his own photographs. this website has allowed for childhood memories to be shared and old acquaintances reunited.
edinphoto is a valuable resource for so many and will remain available as a free archive for everyone to enjoy. we won't be adding any new content to the site but will try to ensure all links are working and correct.
for any urgent issues please contact admin@edinphoto.org.uk.
thank you to everyone who contributed to the website over the years, and especially to peter for making it all possible.

i've found that 
		adding my photos to instagram is far easier than adding them to the 
		edinphoto site.  so i'm still updating edinphoto, but i've begun to 
		add more of my own photos and short video clips to 

instagram.
