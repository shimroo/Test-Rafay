this the ritz-carlton resort sets a new standard in afternoon tea



attributed to the afternoon hunger pangs of anna, the seventh duchess of bedford, the tradition of afternoon tea or “high tea” has become a treasured worldwide custom. since its introduction in england back in 1840 when the duchess satisfied herself with a simple menu of bread, butter, cake and tea, afternoon tea has developed into an often lavish affair with finely crafted pastries and sweets, champagne, and exotic tea blends.

escape to the côte d’azur any season of the year



it had been a long, rainy winter in paris when i first made my escape to the french riviera, a region in the south of france stretching along the coast from the france–italy border to the massif de l’esterel rock formation. a deep craving for the sun’s warm breath on my shoulders and a longing to drift asleep to the wild crashing of waves pulled me toward my southern sojourn as if by instinct.
