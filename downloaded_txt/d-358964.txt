welcome to my website museum, a cross
  between the smithsonian institute and pee-wee's
  playhouse...

if you're looking for neat stuff to add
  to your collection or if you just want to look at a bunch of neat stuff,
  you've come to the right place!

new photos will be added on a regular
  basis, so be sure to check back. there's lots more
  where these came from.
 



i
also buy single model kits or whole collections, so if you've
got some to sell or trade, let me know!
even
if it's junkers or just boxes of parts, i may be
interested. i'm mainly looking for stuff that was produced before 1980.

for
sale! 
our first souvenir item....for lack of a
better term.
the
build-it-yourself milano model & toy museum delivery van model.

made
of sturdy cardboard, full-color graphics--- just cut it out and put it
together.
it's fun
for the whole family and it's a major ego trip for me since it not only has a
beautiful reproduction of our neat little logo, but it also has my face in the
windows! 
just
send $4 postpaid (no stamps, please!....did
people actually do that at one time, send stamps instead of cash?) to the
milano model & toy museum at the address above.
collect
'em, trade 'em with your
friends, get the whole series....actually there's only one, so skip that last
part.

by dean milano with much appreciated help from bill carreon)

i've
stopped producing the dvd, unless someone wants one really badly. thanks
to all the folks who bought one!
the museum dvd.
it's a
little over an hour long and includes a complete walk-through of the museum
exhibits. 
it
also includes sections on the building of the museum, the opening night party
and even a few of the tv shows we've appeared on.

send check or money order for $15
postpaid, to:
dean milano
362 highland ave.

if you
never got a chance to visit us before we closed, just click on the thumbnails
below for a virtual tour of the museum.
  
neat picture of the storefront. no special effects used, the picture just came out
that way by itself. must be the heavens shining down on us.
           
this
was our gift shop, complete with a working early 1960s arcade game.
lots
of vintage model kits for sale along with an assortment of other goodies.

collection of figure models.
 
    
the "front room". this area featured playsets,
toys, advertising memorabilia, old radios, salt and pepper shakers, beer and
soda pop paraphernalia, dioramas, and our "guest" showcase, which
rotated displays and collections on a regular basis. 
it
also featured several shadowbox dioramas and the 15 ' long "dean
street".

this
was the model kit room, with lots of cases and shelves for lots of
models. this room also featured prototype models, large scale master models
from revell-monogram, and many historic items from
the model kit industry from the late 1940s to the present.

and finally, the train layout and research library. the library was available to the public and contained
a wealth of books and magazines on pop culture as well as model kit books and
periodicals. 
our
h.o. scale train layout was a 10' x 5' beauty featuring an amusement park with
working carnival rides and a small mid-western town circa the 1960s.
