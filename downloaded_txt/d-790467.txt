stories of transformation




suzan vulaj
vp, nbcuniversal
as a working mother with a demanding career, i often found myself juggling countless responsibilities, feeling overwhelmed, and losing sight of who i truly am. that all changed when i discovered body & brain. the private healing sessions with [my instructor] were life-altering. each session helped me focus, reconnect with my inner self, and provided the clarity i desperately needed to realign my life. this healing center is truly a sanctuary for anyone looking to find balance, peace, and a deeper connection with themselves.

for the past 19 years, the body & brain center has profoundly impacted my life. the training and support i received have been invaluable, helping me grow both personally and professionally. thanks to the holistic approach and dedicated instructors, i’ve become a more effective leader and learned to value myself deeply in various roles—employee, mother, daughter, wife, sister, friend, and earth citizen. i’ve learned to handle challenges with grace and find balance through every difficulty. i’m truly grateful for the growth and transformation i’ve experienced here.
