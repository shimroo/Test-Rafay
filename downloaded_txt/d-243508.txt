“rmgo has been a steadfast defender of colorado’s gun rights in our collective fight against unconstitutional gun legislation. their dedication to preserving freedoms aligns with our mission at swampfox optics, and we appreciate their relentless advocacy for gun owners across the state.”

“rocky mountain gun owners (rmgo) stands as a more uncompromising defender of second amendment rights than the nra, refusing to back down from political pressure or compromise on gun control measures. unlike the nra, which has at times supported restrictions like red flag laws and background check expansions, rmgo remains steadfast in its no-compromise stance, ensuring that gun rights are never eroded. their grassroots-driven approach and dedication to holding politicians accountable make them a stronger and more reliable advocate for firearm owners.” 














ben gates 




 









 





“rmgo has been a stalwart ally in the fight against the state’s never-ending overreach and efforts to eliminate your creator-endowed right to self defense against criminals both common and elected. the founders of our nation were well versed in the history of government tyranny and were very intentional and very clear. there is nothing unclear about “shall not be infringed,” and the wisdom of that specificity becomes more evident as “common sense gun legislation” is stacked bill after bill to crush the intent and execution of your second amendment. join me & join rmgo in fighting the government’s violation of your 2a on their way to eliminate the rest. ”
