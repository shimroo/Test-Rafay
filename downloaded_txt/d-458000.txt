“upcam for me is a group i can come to whenever, with whatever is going on in my life and know i’m loved and accepted.  i can come to worship in the middle of a horrible week and come out refreshed and reminded of god’s love, ready for the rest of the week.”

— deanna d.

hear students talk about their upcam experience.


“when i first came to cwru, i was not plugged in to any religious/ christian organizations on campus. other christian organizations that i found did not fit my style or belief system, either because they were too polarizing or too aggressive.  one day i finally swallowed my fears and i was hooked ... i decided that upcam was definitely the place for me.”
