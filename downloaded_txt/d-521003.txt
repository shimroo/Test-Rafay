news and info about stuck mojo - one of the best heavy rock bands ever! stuckmojo.net












 
















welcome to the time capsule that is stuckmojo.net! 



the year is 2013. time to take a look back. many of the links below are broken (but i am reworking this site now). the band is gone, no more (for now). 
but you will find here a record of what once was and some refreshed links to other places about stuck mojo! 
 
this site is here because i am as passionate about this music
as the musicians who made it. i absolutely love it. i just can't get enough.
crank it up!
so sure the guys went on to do other
things. that's life and that's great! i look forward to hearing the new
stuff. in the meantime, the mojo will live on here and elsewhere on the
net. there are a lot of great mojo sites out there and i don't want to
duplicate them here. i will however reproduce content that may be gone
from the net. 
ok on this web page stuck
mojo rock
under "the kidd speaks out" is the fascinating story about how a fan of the group got to
join the band and is now part of fozzy. a must read! 
questions, comments, news?! email


their catalog of music is still available and the dvd may be as well:

stuck mojo is back baby!!! back!!!!!!!!!!!! - 



july 4th, 2007 -  
i am sorry to fellow devoted fans out there for 2.5 years (bang head against wall!) for no 
updates. i get email sometimes and i respond though. personal life has just been crazy and
have not had time to update. however, now, it's time! in fact i need to look at a complete site 
redesign. i have taken some web classes and something good should come out of that for here! 
anyway, stuck mojo are back and there are a few different sites to go to along with some forums
for discussion. i present links here for you:






the new official stuck mojo website


stuck mojo forum


german/intl stuck mojo site


mojo's new album - southern born killers









stuck mojo dvd
released - get
yours now!


1-3-2005
-  keepin it real - stuck mojo fans new and old will not want to
miss this long awaited opportunity to get their hands on the new dvd with
over three hours of content including rare interviews and live footage.
and since this is only part one, i cant wait to see what they have for
part two! for a band as solid and influential in the heavy rock genre as
stuck mojo, until now there is very little media such as music videos,
interviews and live concert footage out there that a fan can find. however
with a band that has over a 10 year history you know that this stuff has
to be out there somewhere. and that somewhere was in the hands of the band
who have finally compiled and released their history on this new dvd in
the form of interviews, behind the scenes footage, short video documentaries,
appearances on mtv, live clips and scores of photos, all dating from 1992
to 2004.  read

10-29-2004 - rich ward has said
the following: "bonz has called me periodically for the last 6 months or
so to talk about the future of stuck mojo.... after a couple of conversations,
we recently agreed to put our stuff aside and to write a new record.
at this time i can't make any promises other than to my commitment to write
the best mojo record ever." read

october 2004:
well it's been about a year since
any updates but now it's time because there is actually some news to report
on! several things. cafu is no longer. rich is now working on his own project
called the duke
and you can check out his awesome
new website. the site features various media clips as well as news
and coments written by rich himself! get on the duke's email list for the
latest updates. 
now for some really cool
mojo news: stuck mojo is putting out a brand new dvd, "inside the monster:
the evilution of stuck mojo vol. i", featuring live footage and interviews
and more available on novemeber 20th. check it out on the new
website, stuck mojo media. we will be posting a review shortly after
its release. read the press release
about the dvd.
other items:
i'm not sure if 420 monks is still
around or not (it's not). i got an email with some info about a new project
that bonz is working on and here's the scoop:


 

i've been working with bonz and his new set of faces in a project called
"dead gospel".  it's all brand new material, and they've already got
a show scheduled at "the last great watering hole" in tucker, ga on november
5th.  i've been helping them with some pre-production work before
they get ready to enter in the studio to cut an lp.  the guys have
been practicing 5 to 6 days a week in midtown atl so they asked me to get
the word out and about to those who'd be interested in hearing what bonz's
new band's got to offer.
look for www.deadgospel.com
to come to fruition in (or hopefully before)  november.
rock on,
-s. kelly
ps; the show on november 5th is free (21 and up!) with uncrowned
and 
threat 13.
