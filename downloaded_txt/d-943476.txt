thank you for joining us at our 40th anniversary!
see you back in hawaii december 8-12, 2025


the annual computer security applications conference (acsac) brings together leading researchers and practitioners, along with a diverse group of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest cybersecurity results and topics. with peer reviewed technical papers, invited talks, panels, national interest discussions, and workshops, acsac continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technologies.
this year, we will celebrate acsac's 40th edition. acsac's first edition was held in 1985 and is now one of the oldest computer security conferences, second only to the ieee symposium on security and privacy. we invite you to join us for this special anniversary, which will be held near the infamous waikiki beach in honolulu, hawaii!
as an internationally recognized forum where researchers, practitioners, and developers meet to learn and to exchange practical ideas and experiences in computer and network security, we invite you to submit your work. in addition to peer-reviewed papers on novel applied research, we also welcome case studies on real-world applications, panels featuring world experts, and workshops consisting of 1-2 day sessions on hot cybersecurity and privacy topics.
