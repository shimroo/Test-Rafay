 welcome  to issue 111.  we  begin  with  churail,  a story by pakistani  and british writer, kamila  shamsie.   here  the legend of the churail features in the dynamics of a pakistani  family now living in england. a  teenager learns of the legend from her older cousin, zainab, and the  interplay between the two is delightful.

                next  up is preservation  by andrew  cominelli (us) in which a man at work researching the  historical background  of an old colonial home comes slowly to confront a  painful part of his  past. it’s  a touching piece, beautifully told.  
 and  from england we have all we got by michael  bunn. set  in barcelona, our protagonist meets a most unexpected american in a  dive bar in  the raval.  you  get a good feel for the sights and smells of the barrio  as  you follow the encounter. 
in  don’t!,  a  poignant  piece of flash fiction by us writer, josephine  sloyan, a  suicidal  young female recounts her struggle with a light touch that nicely  plays with a hard topic. 

                  we  are also pleased to have an  excerpt in translation, floral games (juegos  florales),  from the recently  released  spanish novel horizonte tardã­o by peruvian writer ernesto  escobar ulloa. in  this piece,  a boyhood confusion over his name, in addition to the name itself,  forms the motif. if  you read spanish, be sure to look for the novel, which is garnering  much praise.

                  translating from the english to spanish, we  have coches  deportivos by stephen  g eoannou which  appeared  in issue 85 as muscle cars. en coches  deportivos una joven pareja vive al lado de unos chicos que aman los coches  musculosos,  la mãºsica  alta y el alcohol; mientras que el marido de la joven pareja ama  hacer pesas para mostrar sus propios mãºsculos. cuando su esposa lo  empuja a hablar con los chicos sobre el alboroto, lo hace a  regaã±adientes, abriendo la puerta a un encuentro intrigante y  memorable.

                i  love these stories; they pull you along with  fine prose and intrigue,  pack a punch, and stay with you  long after the reading.
 in  our picks  from back issuesâ  from  australia,  we have the  examination  by ryan  o’neill   and  from the u.s., playhouse  by bonnie  jo campbell. two super stories.

the quiz this issue is harry  potter: marauder’s edition. answer  correctly and you’re in the running to win a 30-euro (or  equivalent) gift certificate from amazon. for  answers to last issue’s quiz, immigration  literature click  here. 
our book  review this issue is guide  me home by attica  locke, the third cracking crime  novel in the highway  59 series.
