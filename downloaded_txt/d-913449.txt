did you know? not all sba programs are the same.
 
compare the 504 loan to the 7(a) loan to see the advantages of the 504. 


 








the u.s. small business administration (sba) 504 loan program is a unique financing option that can be used to finance fixed assets such as commercial real estate or equipment. low, fixed interest rates are available for up to 25 years with down payments as low as ten percent.
 
the 504 loan works in conjunction with your local bank, resulting in a financing structure typical to a conventional loan, but with:
 

lower, fixed interest rates
ten percent down payment
up to a 25 year term and amortization

 
wbd makes it easy for our borrowers by handling all interaction and paperwork with the sba. contact wbd or ask your lender about the sba 504 program, because good business is knowing all of your options.
