            welcome to tony's trading site updated 
            17 february 2025
 
            tony's trading started out in 2001 as a hobby site dedicated to my 
            collections and for conducting swaps. 
            the site has expanded over time into a reference site for annuals, 
            
            tv and tv sci fi books, disney books, comic strip books, uk and ireland 
            map postcards and other collectables. 
sorry, i do not provide valuations. 
definition 
            of "trading" : exchanging or swapping - this is not a commercial 
            site.
