improving lives through time-tested programs and services















homelessness is a complicated issue. there is no one-size-fits-all solution that works for everyone. that's why we begin by assessing a client's needs, then develop a comprehensive plan to address the root causes of that person's homelessness.our housing programs go beyond emergency shelter by providing housing along with comprehensive wraparound services, which include case management, orientation, medical and mental treatment, coordination of services, advocacy, referrals, and other related services.
