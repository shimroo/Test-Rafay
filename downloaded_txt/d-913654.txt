welcome to the port royal yacht club
more than a club—it’s a lifestyle!
at pryc, we believe in good times, great people, and unforgettable experiences. from lively social gatherings to exciting on-the-water adventures, there’s always something happening. we’re a friendly, casual, and fun-loving group where every member is part of the crew.









our purpose & the corinthian spirit
our mission: we are dedicated to promoting yachting traditions, responsible seamanship, and camaraderie, all while fostering a welcoming environment for both new and experienced boaters.
the corinthian spirit: more than just a tradition, it’s a way of life! rooted in sportsmanship, integrity, and respect, the corinthian spirit reminds us that sailing—and life—is about fairness, honor, and enjoying the journey. whether on the racecourse or at the clubhouse, we embrace a code of ethics that makes pryc a special place to be.
join the fun!
from regattas and raft-ups to dockside parties and themed events, pryc is where adventure meets community. so, grab your captain’s hat, raise a glass, and set sail with us!
⚓ fair winds & following seas—see you on the water! ⚓
