who we are
born from the efforts of a teenager over 50 years ago, treepeople inspires and supports the people of southern california to come together to plant and care for trees, harvest the rain, and renew depleted landscapes. through our unique model, we listen to, equip, and train volunteers to green our urban spaces and mountains. treepeople has activated millions of people in planting and caring for millions of trees.
we work with both educators and students to train the next generation of eco-conscious leaders. we steward thousands of acres of land—maintaining habitats and protecting land from development. we develop original, actionable research that drives science-based policy. we train volunteers on the ground to help build a greener southern california.

what we do




forestry

we restore ecosystems, plant trees, and incorporate nature-based solutions throughout our southern california streets, mountains, and everywhere in between.




school greening

we create green learning environments that enhance academic achievement, support health and well-being, and create safe places to play in nature. through partnerships with school communities and districts, we advocate for, implement, and manage school greening projects to protect students from extreme heat, air pollution, and polluted water.




education & youth

we provide students, teachers, and the school community with the knowledge, tools, and support they need to create environmental change.




coldwater canyon park

treepeople’s 45-acre headquarters on mulholland drive in the santa monica mountains offers nature trails, experiential education, and cultural programming and is home to treepeople’s native plant nursery.




treepeople land trust

we steward more than 3,000 acres of land in the santa monica mountains–protecting these spaces for the benefit of future generations. programs include public recreation, environmental education, scientific research, and more.




policy & research

we conduct cutting-edge research and facilitate policies that support nature-based solutions.

wildfire resilience fund

wildfires are a natural part of california’s landscape, but their increasing intensity threatens our forests, communities, and green spaces. at treepeople, we are dedicated to fire resilience, working to restore fire-scarred lands, prevent future devastation, and protect the biodiversity of southern california. yet, we can’t do it alone—we need your help.
donate today to treepeople’s wildfire resilience fund and be a part of the solution.




monthly giving

canopy funds will directly benefit our initiatives in urban and school greening for underserved communities, support our wildfire restoration initiatives, and allow us to provide environmental education to thousands of students each year.

how to avoid starting a wildfire during a wind event
january 22, 2025
wind and fire have always been part of california’s ecosystem, and many of our native plants are well-adapted to withstanding or recovering from blazes. but as our region has grown denser and more urbanized, major, fast-moving fires have become more common and more dangerous—in large part due to human activity.  humans are responsible for about…
