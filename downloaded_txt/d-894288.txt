																transapical tmvr: a promising alternative for failed m-teer procedures
															
study findings published in feb 10 edition of jacc: cardiovascular interventions detail the effectiveness of transapical transcatheter mitral valve replacement (tmvr) following failed transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (m-teer).  







																performance ii trial notes low stroke risk demonstrated by neuroguard iep 3-in-1 carotid stent
															
conclusions drawn from a recent study have pointed to the potential of a novel carotid stent system that could benefit patients at high risk of complications from carotid endarterectomy (cea). 







																optimizing coronary stent expansion: review suggests new algorithm for pci success
															
coronary stent underexpansion (su) remains a major challenge in percutaneous coronary intervention (pci), increasing restenosis and thrombosis risks, according to a new review that proposes an intravascular imaging (ivi)-guided algorithm to systematically optimize stent expansion and improve patient outcomes.







																tr stage may influence 1-year t-teer survival outcomes: registry analysis
															
tricuspid regurgitation (tr) disease stage may influence survival outcomes following tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (t-teer), according to a new analysis of 1-year follow-up data that suggests individuals with intermediate tr may receive the most substantial treatment benefits. 







																fewer recurrent strokes, deaths with salt substitutes vs regular salt: ssass study
															
in patients with a history of stroke, salt substitution is safe, and the risks of death and recurring stroke are reduced, a new cluster trial shows. 







																king and i | s5 e9 | management of stable angina with peculiar coronary anatomy findings

																poor social determinants of health linked to poorer cv health in sexual minorities: national health interview survey study
															
among individuals in sexual minority (sm) groups in the us, those with unfavorable social determinants of health (sdoh) profiles have worse cardiovascular health (cvh) scores and are at higher risk for cardiovascular mortality compared with heterosexual individuals, a new study shows. 







																lower all-cause mortality in mechanical vs bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement: real-world analysis
															
mechanical surgical aortic valve replacement (avr) is independently associated with significant survival benefits compared with bioprosthetic avr in patients aged 60 years and younger, a real-world analysis shows. 







																the importance of equity in the development of health care ai models: viewpoint
															
a viewpoint paper explains that equitable performance is the responsibility of health care-providing institutions when integrating artificial intelligence (ai) in clinical practice, as well as continuously developing ai applications to address long-standing inequities. 







																out-of-pocket costs burden hf management, cause financial strain: state-of-the-art review
															
high out-of-pocket (oop) costs for heart failure (hf) management continue to create confusion, financial burdens, financial strain and financial toxicity for patients with chronic diseases in the u.s., leading to poor medication adherence and negative health outcomes, authors share in a state-of-the-art review.
