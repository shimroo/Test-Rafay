nrm is . . .


a community of students, educators, and researchers learning to face challenges and
                                    make wise choices about our environment. natural resources like clean water, fish,
                                    wildlife, and recreational opportunities are always in demand. we make management
                                    decisions about these resources by applying ecological principles and knowledge. our
                                    goal is to balance the current needs of people with sustainability or future availability
                                    of resources. we offer degree programs at the bs, ms, and phd levels which prepare students for professional careers in natural resources management.
the department of natural resources management at texas tech university wants everyone
                                    to know that we are proud to support our students, faculty and staff with their diverse
                                    backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. at texas tech, we are "committed to the
                                    inherent dignity of all individuals and the celebration of diversity. we foster an
                                    environment of mutual respect, appreciation, and tolerance for differing values, beliefs,
                                    and backgrounds" (ttu 2010-2020 strategic plan). we remain committed, now and in the
                                    future, to supporting all members of our community and standing against intolerant
                                    behavior, and we urge our students, faculty and staff and all others associated with
                                    our department to do so as well.
