wow! what an amazing team you have!!! nate and d were amazing - hardworking, pleasant, friendly, courteous, fun, focused, etc. i was so impressed when i heard they had both been with you for many years. they spoke highly of the company taking care of them as employees. clearly, you are doing the right things for your staff and they are terrific!!!
i spent 30 years as an executive at a corporation and in human resources. it is hard to find great people and keep them. then to have staff that have great work ethics and customer service skills - sooooooo hard to find these days.marythey arrived a little earlier than expected, but it worked out very well for us. they placed down heavy ``throws`` to protect carpeting and floors. i was impressed with the handling of furniture, wrapping of a good couch, etc. very polite, and they were there ready for any questions we had. i would highly recommend your team of professionals for any moving job!nancythe guys did a great job; they were very careful with all of our things and so polite! it was a terrific experience and we are happy to pass along the good word!matt and tracythe overall experience of dealing with your company was excellent! from the check sheet to the quotation to the communication and finally to the service itself.harald and christineplease consider this the highest of recommendations for your company! i would recommend you to anyone with confidence. again, thank you for a job well done.thomas
