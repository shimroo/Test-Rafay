!!! over 200 five stars for one dude !!!
3 decades exp – thousands of dogs trained 
 
what makes most sense? constantly bribing your dog with:
 
 * cheese * hot dogs * chicken*
* sausage * beef jerky?  *
 
or, be smart, natural and practical and try:
 
 * praise * leadership *
* technique * psychology?? *
 
sadly, 98% of trainers don’t know sh!t about f**k

 









zeddicus fixes allll these:


* barking 
* biting or nipping  
* jumping up on you or others
* charging at dogs or people
* pissing & pooping everywhere
* counter surfing, begging, 
* being unpredictable   

 














how about more
challenging stuff: 
 
* attacking your guests 
* going after dogs while walking 
* ignoring you off leash  
* guarding, lunging, snapping
* bit you or family member
* being overprotective by (acting bad@ss)

 



 






 barking, biting, growling, snapping, nipping, guarding, charging, bolting, fighting, chasing, potty training… if it rhymes with ing… hire: zeddicus king

 













 



five solid reasons what makes our dog expert stand out:
 
1. zeddicus has 31 yrs pf experience and has worked w well over 15,000 dogs nationwide. he is also the author of the international bestseller: dogs decoded – dog psychology from the future.
 
2. did you know that pet store dog trainers and majority of group classes’ trainers do this part time? yep. for fun. as a hobby. noticed people don’t take hobbyists seriously? lol 
 
zedd king does this as a professional!!! rookie vs. pro?!?! sorry. like anything in life–dedication–and experience matter!!!
 
3. most shy away from challenging cases. even dog behaviorists or the very best dog trainers in pasadena or anywhere else are clueless when it comes to delivering results with:
 

housebreaking
overprotectiveness
being reliable off-leash

 
not our dog prodigy!!! puppy to protective dogs. doesn’t matter to zeddicus!
 
4. he never treats people like dogs. face it. as nice as dogs are, they are still very broke and can’t refer you to nobody. haha
 
5. your dog will not get (over-trained) by him. this means your baby will still have his/her spirit or personality. no broken dog with a sad story. guaranteed. click here to read zedd’s bio
 
american vs. european dogs: 
 
have you ever been to europe? zeddicus has! you literally see nice and obedient dogs. every. where. you. go. whether be france, germany, italy, austria or belgium. well, this can’t be a coincidence. dogs are dogs whether you are in los angeles or paris. but-
 
it is how you train, not how much that makes all the difference!!!
 
time to master the most jealously guarded-
 
!!! dog training secrets !!!

 



sweet or psycho zeddicus trains them all. 
any age – any breed – any challenge

 

 



group classes never work on stubborn dogs: 
90% of our clients were disappointed by group training classes. you show up with your yummy treats. end results? a half a** trained dog. listen. dog trainers of sacramento who teach these classes may mean well, but can’t possibly control the dogs that constantly bark, whine, drag their owners, and some even attack other dogs. if you want quality one-on-one that teaches all about dog training without constant distractions–it’s tough to get it from puppy classes. not to worry. zeddicus will come to you! click here for home dog training.

 











 



doggie boot camp + house calls 
don’t just kennel your dog or hire some pet sitter. let the dog prodigy do his magic at his dog boarding and training, and have you and your family take alllll the credit. even better, we are partnered w camp-run-a-mutt. making our dog board and train a smooth and fun process for your doggy. our dog boot camp is perfect choice if you are frustrated, have a hectic schedule, leaving town, staying home mom with rowdy kids, in process of moving, remodeling or admit, you-just-can’t-do-it-with-this-dog. training dogs properly, isn’t easy. if it were, don’t you think you’d see best trained dogs all over sacramento area? click here for doggie boot camp in sacramento “rocklin”

  





!!! woof !!!


the only dog boot camp with lifetime guarantee 

all other doggie boot camps in sacramento never ever offer free follow ups. meaning, if your dog stops listening to you and your family members, they ask you to drop it off again at their facility. it’s a dog, not a computer, an iphone, or a car. zeddicus ensures your dog responding to you and anyone else in your household. 😉
