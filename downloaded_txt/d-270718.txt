the jewish
professionals institute (j.p.i.) was established in the 1980s to provide
mature, sophisticated jewish adults engaged in modern professions the opportunity to get
acquainted with their heritage.
so many jews have succeeded as lawyers, doctors, accountants, m.b.a.'s, ph.d.'s, and other areas
of academic life, but have
not had the opportunity to study hebrew and judaism on an equally mature level.
j.p.i. is an organization dedicated to adult jewish education and has on staff dedicated jewish educators
who are able to communicate the meaning and value of judaism to the modern jewish
professional.
through free lunch hour
classes, public
lectures, workshops, tutorials, and entering into the homes and communities of
professional jewish adults, j.p.i. provides the missing link: a mature and professional
presentation of judaism and jewish life.
operating primarily in the new
york metropolitan area, and using its own website on the internet as a
focal point, j.p.i. provides a variety of crucial functions:
