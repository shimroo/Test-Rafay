see something you like but not sure it's the club for you? we offer the ability to purchase any club today, and then try it in real-world conditions for up to 90 days. if you don't like it for any reason, we'll buy it back from you for a preset store credit value, sent as an e-gift card. this is not a cash refund. the e-gift card may go toward the purchase of any other product sold by callaway pre-owned. e-gift cards can be redeemed on the callawaygolfpreowned.com website, or call 800-826-6174 to speak directly to one of our sales representatives. e-gift cards are not redeemable through callaway golf retail accounts or through callawaygolf.com, odysseygolf.com, or callawaygolfgiftcard.com, nor can a callaway golf gift card be used on callawaygolfpreowned.com website. please note that accessories do not qualify for the buy-back guarantee. once an accessory has been used, it cannot be returned.
the amount we will pay under the buy-back guarantee is based on the length of time you have played the club: 90% back up to 30 days, 80% from 31-60 days, and 70% from 61-90 days.
