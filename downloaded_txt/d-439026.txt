alert! beware of phishing scams. criminals contact hundreds and even thousands of people by phone claiming they represent your credit union and ask for account or debit card numbers claiming that something may be wrong with your account. we want to remind everyone that we will not initiate a call and ask for full account or card numbers. our team will only ask for enough information to verify your identity over the phone. never full account numbers, expiration dates, passwords, or cvv codes. if you are ever in doubt, please hang-up and contact the credit union directly. thank you.
