why residents love horizon house











"the apartment itself, the view, of course the windows. i love the kitchen. the fact is, there are beautiful apartments all over seattle, with everything that we have here. but what they don’t have is horizon house. it’s just a wonderful place to live! what's most important is the community, and that's what i love."
judy cline





"my favorite part of the horizon house community is that it is a community! it’s so different from other places. the people really like to do things together, like to chat with each other, and there’s a wonderful spirit. things happen here that i don’t think happen other places because people get together and make them happen. so, it’s fabulous."
cami elbow





"i love the bay windows, you see the view throughout. when you come in the door, you take about three steps and, wow! the city lights at night are spanning and the colors in the daytime, so i love everything about my apartment. couldn’t be happier!”
joyce greenwood





"horizon house is a village—it’s a community. there's just so much happening. we’re both very impressed with the variety of programs and issues that are discussed. it’s kind of like being on a university campus."
