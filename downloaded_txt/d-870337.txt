visualgpsview (freeware) incorporates many advanced features that show the status of the gps receiver via the nmea 0183 protocol. its sole purpose is to display graphically specific nmea 0183 sentences for gps and position analysis.

features:





nmea/glonass - supports gps nmea and glonass nmea
azimuth and elevation plot - view all satellites that are in view. each satellite identifies its pseudo random number (prn) and its azimuth and elevation.
scatter plot - the scatter plot shows individual position samples referenced to several type of reference types, next sample, average or user defined.
signal quality/snr window - monitor satellite signal to noise ratios and see them graphically on the screen. the signal quality window will grow or shrink to accommodate number of satellites in view
position plot - monitor latitude, longitude and altitude averages. 
nmea command monitor - view nmea sentences as they are received 
nmea recording and playback - record nmea directly to a file or read nmea from a file. nmea files consists of standard nmea sentences in text ascii characters.






requirements:

gps receiver connected to a rs-232 port or usb with nmea 0183 output
windows 7 to window 10

                                    visualgps decodes the following nmea 0183 sentences:
                                    
gpgga and glgga
gpgsa and glgsa
gpgsv and glgsv

nmeatime2 is pc time synchronization software that synchronizes the pc clock to the time from a gps receiver.
nmeatime2 is set up as a system service where the pc clock is disciplined to the nmea string from the gps. the control loop uses the same techniques in disciplining ocxo oscillators and atomic rubidium clocks. by charactering the arrival of nmea messages, nmeatime2 uses advanced digital filters to minimize communication jitter and achieve the best reference to train the pc clock to.
because of this, there are some requirements that need to be met. specifically, the rate output of nmea message gpgga and gprmc.
itâs getting more difficult to find a pc with a native rs-232 serial communication port, most gps receivers that interface to a pc use a usb. the majority of the usb gps receivers will look to the pc as if it is a serial port. however, the modern usb gps looks to the pc as a usb to serial driver that emulates the serial port. in the usb world, itâs referred as a cdc (communication device class) device.
nmeatime2 will use the nmea string (gpgga) transmitted from the gps, time tag the first character of the that command and use this as a timing reference. as you would expect, there are delays between the 1pps epoch and the rs-232 causing software jitter. the delay can be calibrated out. nmeatime2 will use digital filtering (the red line you see in the time difference plot - see below) and discipline the pc clock to this reference.

requirements

supports windows 7, 8, 8.1 and windows 10

the minimum nmea sentence requirements matter. the most important is that the gpgga and gprmc message output once per second.

gpgga - must be once/second
gprmc - must be once/second
gpzda - must be once/second (nmeatime will use this sentence for time. if not available, then nmeatime will use gga & rmc for time.)
gpgsa - every two seconds
gpgsv - every two seconds

currently visualgps is over 10 years old! nmea support is only limited to gps nmea strings (not glonass or galileo). we recommend that you download visualgpsview.
visualgps (freeware) incorporates many advanced features found in professional programs.  its sole purpose is to display graphically specific nmea 0183 sentences and show the effects of selective availability (sa).
features:




azimuth and elevation graph - view all satellites that are in view. each satellite identifies its pseudo random number (prn) and its azimuth and elevation. also plot and print  the physical mask angle.
survey - the survey window displays both position and xdop (hdop and vdop) parameters. the ability for user selectable hdop/vdop color thresholds for position averaging make a great utility. also monitor standard deviation and effects of selective availability. that's not all - print the results graphically.
signal quality/snr window - monitor satellite signal to noise ratios and see them graphically on the screen. the signal quality window will grow or shrink to accommodate number of satellites in view
navigation - monitor latitude, longitude and altitude
nmea command monitor - view nmea sentences as they are received
