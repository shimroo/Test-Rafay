         canon law  in general         invenerunt           illum in templo sedentem in médio doctorum,           audientem illos et interrogantem eos; stupebant           autem omnes, qui eum audiebant, super prudéntia           et   responsis eius.    canon law, the oldest           continuously functioning legal system in the           western world,               is the            internal legal system           of the catholic church:

       internal: canon law lies       wholly within           the church's authority to compose and administer,       this, in contrast to the wide           variety of external (usually civil) laws to           which the church generally defers in the pursuit of her           divine mission; 

         legal: canon law           operates according to the principles of law           chiefly as set out in aristotelian-thomistic           legal philosophy, this, in contrast to suggestions           that canon law is simply applied theology, morals, or        the rules of           religious cult; 

       system: canon           law must be read as a whole for proper           understanding and use, this, in contrast to           suggestions that canon law is a collection of           principles or aphorisms that are capable of being rightly           appreciated in isolation from each other.            

   canon law affects virtually every       aspect of the faith life of over one billion catholic christians       around the world. but, as pope st. john paul ii explained when he       promulgated the code in 1983, canon law "is in no way intended       as a substitute for faith, grace, charisms, and especially       charity in the life of the church and of the faithful. on the       contrary, its purpose is rather to create such an order in the       ecclesial society that, while assigning the primacy to love, grace,       and charisms, it at the same time renders their organic       development easier in the life of both the ecclesial society and       the individual persons who belong to it." john paul ii, ap. con.            sacrae disciplinae leges (1983) 16.       

           codified   canon law      modern catholic canon law is "codified", that       is, it is contained within (presently) two "codes", one for the       roman church (1983) and one for all the eastern churches (1990). the       codification of canon law (as opposed to the use of canon       law itself) is a recent development in church law.

   the pio-benedictine code of 1917, the first       integrated code of canon law in the catholic church, was       promulgated by pope benedict xv in 1917 and took force in 1918.       it replaced the quinque       libri decretalium (1234) of pope gregory ix that had       governed the roman church for several centuries. the 1917 code       was abrogated by the johanno-pauline code of 1983.
