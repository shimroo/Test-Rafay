    all bodysense hot/cold aromatherapy products are constucted by hand using only the finest materials and fabrics right here in the united states.
each product contains a special rice chosen for its unique moisture content and weight, and time-tested combinations of aromatic herbs and spices
	selected for their unique healing properties. packs can be heated in a microwave for penetrating, long-lasting heat, or chilled in the freezer for cooling pain relief.

the wide array of products that we have developed over the past 20 years have been specially crafted to provide natural therapeutic pain relief and
	gentle acupressure to all parts of the body, from the neck and back, to elbows, knees, hands and feet. we even have a special line of cuddly "toys" designed to
	address the specific needs of children. all comfort packs can be used over and over again. "unscented" versions can be purchased upon special request.
