cpc's impact

for more than five decades, cutting edge methodological and empirical approaches have defined our work, helping us better measure, understand,
        and predict population change and its impact. we study populations and the processes that affect them from many different angles, whether the
        focus is on adolescents in the us, mothers in the philippines, or the elderly in africa. and we provide access to our data, collection protocols,
        and methods, which have influenced scholarship and practice across the globe. learn more about some of 
        the projects housed at our center. 
        
      











 






our affiliates have published over 10,000 articles in peer-reviewed journals since 2000, covering pressing research 
            questions about population dynamics, fertility, health, mortality, migration, and the environment.
