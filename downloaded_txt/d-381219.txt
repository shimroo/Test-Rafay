 will a low carbon sustainable website cost me more?



no!well, not with us, and comparably speaking there isn’t any reason why it should.all our client’s websites are built in a similar way to a typical website, it’s just that we use our design philosophy to minimise carbon footprints. 



 will my eco-friendly website be hampered by it's green credentials?




absolutely not.in fact, we had a client join us and by doing just one thing we increase website performance by 57.7%, & their carbon footprint was reduced by 95%.

we see this repeatedly when we take on new clients, who then often return to us to redevelop their sites for even greater ecological benefits.



 what is your support like?



outstanding – even if we do say so ourselves.our longest standing client, who has been with us for over 13 years, frequently messages us with additions or questions during out of office hours.there is nearly always an immediate reply, if not action to address their query.with all new websites purchased there is six months of support included. we also offer our wordpress care plans is you want real peace of mind, and we also supply support on a payg basis.    



 what is the cost of a single page website?



our single page websites comes under our one plan – ideal from start ups or a small business website.everything you need is included in the package:1 year of hosting1 year of support1 page website1 domain1 email accountbasic seoterms apply



 how can i design my own website?



you can design your own website, but why would you want to if you want to achieve results?there’s a lot more to it than making a pretty looking website, then there’s the hidden costs from the likes of wix & shopify.we use previous user data, well-established design principles, psychology, and other things to create a user journey.unless you have experience in web design, then it’s going to be hard to implement all those factors yourself.we’ll build you a high performing website, whilst you do what you do best – run your business.



 how much does it cost to design a website?



we believe in being transparent about costs, but still believe in exceeding expectations. our one plan costs £85 per month, and is a subscription based model.however, a more bespoke multi page website is a little more costly due to time constraints and technical requirements. starting prices are £1500 for a website; hosting, domain, email, content & images are all extra costs.
