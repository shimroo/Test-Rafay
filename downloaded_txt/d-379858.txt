the pit bull project is dedicated to the education and preservation of the ‘pit bull’ breeds. through this website, i hope to share some of my findings and research, combining some of the most useful and reliable information on and off the net, into one website. through this website, i aim to raise awareness about responsible bully-breed ownership, as well as to provide bully-breed owners and the general public with excellent resources, whether they deal with breed specific legislation or breeding.
the pit bull project is not a rescue group. as the creator of the website, i work with rescue groups in helping to spread the word about adoptable bullies and responsible ownership.
the pit bull project does not support dog fighting, animal cruelty or irresponsible breeding.
for clarification purposes, the use of the term “pit bull” includes the american pit bull terrier, the american staffordshire terrier, the staffordshire bull terrier, and any mix of the previously mentioned breeds.
photographs of pit bulls throughout the website have been kindly donated by the wonderful people who have rescued them. these dogs are not meant to represent defined ukc/akc breed standards of the american pit bull terrier, the american staffordshire terrier, or the staffordshire bull terrier – they are simply wonderful photographs of family pit bulls at their best.
thank you for taking the time to visit the pit bull project.
