eric brown vm21
“at stvm, my friends are my family. stvm is known for its family atmosphere, and that is something you see in and out of the classroom. we include everyone, regardless of our differences, and we support each other through everything. i know i’ll stay a part of stvm long after graduation.”





destinee maringa vm24
"i chose stvm because of the environment. everyone at stvm has been welcoming to me and has made me feel like i was a part of a family. the house system has helped to give me a better connection with my fellow students, regardless of what grade they are in."





johnny faetanini vm20
“i’m appreciative of the many opportunities at stvm to express my catholicity. my theology teachers taught me so much about my faith in a way that i can share with others. our all-school masses, marianist life retreats, and service projects allow all students to come together as a community and grow in our faith.”





ilana boykin vm23
"the thing i love most about stvm is definitely the people! having attended a public school from k-8, i was very nervous to start somewhere new. from my very first visit, i was treated with so much kindness. i have met so many people from many different places and everyone has made me feel so welcome and made my transition so much easier."





kofi powers vm24
"while i was looking for a high school to attend, none of them felt like home until i shadowed at stvm. i love being a part of a new family and making long lasting memories."





mia khayyat vm22
"what i love most about stvm is that we are one big family. there is not one second during the school day or during an extracurricular event where i feel alone. stvm has given me so many wonderful friendships, opportunities and memories for a lifetime."





aidan callahan vm23
"i love the deep rooted family tradition and relationships i get to build with my friends everyday. as an irish legacy student, i love that i can gain friendships and build bonds with many different people. i love that we can support everyone for who they truly are."
