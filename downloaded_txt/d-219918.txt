welcome to the website of innate – an irish network for nonviolent action training and education. innate was established as a result of the need for an umbrella group to support groups and individuals exploring nonviolent approaches to conflict and social change issues.
about this site
this site publishes a large number of nonviolence and peace resources including monthly editions of nonviolent news which can be accessed from this home page. your news is welcome; the deadline for nonviolent news is either the very end of the month or a day or two into the month of issue.  ten full issues come out a year plus two shorter news supplements (january and august) – so there is news comes out every month.
use the much more… dropdown menu above to view other useful material including free downloadable/printable posters, pamphlets, workshop ideas and other nonviolence resources. you can also view recent back issues of nonviolent news, editorials and articles from our regular contributors billy king, and larry speight on green issues.
older issues of nonviolent news are available in our archive. to get at nonviolent news content such as editorials, eco-awareness with larry speight, readings in nonviolence and the billy king column before 2021 you need to open the archive website – click on the link (‘archive’ in red) in this paragraph or the tab on the right on this home page.
photo and documentation site

innate has a separate flickr website for photos and documentation, to which we are gradually adding innate and other peace movement and political/social change pictures and material (additional photos welcome, please contact us). click on the red ‘flickr’ link above or the title below to get to the photo site – or on the photo to get straight to that entry and the details about it.







irish peace trails
a number of different organisations, including innate, have been cooperating together in developing peace trails for around the island of ireland – although this work has been set back by covid. this section will provide information on where things stand. as well as currently working on belfast, derry and dublin, ideas for inclusion are welcome from anywhere in ireland, the republic or northern ireland. please see the concept paper for further details and contacts
listing of innate resources
a listing of online resources on both this, the main innate website, and the innate photo and documentation site (on flickr) is available here     innate online listing 2023 for web    also included is a very brief listing of archival material passed to the public record office for northern ireland (proni).

background to innate
the organisation acts as a network linking those committed to, or interested in, explicitly nonviolent action and training. [you can read about the concept of ‘nonviolence’ in this introduction.] some of innate’s work is intertwined with community relations and the development of a nonviolent response to areas of community tension in northern ireland. but innate covers the whole island of ireland and has an international peace commitment.

in the context of ‘peace’ work, innate insists that a radical concept of nonviolence and nonviolent action, learning from both irish and international experience, offers much in addressing the conflict in northern ireland, and dealing with other issues of conflict and social and political change.

get involved
there are many ways you can be involved and innate tries to ensure people are not burdened beyond what they wish to do. innate organises various projects, seminars, and public events or demonstrations. as currently most innate meetings take place remotely, anyone anywhere can be involved in these. contact us if you would like to explore possibilities…….. email innate@ntlworld.com or see other contacts in the top menu bar.
make a donation
innate relies on subscriptions and donations to pay for costs. innate is an entirely voluntary organisation – no one is paid for the work they do for it – but there are still substantial costs even running things on a shoestring. if you would like to make a subscription or donation (perhaps as a happy user of our website!) you can do so safely by credit/debit card using paypal below. you can also pay by british or irish cheque in the post – in which case please see contacts.
