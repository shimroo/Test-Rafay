find out where to buy high quality marijuana seeds


where can you buy marijuana seeds and cannabis seeds online?
today there are hundreds or thousands of different variations of marijuana seeds available online. you have strains that are specialised for medical purposes (it helps them reduce pain) but basically you can divide them into two types of strains. indica & sativa!
the difference between the two is mostly that indica has a short flowering (55 days and shorter) time and is grown indoors and sativa strains are typical outdoor strains with a long flowering time, around 90 days and longer. (a tip to remind you to know the difference? indica = indoor — starts both with in..)
the indoor marijuana strains have a much higher thc level then the sativa strains in general. sativa plants are mellow, layback and gives you a clean high. indoor or indica strains are much heavier on the brain and preferred mostly by medical patients and the younger crowd.
