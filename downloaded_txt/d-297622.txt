the wall street journal describes south korean pianist seong-jin cho as poised to take his place among the greats of the past “not only for his bulletproof technique, but also for his artistic voice [and] his sense of drama.” cho joins the la phil for ravel’s concerto in g, one of the pianist’s favorite works, which he describes as a continuous dialog between piano and orchestra.
grammy award-winning conductor paavo järvi leads the la phil first in bacewicz’ concerto for string orchestra, which combines approachable classical melodies with more modern harmonic ideas. järvi closes the program with brahms’ piano quartet arranged for orchestra. schoenberg adored brahms’ original but felt it was rarely performed well as chamber music, leading him to transform the piece into an orchestral version—given its world premiere by the la phil—that brings out brahms’ shifting variations and colors.show less

the wine is flowing a little too freely, and two young men enter into a risky (and risqué) bet: each will try to seduce the other’s fiancée. hijinks ensue, with dashing disguises, outrageous flirting, and, of course, wedding bells—but we won't say who ends up together! 
mozart’s razor-sharp comedy is back in a delightful production by director michael cavanagh. a stylish set by erhard rom updates the action to a swanky american country club, bursting with kitsch and color. james conlon conducts a fantastic ensemble cast, led by longtime la opera favorites ana maría martínez and rod gilfry as the schemers behind the deception. featuring an endless parade of exquisite ensembles, mozart’s deliciously scandalous opera is a can’t-miss for newcomers and seasoned fans alike.show less

the critically acclaimed batsheva dance company presents a shared passion of deep sorrow and beauty in its newest evening length work momo, from master choreographer ohad naharin. in the company’s words, “momo has two souls. one sends long roots to the depths of the earth—a soul that embodies archetypes and myths of hardened, raw masculinity, and the other is in a constant search for an individual and distinct dna; one moves within its own autonomous and independent force field, and the other is a constellation of elements that spin around the same nucleus—alternately drifting away and towards it, making room for necessary tenderness and catharsis.” the company performs this new work to a soundtrack from the iconic laurie anderson and kronos quartet’s work landfall, with additional music by philip glass, arca, and maxim waratt. established in 1964 as a repertoire company, batsheva dance company is one of the world’s most prominent and renowned dance troupes. the company stands at the forefront of the international dance world, thanks to the bold choreographic voice of naharin and the uncompromising quality of the company’s dancers.show less

mahler has been a specialty and obsession throughout gustavo dudamel’s career, and in the opening weekend of the mahler grooves festival, dudamel curates and conducts a selection of the composer’s music in mahler’s journey. he opens with two excerpts from mahler’s first and tenth symphonies that frame the composer’s life. blumine was the second movement from symphony no. 1, which was removed after a few performances but rediscovered in the 1960s and appreciated for its rapturous trumpet and melancholy oboe. the adagio from symphony no. 10 similarly found a new life and was published after mahler’s death. the unfinished sketches were written during personal crisis and brim with anguish and pain that is expressed through harmonic language that straddles the romantic era and the 20th century. 
des knaben wunderhorn (the boy’s magic horn) is based on a collection of german poetry of the same name that was influential to mahler and other romantics. two dozen of the poems are set to music that with the help of baritone simon keenlyside explores stories of love, loss, and the supernatural.

a bold world premiere comedy from los angeles-based playwright, larissa fasthorse, about being whoever you want to be, even when it’s not who you are. fasthorse is a critically acclaimed writer who focuses her keen sense of satire to examine native american perspectives on contemporary life and will be the first native american writer to have a mainstage production on the mark taper forum stage. a member of the sicangu lakota nation, and author of the broadway comedy, the thanksgiving play, fasthorse’s new work shines a hilarious light on ‘shifters’ who exist in a world of self-determined identity. this thought-provoking comic play asks what happens when you don’t believe you are the race you want to be? change it! fake it until you make it takes an absurd look at what defines who we are, and the lengths some people will go through to change it.show less
