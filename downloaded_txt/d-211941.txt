all is piano midiin the interest of answering the unasked question, "what if every sound was made from piano midis?", we present our own: 
singing piano's national anthem, the
talking piano's pledge of allegiance, 
real bird songs, and the video that got us here:




here's how you too can create a midi out of anything:


1) get audio file. (or you tube video)
2) head to ofoct's midi site to convert audio to a piano midi.
3) convert piano midi to a tab. 
4) enjoy your "song"?







newsamazing hands and feet on china's got talentfoot playing pianist liu wei lost both of his arms in an electrocution accident but that didn't stop him from performing and winning china's got talent.

thanks to stephen colbert for bringing this to our attention:
the catacombo sound system is "a revolutionary customized sound system for audiophiles on the other side.
the catacoffin employs a pair of two way speakers, tweeters, and a divine 8 inch subwoofer, fine tuned to the coffin's unique interior acoustic space.
so, embrace.  embrace your passion for music, in this life and the next."
colbert: "yes.  speakers mounted inside a coffin.  also the rejected sales pitch for the first mazda miata."  not to be outdone, colbert then announced his own solution for those who prefer cremation, the iurn - "when you're ready to rock your ash off".
