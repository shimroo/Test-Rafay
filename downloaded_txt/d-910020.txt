we have experienced salesman with the knowledge to help you with what you are looking for.  they check stock and price (manually) and can suggest (if needed) items that you might need with your purchases. we call this the hamburger (tools/equipment/you need) and the french fries & onion rings (accessories, parts, consumables) that go with the hamburger.  like the whip hose & oilier assembly that goes with the air tool. so don't be surprised if we ask you "do you want french fries or onion rings with that hamburger.
