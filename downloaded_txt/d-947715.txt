landex development: a leader in community and residential real estate development


landex development is about building a community. from urban redevelopment to residential property management, we have a proven, award-winning track record for four decades. as a family-owned business, we understand that the success of a community extends beyond bricks and mortar; it is about improving the quality of living for residents and their neighbors.
landex specializes in the acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of market rate, mixed-income, and affordable multi-family housing communities in urban settings. over the years we have acquired, developed, transformed, and repositioned developments in public-private partnerships in maryland, florida, massachusetts, pennsylvania, missouri, north carolina, new jersey, utah, virginia, washington, and washington, d.c.
