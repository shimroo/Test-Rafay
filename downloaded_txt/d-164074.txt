joseph tee (mdiv ‘21)



pastoral intern, zion serangoon bible presbyterian church, singapore




“covenant challenged my head and my heart in profoundly biblical ways. every single class really challenged me in my christian walk. and not only in the classroom—what happens outside the classroom impacted me just as deeply. the kind, patient, caring gospel community was refreshing and life-changing for me. the whole experience brought deeper understanding of the beauty of the gospel and how to apply it graciously in my own local context in singapore. i am forever grateful for that.”

church planter, yakima, wa




"covenant’s whole approach impressed my wife and i. the focus wasn’t just on learning material about the bible, but on how to use what you learn to love and serve others well. we were also impressed by the humility of the faculty, their emphasis on being servant-leaders with a pastoral focus. people at covenant spoke lovingly into our lives, helped us assess our gifts and calling, and affirmed my desire to plant churches.”

rev. tim price (mdiv ‘21)



ruf campus minister, washington university




“covenant prepared me for ministry in ways i hadn’t expected. the faculty are really good at making theology real and showing how it matters in everyday life. that’s extremely valuable for ministering to others. many seminaries can produce good theologians, but i think none produces better pastors than covenant.”

thomas harsley (mdiv ‘21)



chaplain resident, saint louis university hospital




“i came to covenant because i was searching for answers to hard theological questions and wanted to grow in my understanding of scripture and the christian faith. god used covenant to show me more about who i am and about who he is. he made me more grateful for how he has uniquely gifted each person for specific purposes and callings in his kingdom—and made me more determined than ever to continue his mission of preaching the gospel of grace to every nation and making disciples of all people.”

director of small groups, park cities presbyterian church




“covenant is incredibly pastoral in its approach to seminary training and the spiritual formation of its students. i loved that i could immediately apply what i was learning in real-life ministry. covenant equips you holistically for a lifetime of fruitful ministry. it’s about knowing god better and seeing others come to know him better. i am a better wife, mom, friend, and employee as a result of my covenant seminary experience. it’s a privilege to be part of this place.”

"the most valuable thing i learned from covenant seminary was how to communicate the scriptures in a way that leads people to the joy of the gospel.... covenant’s emphasis on training pastors was invaluable in preparing me for this ministry. the things i learned there will bear fruit again and again throughout my life.”

rev. glenn hoburg (mdiv '97)



founding pastor, grace dc




“my wife and i can’t imagine our development as followers and servants of christ without covenant seminary. we were given more than the doctrines of grace; we were given models of it—a tone, an ‘incarnation’—proof of lived theology.”

rev. matt terrell (mdiv '11)



ruf campus minister, city campus nyc




"a pastoral mentor once told me: “what people need from you more than anything is not your giftedness, but your godliness.” covenant embodies that idea well. our time at covenant gave us invaluable ministry tools, faithful and godly mentors, rich theological education, and life-giving community. remove any of those things and we would not be able to do what god has called us to do today.”
