what advice would you give a first-time ayso coach?¬†make soccer fun for the kids and get them to enjoy it first, then teach them skills. the most important thing is to have fun on the soccer field; winning is not so important. if you teach the value of teamwork and you instill that early, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important.

julie foudy
world cup / olympics / hall of fame


when julie foudy won two world cups and two olympics medals, she wore the number 11 ‚Äì the same number that she wore when she started playing ayso at age 7 while living in mission viejo, ca.
¬†

hall of famer started her career in ayso
‚Äúi begged my mom to sign me up for soccer and joined a team called the strikers,‚Äù said foudy. ‚Äúwhen it came to pass out the shirts, i knew what i wanted. i was this feisty little 7-year-old who thought i was the best, so i should have the no. 1. they told me the goalie has to take that number, so i went with the double no. 1. that‚Äôs how i became no. 11 for the rest of my life. thanks to the strikers.‚Äù
foudy has many fond memories of her ayso experience that led to one of the most illustrious careers in women‚Äôs sports history. she believes that being allowed to enjoy the game and explore it on her own terms was the key to her success.‚Äùayso emphasizes all the positives of soccer: the enjoyment that kids get from the sport, understanding how to play on a team and be a good teammate, and developing skills in a fun environment. i watched my nieces and nephews go through ayso and i look forward to watching my own kids enjoy soccer through ayso!‚Äù
foudy retired in 2004 after captaining the u.s. women‚Äôs national team 13 of the 18 years she played on it. she played in three olympics and four world cups. and, only two players in the world, former teammates mia hamm and kristine lilly top foudy‚Äôs 271 u.s. national team appearances.
foudy‚Äôs u.s. national team soccer career is a storied one. she‚Äôs won two world cups (in 1991 and 1999), two gold medals (in 1996 and 2004) and a silver medal (in 2000). in her 271 appearances for the u.s. national team, foudy scored 45 goals. foudy played pro soccer with the san diego spirit of the now defunct wusa, where she captained all three years. foudy was inducted to the ayso hall of fame in 2006 and the national soccer hall of fame in 2007.
foudy‚Äôs had a profound impact off the field as well. she was the president of the women‚Äôs sports foundation from 2000-2002, served on the women‚Äôs sports foundation board of directors for seven years and was a wsf advocacy consultant for two years, with a focus on title ix, childhood obesity, and athletes‚Äô rights issues. foudy currently sits on the board of athletes for hope (afh), a 501(c)(3) charitable organization created by successful athletes who have a deep commitment to charitable and community causes. foudy is the global spokeswoman for global girl media, a new non-profit helping young women around the world find their voice through journalism. she is also an ambassador for beyond sport, a global organization that promotes, develops and funds the use of sport to create positive social change across the world. foudy has been instrumental in a number of women‚Äôs rights and child labor issues around the world. fifa, the international governing body of soccer, awarded her the fifa fair play award for her work against child labor in the stitching of soccer balls. she was the first woman and first american to receive the award.
she is currently an analyst for abc/espn and the nbc olympics, director of her julie foudy sports leadership academies, a motivational speaker, and proud mother of two children, isabel and declan.
questions & answers
age started playing soccer:¬†7
why she loves ayso:¬†ayso emphasizes all the positives of soccer: the enjoyment that kids get from the sport, understanding how to play on a team and be a good teammate, and developing skills in a fun environment. i watched my nieces and nephews go through ayso and i look forward to watching my own kids enjoy soccer through ayso!
favorite ayso memory:¬†my ayso coach gave us fun prizes for juggling, so i spent hours juggling and trying to reach those goals. we got something for 25 juggles, something else for 50, and on up. what that really taught me was the importance of time on the ball. when you love the ball, the skills and confidence follow.
what advice would you give a first-time ayso coach?¬†first of all, i‚Äôd tell them they‚Äôre not going to be an expert right away! they can read all the books in the world about the technical skills, but the most important thing is to create an environment where the kids feel comfortable and it‚Äôs fun to learn. you don‚Äôt have to turn them into an abby wambach or landon donovan‚Ä¶just let them have fun and love playing soccer!

landon donovan
ayso famous alumni


a native of¬†southern california, donovan was a member of the inaugural class of the¬†u.s. soccer youth residency program¬†in¬†bradenton, florida. he was named player of the tournament for his role in the¬†united states under-17¬†squad that finished fourth in the¬†1999 fifa u-17 world championship¬†before signing with german club¬†bayer leverkusen¬†later that year.

landon donovan, an ayso alum, started playing soccer at age 2 in ontario, calif., after his older brother, josh, introduced him to the sport.
‚Äújosh would take me out to the backyard and kick the ball around with me,‚Äù said donovan, who joined an ayso team at age 5 and kept playing ayso until age 14. ‚Äúthe beauty of ayso was that you had kids from all walks of life who just wanted to be active and run around and play soccer,‚Äù u.s. men‚Äôs leading goal scorer landon donovan said. ‚Äúi started playing club soccer at the age of 10 but i wanted to continue playing ayso because i enjoyed the camaraderie and the ability to just play for the love of the game.‚Äù
donovan turned pro at 16 years old, when he signed with german club bayer leverkusen. he‚Äôs come a long way in the past 12 years, becoming the most recognizable american soccer player. the 2010 player of the year currently plays for the u.s. national team and major league soccer‚Äôs (mls) los angeles galaxy.
a three-time world cup veteran, donovan is the all-time leader in both scoring and assisting goals for the national team; he also became the fourth-youngest player to reach 100 appearances for his country. he scored three goals in the 2010 world cup in south africa, including the goal in the 1-0 defeat of algeria, propelling the u.s. to the second round of the games. he scored two goals in the 2009 confederations cup, scoring against soccer power houses italy in the group round and brazil in the final. in his first world cup, donovan scored in the 2-0 quarterfinal win over mexico in 2002. donovan has also represented the u.s. at the 2000 sydney olympics, where the u.s. finished fourth.
donovan has scored 124 goals in his 12-year mls career. last season, donovan led the galaxy to an mls cup title, scoring 12 goals throughout the season. the team also won the supporters shield (given to the team with the best record in the regular season). in 2010, donovan helped the galaxy win the supporters shield and became the all-time leading goal scorer for the team. before the start of the 2010 mls season, donovan went to english premier league (epl) team, everton, for a short loan. during that time, donovan played in 13 games, scoring two goals and was named the january player of the month. in 2009, donovan won the mls‚Äô mvp and goal of the year award. he led the team to the mls cup finals, where the team lost in penalties to real salt lake. donovan has won three mls cup championships ‚Äì one with the galaxy (2005) and two with the san jose earthquakes (2001, 2003).
questions & answers
age started playing soccer:¬†2
favorite ayso memory:¬† i started playing ayso when i was 5. before that, my older brother, josh, would take me out to the backyard and kick the ball around with me. my favorite ayso memory is that i got to play on the same team as my best friend when i was 8 years old.
what he loved about ayso:¬† the beauty of ayso was that you had kids from all walks of life who just wanted to be active and run around and play soccer. i started playing club soccer at the age of 10 but i wanted to continue playing ayso because i enjoyed the camaraderie and the ability to just play for the love of playing. the games were still competitive but they never revolved around winning.
advice for the first-time coach:¬† one of my biggest pet peeves is youth team coaches who take winning too seriously. this has always bothered me, and i always tell coaches to forget about winning with young players. they need to create an environment where the kids enjoy playing and are developing their soccer skills. winning should never be a priority.

questions & answers
who was your greatest influence as a youth soccer player?
‚Äúprobably the ‚Äò99 world cup team because that was the first time i‚Äôd seen women on tv playing soccer and completely dominating the game.‚Äù
your dad was one of your first coaches. how did that influence you as a player?
‚Äúmy dad was one of my first coaches. he influenced me greatly because he didn‚Äôt know anything about the game of soccer, but he decided to take it upon himself to learn the game and go to coaching and referee classes. and i felt like because he took it upon himself to learn the game better, it was great to have him coaching me and go out with me for extra practice, extra training and extra shooting. i always had a coach next to me that wanted to help make me better. in that way, he influenced me and wanted‚Ä¶and in turn i wanted to make him proud.‚Äù
what was your favorite ayso team name that you were a part of?
‚Äúmy favorite ayso team when i was younger was called blue crush. i don‚Äôt really remember why, i think there was a movie, maybe, called blue crush and i think that may have been why. i do remember that we made it pretty far, we made it through like, the regional tournament and did pretty well and that was probably the best ayso team i played for.‚Äù
did you have a fun pre/post game ritual as an ayso player?
‚Äúback when i was an ayso player my pregame ritual was probably to put on my cleats like three hours before a game and have my mom braid my hair. it‚Äôs a little different now-a-days, now i have a teammate braid my hair and put my cleats on right before i go out. so it‚Äôs a little different, but i don‚Äôt want my mom in the locker room, so sorry, my mom can‚Äôt braid my hair anymore. i still take a few things from when i was younger and apply that now.‚Äù
what is your most memorable memory from ayso?
‚Äúgoing to in-n-out before a game and then everyone was so full and losing that game and being like, why did we eat burgers before a game?‚Äù
what is your greatest advice for young athletes?
‚Äúadvice i‚Äôd give to young soccer players is to believe in yourself first of all and that hard work takes you way farther than any talent that you start off with. it‚Äôs really that simple. there‚Äôs no secret to success, but it starts with that self-belief.‚Äù
what‚Äôs been your best moment as a pro soccer player?
‚Äúmy best moment as a pro soccer player would definitely be our very first game with orlando pride and seeing 24,000 people showing up for our first game.‚Äù
what are your favorite hobbies off the soccer field?
‚Äúmy favorite hobbies off the soccer field are yoga, spending time out on our lake here in orlando, taking my dog to the dog park and just hanging out with family.‚Äù
