why was this site created?my name is jeanne. i delivered my son eli via an unplanned c-section in october of 2002. after spending so much time reading about every aspect of my pregnancy in detail both online and in books - i was amazed to discover so little written about recovering from my surgery. add in being a very sleep-deprived first-time mom (i didn't get one of those babies who sleeps all the time!) and my being a very slow healer -- and you get the motivation to create what i wished had been there for me.this site has been completely updated with all links validated as of 9/10/2022.



what isn't this site about?this site isn't meant to be for or against c-sections. i will include links and pointers to other sites which are on both sides of the great debate. there are links to sites, books and online publications which include research and statistics. it is not my intention to endorse any position - but instead to help you in your research. my primary goal is to help women heal.
