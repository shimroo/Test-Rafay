why is raxles the best?
what is it that makes raxles cv axles better than all the others? we never regrind our components. regrinding is a common practice in the industry, but it can lead to a number of problems. here's why raxles never regrinds:


when you regrind used parts, they must be held in position for the entire processa feat which is virtually impossible to achieve. as the part moves around, grinding becomes inconsistent, resulting in an inferior product.
regrinding cv joints removes the case hardened 'race' which the ball bearings move against. the 'race', which is the track along which the ball bearings roll and slide against, is a short-term fix.  getting rid of that wear with the regrinding process results in a surface which is much softer, and which wears out in months if not weeks.
the failure rate on cv drive axles with reground components is extremely high. the only way to ensure a high quality, long lasting product is to rebuild with brand new, quality components.




                    other cv axle companies regrind their parts in order to keep their prices low. but what they're really doing is cutting corners and delivering an inferior product. don't be fooled! a raxles cv axle with new components is your only option for a high quality, long lasting solution to your cv problems.

testimonials



                    i have 98 audi a4 1.8qt mt, both my front axels had to be replaced. i got them from raxles and let me tell you what a great experience!
                    not only were the axels great, well packed (with paper towels, gloves and a swiss army knife as souvenir) and in perfect conditions but also marty was great to deal with. his sales and customer service skills are second to none, and coming from a customer service background i now how hard that is..
                    marty, thank you.

                    marty and staff,
                    thank you so much for the excellent product. i recieved my stg 2 raxles today in the mail, and everything was assembled beautifully. i am almost speechless on the quality and worksmanship found in these axles, especially being an aftermarket product. virtually every part of my car has been modified, and this quality far exceeded my expectations and oem specifications easily. keep up the good work, and i plan on recommending these axles to everyone. thanks again!
