forensic mathematics










forensic mathematics
	 ... is the best short description that i have found to describe the
	 work that i do, which mostly pertains to dna identification, and
	 includes 
	 consulting, writing 
	 software – 
	 dna•view is dna identification
	 software used by some 100 laboratories, in every continent (except antarctica) –
	 academic activities in
	 mathematics, 
	 biostatistics, and various aspects of population genetics.
