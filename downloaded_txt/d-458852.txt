 the badsey website


in  memory  of  richard  phillips  (1947-2015)
an appreciation of his life
the badsey website, www.badsey.net is now frozen and will not be accepting new contributions but visitors can continue to access the site.  this website, more than anything else, can perhaps be viewed as richard's memorial and legacy to the village.
our other websites, www.badsey.org.uk (the village today - groups and organisations) and www.archive.badsey.net (badsey society archive and virtual museum) continue to accept contributions.
we shall be working with richard's son, will phillips, to produce a brand-new website for the badsey society in 2016 which will take advantage of the latest concepts in web design.
