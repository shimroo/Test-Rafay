blogger lockout??



i'm not sure if this will even post... i've tried so many times. it's almost like i'm locked out of the blog-o-sphere, but i'm trying. i know it's been a long, long time, but i am getting the blogging itch and i have so many new ideas for my little cottage here on the net. i think you'll enjoy it, so please come back soon. the cottage is getting a make-over!

summer rundown



we are having an uneventful, but fun summer. no big vacation plans, but i am enjoying the downtime knowing that this fall i will be busy working again. lots of thought and prayers going into where we will be and what we will be doing. big changes, maybe. but change is good, right? i'm just enjoying now! baby t had his 2nd birthday. i am such a bad blogging mama... no big post about how i couldn't handle the day or how sad i am that he's getting so big. no post with his newborn picture and a recap of his birth. yeah, kind of over that. (at least today.) i'm excited that he's growing up. it's fun to watch him do all the different things he's doing every day and learning all the new things he's learning. i'm enjoying 2. still sort of a "baby" but becoming a "big boy". it won't be like this forever. best of both worlds. stand still, time! we took him to the zoo (just like last year) and i hope we can make it a tradition. (at least until he's too old to enjoy it. or too old to admit it.) we had his party the next evening at the park. there were close to fifty people there. it was almost too much for him. we opened a few gifts there until he got interested in something else, opened more the next day, more the next day and to be very honest, i think there are still a couple of things in my office that he still hasn't played with yet. the child is not deprived. his newest interest... cars. not the toys. the movie. we watch that about 2-3 times a day.            ka-chow! he calls it "go car go". wonder if we should try and take him to see "go car go 2"? i'm sure he'd do ok in the theater, but we have the popcorn issue... he is still too little to have it and i have to have it. you can't go to the movies without getting popcorn. i think that's a law? his father and i have discussed this and we came to the conclusion that we could both take him... one of us could sit with him (without popcorn) while the other was a few rows away (with popcorn). then, we'd switch half way through the movie. or, we could sneek in the puffy, no kernel kind and mix it in the tub o'corn and let him think he's having what we're having (that was my idea, cause i'm a tricky mom like that). it's so hard raising kids today! these situations keep me up at night. obama is so lucky he just has that little "debt ceiling" thing to worry about. his girls are old enough to get popcorn at the movies.   t1 is busy doing his usual thing. computer, shopping, cars... he's getting more interested in driving. i see drivers ed in his future. but, not until he starts wearing his glasses more. how do you get your teenager to wear their glasses? duct tape? t2 has a summer job. he mows my father's church lawn. hey, it pays good and he loves to mow. i think next year he might try to find more mowing jobs. he's so good at it, too! he's been spending most of his summer at my parents' house and although i miss him, he's having a blast. and isn't that what being 14 is all about?! he has a bunch of friends around his age in their neighborhood and they all ride bikes, play basketball, go swimming and explore the creek.  me... well, my goal was to have a decent tan by now. uh, nope. i had planned to have a set workout routine at the y. nope. oh i know, i was busy getting the house and my new office organized. wait, another nope. i really can't tell you what i've gotten accomplished because it seems like this summer my mind has been foggy and i've just been doing the basic "mom" things. cleaning, laundry, fixing meals, watching my toddler while making my teens happy, finding time for sleep... ya know just little stuff like that. i did get my hair colored last week. and it actually turned out. it's actually as light as i wanted it. that never happens. guess i shouldn't ask for any more this week. or month. don't get me wrong, i am truly thankful for all i have. i don't need much. however, i will admit i am a little envious of all my friends who are taking summer vacations. but then i think about how we are planning another trip to florida soon and then, while my friends are here freezing in the indiana cold, i'll be nice and warm in sunny florida. if i want sunshine now, all i have to do is step out on my back porch. happy summer!
