we are mater




as a catholic not-for-profit ministry of mercy partners, mater brings together our collective expertise and resources across health, education and research to help you make better choices about your health, every day.
through our extensive network of hospitals, health centres and related businesses, a nationally accredited education provider, a world-class medical research institute and philanthropic support, we’re working together to improve the health of our community.












did you know?
the sisters of mercy built mater on a foundation of collaboration and a shared vision as a catholic ministry to meet unmet community need.
this approach has shaped and inspired us for more than a century, and while that vision continues, how we deliver our services has changed. we have evolved and now serve our community in ways which may not be so well known.
watch to learn more about different areas of mater and how we are building on our history of care to enhance and extend beyond the hospital services we’re known for, working together to improve the health of our community.









meet our mater people
thousands of passionate people are employed across mater and each and every one of them brings together a high level of skill, integrity and compassion to their role. while mater people hold unique skills and attributes, they have one important thing in common—they have genuine care and compassion for others.
