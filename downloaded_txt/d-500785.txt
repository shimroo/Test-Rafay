'dog the bounty hunter' partners with prison ministry to witness testimonies, praise, and baptisms
'dog the bounty hunter,' along with the prison ministry god behind bars, recently teamed up and saw many incarcerated men give their lives to jesus in one of the country's toughest prisons.  the most recent visit took place at the louisiana state penitentiary in angola, la, where the gospel message was shared with over 700 men in prison.  "most of these men are serving 25 years to life in prison but god is not done with them yet," says god behind bars on instagram. "revival is happening inside of louisiana prisons!"                 view this post on instagram                                  a post shared by god behind bars (@godbehindbars)   the ceo of the ministry, jake bodine, talked about the hunger for faith that he's seeing inside prisons across america.  "we went to, number one, fill their cup – and to reach those that would most likely never darken the door of a church – with the love of christ and we saw an amazing response," said bodine in an interview. during their visit to angola, about 50 inmates gave their lives to jesus during the worship service and 12 men facing life sentences were baptized right there.  duane chapman, aka 'dog the bounty hunter,' along with his wife francie, former nfl player joe jackson, and former nfl player mike barber were at the service to share their testimonies as well.                  view this post on instagram                                  a post shared by joe jackson (@jojk86)   "angola was once known as the bloodiest prison in america," said joe jackson on instagram. "it still is, but it's the blood of jesus cleansing the soul. what a powerful and amazing weekend." chapman shared his testimony, which included talking about his own time behind bars.  "behind bars, i found my calling. i'll never forget the moment a guard yelled—'hook him up, bounty hunter!' right then, i knew exactly what to do," he shared in a recent instagram post. "since that day, i've taken down over 10,000 fugitives, built a name the world wouldn't forget, and led the #1 show on tv. but today, my mission is bigger—i'm hunting souls for jesus." back in the day chapman was sentenced to five years for being an accomplice during a break-and-enter and served 18 months.  "we partnered with @godbehindbars, and what we saw? power, freedom, hope. chains broke. tough men wept. convicts turned into warriors for christ. i’ve kicked in doors, chased down the most wanted, but nothing compares to watching a man surrender to jesus."
