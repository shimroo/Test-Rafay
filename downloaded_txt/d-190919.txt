stephanie bischoff
i have had the privilege to meet many people from all walks of life and help them find a place to call home. i’m a people person with a competitive spirit and an eye for design. my specialties include negotiations, marketing, design, staging, and structuring deals that otherwise wouldn’t or couldn’t come together. i can’t wait to work with you!











emily johnson
i have been representing the snohomish county area since 2005. my low-pressure approach to sales, attention to detail, patience, and drive have always guided my approach. many of my clients have even become my friends. i live here in snohomish with my husband ron and our three amazing children.











nicole graafstra
i strive to remain up-to-date on trends in the snohomish and king county real estate markets, constantly working to ensure that all of my clients’ goals are achieved. i will be extremely attentive to your specific requirements from stagings to showings, and my straightforward approach will get you the best results on the market.











gabe gilpin
i grew up in snohomish, and when my father retired, i became the third generation to own this family business. as a snohomish native and father, i bring a level of patience, knowledge, and understanding that is unmatched. for my clients, i strive to achieve excellence in all areas of real estate, resulting in unparalleled service.











rose mcallister
i have 26 years of experience helping my clients make their dreams come true. whether they’re buying or selling, i will be there for them every step of the way. i cherish the moments when i get to hand my buyers the keys to their new home, and helping my sellers to achieve their goals will never grow old.











ray cook
i grew up on a farm in snohomish and have raised my family here for almost 70 years. i got into real estate in the 1980s and fell in love with all the challenging and exciting adventures it brought. i am experienced, professional, and honest, and i treat every one of my clients like they are family.











spike wahl
i moved to washington in 1984 out of a love for travel and a sense of adventure! hard work, responsibility, and solid ethics from farm life are the foundation of my soul. that, along with a gift of gab and a bartender’s background, led me to real estate in 2003, and i have never looked back! i believe the tried and true, old school, golden rule always gets the job done.











julianne mckeown
i’m a pacific northwest native, and i started my career in the banking industry. in that journey, i discovered a passion for helping clients navigate the mortgage and home buying process. i found i loved helping them find just the right mortgage solution! after moving to snohomish, i entered real estate, where i now apply my knowledge of the lending process to help my clients with realistic conversations and smooth closings. i’m motivated by the relational connections i create with my clients.











jamie delong
“making dreams come true” has been my motto for over 20 years! being a wedding and event coordinator has taught me that i can handle any problem big or small. my clients know that i have their back always. buying or selling a home is personal, emotional, and one of the biggest things you will do. i strive to make that process easy on you from start to finish. you always remember the ride, i make the ride a smooth one.











jennifer murphy
i moved to the snohomish area in 2011, where i raised my daughter. my mother-in-law, also a broker at gilpin, encouraged me to try real estate, and i fell in love. one of the best parts about it is learning everyone’s stories. i strive to make every one of my clients happy, and i am excited to work with you.











cassandra loesch
my name is cassandra loesch and i have been in the business for just almost a year and a half now. i have lived in snohomish my entire life and i enjoy playing indoor soccer in the fall with a co-ed league. i have two wonderful daughters who i have full time; holly who is 6 and skylar who just turned 8 years old this month. i really enjoy helping my client’s become homeowners and making sure that their needs are met throughout the transaction.











ashley black
growing up in monroe, washington, i gained a deep appreciation for the area we live in. as a wife and mother of three young boys, i know how important it is to find a good home. i have always had a passion for real estate, so it is my pleasure to help other people find the perfect home for their families as well.











meagan gilpin
i grew up in snohomish and graduated from snohomish high school. in 1997, after several years of working as a stylist in the snohomish region, i met and married gabe. a few years later, i decided to get my real estate license so i could work in the family business. i currently work in real estate part-time and spend the other part of my weeks working as a para-educator for the snohomish school district. i love the flexibility to serve in both spaces!
