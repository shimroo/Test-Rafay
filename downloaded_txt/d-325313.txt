note:
the financial aid student portal will be down for planned maintenance on february 18, 2025 from 1:00 am to 5:00 am. during this time, both the student and admin portals will be unavailable.



note:
1/30/2025 – on wednesday, jan. 29, 2025, the office of management and budget rescinded the memorandum that temporarily paused federal financial assistance programs.
prior to the rescindment, the u.s. department of education confirmed that federal student aid was not stopped or paused. funds provided to individual students, which include direct loans, pell grants, and the federal work study program were not intended to be impacted.
we will continue to monitor this situation and will provide further information as it becomes available.


note:

the 2025-2026 fafsa is available. visit our fafsa information page for more details. rutgers federal school code is 002629.
