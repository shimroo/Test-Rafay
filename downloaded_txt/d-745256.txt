about keen welding consumable storage ovens:
since  1923, welding professionals around the world have trusted keen  welding ovens for dependable, welding consumable storage. our stick electrode  ovens, submerged arc flux ovens and custom consumable storage ovens can fulfill  just about any requirement. 
welding technology changes rapidly and keen welding is there  for you. our mixed-use mig wire and tig wire storage oven (k-1000m&t) was  the first in the industry. other firsts were the segregated tig filler rod  storage oven (kt-99) and inert atmosphere welding consumable storage ovens  (nitrogen purge capable).â  our  engineering staff at keen ovens strives to keep the convenience and practical  needs of today's welders foremost in their productions.
types of ovens:
welding  electrode rebake ovens - coatings on welding electrodes quickly  absorb atmospheric moisture when taken out of the can. this moisture contains  hydrogen which will eventually enter the weld and cause cracking. damaged electrodes need to be rebaked at  high temperatures to restore them. the  keen kht-500 500 lb. capacity oven and the kht-900 1000 lb. capacity oven are perfect solutions. our proprietary shelving  configuration will ensure effective heating and restoration of your electrodes.
welding flux  storage and rebake ovens - we offer 125 lb, 300 lb and 600 lb  hopper-style flux holding ovens with maximum temperature of 550â°f for  maintaining factory fresh dryness. we also offer the 600 lb. high temperature khtf-600 flux rebake oven which reaches 1000â°f. our  flux ovens have the quickest heat-up times in the industry due to our  unique element configuration and rugged oven design.
portable  welding electrode ovens - we offer a broad range of  capacities in our portable range. we manufacture 5 lb., 15 lb. and 50 lb.  portable models. rugged and durable, these ovens will keep your rods factory  dry in the field. available with or without thermostat. take what you need from  the shop holding oven, and load up a keen portable before heading to the field.
mig wire and tig filler rod holding ovens - we offer  the broadest range of mig & tig storage ovens in the welding industry. for  small shops we have compact bench-top models like the k-4rs which holds 4-33# wire spools, and the k-4rsm which holds up to 4-60# wire spools.  for the large shop we offer a broad range of options for mig, tig and mixed  storage ovens like the industry first k-mpo mixed use oven and the kt-99 originally designed for boeing. with keen, your expensive mig and tig  consumables will always be protected.
floor welding electrode ovens and bench welding electrode ovens - our  450 lb. capacity k-450 model is known around the world for its  rugged construction and ease of use. there are units still in use since the  early 1970's. the k-200 is very popular with the smaller shop  for its compact size and efficient heating. the larger floor models like the k-900 and k-1000 are terrific cost-effective storage  solutions for the large shop. the floor models are built with forklift slots  for ease of handling around the shop.
