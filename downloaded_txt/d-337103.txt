advanced age - your risk of developing and dying from a heart-related illness increases as you age, with most deaths occurring in the over 65 age group, so staying as healthy as possible through exercise and diet is the best way forward.
gender – men are more at risk of having a heart attack than women, and having one earlier, too.
heredity risk - you have a higher chance of developing heart disease if other family members have it. you may want to get your dna tested for any hereditary risk, then (of course) discuss the results with your doctor.
smoking – smokers are more likely than non-smokers to develop heart disease. it’s time to kick the habit!
low physical activity - leading a sedentary lifestyle is one of the major risk factors for developing coronary heart disease, but you don’t have to be an elite athlete to increase your activity levels as extra protection.
being overweight - overweight people are more likely to develop heart disease. excess body fat around the stomach and abdomen areas is particularly dangerous and can also lead to high blood pressure.
stress - your physiological response to stress could be a leading risk factor for having a heart attack. look for healthy ways to deal with the stress of your everyday commitments, such as mindfulness and meditation.
poor diet - what you eat affects your health. eating nutrient-rich foods (such as fruits and vegetables) and limiting your red meat and sugar consumption is a good place to start.

every february across the united states, heart health awareness month is celebrated. since declared a health month by president lyndon johnson in 1964, fundraising and heart health awareness activities take place all over the country.
this month we look at the different statistics regarding heart health and some ways that you can be preventative when it comes to your heart health. 


cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in america.
approximately 640,000 americans die from heart disease each year – that’s 1 in 4 deaths.
more than ¾ of the deaths from cardiovascular disease occur in low- to middle- income countries.
someone dies from cardiovascular disease every 38 seconds, according to the american heart association.
around 18.2 million adults over the age of 20 have cardiovascular disease.
one in five heart attacks are silent, with the person unaware of it.

so, what are the warning signs of a heart attack? here are some common symptoms:

tightness in the chest
nausea, heartburn and indigestion
shortness of breath
cold sweat
fatigue
sudden dizziness

many different risk factors affect your chances of developing heart disease. understanding what aspects of your life play a role can help you make changes to improve your health. of course, there are some risk factors that you cannot change, but you should still be aware of them. here are the risk factors:

as odd as it may seem, your feet may be the window to your overall body health. here are some things to look for regarding your feet that will give you clues that there may be other important body issues to investigate.

thick, yellow toenails - 
toenails are not supposed to be thick and/or yellow.  thick, yellow nails are most often an indication of a fungal infection living beneath your toenails.  people that have other medical conditions, like rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and other immune deficiencies are more likely to get a fungal infection than those that do not have these conditions.  to treat thick, yellow toenails, you will need to consult a podiatrist.  while there are plenty of over-the-counter treatments for thick, yellow toenails, by the time your nails are already discolored and thick it is too late for any over-the-counter creams or medicines to work. you must discuss your options with a professional.
no hair on your feet or toes – 
if your feet or toes are lacking hair, it can be a sign of having poor circulation because of vascular disease.  if you notice that your feet and toes do not have any hair on them, you will want to consult your doctor to find out ways to improve your circulation thereby reducing your risk of acquiring vascular disease.
a wound that won’t heal on your foot – wounds on your feet that just won’t heal could be an indication of diabetes.  over time, elevated blood glucose levels can lead to serious nerve damage in your feet and because of this damage you may not feel when you have a sore or a wound on your foot.  if your wound continues to go unhealed there could be major problems, including amputation.  if you notice a wound that won’t heal on your feet, be sure to contact your doctor to discuss your wound.

mangoes are an excellent source of vitamins a and c, and they are also an excellent way to replenish potassium lost through exercise or for those who are constantly “on the go.”
an average-sized mango can even contain up to 40 percent of your daily fiber requirement, thereby being a great way to curb constipation and irregularity.
mangoes can also help to prevent certain types of cancer and help to lower blood cholesterol levels, too.


recipe: jamaican jerk chicken salad

½ cup prepared or purchased honey mustard dressing
1 teaspoon finely grated lime zest
4 chicken breast halves without skin, boneless
1 tablespoon jamaican jerk seasoning
2 large fresh mangoes
10 to 12 cups mixed greens 

stir together honey mustard dressing and lime zest.  cover and chill dressing while preparing chicken.
rinse chicken and pat dry; sprinkle with jerk seasoning.  in a large skillet cook the seasoned chicken in hot oil over medium-high heat about 6 minutes on each side until browned and no longer pink.  thinly slice each chicken breast.
arrange warm chicken and mango atop greens on four plates; drizzle with the honey mustard dressing.
