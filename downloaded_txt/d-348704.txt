featurespace and orbograph partner to help financial institutions 
prevent check fraud using world-class analytics and image forensics









atlanta, ga, and burlington, ma, july 23, 2024 – global fraud and financial crime prevention company featurespace has partnered with orbograph, supplier of check processing automation and fraud detection software and services, to better protect the financial services industry from check fraud.  
according to data from the financial crimes enforcement network (fincen)*, check fraud is becoming more prevalent compared to other types of fraud, making up more than one-third of all fraud at depository institutions in 2023.
this partnership will see the two organizations integrate their fraud-detection services to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of identifying and preventing fraudulent check activities for both deposit and “on-us” fraud (whereby a check or other transaction is deposited or processed by the same bank that issued it).
