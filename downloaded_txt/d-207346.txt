     about cropping daze retreat

 bed and breakfast

cropping daze retreat, inc. was established as the result of the dream of its partners, holly kaster, lisa macleod, phyllis macleod, and dawn timoszyk. we took our passion for scrapbooking and combined it with our love for cooking and entertaining. we set out to develop an environment where women could come for a weekend to work on their favorite hobby, rest, relax, and be pampered.out of the four original partners, two remain. in 2014 lisa lost her battle with melanoma skin cancer. she was an integral part of the success of cropping daze. her culinary skills, attention to detail, and infectious laugh are truly missed. dawn spent her last day in our kitchen in 2014 as well. the call of very busy teenage girls with outrageous sports schedules forced her to hang up her apron, leaving phyllis and holly to hold down the stove.our retreat has grown to house more than just scrapbookers through the years! every weekend we host various crafters such as quilters, painters, jewelry makers, pinterest groupies, knitters, and more! we even cater to those who just want to come and relax and hang out with their ‘girls.’our goal is to make you forget about the mundane tasks of home. we make every effort possible to pamper and care for you during your stay. gluten-free? we’ve got you covered! food allergies? no worries! holly has a servesafe food safety certification with an allergy endorsement. picky eater? we will always encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and try something new (we have won over some of the pickiest eaters!). regardless, we have no problem omitting something you dislike. we always do our best to ensure your food experience at cropping daze makes you crave more!at cropping daze retreat, our guests enjoy a new menu every six months. we serve recipes collected from our families, friends, and the many cookbooks, magazines, and cooking shows that we have enjoyed over the years.

       the neighborhood

 an experience

our home is nestled in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance (only three blocks!) of the quaint village of chesaning. located on michigan's shiawassee river in southern saginaw county, the historic village (often dubbed 'showboat city') is best known for the 'shiawassee queen.'   although the showboat is@ retired, the quaint town carries on.  serving as a symbol of the chesaning community for over 75 years, the three-leveled vessel was a stage for famous musicians during the annual showboat music festival. be sure to take a stroll around showboat park and cole park, where you'll discover scenic walking trails around the winding river, disc golf, a repurposed old dam, and an antique iron bridge. our quaint town of chesaning is also known for its preservation of "vintage" victorian architecture, which is noticeable with just a drive through town - an excursion worth taking. visit antique and specialty shops and feel the overall friendliness of the locals (where people actually say hello and aren’t grumpy!), for seasonal activities and more information, visit
 www.chesaningchamber.org.

 "this is by far my favorite place to go to “craft” for the weekend. holly has the best home cooked meals, warm beds, lots of space to craft. her new menu this year is a++. she spoils you from the moment you walk in till when you check out. this was my daughter's christmas gift and she and i had the best time crafting. i can not say it enough this is the best place to go away with friends or family. thank you again holly and the great staff you spoiled us and we can’t wait to return hopefully sooner than later"
carol p.

 "this place is as good as it gets!!!  i checked into this lovely home on thursday night.  the house is warm and inviting.  it is perfectly clean and well stocked for any need.  there was a snack thursday night, and every night after that.  there was always something savory and something sweet, so it accommodates any craving.  the scrapbooking room was spacious and well lit.  each person receives 8 feet of table space with a comfy chair and lamp.  there were plenty of cold pops in the fridge, as well as fresh water, and tons of snacks available at all times.  the bedrooms and bathrooms are well decorated and very clean.  they also have extra toiletries if needed, and plenty of towels.  each meal was plated and there was plenty of well cooked food.  the staff serves each person as seated and offers a variety of beverages to be served, as well.  the staff is extremely accommodating with dietary needs.  they were also very friendly and helpful.  i have not one negative comment about this place.  it far exceeded my expectations and i hope to return soon!!  thank you for a wonderful and perfect weekend retreat!"
