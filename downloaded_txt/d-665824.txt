celebrating its 20th anniversary season in 2024, fort lauderdale’s revolution live has been living the music in south florida since 2004. acts such as lady gaga, the weeknd, katy perry, and paramore played the rock club’s legendary stage for an intimate audience before they broke out as stars; artists of all genres, from punk to rap to metal, regularly perform at the unapologetically bold venue.
winner of the broward-palm beach & miami new times 2018 “best of miami” awards for best rock club, revolution hosted sold out shows from sum 41, artic monkeys, john legend, rancid, flatbush zombies, kali uchis, børns, and an unforgettable secret concert from indie rock legends the pixies. revolution live is bringing up-and-coming stars vince staples, kurt vile, and ella mai to its stage.
revolution live has hosted an extensive portfolio of private & corporate events, including birthday parties, bar & bat mitzvahs, banquets, and more. the venue, along with the entire damn good hospitality family, is committed to its position in the community as an influential advocate for philanthropy and local support.

jun 13, 2017
everyone loved the party! your staff was professional and attentive. laura made everything beautiful for the event. the bartenders made outstanding drinks, and the wait staff were always present. it was a surprise party and it was handled it perfectly! the burlesque show made the party different and put it over the top. my only complaint - which is in no way negative - is that the hors d'oeuvres were so good, they went too fast!! all in all, great job done by all. thank you from the bottom of my heart.
