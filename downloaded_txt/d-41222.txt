 0 pieces of brilliance put forth by a daring and delightful reader



a decade of corporations like facebook censoring sex-positivity got us here: “michael kosta sits down with clinical psychologist dr. david ley, who traces the origins of the alt-right movement’s anger to its anti-masturbation stance.” * why is the alt-right so angry? (daily show | comedy central) kanye west, who wrote a song last year about…

“plans to introduce a nationwide age verification system for online pornography have been abandoned by the government after years of technical troubles and concerns from privacy campaigners. the climbdown follows countless difficulties with implementing the policy, which would have required all pornography websites to ensure users were over 18. methods would have included checking credit…

i don’t know about you, but i’ve been really wondering what sex workers think of the new film, hustlers. “sex workers rarely see any of our experiences reflected on tv or movies. we are usually severely dehumanized, the character that gets ârescued,â the but of a tired joke, or getting murdered in the first five…

in 2012 louis theroux took his cameras to porn valley and created one of the most misogynistic, warped, and utterly misleading video editorials i’d ever seen. turns out, this was completely on-brand for theroux, who describes himself as “puritanical” and went on-record supporting britain’s disastrous internet porn restrictions. looks like this time he’s gone after…

i think this is what’s been going on with me. “i asked dr. justin lehmiller, a research fellow at the kinsey institute, why some people might be more likely to give themselves over to temporary celibacy during times of high anxiety … but anxiousexuality is different than a dry spell. itâs more existential.” * are…

the sex work vs. trafficking issue is a clear signifier of understanding around pro-choice. if they can’t demonstrate they understand the difference between adult women having consensual sex and girls being raped on the “lolita express” (epstein) then they can’t be trusted with lawmaking around female bodily autonomy. our bodies, our choices. we do not…

“new age restrictions on pornography that are set to come into effect in the uk next month are a âprivacy timebombâ, a new report has warned. âdue to the sensitive nature of age verification data, there needs to be a higher standard of protection than the baseline which is offered by data protection legislation,â said…
