checkers 
            origin


it 
            is not clear the origin of the checkers board game. there are paintings 
            of the 13th century that depicts a checkered board. some historians 
            believed that checkers may have been invented around 1000 ad.; the 
            location of the checkers game origin is probably the south of france 
            and spain - hey, a mediterranean game. there are traces of checkered 
            games in the middle east, but, were they checkers?


 












checkers 
            game



the game of 
              checkers or draughts is played on a board of sixty-four squares 
              of alternate colors, usually referred as black and white although 
              not necessarily of those colors. twenty-four pieces (fat round counters), 
              called men (twelve on each side) also of opposite colors are located 
              on the game board. the game is played by two persons; the one having 
              the twelve black or red pieces is technically said • to be 
              playing the tint • side, and the other having the twelve white 
              "men", to be playing the second side. 

              the object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's men, 
              or block them so they cannot be moved, the person whose side is 
              brought to this state loses the game.
checkers game 
              rules 
              - the checkered board is placed between the two players in a position 
              where the bottom corner square on the left hand shall be black.
              - the players will toss a coin at the beginning of the match, and 
              the winner will have the choice of taking the black or white pieces.
              - then each player places his twelve men on the black squares of 
              the first three rows of his respective opposite ends of the board. 
              
              - the player with the black men must move first.
              - players 
              take turns to move a piece of their own color. the checkers are 
              moved diagonally forward, left or right, one square at each turn.
              - an opponent's piece is capture or taken when the player is able 
              to diagonally jump forward one of his "men" over an opponent's 
              piece and land on an empty square behind. the player may continue 
              jumping and capturing pieces with the same "man" during 
              the same move if possible.
              - when a piece reaches the last row on the opposite side of the 
              checkered board, it is crowned and becomes a "king". a 
              "king" is a piece "crowned" with another piece 
              of the same color on top. the free online checkers games identify 
              the king with a crown or an image of different color in the center.
              - a "king" moves diagonally forward and backward, and 
              also has the power of capturing pieces in both directions.
- a draw 
              occurs when neither of the players can force a win.
