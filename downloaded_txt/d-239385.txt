"the voice of one crying in
            the wilderness: 'prepare the way of the lord; make his paths straight "(mark 1:3)
            lord jesus said in (mark 1:15)the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of god is at hand.
            repent, and believe in the gospel."
let us
            prepare ourselves to that great day, when jesus is coming to take his bride with him (rev
            3:5)"he who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and i will not blot out his
            name from the book of life; but i will confess his name before my father and before his
            angels.
