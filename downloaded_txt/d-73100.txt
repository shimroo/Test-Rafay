who we arein 1986, the founders of nccs set out to establish an organization that would replace the words “cancer victim” with “cancer survivor,”
and bring about a different notion of the cancer experience. the founders envisioned an organization that would deal
with the full spectrum of survivorship issues related to living with, through, and beyond a cancer diagnosis.
