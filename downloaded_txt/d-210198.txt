great cause













pura vida coffee was established in 1998 to roast great fair trade organic coffees and then use most of the net proceeds of the business to fund programs through our create good foundation that help at-risk youth around the world.  we believe we were one of the first businesses to adopt a social venture business model that we continue to follow today. the growers of our premium fair trade organic are paid fairly and better able to provide for their families.  our customers benefit by enjoying a terrific cup of coffee.  when you serve pura vida coffee at your workplace, church or home, every single purchase has a purpose.
