efc erp - fms/tms

for more than two decades, e-freight technology has been delivering innovative and effective technology solutions to freight forwarders around the world.  
we began our journey in 1999 with a client-server based fms eft-ecargo, designed for us freight forwarders. later, we expanded our market to asia. it requires more rules and logics to adjust new business environment. every fms takes time to grow and mature. 
our freight erp system covers booking, operation, bill of lading, accounting, banking, cash management, general ledger, reports, statistics and dashboard. 
in 2019, we launched our cloud based efc erp for our clients. this system incorporates a new design concept and leverages modern technology to help forwarders seamlessly transition to the digital world. 
our extensive experience and knowledge of the international shipping and logistics industry enables us to create a complete and sophisticated freight system that meets the needs of the dynamic changing logistic world. 
we are committed to improving our products and services in the long run and put quality and customer satisfaction at the top of our priorities.
we understand that hearing is not enough, we need to listen and respond. 
our company culture is to focus on creating a user-friendly system. we constantly enhance screen design and business logic to minimize confusion. 
we view user errors as an alert to improve our design. we learned that a good presentation in screen layout benefits both our clients and us. it reduces the training time and our service time in answering questions. 
software design is an art. it’s art in communication that requires passion and innovation.
