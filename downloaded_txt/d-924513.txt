welcome to
country living inn


                            country living inn is a family owned and operated country inn, located in the heart of
                            lancaster county's pa dutch country. unlike the stark decor you'll find in most hotels, the
                            country living inn's themed suites and standard rooms feel more like a cozy bed and
                            breakfast, from the shaker style and traditional furniture to the comfortable glider
                            rockers, hand-selected antiques and decorative quilts on each bed.
                        
the inn provides a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of city
                            life, while still remaining close to major amish attractions, entertainment venues, outlet
                            shopping, restaurants and more.

great location. lovely comfortable
                                                room. we were coming to do an amish homestay and staying here the night
                                                before set the scene perfectly. we checked in late and that was easy.

                                                accommodating. room was clean and spacious. would definitely stay here
                                                again. superb hotel, staff and location.

iâve stated in many motels in the area
                                                in search of a winner. i think i finally found one. this motel is so
                                                clean. i wasnât grossed out like i was so many times before. looking
                                                forward to staying here again.

we were there for a very short time
                                                (got in late and left early) so did not eat breakfast or explore the
                                                area. i was super appreciative of the late check-in work around. that
                                                was helpful!
