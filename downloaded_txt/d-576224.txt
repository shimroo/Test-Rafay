based in great blakenham, suffolk, our team specialise in trailer design and fabrication. typically, we manufacture trailers in batch quantity for oem’s, coach builders and body builders.
serving all sectors and with high profile customers including the ministry of defence (mod) and the royal national lifeboat institution (rnli), we also supply bsp-tex with trailers for their road maintenance machinery.
we produce a complete spectrum of commercial and heavy-duty industrial trailers for transporting generators, industrial pipes, decontamination plant, satellite broadcasting kit, portable toilets, and sound testing equipment.
our recreational boat trailers are designed to carry lake, river, and ocean-going craft, including sail boats.
our design team use solidworks 3d cad software to calculate, visualise and support the manufacturing process.
we believe in providing a full-service when it comes to the supply and maintenance of our products, and we therefore offer a comprehensive parts service for all our trailers.
