1 comment on making plans to reboot my blog 







here i go again. this feels both familiar and strange, all at once.
a little bit of backstory to start. in november 2022, my facebook account was hacked. i know exactly when it began, as i had a strange ‚Äúyou must change your password‚Äù message. my facebook account and my instagram account were linked together, and whatever they did once they got inside was so bad, meta would not give me my account back. at all. i tried everything short of working with a lawyer on it.
what a nightmare. my facebook account was 16 years old at that point. my instagram account was 12 years old. if you look at my decline in posting on this blog, it aligns with those time periods.
i have found the silver lining in it all, as it has been nice to have a fresh start. it is like moving houses, you don‚Äôt notice what all you have until you have to pack it up and find a place for it in your new home.
the only part that still bothers me is all the content that i gave meta that is now just ‚Ä¶ gone. from articles or quotes i found interesting to entire lengthy posts that really belonged on a blog. photos from instagram. comments from friends. gone.
the irony of all of this is that when i published my book in 2015, i talked about building on the land that you own ‚Äì but i was not doing that myself.
lesson learned.
my purpose here now is mostly selfish. much like in the original days of blogging, actually. i want to write about what i think about, in a space where i know it will be here later. probably. (note to self: another post needs to be written about how none of us really own anything we put online, but not yet. no need to scare people completely.)
i want to use it like a commonplace book, where i can reference and find things as i need them.
it will also function as a journal, a diary, a photo album. a place to put a good quote. a place to just keep my thoughts.
here is my to do list as i get this site ready ‚Äì in the form of links to articles and videos.
commonplace books, para method, and a second brain

oscar wilde and how he kept his commonplace book: insights on how to approach a commonplace book ‚Äì and in a way, my foundation of what i want to do with this website.
beginner commonplace notebook setup & organization: table of contents? categories? well, that sounds a lot like tags & categories on my blog. i need to clean up the categories here.
tiago forte: organize your digital life with the para method: i‚Äôve followed tiago‚Äôs work for some time. we will be discussing this.
index ‚Äì the easy lookup for information in your commonplace book: more inspiration for indexing this content.
how to remember everything you learn: part of what is driving me to build upo this site? this. my memory seems to be terrible lately.
how to keep a commonplace book of wisdom: a way to hold on to wisdom. focus in on collections to understand diaries, journals, and more.
my box of inspiration! how to create a commonplace book: another way to track what you‚Äôre thinking, using notecards. help you synthesis and coordinate what you learn. these notecards remind me of when we did research papers in junior high.
a commonplace book will revolutionize your life: this video just makes me excited about what i‚Äôm doing here.
what‚Äôs in my commonplace book? ‚Äì 2023 edition: using the remarkable 2 for a commonplace book, similar to my blog goal.

productivity



how to stay focused and get things done: there are a lot of things to do on this list, and i need to set myself up for success and getting it all done.
how to fall in love with your planner: great ideas, but wow. i don‚Äôt want my planner to be a scrapbook. no.
the most overlooked productivity superpower: hours don‚Äôt equal outcome. overworking does not make you more productive.

wordpress design updates
this site is using a block editor theme at this point, but now there are patterns. i need to figure out what they are and what to do with them.

olliewp: everything you need to know about wordpress patterns: this will help me get going.
wordpress block themes: don‚Äôt make this beginners mistake!
wordpress block themes are amazing üî•: i know i want to use custom post types at some point here. fantastic information on them.

close the backdoor in my wordpress blog

wpbeginner tutorial: find the backdoor and fix it: if you look at my old posts, there are a lot of injected links. i‚Äôve already taken some of these steps, but i need to go through this tutorial and make sure this is resolved. i also need to check my server itself to make sure everything is ok.
wpbeginner: wordpress security guide ‚Äì step by step (2023): oh yes, we need to get security in here too.
wpbeginner: 12 signs your wordpress site is hacked (and how to fix it): more tips that i need to review.
how to find and remove spam link injection in wordpress?: they may be a bit biased, as they offer the plugin needed. however, i have thousands of pages that have spam links injected. i need help.
jetpack: has your wordpress site been hacked? how to check & fix it: see above. thousands of pages. help.
buzzfeed news: hackers are breaking into websites and adding links to game google: i mean, i guess it‚Äôs good to know i‚Äôm not alone?
wordpress website hacked? 10 steps to get you back on track: more solid tips.
andrea whitmer: how to find out if your wordpress site has been hacked: more ideas on security. i also like the ‚Äúmuseum‚Äù concept and the note at the top that the article is old and might be outdated. for a site that is 23 years old, this could be a good addition.

happy 20 year blogiversary!

friday, may 8, 2020














twenty years ago today, i started this blog.
originally known as blahblahblog, and later renamed bigpinkcookie, my first blog post was possibly my most groundbreaking:



these blogs seem to be all the rage, and hopefully it will be easier then editing the old fashioned way‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll see how it works out! =)






a thought for today:‚Äúwhat we need in the world is manners‚Ä¶. i think that if, instead of preaching brotherly love, we preached good manners, we might get a little further. it sounds less righteous and more practical.‚Äù¬†‚Äì eleanor roosevelt



this was actually my second attempt at blogging, after i was inspired initially by the digital divas to blog by hand coding an html page and replacing it each time i added to it.
thankfully blogger came along, and then greymatter, and movabletype, and eventually wordpress.
as i woke up this morning, i started to think of all of the things that blogging has impacted in my life.
without blogging, i never would have met a community of friends, many of which i‚Äôm still connected with today.
i never would have met my husband, mike. thank you ann for that connection.
i never would have met matt mullenweg and named wordpress. (hey, matt? remember when i thought you were crazy because you said it would change the world? yeah. you were right and i was wrong. 30% of the internet and still growing.)
without it, i wouldn‚Äôt have started sharing my photography & had the courage to start a business ‚Äì where i‚Äôve since photographed hundreds of weddings and thousands of portraits ‚Äì touching so many other lives ‚Äì and my blog helped me connect with those people.
the lessons i‚Äôve learned from blogging + social media + business are things that i‚Äôve tested over and over again with others, and formed the foundation of my coaching business.
without blogging, i wouldn‚Äôt have had 20 years of adventures. i wouldn‚Äôt be me.
i dreamed back in high school of being a photographer, a teacher, and working with computers. back then, you couldn‚Äôt have all of that. i never could have imagined the future i‚Äôd have, where i have been able to blend all three of those in to a perfect medley of my business.
twenty years. i can‚Äôt believe it has been twenty years.
thank you to all of you reading this now, who have read so many other things i‚Äôve written over the years. none of this would be possible without you.







people i‚Äôve visited, shared a meal with, spent a trip with. i‚Äôve watched their families grow and change. we‚Äôve supported one another in times of joy, and times of sorrow.
a community ‚Äì completely unlike one we could have ever imagined 20 years ago.
blogging made me believe that i could do anything.
my first photography clients, and my biggest fans, came from my blogging circle. i‚Äôve traveled to england, bermuda, and around the usa to photograph people that first came in to my life through blogging.
social media came along; twitter, then facebook, and instagram, and it all changed how we blogged. the posts became faster, the reactions and interactions more spontaneous, and blogging for many has evolved or faded away.
blogs have evolved, which isn‚Äôt surprising for a medium that didn‚Äôt even exist 20 years ago.
blogging is what made my life as i know it possible.

out with the old, in with the new‚Ä¶

17 comments on out with the old, in with the new‚Ä¶ 







if you follow me on facebook, you know i‚Äôve been going in circles about this blog for months. actually, now that i think about it ‚Ä¶ i‚Äôve been going in circles about it for years.
my business, my work, has always been focused around me. who i am has always been at the core of it. i have never hidden myself away from my clients. back in 2007 when i started my photography business, i went back and forth about consolidating this blog with that blog. it made no sense that they were separated, but i wasn‚Äôt ready to let this site go ‚Äì so it languished instead, neglected.
lately, i have found myself writin i have gone crazy trying to figure out what i want to do about that blog, this blog, my photography from my road trip, vivid & brave ‚Ä¶ well, you get the picture.
i finally asked my smart friends. i do actually have the smartest friends on the planet. most of them said to consolidate everything. it is far too confusing for them to have to go to different places to get a piece of me here and there. i completely agreed with them, yet it still didn‚Äôt feel right.
then my friend bobbi asked me about upcoming conferences i am going to, and what did i want to brand? that question was easy to answer. i want the world to know about the work that stephanie & i are doing at vivid & brave!
so my plan was to focus my personal writing at my photography blog, my travel blog posts at a travel blog (very niche focused so that google liked it) and put all of my energy in to vivid & brave. easy!
until i started spinning again.
i woke up this morning and really wanted to write a blog post about hotel sex and why it is so incredible. no, i did not have hotel sex last night. maybe that was why i was thinking about it being so grand? anyways‚Ä¶ that post didn‚Äôt belong on a blog where my photography clients might see it before they see anything else. it doesn‚Äôt belong on a travel photography blog (although it is hotel related). crap. once again? the circles were back. i was spinning. again.
stephanie & i finally had a chance to get on skype and chat this evening. as soon as i told her my dilemma? she pointed out that those posts belong on vivid & brave. she has no problem with me putting them there. we both agreed that as we ask our coaching clients to be crazy vulnerable with us, we need to be just as vulnerable with them. we don‚Äôt have many ‚Äúrules‚Äù for the group coaching, but the biggest one is tolerance and understanding. if i write about hotel sex and someone runs away from the post? well ‚Ä¶ they probably shouldn‚Äôt be working with me anyways. yes, this is true for my boudoir clients too ‚Äì but i have big dreams for 2014, and they involve vivid & brave. every last one of them.
finally, the spinning has stopped.
so it is with that that my personal blog posts ‚Äì and all my energy and focus ‚Äì are moving to the vivid & brave blog. i realized today that part of why this decision has been so difficult every time i face it is because this blog is such a part of me. it saw me through the ending of a tumultuous relationship that left me heartbroken, and emotionally broken as well. it has brought me hundreds (thousands?) of friends that i wouldn‚Äôt know otherwise. it is because of my blog that i met my friend ann, who tipped me off on this great guy mike who was living in london at the time but was moving back to houston. it was through this blog that i announced our engagement, 10 years ago yesterday. through this blog that i met elaine, a month before i met mike, who embarked on the adventure of being a professional photographer with me. the list goes on and on.
however, it is time. as i start the new year, it is time to move on to other things. mostly, it is time to stop feeling guilt about how little i update this site, how much i want to share but how my focus is pulled elsewhere. my focus is pulled elsewhere because i have changed. i have grown a lot in the past 13+ years since i started this blog back in 2000.
i have changed.
it is time to close the book on this blog. time to put it up on the shelf and focus completely on the new story.
this site will live on, remaining here online. i‚Äôm going to take the name back to being bigpinkcookie because that is what it has been for the past 10+ years. i‚Äôll link to it from time to time, and reminisce in the memories about it ‚Äî but it is time to start a new book.
one that is vivid & brave.

things you should know 

things you should know ‚Äì my greatest fear‚Ä¶

8 comments on things you should know ‚Äì my greatest fear‚Ä¶ 








‚Äúwhat is your biggest fear in business?‚Äù
my friend and philadelphia wedding photographer mike allebach asked that question today in the brandsmash facebook group. it stopped me.
fear? i don‚Äôt have fear in my business. ok, ok, i mean ‚Äì i have the fears everyone has. will there be customers? will some major catastrophe happen and shut my business down? but i have systems in place for a lot of things. i have an amazing network of friends locally and nation-wide that have my back. i don‚Äôt have fear about my business.
‚Äúletting my business take over my life, no longer having free time.‚Äù
it is so easy as a business owner to slide in to this mentality of it consuming everything. what i offer to my clients is built around my passions, so it is a part of me as much as my eyes are blue.
a few hours later, it hit me.
i have a far bigger fear ‚Äî my story not being heard.
(which of course starts with me telling it.)
i‚Äôve spent a lot of the past six weeks going in circles. i have stories i want to tell, and choosing where to tell them is hard. i know i want them on my blog and not on facebook, even though it is easier to just slide them in there. faster. always open. quicker feedback from people.
but facebook is so transient. fleeting. my stories belong on my blog.
having so much that i want to say leaves me silent. i don‚Äôt know where to begin. 
then there are the stories that overlap with the stories of others, and the blurred line of what i can share and what is not my story to tell.
if i want my story to be heard, i need to tell it. plain & simple. i should get on that, shouldn‚Äôt i?
i thought long & hard about this week‚Äôs things you should know thursday. if we‚Äôre going to be bffs, you should know that i need to be heard.
my goal for 2014 is to tell more of my story. here. on vivid & brave. when working with my mentoring clients. when working with my photography clients. it is all about the story and being heard ‚Äì and hearing them. we all have stories to share. i can‚Äôt wait to see what the new year holds.

why not me?

33 comments on why not me? 







i had the strangest day today. i‚Äôm still whirling from it all a bit.
my makeup artist asked me on wednesday if i knew any event photographers. uh ‚Ä¶ yeah. me. (5+ years of weddings? yes. events.) she was doing makeup for an event, and they needed a photographer. i exchanged emails with the event planner, and at first all i knew was her name and the time of the event; at first, i did not know the client‚Äôs name.
yesterday i was annoyed at myself. events? they don‚Äôt fit my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of helping women grow their confidence and rediscover their beauty ‚Äî i was thinking of handing it over to a friend. after all, stephanie & i are are in the middle of preparing a series for vivid & brave on preparing for the new year. i have a lot to do between now & monday.
then i got the email back with the name, and discovered it was a luncheon for emily‚Äôs list.
i am so glad i was there.
know when the world keeps pinging you and trying to send you messages? this summer when i was at blogher, i almost went in to the panel about how to run for office. hahaha‚Ä¶ who do i think i am? i could never run for office. i didn‚Äôt attend it.
today‚Äôs event? all about encouraging women to run for office. and then i flashed back to my activities in high school ‚Äì i was in a model state government program in illinois; i was selected as an ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù delegate for the model un program in houston. (pretty big deal when you‚Äôre one of 5 selected out of a hundred or so.) i went to close up in washington dc.
on my road trip, i said many times that it was easier to understand how certain regions voted certain ways when i spent time in their geography.
as the gears were turning and i was talking with state senators today from three different states, i realized ‚Äî why not me?
the moment that brought it full circle for me though ‚Äî irony at its best ‚Äî was when ohio state senator nina turner started talking about women, and how women are often the most critical of themselves. we as women tear each other down, and it is terrible! it is time that we come together in the sisterhood circle. ‚Äúit is the sister circle that will make the difference.‚Äù
well, crap. that? that is exactly everything i am about.
why not me.
why not you?
i‚Äôm tired of a government full of men, mainly white men, deciding my fate. the current state of affairs in this country is horrible. i considered more than once trying to figure out how to stay in canada this fall when i was in calgary, just to get away from the insanity.
maybe, instead, it is time to stand up and start figuring out how to change it. what i can do.
the start? helping to get people out to vote. i‚Äôve complained for years about people not turning out to vote. as someone said today, texas shouldn‚Äôt be called a ‚Äúred state‚Äù when only 20% of the voters turn out ‚Äì it should be called a ‚Äúnon-voting state‚Äù. 20%!!!!! that is just pathetic!!! texas is last in voter turnout. next election, when someone tells me that ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt bother because their vote doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù i will point out that they are told to believe that, but it is not true. not true at all.
beyond that? we will see. i need to spend some time thinking about this. i‚Äôve always believed you have no right to complain about something if you‚Äôre not willing to work towards a solution to fix it.
why not me?
