alum story
onsite is the 


best gift i have ever given myself, and i would recommend it to anyone wanting to make changes, heal, and 


grow.–peterliving centered program alum
onsite is the most amazing, wonderful, and healing place. the word that comes to mind is magical. the relationships built there are for life; the healing that takes place will 


transform you; and the counselors are the most well-trained, compassionate, and caring souls you will ever meet. i feel blessed beyond measure to have been able to attend. this is the best gift you can give yourself.–bworkshop alum
i’ve been in therapy on and off for 35 years, and 


nothing came close to my experience at onsite.–anonymousworkshop alum
what i accomplished there in 7 days cannot be described or measured. it was one of the most important and 


meaningful things i have done for myself. in doing this program, i have been able to improve my life in many areas.–terraworkshop alum
 



a safe environment for avoiding distractions, focusing on yourself, and resting and rebuilding in comfortable surroundings.
