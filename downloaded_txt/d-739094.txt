all things considered, i clearly talked excessively soon








all things considered, i clearly talked excessively soon. notwithstanding a describe war or a fanatic fight over joe lieberman's loyalties (and his readiness to captivate such a whine), it would seem that the dems will convey the senate too. the rope has immovably been planted around bush's neck. 



things that stood out amid the vote watch the previous evening: 



1) santorum's hollering kids amid his concession discourse: they were placed in an alternate light when a tv observer helped us to remember all the yelling youngsters whose daddy's lost their lives. all of a sudden, sensitivity for those whose daddies lost their occupations flew out the window. it says something when chris matthews tosses his rose-tinted glasses alongside the gop amazingness that he had beforehand held with such high respect. 



2) msnbc ought to be renamed memoirs of joe scarborough. in the event that i hear that 2x4 contrast everything without exception with his decade in congress once more, i'm going to spread regurgitation everywhere on those inside close vicinity. for the purpose of my friends and family, nbc ought to can that useless hack. 





something to keep us stressed: 



notwithstanding lieberman's loyalties, when he concurs with bush from here on out, he's formally punting the ball in cheney's lap - making ole double-barreled friend-shooter the 101st senator. without hybrid gop votes, this will hamper the senate's capacity to pass dynamic measures. 



the democratic party of texas formally now has consent to run name-brand legislators. at the point when the gop hopeful for representative wins with 39% of the vote, it implies one thing: why the hellfire did you not run top notch lawmakers? there were underdog government officials around the nation making triumph addresses on the brisk the previous evening because of winning "no-chance" races! there is no reason for the competitor program of the dems in the lone star state. the whole administration of the democratic party in the state of texas ought to be traded for stupendous uncouthness (clue to deaniacs: take it over). 



what it all means 



all things considered, to me in any event. 



it wasn't the torrent they were calling it on msnbc throughout the night, yet it was a moderate-to-solid triumph for the democrats. it could have been powerless (by basically matching the earlier gop numerical lion's share or more terrible), and it could have been a victory as some anticipated (40-60 seat pickup). it was some place in the middle of - particularly with their failure* to win a dominant part in the senate. 



what it implies: 



1) the president's motivation will be quieted and won't pass without trading off with the democrats in the house, 



2) the motivation of a democratic-headed house will be a moderate, widely appealing one. 



what it doesn't mean: 



1) there will be no reprimand of george walker bush. 



2) there will be no gingrich-style endeavor to legislate around the president. 



3) there will be no equivalent and inverse reel to the left by congressional democrats with their motivation. 



1) george allen won't be a hopeful for president. 



2) rick santorum won't be a hopeful for president. 



3) john mccain won't essentially have the capacity to utilize a ultra-liberal congress to run against for a fruitful fight for president — he'll need to run against george bush's record . . . once more (and we all expertise well he did the first run through). 



4) clinton or obama won't have the humiliating record of a gingrich-style democratic congressional exceed keeping their potential '08 presidential achievement. 



the absolute most exceedingly terrible thing it means is: 



a bush compelled to represent from the focal point might really encounter a build in approbation appraisals — forestalling either democratic or republican hopefuls for president to successfully run against his record in '08 (contingent upon how reliable the amnesia is among "free" voters). 



who said reagan was the tephlon president! 



*as of 11:30pm tuesday night. hey, i gotta work in the morning! lol! 



gettin' kinky wid it 



today, queertexan.com was recorded as an endorser of kinky friedman on the website, getkinky.com. with the end goal of full exposure to the individuals who are basically after the connection . . . this queer texan has altered his opinion. 



at the point when kinky started his exploit a year back, i was amped up for a hopeful that guaranteed to shake austin up — even before that movement transformed into another person's fight trademark. i stayed energized as the democrats assigned somebody to run against perry that had the same broad name distinguishment as the director of my nearby school board. 



things changed. previous congressman chris bell got a little road cred, and much more critical that, he discovered somebody to store his crusade. at that point, most vital to me specifically (being one-a large portion of a between racial gay couple), kinky couldn't scrape himself out of the huge amounts of cow butt nuggets his past satire acts have dumped on his force. insight to future gubernatorial chosen people: if the "n" word is a typical piece of your parody schedule, chances are you won't have a political profession later, regardless of the fact that you need one. 



a year ago, when the name of this web journal was entitled, "the blue report" (on blogger), i did embrace kinky friedman. for those that have been perusing my website for some time, you'll know i now completely help chris bell. he may not be jfk, yet he's the closest competitor in the surveys to rick perry, and for all texans that need old pretty hair out of office, then he's the stand out that has a shot at winning. 



on the other hand, you can vote in favor of granny or the cowhand who never grew up and imagine that you're doing something shrewd. it's actual that we need better competitors, yet these individuals ain't

blue book was one of a sequences of systematic studies of unidentified flying
objects (ufos) carried out by the united states air force. started in 1952, it
was the second revival of such a study (the first two of its kind being
projects sign and grudge). a termination order was given for the study in
december 1969, and all activity under its auspices stopped in january 1970.



project
blue book had two goals:


to decide if ufos were a risk
to national security, and
to scientifically examine
ufo-related data.



the
project blue book archive offers researchers free online access to over 50,000
official us government documents relating to the ufo phenomenon. a search

project blue book









project blue book was one of a series of systematic studies
of unidentified flying objects (ufos) conducted by the united states air force.
started in 1952, it was the second revival of such a study (the first two of
its kind being projects sign and grudge). a termination order was given for the
study in december 1969, and all activity under its auspices ceased in january
1970.



project blue book had two goals:



to determine if ufos were a threat to national security, and to
scientifically analyze ufo-related data.



thousands of ufo reports were collected, analyzed and filed.
as the result of the condon report (1968), which concluded there was nothing
anomalous about ufos, project blue book was ordered shut down in december 1969
and the air force continues to provide the following summary of its
investigations:



no ufo reported, investigated and evaluated by the air force
was ever an indication of threat to our national security;



there was no evidence submitted to or discovered by the air force
that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represented
technological developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific
knowledge; and there was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as
"unidentified" were extraterrestrial vehicles.



by the time project blue book ended, it had collected 12,618
ufo reports, and concluded that most of them were misidentifications of natural
phenomena or conventional aircraft. according to the national reconnaissance
office a number of the reports could be explained by flights of the formerly
secret reconnaissance planes u-2 and a-12. a small percentage of ufo reports
were classified as unexplained, even after stringent analysis. the ufo reports
were archived and are available under the freedom of information act, but names
and other personal information of all witnesses have been changed.

report





a report is a textual work (usually of writing, speech, television, or film) made with the specific intention of relaying information or recounting certain events in a widely presentable form.

written reports are documents which present focused, salient content to a specific audience. reports are often used to display the result of an experiment, investigation, or inquiry. the audience may be public or private, an individual or the public in general. reports are used in government, business, education, science, and other fields.

reports such as graphics, images, voice, or specialized vocabulary in order to persuade that specific audience to undertake an action. 

one of the most common formats for presenting reports is imrad: introduction, methods, results and discussion. this structure is standard for the genre because it mirrors the traditional publication of scientific research and summons the ethos and credibility of that discipline. reports are not required to follow this pattern, and may use alternative patterns like the problem-solution format.

america’s ready for hillary





a new usa today/cnn/gallup poll shows that most voting americans are likely to support a hillary candidacy. who knows how this will pan out in the next three and a half years, but these numbers are similar to the same support george w. was getting during the same period in 1998, and are stronger than […]

reports from europe in the last few days are indicating that the all-important constitution drive may fail. signing the deal is growing less popular each day in france, which votes on the measure next sunday, but this sentiment is also growing in the netherlands, and in the united kingdom – which has butted heads […]

idol finale: surprises and stinkers






tonight’s season finale of american idol crowned carrie underwood as the successor to fantasia, ruben studdard, and kelly clarkson. however, the two-hour show seemed to have a few things in common with its host, ryan seacrest – it was long-winded, boring, and full of itself.
the show managed to keep our attention by continually promising
