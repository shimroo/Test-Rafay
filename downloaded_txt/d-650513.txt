big bang mosaics - cynthia fisher



​i create custom fine art mosaics, residential mosaics and mosaic murals in public settings nationwide. i conduct school residencies and community projects and teach mosaic workshops at several art centers and at my studio in western massachusetts, big bang mosaics. fine art mosaics, most notably abstract mosaics are my passion and my work has won numerous national and international awards.
