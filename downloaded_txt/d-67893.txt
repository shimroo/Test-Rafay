 baby names and meanings
children often feel special if their name represents a good character trait. when thinking about a baby name, consider that children are likely to be teased at some point in their childhood because of a name's meaning.

when selecting a middle name, be sure to say it out loud to make sure it goes with the first.  often times too many syllables in first, middle and last name can be bit much for some while others want to be as creative as possible.  

it is best to think of rhyming names that might be embarrassing as well. this can be just as important as a name's meaning.

we've put together several lists of baby names organized alphabetically, by boy or girl, origin and  meaning to help you select the perfect name for your new addition.
