statement of solidarity and commitment to anti-racismthe off-broadway league is committed to doing the work required to become a more equitable, just and inclusive organization. we affirm that black lives matter and we join the calls to stand against anti-blackness and to stop aapi hate and racial injustice in all its forms. we acknowledge that our organization is composed of predominantly white individuals and leaders, and that most of our members serve predominantly white institutions, which don’t accurately reflect or represent the broader off-broadway theater community, or our home city of nyc. it takes energy, time, and resources to dismantle the cycles and systems that reinforce and support racism, oppression, violence and injustice, and we invite all of our members and stakeholders to partner with us to create a more inclusive, more equitable, more accessible, and anti-racist industry. we may make mistakes in the process, but we must use our power and our privilege to make our organization and the industry more equitable.
