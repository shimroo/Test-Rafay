helps support our mission 



donating + shopping with goodwill manasota 



while goodwill manasota strives to provide the community with a first-class shopping experience, our end goal is to help empower thousands of people through employment opportunities. opportunities include on-the-clock training, education and up-skilling, free career services, veterans services, and more. we couldn‚Äôt accomplish this without your generous donations of gently-used items and philanthropic funds. together, we make programs possible that help members of our community overcome various barriers to career and life success. together, we are building a stronger community.
