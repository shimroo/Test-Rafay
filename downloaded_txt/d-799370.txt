championing girls since 1939

 











this is not your ordinary summer camp.camp birchwood is more than just a spot on a map.  it is a place where girls are embraced with love and support as they engage their whole selves in remarkably fun and meaningful activities in the great outdoors.  the tremendous kind of “know-how” that girls gain at birchwood ignites their self-esteem and fuels their confidence.   with kindness and respect as the hallmarks for daily life, birchwood campers are steeped in a rich sense of community and encouraged to be their truest, most authentic selves.  their voices are heard.  their passions are explored.  and the genuine connections that are forged in this brilliant setting remain strong long after summer has passed.  yes, at camp birchwood, friends become friends forever.

























 









 

the birchwood way

 











spend time outdoors
children are meant to breathe fresh air, walk through tall grasses, and explore the woods.  at birchwood, campers ditch the gadgets.  instead of screen time, they swim in cool waters, dig their toes in the dirt, and run until their cheeks are rosy.  at night they fall asleep with the scent of pines in the air and the sound of lake waters lapping on shore.















discover self-confidence
girls need a safe place to grow.our caring counselors teach girls to root themselves in their individual strengths rather than compare themselves to others.  they shine light on their accomplishments both big and small.  and teach girls to shower one another with encouragement . with every success, girls bloom.















build lasting friendships
camaraderie, understanding, and connection are cornerstones to health and happiness.birchwood paves the way to a life-long sense of belonging.  in our community, everyone matters.  and the genuine connections forged at camp teach girls that they deserve that same level of  kindness and respect everywhere they go in life. 



 











learn from real role models
when girls are surrounded by strong female role models worthy of emulation, they step into their own worth.at birchwood, a vibrant team of women run every aspect of our operation so girls see strong ladies taking charge and making it happen!  our leaders come in every shape and size, have a variety of dispositions, and represent many walks of life. 















acquire essential soft skills
real life asks more out of our girls than academic know-how, success in sports, or hard-core talents. girls develop a multitude of “soft skills” as they live and learn together at camp.  as a team, you practice listening.  you learn to navigate disagreements with kindness.  you share your time, your space, your ideas.  you see first hand, that collaborating is not only fun, it makes the outcome so much better.















celebrate accomplishments
what we feel most proud of in life doesn’t come easy.when girls choose to challenge themselves at birchwood, we are there to support and celebrate that brilliance.  so whether a young girl just hit a tennis ball over the net for the first time, or a teen just emerged from a week-long trip in the remote wilderness, they are invited to stop. breathe.  and take a minute to say “i did it!”

welcome to your “home away from home”.  at birchwood, campers get comfortable, fast.the very first day is filled to the brim with amazing outdoor activities to start everyone off right.  then our activity instructors individually welcome every child to the group and connections start to form.  girls learn each other’s names and find things in common.  smiles spread.  heads nod.  shoulders relax.  then before you know it, something funny happens, fits of giggles erupt, and that quintessential birchwood magic starts to happen.in all those impromptu seconds of joyful silliness - and in all of those zany “you had to be there” kind of moments - birchwood girls are active, soulful participants in their own lives. they are immersed in a kind of memory-making that simply can’t happen back at home or in school.  nah, this is special.  it’s hard to define.  it is felt deep in the heart.  it feels like coming home.and that kind of good stuff, day after day, teaches us that one summer of fun is just the beginning.  from here on out, they are part of each other’s story.yep, once you’re part of the birchwood “web” of friendship, you’re tied to people who care about the real you, throughout your life.












 









 

happy campers

 

“at camp birchwood you can be yourself - you don’t have wear makeup or cool clothes.  you can blurt out camp songs even if you’re off key and wear pajamas to breakfast. every year i come home changed. birchwood has really shaped who i am as a person today.— emily o.  // camper 



“camp birchwood is truly the golden standard when it comes to summer camps. the most unbelievable part was to witness how much my children matured over the two weeks.”— therese m. // parent
