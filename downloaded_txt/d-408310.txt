treo engineering sets new spl record at 2002 db drag racing world


german competitors team bs of walkertshofen, germany brought their vehicle to 
nashville, tennessee for db drag racing world finals and obliterated the competition 
at the 2002 db drag racing world finals.  their mark of 177.6 decibels (db) was nearly 
two decibels louder than the previous record, also set by team bs at the db drag racing 
european finals on october 4, 2002 in bern, switzerland.  led by wolfgang fischer, the 
team is made up of twelve hobbyists from germany.  wolfgang fischer, roger jesse, robert 
schmid, jochen resch, jörg völkl, and manfred burkhard made the journey to america, and 
joachim hössle, peter unterreiner, bernd fischer, schigg gerhard, stefan magerl, and 
gerolf owesle remained in germany during the show.

team bs poses with their vw type iii extreme 13+ van





team bs used a highly modified volkswagen type iii fitted with bullet-proof glass and a 
cabin strengthened with steel, wood, and concrete.  their van tips the scales at 
approximately 14,000 pounds (approximately 6300 kilograms).  team bs used sixteen treo 
engineering csx12.09x subwoofers and sixty-four directed 1100d amplifiers running on a 
sixteen volt electrical system.  team bs estimates 100,000 watts of amplifier power was 
on tap in their van.  many other competitors at the world finals were using quad voice 
coil subwoofers, but team bs used dual voice coil subwoofers to set their steel-bending 
spl record.


team bs took home the crown in db drag racings extreme 13+ class by recording a 177.6 
db score on their final run.  the second place team, team pure sounds of ozark, missouri 
recorded a score of 175.0 db.  in the realm of db drag racing extreme vehicles, 2.7 db is 
a wide margin.  in their previous run team bs had recorded a score of 177.7 db.


team bs won the coveted db drag racing extreme cup. the extreme cup is a perpetual trophy 
that is awarded to the db drag racing association's overall world record holder each season.  
"it takes a tremendous amount of time, energy, and money to build a vehicle of this caliber," 
said wayne harris, president and founder of the db drag racing association. "this trophy is 
intended to recognize that effort."  treo engineering is extremely proud of team bs for taking 
home the extreme cup and winning the very competitive extreme 13+ class.  what is truly amazing 
is that these achievements were possible so soon after team bs first started using treo.  
within these past 90 days, they were able to beat their own personal best score, and then go 
on to win the german, european, and db drag racing world finals with a world record!


for the third consecutive year no treo engineering subwoofers failed in the competition lanes 
at db drag racing world finals.  even team bss woofers, taking over 6,000 watts per speaker 
were able to take the power with no failures.  team bs also used the woofers in the five-minute 
deathmatch competition.  deathmatch is the most grueling type of spl competition and it is not 
uncommon for every amplifier and speaker in a vehicle to fail while going for the sought after 
deathmatch trophy.  team bs did not have any equipment failures in the deathmatch.  unbelievably, 
team bs used the same speakers at db drag racing german finals, db drag racing european finals, 
db drag racing world finals, and the deathmatch.  craig smith, vice president of zooss 
international who handles international sales and technical support for treo engineering calls 
this a great testament to the reliability, performance, and durability of treo engineering 
subwoofers.



treo engineering announces street series extreme (ssx) subwoofers



treo engineering is proud to announce the completion of its street series extreme (ssx) line of subwoofers.  the treo engineering ssx subwoofers are intended to be the worlds loudest street bass subwoofer.  they take many of the same technologies used in the championship winning treo engineering competition series extreme (csx) spl competition subwoofers and translate it into great-sounding subwoofers that will stand up to any kind of abuse.


the ssx12.22 features a massive thirty-three pound motor structure, 3.0 inch dual two ohm aluminum voice coils, and a treo-exclusive ultra-stiff penta-fiber cone.  the ssx15.22 and ssx18.22 feature the same penta-fiber cone along with mind-blowing forty-three pound motor structures and 4.0 inch dual two ohm aluminum voice coils.  all ssx subwoofers feature cast aluminum frames with treo-exclusive perimeter venting and durable and attractive polished nickel top plates and t-yokes.  power handling on the ssx12.22 is 1800 watts rms and power handling on the ssx15.22 and ssx18.22 is 2400 watts rms.  the ssx15.22 and ssx18.22 boast 4 inches of peak-to-peak excursion.


the ssx15.22 and ssx18.22 have been shipping since january 2002, but the addition of the ssx12.22 completes the line.  the ssx10.22 has been cancelled.

ed koski sets meca drive-by spl record with treo engineering subwoofers



ed koski of el dorado springs, missouri set a meca world record at meca world finals october 9-10, 
2002 in shepherdsville, ky.  ed used two treo engineering csx15.22 subwoofers and two u.s.amps 2000x
