              the web space where the catinside played
links to the web portal, the ledge 
              and the edge will be up soon. they are to be my places to play without 
              rules. the rest of the site has some sort of order but there are 
              times to play without constraints. if you get lost there will be 
              a mousemusings link at the top of the page 
              that will bring you back to reality, or at least give you some direction. 
              the weblogs link is a good place 
              to find recent surfing activity.
