rome gained its reputation as the copper city during the industrial revolution when the city produced an estimated 10-percent of all copper in the united states. once a thriving industrial city, rome has transformed itself to a city charging toward the 21st century focusing on the next generation of cybersecurity initiatives, unmanned aerial systems (uas) testing and research, in conjunction with the world renowned air force research laboratory (afrl) located at the former griffiss air force base home to over 5,000 employees amid a mix of high technology, department of defense facilities and light industrial businesses. the city offers a rich quality of life with employment opportunities, an education system that prepares students for college, and a hospital that offers state of the art care, all with convenient accessibility to the region’s offerings. nestled in the middle of new york state, rome is only a short distance from the high peaks of the adirondacks, new york city and boston, and the world famous niagara falls.
within our city’s boundaries you can find history, art, culture, and nature. recreation opportunities are plentiful with the mohawk river trail connecting rome’s waterfront, historical sites, commercial districts, local schools, parks, the griffiss business and technology park, and residential neighborhoods, all while offering a unique multi-use trail recreational experience. delta lake state park is located just north of the city offering endless activities in all four seasons with a boat launch, beach, campground, and all season fishing. the city of rome is the place where families raise generations to live, work, and call home.
