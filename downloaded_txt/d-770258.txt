a word from our pastor
we would love for you to visit with us. mount calvary has been a part of greenville for over 60 years, and the possibility of seeing god's word meet the needs in your life still excites us.
our people are friendly, and the atmosphere of our services displays a reverence for god. our services are intended to bring people face to face with god's word through traditional gospel hymns and expositional bible preaching.
