	 bleepstreet records is back!
	 
    


after a few years pause, bleepstreet is back with a new relocated team and new releases. the label was originally founded in 1998 by johan kotlinski, most known for making the lsdj software for gameboy.apparently, a new batch of bleepstreet releases are imminent, so if you are into "nu-chip" related music this is definitely the label to watch out for the next decade.bleepstreet released among other gems a true c64 classic, the first 7" vinyl by goto80 called "papaya ep". for the relaunch of the label, bleepstreet released 2 digital maxi-singles by goto80 and dr. von pnok, available to buy in most digital music stores.listen to this bonus track by dr. von pnok, a real funky acid techno tune made entirely of c64 samples.     dr. von pnok - atomicity & consistency  by  bleepstreet records//

	 c64 sid phase accumulator and fpga tuning
	 
    


in this video, jeri ellsworth explains the phase accumulators in the c64 sid sound chip. this technique was used in many early synthesizers and sound chips. jeri ellsworth is most known for creating the c64 dtv, the all in one joystick emulator in 2004. she is also responsible for designing the fpga chip of the c-one, so i guess no more introduction is needed, enjoy this master lesson.use an fpga to tune a secondary sid chip to give the c64 a pseudo stereo effect. this demo shows how you can play ordinary chip tunes as if they had stereo channel differences.// more videosfatmanandcircuitgirl.comjeri ellsworth youtube channel

	 commodore 64 sid 8580 basic sample pack
	 
    


via littlescale comes a basic but handy c64 sample pack. the pack contains samples of every c and g note from c-2 to g 6 for the main basic waveforms of a commodore 64 (8580 sid chip). the waveforms are triangle, sawtooth, pulse and noise. the duty cycle for the pulse wave was set to approximately 50%. the samples were recorded from c64 hardware directly using a custom designed interface.//download wav or mp3 sample pack here.

	 more soundchip hacking: realtime sid delay
	 



the norwegian composer geir tjelta has introduced a new trick for the sid-chip: realtime delay. the output of the third channel of the sid can be recorded, and by delaying the playback of the sample on the “virtual” fourth channel, you get a subtle echo. this routine doesn’t use much cpu-time either. a nice and elegant trick. get the exe and mp3 here. it needs to run on the old 6581 chip, since this technique for playing samples relies on a bug that was almost fixed with the new 8580 chip.... read morevia chipflip//

	 new revolutionary c64 music routine unveiled
	 



a team of supertalented coders have managed to break the limits of c64 sound once again.the human coding machine from germany and soundemon from finland, have managed to create a music routine that allows you to have:- 4 channels of 8-bit samplerate, digi playback- 2 channels of sid synth sound- you can filter both sid channels and samples!- and you have enough rastertime to not being forced to turn off the screen, and can actually do something with it ;)this technique has been presented in the x'2008 demoparty, the bi-annual classic of the c64 scene where usually all barriers are broken and this one has been, fortunately, no exception!the routine in question was demo'ed in the production vicious sid (picture), which also included other crazy audio routines you can check out by following the attached link.beta testing of this software will start soon, a few artists have started to experiment with pre-beta versions of the tools, like fanta, who made an amazing x'2008 sid music entry with his tune fanta in space, which you can check out by clicking here.(this is the output straight from a commodore 64, nothing added!)

	 how to code your own music player in assembler!
	 
    


from the uk comes a nice 30min video tutorial for beginners on how to write a simple raster irq setup and run routine in assembly language for the commodore 64, using action replay for a monitor/assembler.this example is on how to write a simple music player with an irq. (part 1/4)//

	 goto80 unveils his secret tool!
	 
    


yeah.. goto80 has been telling us since a few months about a secret tool called defmon, made by one of his pals, so in theory no mortal will ever play with it..only goto80, so, now we get to see the first video of the tool in action and my first impression is that defmon makes the sid synth spit out some data-fire !!! yeshhhh !enjoy the fresh breeze.//

	 hypersid synthesizer
	 
    


i'm not really sure now, but i think among all the sid based synths i've checked out i've never seen this one so here it goes.the hypersid, a subtractive hardware synthesizer based on the c64 sid chip, you control it via midi and also with a custom built vsti that controls all the parameters in the synth. you will find documentation and downloads in the official website.features:- 3 osc per key (monophonic)- 1 osc per key (3 voice polyphonic)- 4 waveforms per osc tri , saw ,noise, pulse (combinatorial)- osc transpose range +36 to -36 semitone- osc cent range -50 to +50 cent- osc ring modulation- 3 amp envelope adsr- multimode analog filter 12db/octave hp , lp , bp and (combinatorial)- 1 lfo part with sync , retrig and invert capability- 1 step lfo part with sync , retrig and invert capability- 2 general purpose envelope generator with invert capability- individual routing for each modulation source- 88 parameter for controlling overall synthesizer (automation recordable)- flexible preset manager with save and load function- built in 64 categorized factory preset .- clean sound without any self oscillating in most of the presets- automatic real time synchronization between software and hardware- independent midi out path from host- very low cpu usage//http://www.hypersynth.com/hypersid.html
