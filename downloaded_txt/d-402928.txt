information
about islay and jura to help your visit.
this is a mixture of information to help
the visitor to islay and jura and for those who just like the
islands. this information has been collected since 1989 about
the isles of islay and jura and their villages. there are many
pictures and many links to other islay and jura sites and, oh

me if you would like help with travel or accommodation. mail

in an exciting development for the site
i am hosting a subsite for charity, the islay
pillaged malt event. a voyage by traditional skiff, rowed
by volunteers, has visited all seven islay distilleries, pillaging
25 litres of 10 year old malt from each. the resulting unique
malt will be auctioned to benefit the islay lifeboat and cancer
research.
see the
history page for recent changes.
