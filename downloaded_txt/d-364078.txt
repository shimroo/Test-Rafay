there is no other comparable product or firm out there that i am aware of.
i have been on the board of a major public reit during its ipo and merger with another public reit, and served on the board for 22 years, so i feel like my perspective has some merit.
with green street’s insights we are able to make better strategic business decisions, which has helped our business’ success quite extensively.

                    green street's commercial property price forecast is published monthly in green street's real estate pricing macro snapshot, a real estate analytics report. results prior to february 2012 are back-tested results. the model that generates the forecast is based on: 1) a comparison of green street's proprietary time series of unlevered return expectations on real estate with corporate bond yields (50% of the model) and 2) the relationship between reit share prices and the underlying private-market value of their properties (50%). past performance cannot be used to predict future results. green street's commercial property price index®, available here, is a time series of unleveraged u.s. commercial property values that captures the prices at which commercial real estate transactions are currently being negotiated and contracted. click here for complete disclosure statement.
