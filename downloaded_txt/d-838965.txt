does this felt make me look fat?



mostly anything that stikes you like a cue ball hitting the eight ball and the sound of winning dropping into the pocket. similar to a light coming on in your head sort of thing.

mccain, you don't fool me





not for one second, you don't fool me. i'm so tired of the same of eight years of the poor misuse of power.   the only reason you men like his vp choice is because she's nice to look at.  what a slap in the face, it's so clear that you don't get it, and once again you are saying we aren't good enough to be equal and that we have to still sit in the back seat while you drive around staying lost and refusing to ask for directions. mccain your trying hard to wear the emperor's clothes and we saw thru that curtain within the first few months in office.  i 'm so disgusted with you and your minnons. owwee........

a perfect day 4 a walk





                   yesterday was just the type of day that i absolutely live for in every aspect. the wind was doable, and it wasn't too hot. the water temperature is still a bit chilly but soon people will  be  playing in the river. i didn't see that bird until after we took the picture and he noticed us, but instead of flying away we all shared the coolnest of the water.  have a great day everyone.

where has all the time gone?





it's been quite awhile since i sat down and wrote anything at all.  there are many reasons  why some dull and some not so boring.  mainly the job i was working at had me so very exhausted that it was all i could do just to walk home only to collapse onto the couch and recuperate .  let's see where i am today ;  first and foremost on the personal level it's been "ten months of clean and sober".  it hasn't been easy but so far so good. i could expound upon the barrage of commercials, (that i never really noticed before) that try to promote their product thrusting into my  subconscious.   then there's my favorite morning news program that is always selecting the "best wine of the day" , i try not to start out my day thinking of wine, and if i do have wine on my mind it's usually sounds like this; "i wanna go to miami beach".   !!!!!                                      ******i was going to buy a car with my "uncle bush" money then i changed my mind and i got a horse instead....**********  actually, i got a new computer and a little scooter. the computer goes  faster than the computer.*********************************************************.  . the cat  is doing great! he's learned to cover his business which is a good thing , the reason that he came to live with us is because other people didn't have the time to work with him , instead they would toss him out into the cold snowy night.  it didn't take long at all for artemis to get it right. i came home from work early one night and he growled at me. he's become quite the watch  cat. \\\\\\\his latest trick is to slap me a high five!\\\\////\\\\\////////////\\\\\\\\\\\//// well     that is about  all  that has been going on with  me  . i could mention big brown but why? then again i could go on about hillary but why? maybe if hillary had taken big brown's steriods she'd still be in the race and big brown could be obama's running mate.

just a thought





the other day while driving around town doing errands, i got a little attitude going because the  car in front of me had her dog at the sterring wheel. i'm yelling at her;"if they wanted dogs to drive they would have issused 'em dog licsense!!! then it hit me oh, they did!!!     i slipped and fell on the ice yesterday morning,man, did that hurt, i thought about putting ice on my  bruised hip but then i remembered that i didn't need to i fell on the ice. i'm glad no one saw me  esp. when the trash can lid took advantage of me and conked me on the head while i wasn't looking.     last week it was really windy here, gust up to 65 mph.  the day before that though i was out picking up trash in the work parking lot with my happy little  yellow cart midget size over by the frozen platte river when a gust of wind grabbed my cart and off into the river it went.  too bad there wasn't a video going caused i'm sure that would have been pretty funny watching me retrive that cart, what a battle that was.    artemis woke me up this  morning at my usually time to get up my bad, i forgot to tell him i wasn't going to work until later today. good to know that my cat knows when i 'm suppose to be up, just in case the electricty goes out.
