“i am in awe! i now understand how our son learns and why he is having so much trouble at school. thank you for taking the time to assimilate the information and to explain it to us.” 



 


happy learningfrom students, parents & professionals 

"i was one of three to receive one prize and the only one to receive the other prize. you have been quite instrumental (certainly an understatement) in my “academic metamorphosis” and i wanted to share with you the good news of what i have been able to accomplish with your help. thank you very much.”

gifted adult with adhd 




thanks for being such a great tutor. i’m not a c- student anymore. i’m a b+ student. well, i just wanted to let you know that i appreciate your working with me all these years.






“thank you for your support, encouragement, and professionalism. you have been an extraordinary force in stephen’s life over the last 18 months, guiding him and tutoring him to great heights. all the way, you have praised him and helped him keep good self-esteem intact. we appreciate all of your wonderful help on behalf of our entire family.”






“i am in awe! i now understand how our son learns and why he is having so much trouble at school. thank you for taking the time to assimilate the information and to explain it to us.”






“i refer students to dr. mannis and the ivy prep learning center because i know that they will receive individualized, targeted, goal-oriented remediation based on their cognitive and learning profiles. dr. mannis is an unusually talented, multifaceted learning specialist who uses her overlapping areas of expertise - child development, cognition and remediation, to design and implement highly effective remediation plans for her students”.

robin forman, phdchild neuropsychologist 




"when we brought our son to you he was about to repeat first grade and he could not read or write. he was discouraged, frustrated, and scared. this week he submitted an amicus brief to the u.s. supreme court. your sophisticated remediation, your supportive teaching, and your unwavering belief in his abilities made all the difference in the world to him and to us. thank you, rebecca"

repeated kdg, currently on partnership track
