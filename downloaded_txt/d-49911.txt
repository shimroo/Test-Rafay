as i receive new information, i continue adding to       fms-help.com, so you may want to bookmark this page and check back now and       then.   only those of us with       fms/cfids understand what it's like to have this mysterious and often       disabling condition. fms/cfids is not a psychiatric condition. we are not mentally ill. we are physically sick. i am fortunate that my husband       understands my illness. he is a great help at home and supportive of my       endeavors (when he's not admonishing me to slow down and rest       more!)  i use various meds, supplements and       protocols that help me cope and function so that i have a reasonable       quality of life. i had to experiment a lot over the years to find things       that helped. each of us is different, but you can read the list of things that help me. i must continue to be       very careful in managing stress (my worst enemy!), and i still need sleep       meds or i don't sleep at all. i've had a broken sleep       clock since i was 16 (45+ years       ago).  you can use the google       search box here to find specific topics i've discussed on my site and       in my past newsletters.

fms/cfids is sometimes called "millionaire's disease" because it destroys our ability to function and make a living. sufferers spend a fortune trying to find ways to regain their lost health, for the most part unsuccessfully. thank you from the bottom of my heart for any donation to help keep fms-help.com online.
