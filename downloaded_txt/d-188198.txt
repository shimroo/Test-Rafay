we are fully experienced with handling home buyer survey reports
homebuyerâs survey and valuation report

a homebuyer's survey and valuation report is an investigation carried out when you are buying a property. this is a more in depth survey than a mortgage valuation, but is still an economical way of learning about a property's condition and value
we will look at all reasonably accessible areas of the building and provide the following:

an opinion of the property's general condition, current market value and future sale prospects
identification of any items or issues which require attention and/or may affect the value now or in the future
a list of matters with probable/possible legal implications which should be referred to your solicitor/conveyancer
advice on maintenance and safety issues
details of matters to be investigated further or acted upon prior to legal commitment to purchase
