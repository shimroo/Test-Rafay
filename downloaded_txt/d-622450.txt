brazil icon megapost #1  


my first icon post in over a year, and it is a doozy. i present to you the first 100 icons taken from my screencaps of the film 'brazil.' yes, i said first 100 icons. i've got over 400 screencaps, and though i likely won't use all of them (and a good chunk are for gif-ing purposes) you can be expecting a lot of ioncs.under the cut:[100] brazilpreviews:  ( we kissed beneath an amber mooncollapse )comments are adored; credit is appreciated. :)tags: brazil, icons

a couple new manips  


many fandoms inspire me to write or make icons, a few inspire me to draw.  exalted, apparently, inspires me to manip.^ meet my new twilight caste from the east-side representin'.  we party like rock stars in the east.  like the delzon*, but without the crossdressing.and yes, he does happen to be "played by" paul bettany.  it's always nice when i try to think about what actor to use for such purposes, and a name actually presents itself.  that way i don't have to go googling around with vague terms like "blonde actor."*or however you spell that.---------------------------------the second manip is based on my nano novel.  i was gonna re-layout my main lj and make it my header, but....nah.  i'm still diggin' the magic butterfly.( on to further photoshopness!collapse )tags: exalted, original characters, photoshop art, rp characters

more earthbound/photoshop fun  


i'm working on a fanmix for earthbound, and of course about half the fun in making a mix is the "cover" art.  :d  check it out:so first i was able to find a picture of michael angarano--from the same shoot i used before, no less--where he's actually wearing a hat!  add a little hue/saturation and voila, it's red.also, i discovered a young claire danes in a pink dress.  i like her as paula a lot more than nameless teen model from the last manip i did.  of course, as with mike, i'm using old pictures, so this will evermore be a fantasy...tags: mother/earthbound, photoshop art
