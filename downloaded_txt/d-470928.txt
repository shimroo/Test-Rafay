menu favorites
in 1951, lon and annie loveless started serving made-from-scratch fried chicken and biscuits out of their home just west of nashville. now, over 70 years later, the loveless cafe continues to serve up heaping helpings of southern staples using lon and annie’s unaltered recipes. from our country ham, 22-hour tennessee hickory smoked bbq, scratch-made sides, and world-famous biscuits, all we can say is that you better come hungry!
