welcome to the new york compensation association
the new york compensation association strives to be a leading source of compensation information and professional development for total rewards professionals in the new york metropolitan area.  membership is open to those who are engaged in the design, implementation, execution, consultation, administration or management of compensation and/or benefits.  it's affordable and the travel expense is usually a subway ride!
breakfast meetings are held six times per year in two programming seasons (september to november and april to june). we feature great speakers from the world of total rewards and a lively, interactive discussion afterward. your membership fee covers all expenses and if you're not able to attend, a colleague can attend in your place at no cost. we are also a local partner affiliate of worldatwork, and your nyca membership can be used for w@w program discounts.
