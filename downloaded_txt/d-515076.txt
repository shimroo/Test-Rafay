our reviews



⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐i am so grateful to tom and jeremy and the other coaches for teaching me to fence and helping me get into college. 



⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐both of my kids have been fencing here for a year. they simply adore coach phil. great staff, great sport, great vibe. location is a little tricky to find, but once you’re here it’s very welcoming. 10/10 would recommend!



⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐my 7 year old just started here and he loves it. the structure is great. the kids have to listen and can't run around. the teachers are really nice.



 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐i hosted a party here and it was spectacular. jeremy and matt were beyond fabulous. it was comforting to see how they handled the safety and fun cohesively. and boy did they push us, it was an excellent work out. my guests and i had such an amazing experience that we cannot wait to come back. it was the most unique, thrilling and rememberable party i have ever thrown. i would highly recommend for birthdays, team building, girls night out. thanks guys!
