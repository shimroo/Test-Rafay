welcome to the
                official web site of the genealogical society of
                  rockland county. the society was organized in
                october, 1985 by members of the historians roundtable of the
                historical society of rockland county (ny). it is a non-profit
                organization, sponsored by the new



                  city library.
its aims and goals
                  are:   

to encourage and
                  promote accurate and thorough research of every region
                  through educational programs and workshops.


to discover,
                    collect, preserve, record, and catalog rockland county
                  genealogical and historical data and to make these records
                  available for study.


to prepare and
                    distribute to the membership a quarterly publication to
                  include genealogical inquiries from members nationwide and
                  worldwide, plus genealogical articles and hitherto unpublished
                  records such as family bible records, parish records, census
                  records, and collections of newspapers and the like.

to further these
                  aims:
our monthly meetings take place on the fourth tuesday the
                month january thru may, and september thru november, at 7:00
              pm in the auditorium of the new city library. we also co-sponsor
              joint meetings / speakers with other societies and the new city
              library.
society projects include the copying, computerizing, and
              publication of rockland county church, funeral home, state
                census, and cemetery records. since our first volume, that
                all may be remembered, written by peter krell was published
              by the rockland county bicentennial commission in 1976; we have
              continued to publish other compilations. (please see our
              publications form for a complete list of available titles).
we maintain one reference
              collection at the

from time to time, we have
              sponsored field trips to sites of historical and genealogical
              interest such as:
the  rockland
                county clerkâs office, 
the  new city
                library (rockland room), 
the orangetown museum, 
  ellis island,
              etc.
 
many of our members also
              participate in the activities of 
the  historical
                society of rockland county, 
the genealogical society of bergen
                county (nj), 
and many family organizations
              throughout the region.
they research in archives and
              libraries throughout the region and welcome those who wish to
              learn how to research to join them. others volunteer at the county
              archives, where the catalog and index record sets and assist
              researchers to find materials. they lecture in libraries and at
              conferences throughout the area, and generally make themselves
              available at society meetings to anyone who asks for help.

                program
 as part of our
                agreement with the new city library to sponsor our genealogical
                society, we need to provide some volunteer assistance for
                library patrons who are working on their genealogy or family
                history.
 we are looking for
                members who are willing to assist patrons with their
                genealogical and family history questions. this can be done by
                making appointments to meet with them one-on-one, or it can be
                handled by mail, telephone, or e-mail.
 a list of volunteers
                with their addresses, phone numbers, and/or e-mail addresses, as
                well as "particular areas of expertise," is currently being
                prepared. this list will be placed at the library's reference
                desk.
 genealogical
                research requests: members of the society will respond to
                genealogical inquiries by checking  indexed material in
                order to provide answers to your inquiries.  please note,
