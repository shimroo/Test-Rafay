hms gaspee and her
                    hated commander, lt. william dudingston, were sent
                    by king george iii to rhode island waters in march
                    of 1772 to enforce the maritime trade laws and
                    prevent smuggling. they made no friends amongst the
                    colonists in harassing shipping and delaying, often
                    unjustly, ships that had properly passed custom
                    inspection in newport. 
the latter was the case on june
                    9, 1772, when the packet sloop hannah left
                    newport for providence. when the gaspee gave
                    chase, hannah's captain lindsey deliberately
                    lured her across the shallows off namquid point (now
                    gaspee point) and left the british ship hard aground
                    on a sandbar, unable to move until the flood tide of
                    the following day. 
upon arrival in providence,
                    captain lindsey reported the event to john brown,
                    one of the most prominent and respected merchants in
                    rhode island, who sent out a town crier inviting all
                    interested parties to meet at sabin's tavern to plan
                    the gaspee's destruction. under the
                    leadership of abraham whipple, the small band of
                    patriots rowed eight longboats with muffled oars to
                    the stranded ship.  lt. dudingston and his crew were
                    taken prisoner and removed to pawtuxet village.

near daylight on june 10th, the
                  rhode islanders set fire to the gaspee,
                  burning her to the waterline whereupon her powder
                  magazine exploded. efforts of the crown to learn the
                  names of the culprits were unsuccessful, although a
                  sizable reward had been offered. public sentiment was
                  in accord with the venture; this spirit of unity soon
                  spread to the other colonies with the formation of the
                  committees of correspondence to prevent further
                  threats. it was but a short step from here to the
                  first continental congress and eventually the
                  declaration of independence.
