								awesome! thank you very much for the amazing service you’ve given us.

								just a quick note to say thanks for supplying the sparkle bands last week for my dad's funeral (especially at the super reduced price that you did).
everyone loved the concept and they really helped liven up what is normally a very sullen occasion.
we had a pile of people taking home extras so they could give them to their friends who couldn't make the funeral.
thanks again!
