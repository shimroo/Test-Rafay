our story
the history of the hunt
he metamora hunt club began in 1928 as an outgrowth of the grosse pointe hunt club and bloomfield open hunt, which both began in the opening years of the 20th century but faded away as those areas urbanized. the bloomfield open hunt held its last event in 1965, but metamora has continued to thrive.
