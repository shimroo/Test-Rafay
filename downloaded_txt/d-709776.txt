c dan joyner (cdj) property management is responsible for day-to-day the operations of our home owners’s association (hoa), which consists of 134 residents.  our cdj property manager is the single point-of-contact for our residents and facilitates the dynamic dialogue the hoa board of directors need with the residents.  additionally, the cdj property manager is responsible for ensuring the safety, security and financial sustainability of the hoa.  all hoa functions are completed efficiently and effectively, thus meeting (and many times exceeding) the expectations of the hoa board.  well done!

brandi israel gave me the piece of mind that i was looking for. since i live in another state i cannot manage my property in person. brandi has been the perfect solution, she is very professional and responds immediately to any concern. she is on top of any situation making sure everything gets resolved on time and efficiently. i definitely recommends to work with her.

c dan joyner have managed our apartments for going on 5 years.   i am super impressed with them as they are respectful to our tenants and clair carson says on top of it all for us.   the company is easy to work with and their monthly reports are easy to read.  plus, they direct deposit our monthly checks.  if you are looking for someone to handle your property don’t hesitate to give them a call.

fantastic company to work with.  our hoa uses them for our management company and we couldn't be happier. sometimes people complain about things that are beyond the control of the hoa. i can't imagine anyone being unhappy with the service we get from c dan joyner.  we have found them to be honest and easy to work with.  i highly recommend them.
