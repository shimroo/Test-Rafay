future home of
                      the national primate research exhibition hall
                      june 4, 2005, madison, wi. 
like a holocaust memorial at the gates of auschwitz, the 
                      national primate research exhibition hall makes the clear 
                      statement that what is occurring in these labs across the 
                      country and the world is wrong and must be stopped. sandwiched 
                      tightly between the historic and infamous harry f. harlow 
                      primate psychology building and the national institutes 
                      of health’s flagship vivisection lab, the wisconsin 
                      national primate research center, the exhibition hall’s 
                      permanent presence and clear voice will be impossible to 
                      ignore.
