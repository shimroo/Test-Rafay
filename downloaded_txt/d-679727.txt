contracting 















caipa places the overall interests of our providers first in all contract decisions. the contracting department works with our business partners that include health plans, hospitals, and laboratories. we carefully examine key contract elements, including language, reimbursements, quality incentives, and your areas of responsibility to ensure the highest possible benefits for caipa providers. 









 








 










 







quality & risk adjustment 















the caipa quality team strives to support providers in delivering high-quality and efficient care. through education, outreach and chart review, the quality team helps providers excel in performing necessary preventative care and quality measures, which improve outcomes and reduce cost. the quality team also performs functions in prospective and retrospective risk adjustment programs, which assist providers in capturing conditions or diagnoses that may have been missed. with outstanding patient care, unrivaled accessibility, and support from the quality team, caipa physicians consistently rank among the top quality providers with health plans.

care coordination 

home assessment 

individualized physician management services 




the care coordination program is a safeguard designed to keep our patients healthy. our program is staffed with physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, and medical assistants. our transitional care management and chronic care management team works closely with community physicians to monitor patient traffic (focusing on admissions, discharges, and er visits) with our chronic and high-risk patient population. this allows us to capture and prevent the progression of ambulatory sensitive and chronic conditions. care coordination is the keystone to our organization, allowing us to keep our patients healthy while fostering an intimate patient relationship. 

the home health assessment program is an added benefit for patients under our caipa umbrella, intended to close the gaps in care, but not replace the care provided by their primary care physician. we provide an annual medical assessment to qualified patients. this service is furnished by licensed medical providers also known as advance practice providers (app), such as physician assistants (pa) and nurse practitioners (np). the assessment encompasses a broad range of medical, social, and psychological evaluations, which includes but are not limited to the optimization of medical diagnoses, medication reconciliation, depression and anxiety screening, cognitive assessments, activities of daily living (adls) assessments, nutritional surveys and social assessments. any unaddressed needs that are identified through our assessments are directed to the appropriate resources, such as case managers or the patient’s primary care physician. the overarching objective of the program is to identify missed gaps, monitor chronic illnesses, and improve the accuracy of the patient’s diagnosis. our service, in addition to our case management, further assists our pcps efforts in maintaining and improving the health of our patients. 

changes within the healthcare landscape have created layers of administrative hurdles for our physicians. our individualized physician management services is designed to unchain our doctors from all the administrative burdens, allowing our doctors to be doctors. as large healthcare systems continue to jeopardize the existence of solo and small private practices, it is within our core dna to maintain the independence of our physicians. we provide a spectrum of services such as, but not limited to, practice management, ancillary clinical support, human resources support, information technology support, billing and coding, and maintenance. creating an environment that is sleek, innovative and modern, in addition to our added services, allows us to remain competitive to attract healthcare professionals to care for the people in their community.
