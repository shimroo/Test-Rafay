advantages of investing in middle keys real estate



there are several big advantages of investing in middle keys real estate. chief among them is location. however, location isn’t the only benefit. the middle keys are a bit less-traveled than the more famous islands of key largo to the north and key west to the south. which means real estate in the middle keys is not as expensive. so, let’s take a look at the big reasons to invest in middle keys real estate.



advantages of investing in middle keys real estate



the middle keys real estate market, much like the rest of the island archipelago, is a highly desirable one. which means many people take the opportunity to buy when it’s available. but, many also do not, because they believe that it’s just too expensive or a pipe dream. the good news is, this just isn’t the case. here are the top advantages of investing in middle keys real estate:



● inexpensive property taxes. property taxes are relatively inexpensive in the whole sunshine state. and, that includes the middle keys. this is just one factor that make the cost of homeownership more attractive.
● no state income tax. one great aspect of living in florida and the keys is the fact there is no state income tax. so, you keep more of what you work so hard to earn.
● strong property appreciation. of course, since the middle keys are a highly desirable place to live, property appreciation is quite robust.
● ability to rent short or long term. another enticing aspect of having real estate in the middle keys is the ability to create a passive income by renting.

living in key west 



the real estate market in key west is almost impervious to the larger economic climate in the united states. because land is at a premium, the market remains remarkably stable, even during economic downturns. and that means durable property values. what's more, it means it's a good investment, whether buying a primary residence or a vacation home. the weather on key west is divine. warm balmy, summers and mild, spring-like winters are the norm. that means outdoor activities are accessible year-round. it also means there's much to see and do. arts and culture in key west

when people think of the florida keys, they think about sunsets, boating, fishing, sunbathing and seafood. but what surprises most first time visitors is the diverse culture and arts communities in key west. there's more to key west than sand, surf and sun. there are a great many arts to enjoy and participate in: dance. the most popular dance troops perform the nutcracker key west--a tropical take-off of the popular ballet. there's also for the more traditionally-minded, but this is one show that has to been seen.

festivals. the pigeon key art festival, the key west craft show, and the old island days art festival are journeys into water-color, oils, acrylics and sculpture mediums.

film. the tropic cinema hosts all kinds of movies. from shorts, to independent and foreign films, as well as modern and classics, this theater has it all.

galleries. if you like to experience art, then you'll love the many opportunities that key west has to offer. the morada way arts & cultural district on islamorada is home to some of the finest galleries in the united states.

literature. tennessee williams was a permanent resident from 1949 until his death in 1983 and robert frost took up seasonal residence in the keys. but the most famous was author ernest hemingway, whose home has become a destination for many over the years.

the keys are a great place to work and play. but this chain of islands off the coast of florida situated between the atlantic ocean and gulf of mexico also has hidden potential. and that comes in the form of investment opportunity. when people think of the florida keys, they think of sunshine, beaches, sparkling water and balmy breezes drifting about day and night. they think about watching sunsets and sunrises, strolls along the coastline, a tropical lifestyle, casual dining and mouthwatering seafood. but there's a lot more to the keys.

health
benefits of living in the middle keys



there are several benefits of living in the
middle keys. of course, enjoying a tropical paradise is just one of them. but,
there are more, to be sure. when it comes to the florida keys, the middle keys
are often overlooked as key largo and key west attract more visitors. however,
the middle keys have everything the other islands have to offer. so, let’s take
a quick look at the health benefits of living in the middle keys.



health
benefits of living in the middle keys



everyone knows the florida keys are a great
escape from life in the big city. but, they also offer more than sun and surf.
sure, it’s a great place to visit but an even better place to call home and
here’s why:



●     
wonderful weather means more outdoor
recreation. the middle keys enjoy a tropical climate which means super mild
winters, warm summers, and wonderful fall and spring seasons. that translates
to more time outside, seeing and doing more throughout the year. simply put,
there’s more time in the year to get and stay active.

●     
laidback island lifestyle means
less stress. the keys aren’t known for traffic congestion, long commutes, and
all the trouble that’s so common in big cities. here, life is a lot more casual
and that means there is a lot less stress in your day to day life.

●     
the climate is more conducive to
good moods. seasonal affective disorder, also known as the winter blues simply
does not exist in this environment.



all of this and the cost of healthcare in the
middle keys is right in-line with the national average, making it quite
affordable.article courtesy of brenda alexander. your best choice for finding middle keys real estate.

benefits of investing in real estate in a destination resort area 



there are some solid benefits of investing in real estate in a destination resort area, like key west. when you consider buying property, you do so for several reasons. most people invest in real estate to gain an asset to use for a variety of reasons. among the biggest is to build wealth and to enjoy a steady passive income stream. but, location is always king when it comes to real estate. that’s why a destination resort area is the best way to go.

benefits of investing in real estate in a destination resort area

when you own real property, you own something that’s tangible. and, if you own real estate in a destination resort area, you have a better situation than if you just owned a run of the mill house on a generic block. here are the biggest advantages of investing in real estate in a destination resort area:

tax advantages. let’s start with a big financial benefit and that’s the deductions and other tax opportunities that come with real estate. write off insurance, property taxes, mortgage interest, maintenance costs, and more. working with a tax professional can easily turn up more benefits that help your bottom line.
more rental opportunity. another big benefit of investing in real estate in a destination resort area is its location. it’s obviously more attractive to people and that means more rental opportunities. because the area is frequented by a lot of guests, you’ll have an enormous pool of potential renters.
higher appreciation rate. because the house is located in a destination resort area, the property will enjoy a higher rate of appreciation. so, as you amortize the mortgage, the house’s value will likewise increase. combine these two dynamics, and you immediately see a huge win-win scenario.
command bigger rental rates. yet another advantage of investing in real estate in a destination resort area, is that you can charge higher rental rates, simply because of its location. and, by doing so, you appeal to a more select crowd.
enjoy the benefits of owning a hard asset. when you own real estate in a destination resort area, you have a real asset. so, when you’re ready to buy another property, you have increased leverage.
you have a dedicated place to vacation yourself. perhaps the most attractive aspect about investing in real estate in a destination resort area is that you have a dedicated place to stay when you visit. a true home away from home to enjoy. article courtesy of the mullins team in key west fl. for help finding lower keys and key west homes for sale please see http://www.lowerkeys-homes.com

why live in key largo



why live in key largo? the question really is, “why not live in key largo?” many people visit the florida keys, thousands and thousands of tourists each and every year. and, they all discover an amazing place with some unforgettable things. key largo is where the florida keys begin but it’s much more that just that. the truth of the matter is, there are several good reasons to live in key largo.



why live in key largo



if you ever get the urge to pack up and take off for a few days, you might make the florida keys your destination. once you experience key largo, you’ll probably start to seriously think about relocating. and, why wouldn’t you? after all, there are some very good reasons to call key largo home:



the weather is simply delightful. now, you might think it’s florida -- so it’s hot all the time and it’s humid. but, in key largo, it’s warm and there’s a constant breeze from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic. plus, the winters are super mild and spring and fall are nothing but spectacular.
there’s much to do on the water, including boating, snorkeling, diving, kayaking, skiing, and so much more.

5 basic tips for investing in real estate



if you’re seriously considering a foray into income rental property investing, you’re certainly not alone. but you must proceed with caution and a significant amount of forethought. while no one has a crystal ball, it’s very important to make smart calculations going into the venture. to achieve the right results, you need to follow 

five basic tips for investing in real estate:



1. pick the right property. those who’ve been successful in this pursuit know one undisputable fact: money is made at the buy. in other words, what you pay ultimately determines if you’ll fetch a strong roi or take a loss. there’s not much in between those two outcomes, but it does occasionally happen. if you aren’t purchasing it for a substantial steal, you’re on precarious ground to start.
2. understand the local market. another fact is the local market dictates what is and what isn’t a smart choice. local markets are malleable, to say the least. look into the history of the neighborhood and learn what trajectory it’s currently on, so you don’t wind up in a community that’s experiencing a decline.
3. plan for the carry costs. make no mistake about it, the amount of rent you can charge will be dictated by the condition of both the house and the neighborhood. and, many first time investors get into trouble by not factoring in carry costs. these include your mortgage, insurance, taxes, normal maintenance, repairs, vacancy periods, and replacement costs. after all, the water heater will break and the house won’t always have a tenant.
4. get your finances prepared. while it’s obvious, it’s worth mentioning lenders treat rental properties quite different. these present a lot more risk in a number of ways. so, be prepared to put up a sizeable down payment and have money set aside for closing costs, as well as any improvements.
5. create a solid tenant screening process. unless you hire a reputable and reliable property management service, you’ll need to screen potential tenants. learn about this process and take those lessons to heart.





real estate investing can be very rewarding financially and emotionally. but, if not done right, can easily turn into a nightmare scenario.

getting financing for the condo you want 



getting financing for the condo you want is a bit different than obtaining a mortgage for a single family property. because “different” can mean “difficult,” since the government agency backing the debt instrument has its own requirements. but, this doesn’t mean you’re out of luck getting financing for the condo you want -- it’s just a more involved process.



getting financing for the condo you want



about 94 percent of the home loan market is claimed by fannie mae, freddie mac, the fha, and va. and, all have their own requirements. the reason for this is when you purchase a condo (a type of legal ownership that’s more close to a cooperative), you’re not getting a fee simple title. 



in other words, you’re buying into the entire community, essentially obtaining a percentage or share. so, lenders place restrictions on which condo communities receive mortgage approval. here’s what you need to know about getting financing for the condo you want:



● generally a higher interest rate. in general, mortgage interest rates for condos are slightly higher than single family residences. the reason is quite simple -- there’s more risk to the lender. because it’s part of a community, lenders charge higher rates but these can be avoiding by paying points. just understand the lender, condo community, geographic location, and more all play a role.
● bigger down payment requirement. usually, buyers who make a down payment of 20 percent or more qualify for more diverse types of loans, as well as escape pmi or private mortgage insurance (which protects the lender in case of a borrower’s default). however, a down payment for a condo typically runs a bit higher, about 25 percent. now, this doesn’t mean it’s always the case, in some markets, down payments can be the same as single family, or 20 percent. here again, there are many factors which make a difference.
● the homeowner’s association fees. not only will you have to qualify for the monthly payment, but don’t forget about the hoa fees. these range from just a few hundred dollars to much more. now, this helps you because the hoa is responsible for common area maintenance and repairs. but it still represents additional costs. your monthly mortgage payment and hoa fee combined should not exceed 25 percent of your monthly income.
● property qualification factors. one factor which really hit a substantial amount of condo buyers during the wake of the housing crisis was property qualification. if there are too many vacant units and/or too many rented out, lenders tend to frown on this.





just be prepared and careful about which condo community you ultimately decide to live in. article courtesy of http://bestkeywestcondos.com/

cost advantages of modular homes



modular homes are a great alternative to site built houses, with some extra advantages. while some people say modular homes aren’t “real” properties, that’s not the case at all. modular homes are as a permanent structure as site built homes and have some notable benefits site built house do not enjoy. so, let’s take a look at some of the advantages of modular homes.



cost advantages of modular homes



modular homes or prefabricated houses, are an option for people who want to build a custom property but do not want to incur the high cost. in fact, a prefab home is a savvy way to actually save money while getting everything you want out of a custom built property. here are some of the cost advantages of modular homes:



● cost control. one of the leading complaints about site built homes is going over budget. while it sometimes involves the eventual homeowner changing their minds and making changes, it’s usually due to delays, the cost of materials, and more. but with a modular home, the budget is set when the home is designed.
● faster build time. speaking of delays, which can cost the homeowner more with extra expenses, modular homes are built faster, about half the time it takes to construct a site built property.
● energy efficiency. another long term cost benefit of prefab homes is these are built for maximum energy efficiency from the get go. 


all of this, not to mention that you can get a completely customized home for much less than a site built home with a modular house.

about grassy key in the florida keys

situated in the middle keys, in the well known florida keys, grassy key is an island that lies south of the conch keys. as with all the florida keys, grassy key has its own uniqueness but still shares quintessential subtropical attributes of the entire island archipelago.



about grassy key



unlike some of the other keys, grassy key is a bit more natural, meaning it isn’t as developed as key west or key largo. however, it’s this natural beauty which makes it just right for those who like to explore and see the florida keys as practically undisturbed. but, this doesn’t mean there aren’t things to see and do in grassy key. 



for instance, take a day to explore the famous dolphin research center. established back in the 1980s, this is one of grassy keys’ most popular destinations. get up close to dolphins and learn all about these marvelous marine creatures. see sea lions and let the little ones have a blast in the play ground -- a water play area.

how to deal with a low home appraisal

islamorada, fla. - jan. 26, 2017 - prlog -- per kim bagnell thaler, top producing real estate agent for sotheby's international in islamorada florida,"when you put your house on the market to sell or you apply and receive a mortgage pre-approval, this begins a long process. if you are a seller, you smartly order a pre-listing inspection so there aren't any surprises. then, you make all necessary repairs. next, you have the house professionally staged and then place it on the local multiple listing service. suddenly, you have an interested party who submits a purchase offer and you accept it.

if you are a buyer, you've taken the time to clean up your credit files, save money for a down payment, inspections, moving, and closing costs. you searched far and wide for the right house. after weeks of looking, you find a home you really like and submit a purchase offer. the seller accepts your offer and now comes the inspection phase.

for both the buyer and seller, the inspections are anxious experiences because each party doesn't want unpleasant surprises. when the inspections give the house a thumbs up, next is the home appraisal.

and, this is when you might have to know how to deal with a low home appraisal:

● submit a "rebuttal of value." a low home appraisal can be appealed with what's known as a "rebuttal of value." although odds are against the valuation being adjusted, it's certainly worth the effort to attempt to save the transaction.

● have a second appraisal conducted. the buyer can also order a second appraisal. this does come with a cost, but it can be a shared expense, between the buyer and seller to save the deal.

● negotiate the agreed selling price down. if you are the buyer, you can negotiate with the seller to lower the purchase price. if you are the seller and believe the appraisal valuation, you can simply lower the selling price.

● make up the difference with cash. another way of dealing with a low home appraisal is for the buyer to make up the difference with cash. while this places more burden on the buyer, it keeps the deal intact.

if none of these are feasible or work, then it's time to walk away. while this isn't a preferable solution, it's a smart move to move on.

beware: five renovations that don't increase home appraisal value

key west, fla. - jan. 26, 2017 - prlog -- per fred mullins, top producing member of team mullins at coldwell banker schmitt in key west and owner of www.lowerkeys-homes.com,"before getting to the five renovations that don't increase home appraisal value, let's look at the biggest home improvements with substantial return on investment. coming in at number five is new vinyl siding, snagging an 83 percent return.

install a new garage door and receive 87 percent back. put down new hardwood floors for a 91 percent roi. upgrade the insulation and enjoy a return of 95 percent. install a new roof and you'll love its huge return of 105 percent.

but, there are five renovations that don't increase home appraisal value and you obviously should avoid them completely. these make it more difficult to sell a house, as well as wasting money.

here are the five renovations that don't increase home appraisal value:

1. a swimming pool. sure, a swimming pool is a welcome amenity; or is it? the truth of the matter is, swimming pools introduce a number of factors. for instance, buyers with small children might see it as a safety issue, as well as elderly buyers. insurance costs will increase, also. at the very least, there are maintenance concerns.

2. luxurious landscaping. while elaborate landscaping definitely improves a property's curb appeal, it's usually just seen as a giant maintenance headache for buyers. instead of going all out, upgrade with a modest but beautiful landscape. this will help to bolster a property's value.

3. over-improving for the neighborhood. if you want more space, you might consider adding on a second story. but, if the majority of other houses in the neighborhood don't aren't two story, it's going to have a negative impact on the home's value.

4. upscale home upgrades. big time, high end upgrades will improve the style and even the function of a home, but these will also lower its value or just not return very much on investment. it's best not to go all out in practically every home improvement aspect.

5. unseen home improvements. while a house might need new plumbing or electrical wiring, these are unseen improvements and do not increase home appraisal value.

another renovation that does not increase home appraisal value is a master bedroom addition or remodel. although it's a wonderful creature comfort, don't expect it to have much impact on your home's value.

how to search and find the perfect realtor





when you decide to invest in real estate, you know that having good representation is key to a successful transaction.

it is not in your best interests to have the same agent represent you as the one selling the property. how can you find the perfect realtor for you?

start your search by asking people you know for help. if someone you are acquainted with works in the banking industry or has had positive results with someone, ask for a recommendation. it is important that the recommendations you receive are for agents in your area.

it is perfectly okay if you don't have any acquaintances to recommend an agent to you. grab the phone numbers of local real estate offices and ask to speak to a manager. ask the manager to recommend an agent from the office or inquire about an agent from another real estate office. in most cases, you will receive the help you need.

the internet can be used to your benefit. instead of looking for listing agents on familiar websites, look for local real estate agents advertising themselves. it is important that you don't just find an agent who is a "listing agent". when looking at the agent's website, look for signs that he or she is just looking to make a quick buck. avoid websites that claim "you are number one" or just ramble on and on about accomplishments.

you will have to interview your potential list of realtors to represent you. it is important that you get a good feel of the agent's habits and you don't end up with someone who doesn't really understand the buying process. most agents who aren't good at what they do will let you know they must "consult" the computer to double check.

a good real estate agent will want to have an understanding of your financial situation and will ask about your debt and finances. he or she will initially use this information to help you determine a price range in which you can shop around in. you need a real estate agent who is willing to ask questions and use your answers to determine whether or not what you want is realistic in the neighborhood you want to buy in.

last, but not least, a professional agent will want to set up an appointment and meet with you in person. a realtor makes their living through commission, so it is only natural that they should care about meeting with you. your chosen agent should behave in a way that helps you feel that he or she has your best interests at heart, and isn't just looking to make quick money. if your agent seems to be too good at throwing a sales pitch, it is time for you to find someone else!

what makes a good real estate agent? most people will have a lot of answers, but the best agent wants to make you happy and provide you with the home of your dreams. always interview several potential agents before settling down and choosing the one that's right for you. for more information see www.flaallwaterfront.com

oceanfront condos

different agencies offer many affordable waterfront real estates to suit the tastes of different people. these real estate agencies cater to the needs of those who want to live either in an affordable waterfront home or in a luxurious condominium overlooking the ocean.

one of the most famous types of waterfront property is the oceanfront condo where people can marvel at the beauty of the ocean directly from their windows. the distant sounds of the waves crashing the shore are sure to make them feel a different kind of comfort.

the views during the day and at night are also among the perks of living in this type of condo unit. the owner can have a better view of the night sky with the constellations being more visible.
the real long-term value of oceanfront condos is a wise investment especially for workers who are planning to retire. the appreciation value of these kinds of properties tends to increase more than those of the average properties in the city.

the market is another thing to look at. people generally don't live in theiroceanfront condos all year long. it can be best to rent it out on days when no one is living on it. this is the reason why having beach condos are considered good investments. the buyer should purchase a property in an area where tourists regularly visits.

it is also best to seek the help of a real estate company in deciding what beach condos are available in the market and the best locations to purchase the mentioned properties. do not be contented with asking the help of just one company. ask as many real estate agents as possible to have a proper view on the price range and features of beach condos.

it is also advisable for a potential buyer to talk to agents who specialize in beachfront properties since these kinds of properties are different from the regular houses found in cities.

bass fishing in florida; a multi-million recreation


bass fishing represents one of the most popular fishing sports practiced today. its popularity has yielded a multi-billion dollar industry unto itself, aside from the business of other modes of sport fishing. there are boats on the market designed specifically for bass fishing. clothes and gears are also very popular.

freshwater sport fishing in florida provided recreational opportunities for over 1.32 million people, over age 16, and generated an economic output of $2.0 billion in 2001. aside from that, florida freshwater recreational fishing generated 19,519 jobs with earnings of $484 million in 2001. florida freshwater fishing provided 20.8 million angler days of recreation (92% resident) based on 14.5 million trips. (a trip is from the time someone leaves home until they return and may include many days; a day is defined by an activity on a specific day.)

bass habitats include a variety of environments, from rivers, lakes, streams, and even ponds. rivers provide one of the healthiest habitats, due to the highly oxygenated waters from the rapid current. in order to fish bass from rivers, it is best to seek out breaks in the current, perhaps from a fallen tree, a stump, or rocks. the fish that bass feed upon will normally school below a dam, thereby making these spots ideal for bass fishing.

there are at least 32 species of fish commonly caught in the numerous lakes, ponds, canals and rivers throughout southwest florida. the anglers pursuing the most popular of these freshwater game fish are locally referred to as either bass fisherman, "perch jerkers", pan fisherman or catfishermen, depending upon the object of their pursuit.

the most common and popular of these are largemouth bass, catfish, panfish, chain pickerel and crappie.

largemouth bass without a doubt is the most sought after game fish in florida. it is the main target of the majority of anglers. many of these lure busting monsters in the 10 to 12 pound range are taken every year in local waters.

the yellow and brown bullhead, followed by the channel catfish, is the most abundant in the area. they are favored by sportsman for the delicious table fare that they provide. also harvested commercially, mainly on lake okeechobee, and their tasty fillets are served as an "all you can eat" favorite in most area restaurants. but it is still the bass fish that promises the challenge of the sport.

every freshwater river, canal, lake and pond in south west florida is abundant with what is locally referred to as "panfish" for the thick tasty fillets they provide. the term actually covers a wide variety of pan sized fish in the sunfish family. these include, but are not limited to, the following: bluegill, bream, warmouth, and the most sought after, redeared sunfish, locally referred to as a "shellcracker" for its diet of aquatic snails. another favorite is the exotic oscar, which has flourished in the hundreds of miles of canals in the area.

an angler needs only to arm themselves with a cane pole and a can of worms or crickets for guaranteed success in catching supper. however, most anglers opt for the ultra-light spinning outfits with tiny spinners and spoons, or the fly rod with popping bugs. catches of fifty or more a day are common.

while not particularly sought after, the pickerel must still be considered a game fish for its savage attacks on the lures most commonly thrown by bass fisherman. they are fast, tackle busting acrobatic fighters. while edible, they are usually released due the many pesky little bones in their fillets.

also locally called speckled perch or "specks" and considered as the favorite of the "perch jerkers" or crappie fisherman that pursue them. these quick striking fish fall for a variety of lures. they congregate in large schools and once located, provide the angler with plenty of action and a great fish fry.

there are innumerable techniques and types of tackle available to practice the sport of bass fishing. for a beginner, it is advised to gather some more basic tools to get started. some suggestions point towards acquiring a 10-pound line, suitable for the average sizes and weights of this species. also, it is suggested to start with artificial bait until the angler has a better understanding of the unique characteristics of the bass fish. the spinnerbait is common artificial bait used by both amateur and seasoned anglers.

the catch and release method was first introduced in the 1950s. it was designed to reduce the rising costs of restocking hatchery-raised fish, and was normally used for fish not meant for consumption. popular consensus does not consider bass as a food fish, and thus this technique is widely used.
