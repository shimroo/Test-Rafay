canadian media manifestothe cmdc is committed to shaping a healthy, responsible and vibrant canadian media ecosystem through the leadership initiative: the canadian media manifesto.launched on world news day in september 2021, the canadian media manifesto sets a goal to allocate 25% ($380m) of digital media investment to canadian media by 2025.  this initiative has received over 1,500 pledges from marketers and media leaders. as a vibrant canadian media ecosystem not only strengthens the economy and promotes responsible journalism and brand safety but also provides brands with valuable opportunities to engage with canadian audiences. supporting local media is both a socially responsible and business-savvy decision. local media is vital to democracy, diversity, and the economy. by investing in local media, advertisers not only do the right thing but also make decisions that benefit their brands performance and the broader canadian economy.
