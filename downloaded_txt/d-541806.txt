cory morrow and
“whiskey and pride”

cory morrow didn’t become a texas legend by being quiet. he sings about strippers and jesus with equal fervor. while this dichotomy may leave those on either side of the moral equator perplexed – the answer is actually very simple. cory morrow is beautifully and uncomfortably transparent. from the beer soaked, cocaine laden days of his early career, to today’s more sober and spiritual leg of the journey, one thing about morrow has never changed – as goes cory’s life, goes cory’s songs – and that’s never been more evident than on his newest studio release “whiskey & pride”.
the record, set to drop in september 2018, is an aggressive blend of early morrow sound with a current day perspective. vintage feel from an evolving heart and mind. the title track, “whiskey & pride” features the age-old struggle of love versus ego and cleverly straddles the line of sermon and self-deprecation. the twist comes in the form of a mirror behind a bar that reveals the true identity of the accuser. the track, which is also the first single release, features the texas country-style instrumentation prevalent in morrow’s early days, including steel guitar phenom and producer of “whiskey & pride”, lloyd maines.
