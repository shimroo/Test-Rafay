the learning process can be quite boring if resources that are used are not motivating. it is as a result of this that teachers are encouraged to design resources that capture the attention of the learner to learn the content that is given. the manner in which content is delivered to the students also matters a lot. it should be given in a form that allows the students to comprehend the content best. the learning management systems give the teachers the best way by which they can present content to their targeted audience.
how can you quickly determine the best lms for your organization? one of the key steps to take into consideration is the features that your audience holds in general. if they are students who do not have any difficulty in using the learning management system, then they will be very easy to deal with. the students who cannot use the system should be identified and taught on how to use the system so that when it is launched all the students will be able to use it to achieve the set objectives and aims of the course being offered. this also helps the teacher to construct the best content that suits the audience in reference.

the next step is to look at how the content will be distributed throughout the course. contents should be delivered in a manner that allows the learner to see the relationship between the previous topics and the current topics being raised. the chronological flow of topics helps students to know the type of resources that they will be required to have at every step within the course. the content can then be downloaded by the students using the scorm player which is an application that helps students to get contents from the teacher under a learning management system.
the third step involves creating a mobile based system that allows the students to interact freely either in groups or as individuals and the teachers. most schools that have used this method have been able to register positive improvement in the performance of their students and hence the general improvement of the school. this method of learning is known to improve the morale of the students to learn. this system is also learner-centered and allows the students to do extra research on their own and seek clarification from their teachers where they have a problem understanding.
this method to should be used to encourage learners to improve their performance. it should also be applied in other areas of life. since the education sector is related to the job market, the students should be able to appreciate why the method was used to administer instructions back in school. this method allows the students to take part in education without having to travel to attend classes in the school. it gives them an opportunity to attend the classes from their homes or places of work. these acts as saving mechanism on both the teachers and the students at large. the students save on the cost of travelling while teachers save eon the cost of producing learning resources.
