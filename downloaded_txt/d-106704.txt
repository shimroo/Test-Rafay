sarah palin makes brain hurt



sarah palin energy expertwolf blitzer: as the law stands now, expanded domestic drilling would have no impact on u.s. gas prices precisely because “oil is a global commodity whose price is set by global supply and demand.” how will you help keep any new domestic oil produced in the united states?sarah palin:oil and coal? of course, it’s a fungible commodity and they don’t flag, you know, the molecules, where it’s going and where it’s not. but in the sense of the congress today, they know that there are very, very hungry domestic markets that need that oil first.  so, i believe that what congress is going to do, also, is not to allow the export bans to such a degree that it’s americans that get stuck to holding the bag without the energy source that is produced here, pumped here. it’s got to flow into our domestic markets first.sarah "i will never blink" palinsarah palin economics and health care expertkatie couric: why isn’t it better, governor palin, to spend $700 billion helping middle-class families struggling with health care, housing, gas and groceries? … instead of helping these big financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess?sarah palin: ultimately, what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up the economy– oh, it’s got to be about job creation too. so health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions.sarah palin national security and foreign affairs expertkatie couric: you've cited alaska's proximity to russia as part of your foreign policy experience. what did you mean by that?sarah palin: that alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country, russia, and, on our other side, the land-boundry that we have with canada. it's funny that a comment like that was kinda made to … i don't know, you know … reporters.katie couric: mocked?sarah palin: mocked, yeah i guess that's the word, mocked.katie couric: well, explain to me why that enhances your foreign-policy credentials.sarah palin: well, it certainly does, because our, our next-door neighbors are foreign countries, there in the state that i am the executive of. and there…katie couric: have you ever been involved in any negotiations, for example, with the russians? sarah palin: we have trade missions back and forth, we do. it's very important when you consider even national-security issues with russia. as putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the united states of america, where do they go? it's alaska. it's just right over the border. it is from alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation, russia, because they are right next to, they are right next to our state.glad to see that the gop was able to succeed in finding someone more unqualified and incoherent than george w. bush.  that's straight talk that i can believe in. ya know?

i will never vote for a republican again



after putting the most incompetent president ever onto the ticket in 2000 and having 8 years of rule, i sought to punish the republicans.  i could not in good conscience vote for any republican for the next few years.  now, with mrs incompetent as their vp nominee, i can never vote for a republican again.  they have such contempt for the american people that i must make this decision.  it actually kinda sucks, because the democrats in general are not much better.  but at least they don't piss all over our system of government.  they really think we, the american people, are a bunch of idiots.  well, i am not that dumb.  f$ck you!tags:politics liberal  conservative  republican democrat

safe european home



it would be hard for me to name my favorite band of all time but if so, the clash would one of the contenders.  i'm also big for influence on popular music and there is no denying the huge influence the clash have had on popular music.  "london calling" and "the clash" are two of the greatest cds ever made.  "give 'em enough rope" is really underrated.  and "sandinista!" is a beautiful mess that would be a classic if they had made it only a 2 lp instead of 3.  anyway, i think i'm starting another of my nonstop clash listening periods.tags:music indie  punk  the clash  safe european home

obama losing racist vote



political observers have been aghast at the latest poll showing obama trailing mccain among self-identified racists, 78-22.  "in 2004, bush only won by 30 points.  there is possible path to the white house if the democrat does not cut this down to 40 points", an unnamed news-douchebag was heard muttering into the microphone he makes love to every night.upon hearing the news, a tubby fatass drug abuser who happens to attract a loyal bevy of stupid proclaimed, "the driveby media won't tell you the real news that racists like farrakhan and jessee jackson and steve urkel support barack obama.  that's right america, that racist scum urkel supports obama."the obama campaign has denied our request for a comment, as has the mccain campaign.  however, we can make assumptions about what the mccain campaign would say and it goes a little something like this - "whoo-hooo!!!!  our racist ads are working!  that boy will know his place or my name aint'...oh yeah, pow bitches!"tags:politics media  satire liberal  conservative democrat republican  obama mccain  race

please kill me!



been reading "please kill me: the uncensored oral history of punk" by legs mcneil and gillian mccain and so far i must say it's been pretty great.  i always find rock histories and biographies fascinating.  and so far this book has been thoroughly enjoyable.  at about the halfway point, it is just getting into the rise of cbgbs and television and the ramones.it's interesting to understand how everything came together.  from the velvet underground and andy warhol through the mc5 and the stooges to the new york dolls and the glam scene, each movement inspired and set the stage for the next.  i am having a hard time putting it down and should have it finished by the end of the week.  so far, iggy is the man.  i saw him in detroit many years ago and it was an incredible show.  but it appears to have been nothing compared to the stooges shows.  iggy was dangerous.  and i know i constantly profess my love for iggy.  but i can not stress enough just how influential iggy was on popular music.  it's a travesty that the stooges are not in the rock n' roll hall of fame.  he was not always the weird old man who refuses to wear shirts.  and this book reaffirms his place in rock n' roll historyshake appeal - iggy pop and the stoogestags:music indie punk iggy pop  the stooges please kill me

do they have any shame?



of course the answer is no.  republicans have no shame, which serves them well when trying to win elections.  especially with a media that considers their job to be stenography, in the best possible light.  so even after mccain's house gaffe, they are still running with the obama as an elitist.  even though obama came from humble beginnings and rose to presidential nominee.  it's a great american story.  but the guy who married into wealth and does not know how many houses he owns and spends over $200,000 a year on servants is the regular salt of the earth guy.  if you believe your job is just to repeat the lines of each side, then yeah, i guess that's what the republicans say.  of course it takes 5 minutes of research to find that story unbelievably false.  but that's not in their job responsibility.  neither is actually informing the electorate.btw, i own a single condo but i do shop at whole foods.  so i guess i am afterall a damn dirty hippie elitist.  but the guy who takes a 9 car motorcade to get a cappuccino at starbucks is not.  go figure!tags:politics media  bias liberal  conservative democrat  republican  obama mccain  elitist

your liberal media



it's almost impossible to believe this is true.  on this week, the dealer asserted that mccain's housing gaffe would come back to haunt...wait for it, obama.  that's right, everything is good news for mccain even when it reflects negatively on him.  it would be challenging to find greater proof that our media is not liberal.  unfortunately, the dealer sets the conventional wisdom in dc.  and nothing will cause him to deviate from his script that everything is good news for mccain.this is just further evidence of what we are dealing with.  it's not just the republicans, it's a good majority of democrats.  it's the media.  it's the corporations.  their goal is to keep and expand their power.  which unfortunately comes at our expense.  so as long as they can muddy the waters and play these fuckin' stupid personality based elections, they can prevent us from getting what we deserve.  it's about time we get mad as hell and fight for what we want.  because they are not going to give up without a fight.  electing obama is just a start.  holding him and the democratic congress accountable to our desires is just the next step.  somewhere we need to fix our broken media.  that's so important but also very challenging.  until the dynamic changes, we will really struggle.tags:politics media  bias liberal  conservative democrat  republican  obama mccain

mr optimism



by nature i am a pessimist.  which is why i am a little shocked in my recent optimism.  i know there is a long road ahead, but i see things coming into place that will make it possible.  a president obama would just be the start.  for this is much bigger then him and will revolutionize the world as we know it.it is hard for me to clearly describe what i'm seeing.  but i'll try.  to begin, we have to go back to see what has failed us.  and that can generally be summarized as politics.  we have been getting screwed for too many years and it's just a matter of time until the pendulum begins to swing the other way.  in this high stakes games, there are many enemies.  i hold the media as main culprit, but it's very complicated and could take multiple books to scratch the surface.  and while democrats are not as bad as republicans, they are pretty frickin' bad.  so it is less about obama the politician or obama as liberal jesus.  he just represents and is actively progressing the people powered movement which will change the world.  or that is my hope, which is why i am so enthusiastically behind him.people powered movement is the word i will use until i can think of a better word.  it refers to citizens taking responsibility for making the world a better place.  for taking control in areas we are being failed and changing the landscape.  in many ways, this is not a novel concept.  this country is built off the american dream and its entrepeneurial spirit.  it is the convergence with technological advancements that is accelerating this into a movement that is rapidly changing.  for technology has made the barriers to entry less expensive.  so cheap, in fact, that there are almost no barriers.  doesn't mean there isn't a lot of blood and sweat needed.  for that's exactly the case.  it just doesn't necessarily cost millions of dollars.back when the media may have been rightfully described as liberal, conservatives built huge media infrastructures to combat this perceived bias.  it required huge investments, which is why the conservative movement is so beholden to the wealthy.  they started it and the whole point is to ensure it will remain.  but that's why this new movement is so exciting.  it's about all citizens, rich and poor.as i sort out my observations and start to make sense of it, i'm sure you'll see posts.  one example i want to point out is strange bedfellows.  from their site:strangebedfellows is a unique and diverse left--right coalition which has come together to put a stop to the eradication of civil liberties in america. modeled on a similar group in britain, the initial strangebedfellows group encompasses ron paul supporters (breakthematrix.com, rick williams and trevor lyman), leading bloggers from the left (glenn greenwald of salon.com, jane hamsher of firedoglake.com) and many more who share the view that warrantless surveillance, telecom immunity and other such outrages of the lawless surveillance state must end—and end now. our group of strangebedfellows is organizing a moneybomb on behalf of accountabilitynowpac, and we’re reaching out to friends and colleagues from across the political spectrum who believe in the bill of rights and freedom in america. so join us-- become a strangebedfellow! add your name and group to our list of backers, and enter your pledge today to donate to accountabilitynowpac. let’s reverse these police state sellouts by our political leaders—forever. if we had a working media that held our elected leaders accountable.  or if we had elected officials who respected the constitution.  in either case, this group would not be necessary.  their message would be heard loud and clear.  but it's not being represented.  so they took it upon themselves to get the message to the people.  they will create the pr campaigns, utilizing different tactics and their personal expertise, to achieve their goals.  it will revolutionize the world.  it is what inspires me, in such a large world, to hold onto my ideals and live what i like to call, the punk rock lifestyle.tags:politics liberal  conservative  democrat  republicans people powered movement  strange bedfellows  punk civil rights

instead of saving my soul, how about helping the poor?



my friend is in the midst of a fabulous conversation with his childhood church.  apparently you can never leave that church.  they will hound you until you give up.  and that includes the pastor and the group of elders (i wish i were making that up).  but i did want to latch onto one thing - the need to pray/save for your soul.raised catholic, i get the supposed benefit to saving my soul.  but that just illustrates the utter lunacy of the god you might recall from such bibles as the catholic churches.  he is a selfish and little man.  i'm sorry, but that's not my god.  and yeah, it's true - my god can kick your god's ass.i'll get back on point here.  while i have my doubts about the existence of god, i do believe in something.  it's up to you to call it god or a higher being or whatever floats your boat.  i do not believe god is watching over us, controlling every little thing.  sorry, he is not a control freak.  if so, there would be no evolution.  he could not be that patient.  so this idea that god is so needy he needs us all to follow his rules is ridiculous.  my god favors living a good life over following rules and attending rituals.  your church batting average may be better than mine, but god judges us on multiple levels.  afterall, he would not be so idiotic and simple-minded.which leads me back to this desire to save everyone's souls.  imagine what could be accomplished if this religious fanatics used that energy on making people's lives better.  i'll leave it up to them to decide what that means.  but i think the world would be a markedly better place.  and somewhere, the baby jesus would shed a tear of happiness.tags:religion church god  soul tom g

mccain vows to bring back touched by an angel



while campaigning today in deerfield beach, fl, republican presidential nominee john mccain told a group of supporters that if elected president, he would bring back the tv show touched by an angel.  during the question and answer session in front of a group of older americans (though strangely skewing younger than mccain), one woman asked mccain directly what he would do to make their lives better.  after some uncomfortable silence followed by utterances that approximated english, mccain finally found his footing.  "my friends", mccain began.  "i promise that as president, i will bring back the cast of touched by an angel under an executive order.  during these uncertain times, we need all the help we can get.  and nothing helped me through the tumultuous 90s better than the hip feel-good show i liked to call touched by an angel."before mccain could continue, the deafening silence overwhelmed him.  showing his true maverickness, mccain quickly pivoted to focus on obama's plan to force angela landsbury to pose nude in an issue of playboy.  "my friends, obama wants to shame america's way of life by having angela landsbury be the centerfold in an issue of playboy.  some call it retribution for the harmless pranks that occurred at the country club abu ghraib.  i promise that as president, angela landsbury will remain the chaste and virgin role model our daughters can aspire to become."within minutes of mccain's speech, hundreds of right wing blogs posted stories trumpeting obama's plan for landsbury to pose in playboy.  in addition, rush limbaugh plans to spend approximately half of his show on the topic tomorrow, assuming he tires of the discussion around things that woman might have done with her mouth to john edwards' body.  i suggest every thinking being avoid limbaugh's show tomorrow.tags:silly funny  politics  mccain  touched by an angel obama  angela landsbury  playboy

dallas lundman cuts his vacation short



doylestown, pa resident dallas lundman had to cut his family vacation to myrtle beach short.  according to eyewitnesses, dallas lundman answered his cell phone shortly after 10:37am while sunbathing next to his wife and 2 kids.  things escalated rather quickly, with dallas standing up and then forcibly waving his arms.  eventually he exited the beach to continue his phone call in a hooters parking lot.dallas returned to the beach and his family, visibly distraught, at 11:19am.  at this point, he began to pack up his family's belongings.  marianne lundman proceeded to tug on the blanket as dallas was attempting to place it in "that huge ass bag that god damn family always brings", as travel companions the flemings refer to it.   before too soon, there was yelling and screaming, and a little bit of sand kicking.  authorities were not called to the scene, though mikey and wendy needed consoling.when asked for comment, dallas denied the sand kicking.  but he explained that his family's vacation had to be cut short because of "some jerkoff in marketing who can't follow directions.  i go on my first frickin' vacation in 10 years and that guy can't fill out a work order with the proper instructions.  dammit, i don't make nearly enough to put up with this bullshit.  thank god for them the economy is the shitter and that i'm too lazy to update my resume."when informed that george bush did not leave his vacation to deal with the crisis between russia and georgia, a clearly frustrated and outraged dallas lundman bellowed, "f$ckin' douchebag!"our eyewitness could not actually vouch for dallas' return to work, as he continued to ogle bikini clad teens at the beach.tags:funny silly  spoof  bush  vacation dallas lundman

fast food mayor declares support for mccain



in a brief press conference yesterday, mayor mccheese of mcdonaldland declared his support for republican presidential hopeful john mccain."john mccain may not have a head made out of a genetically modified cow meat and cheese, but he has my support," declared the embattled mayor in front of crowd of 100 people."mccain is a president who will protect mcdonaldland from terrorists who wish to disrupt our way of life and take away our freedom fries.  i believe he will support my innovative "no cheeseburger left behind" tax cut program, which ensures that all americans can purchase tasty mcdonald's food products."america's tastiest mayor supports republican presidential hopeful, john mccain"john mccain has ensured me that if elected, he will put an end to the frivolous 1973 sid and marty krofft lawsuit, which threatens our very existence. make no mistake.  john is the man for the job."the mayor's announcement was greeted with enthusiastic applause despite the mayor's mounting national unpopularity.allegations of incompetence, the intentional mercury poisoning of fish fillet lake, and failure to protect hamburger patch from increasing hamburglar attacks have plagued the mayor since he took office in 1971.  local support for the mayor has never been stronger.the attendees of the announcement included a fast food clown with arteries of grease, an obese bird who wears protective gear due to flying mishaps, and a purple tub of lard with an iq of 67 that some say resembles a gumdrop.the purple gumdrop who identified himself as grimace was breathlessly chanting mccain throughout the speech while drinking a large chocolate shake.mcdonaldland is traditionally a rich republican stronghold. it was the only city in america, which signed a resolution to vote out congress in protest to nixon's resignation."yes, we identified strongly with nixon," said fast food clown ronald mcdonald."it was during his years that the mcdonald's organization and mcdonaldland in particular rose into the american consciousness.  i have a cherished framed picture of myself shaking nixon's hand hanging in my library.  i'm still loving it."john mccain did not formally accept mayor mccheese's endorsement. spokesperson judy gordy elaborated on the campaign's decision."mayor mccheese is a true american, who is now facing a vast liberal conspiracy.  although john appreciates his support, we can not formally accept the endorsement until the "fish fillet lake mercury gate" case is closed and the mayor is proven (as he should be) innocent," states judy gordy.

antichrist removes flag from plane



people will think of anything not to support obama, but sometimes it seems just ridiculous.i received an email a couple of weeks a go about how obama removed the american flag from his airplane.sounds bad, right?sure. until you look at the facts.obama was using a north american airline plane, which tradmarked the american flag image as it's company's logo. in other words, he probably could not modify the plane without removing the trademarked image first.mccain's plane, "straight talk express" does not appear to have an american flag on it anywhere.flag be missing! ya'll!to be fair in recent years presidential candidates have been painting their planes with their campaign slogans and colors.obama's plane is no different in that regard to bush's 2004 plane, kerry's 2004 plane, or mccain's 2008 plane.obama does have 2 flags on the side of his plane, but since it is not on the tail so it doesn't count.sigh.i suppose you can't expect much from a guy who drinks the blood of aborted babies for breakfast.

tom's post on church got me thinking about religion.  just like him, i'm a card carrying member of the bad catholic society.i go to church when either the parental units talk me into it, holiday, or funeral.  otherwise i don't go.  a couple of years a go i experimented with the episcopal church.i have to admit i enjoyed it.  the problem was that i didn't want to convert. i know conversion is just a word, but the implications bothered me.  would lightening strike me if i turned my back on my religion?  what would my parents think?  could you ever escape catholic guilt?the episcopal church in my opinion is a more relevant, progressive version of the catholic church.  it even follows the same format except that things are in a different order, priests can marry, women can become priests, and there is this odd acceptance of gays.i remember thinking, "you mean these dudes who are into dudes are not going to hell?"  strange. this goes against everything that those celibate white haired men told me.all joking aside, i enjoyed hearing a priest candidly talk about marriage and family matters when he was both a father and husband.  he even sounded like he knew what he was talking about.i know many fine catholic priests, but i think it would be a challenge for them to pull off a good sermon on love and marriage.  sure, they might have studied in-depth about marriage.  they might know many married couples. but i doubt they know what goes into a marriage on a day-to-day basis.  that's a big disconnect.then there is topic of sex, which the catholic church views as being both shameful and sinful. sex is natural and by nature we are sexual beings.  why is something to be feared and despised?  are we not despising ourselves?suppressing a natural urge in order to preach on religious matters appears illogical.  the two are not necessarily connected. i can buy the argument that celibacy is the ultimate sacrifice offered up to god, but it appears to create many issues.besides celibacy conflicts with early church history.  most of the apostles were married and i'm pretty sure that most of them had children too. if they gave up sex after becoming followers wouldn't that make them horrible husbands?at some point in time in church history, marriage and sex became a huge negative. the justification that a priest/nun is married to the church and marriage would strain the relationship with god or distract him/her from their religious obligations seems flimsy.there are plenty of "unholy" distractions in the world.  a marriage could be a distraction, but so could alcohol, television, sports, food, video games, etc...i refuse to believe that there is a priest alive who doesn't partake in some or all of those activities.  it doesn't make them a bad priest; just a person who isn't focused solely on god 100% 24/7. priests are a lot like people.  some like a good drink; others like to play basketball, and some like to cook.  there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of those activities.the catholic church currently is on the fast track backwards.  nostalgia can be a popular retreat, but it does not solve the church's current problems such as the priest shortage, the relevancy of the faith, and so forth.  pope benedict should try to address these issues or he risks alienating a generation.
