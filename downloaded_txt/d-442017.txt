testimonials



“i came into this class with an apparel design background. it’s a powerful experience to design, create and then wear something that you made yourself. there is something so profound about the process behind shoemaking as compared to clothing … be prepared for your perspective and appreciation of footwear to change ...”justine m.



“jason is an exceptional instructor. he took the time to be sure i understood not only how - but why to follow the steps involved to create four different styles and types of shoes, and all without needing to purchase expensive tools or machines. my feet are deformed, and i also suffer from neuropathy, but with custom footwear - my feet and i are very grateful.”dakota f. 



“i’ve taken what we did together to start a career and begin grad school for sports product management. his lifetime of experience makes the education one of a kind.”  woby l.



“jason is a fabulous instructor and craftsman. what impresses me about his teaching isn't just his attention to detail and his ability to convey his vast knowledge, it is also how he brings an understanding of physiology and the history of shoe making to his teaching. i came to him with a very specific project; boots for a rugged northern canadian wilderness survival adventure and he helped me bring my dream to reality!”woniya t.



“i give his dvd 5 stars! finest long-form video instruction i've ever seen. i was a classroom teacher for 9 years. i have a masters' degree in curriculum and instruction. i'm professionally critical about instruction, pedagogy, and method … and i have never seen finer video instruction.”torrey p.



“jason is one of the most skilled and knowledgeable leatherworkers and shoemakers that i know. he is a patient and interesting teacher who always has funny stories and good music playing. i highly recommend taking a class with him! you won’t be disappointed.”becky s.
