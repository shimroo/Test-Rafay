sable enables
boundary pushing research
only sable enables you to measure the smallest changes in your animal’s metabolism and behavior, with the highest resolution, accuracy, and precision. study in-vivo metabolic processes by integrating our unique stable isotope analyzer. conduct cardiorespiratory fitness tests analogous to human fitness tests with our mouse treadmill. add our isolation cage to study mice and rats that are germ-free, have a defined gut microbiome, or are immunocompromised. quantify changes in gut microbiome with our high-resolution methane gas analyzer. 
trust in your data
generate high-resolution gas analyzer data that delivers the most accurate indirect calorimetry values, so you can answer the toughest research questions. you’ll see every aspect of metabolism and behavior more clearly, with finer detail, quality, and repeatability. our unique raw data storage protocol means there are no hidden algorithms or pre-conditioning of data – just fully traceable and transparent results that are available anytime for re-analysis. giving you complete confidence in your study.
broadest range of research models
sable classic line systems span the full spectrum of research models from microbes to humans—and all animals in-between. you’re free to study virtually any animal on the planet. thousands of published studies in peer-reviewed journals are proof of our systems’ high performance in a broad range of applications.
expert support 
you’ll get expert assistance from our knowledgeable team members every step of the way, from experimental design and system configuration, through setup, training, and ongoing support. expert help – delivered by scientists, for scientists.





 

sable enables
boundary pushing research 
obtain a deeper understanding of your rodent model and create the opportunity for new discovery. only promethion core’s high resolution gas analyzers deliver accurate resting and active energy expenditure measurements and the ability to measure the energy expenditure of specific activities. this allows you to synchronize data from other high-resolution systems to clearly identify and quantify corresponding events. promethion core enables you to push the boundaries of research and explore the unknown. 
expanded capabilities 
promethion core’s modular design means you can combine it with other high-resolution systems, such as continuous glucose monitoring or high spatiotemporal optogenetics, to broaden your research. integrate promethion core with advanced gas analyzers for bioenergetics and microbiome studies. add the metabolic treadmill for exercise physiology studies. you will benefit from more comprehensive studies and higher confidence in your results.
trust your data
you can rely on promethion core for your most demanding experiments, including runs of over two weeks without performance loss. promethion core’s performance stability means you can now perform longitudinal/animal lifetime studies. high air flow and a home-cage environment optimizes animal comfort and minimizes unexplained variance, facilitating higher quality data. you will see your study more clearly, with finer detail, quality, and repeatability—giving you complete confidence in your results.
actionable intelligence
have full control of your experiment. promethion live software gives you the real-time animal and system information needed to make key decisions. easily and remotely monitor the welfare of each animal. assess experiment progress through live data evaluation and comparison of experimental and control groups. promethion live puts the power at your fingertips.
expert support 
you’ll get expert assistance from our knowledgeable team members every step of the way, from system configuration and experimental design, through setup, execution, data analysis, and ongoing support. you and your team can expect the diligent and comprehensive training necessary for optimal system operation and highest research throughput. expert support – delivered by scientists, for scientists.

maximum flexibility
as your needs change, you can easily expand and update your capabilities. sable classic line systems and instruments work seamlessly with each other, allowing the ultimate flexibility.
rugged reliability
need a system that withstands rigorous demands of fieldwork? sable fms and foxbox portable field systems integrate the highest quality gas analyzers into a compact, lightweight, and rugged carrying case.
preservation of raw data
your actual study data is preserved in original form with high resolution, ensuring full traceability for glp compliance or peer review. other systems permanently alter your collected data, preventing study validation or re-analysis.
water vapor compensation option
sable calorimetry systems can measure water vapor dilution directly, eliminating sample gas drying and significantly increasing accuracy.
expert support 
you’ll get expert assistance from our knowledgeable team members every step of the way, from experimental design and system configuration, through setup, training, and ongoing support. expert help – delivered by scientists, for scientists.
