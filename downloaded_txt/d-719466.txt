i just recently got to use the keyboard and mouse myself. i’ve probably recommended the keyboard to about 7 or more clients in the past 2 weeks. i’ve also recommended the mouse 2 or 3 times recently. this will continue since i do 5 or more office evaluations a week. i posted a review on cnet and attached the link for you....... many wakefieldregistered occupational therapist




it promotes a midrange forearm and relaxed hand position, and the light touch of the buttons makes it very easy to operate. unlike its predecessor, it doesn't require a significant pinch grip to activate the click functionality.

love the vertical mouse…awesome! many of us at pg&e have been using the vertical mouse 3 (right and left) for several years.
