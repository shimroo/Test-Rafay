at the 11th hour on the morning of november 11, 1918, the "war to end all
wars" ended.  the peace that followed would start a new era not only in
european affairs but in those of all mankind.  the thirty years that
followed the treaty of versailles would see an increase in war and bloodshed
that even the darkest pessimist would find unexpected.  it would see a world
struggle out of the emptiness of the great depression only to find itself
once again cast into the fires of world war.  it would bring out the best
and the worst in men and see the commission of the darkest crimes of
history.  the world would emerge from the fires of war to find not the peace
she hungered for but the netherworld of the cold war.  this is the story of
that time.
