the wareham forge uses traditional blacksmithing techniques to
                produce items of enduring quality. metal is heated in a
                coal forge then worked with the hammer to create forms
                and textures that no other method can duplicate. the
                strength of steel is combined with the warmth of hand
                formed copper and brass, resulting in pieces that are
                indistinguishable from artifacts from the past. every
                item produced, from pewter button to custom railing, is
                the result of a blending of historic form, materials and
                techniques. although often called 'wrought iron work' in
                fact today's craftsman works with modern steels!

artisan blacksmith darrell markewitz
                brings decades of experience to all his work - at the
                forge, background research, practical experimentation
                and extensive teaching experience. 

 
 'have nothing in your houses that you do not
                  know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.'
            attributed to : pre-raphaelite william morris (1834 -
              1896)

 how does the custom design
process work?
how much does it cost?
take a look at the section that details
the process of creating an original art metalwork.
'on
custom designs'

 this section now includes a
gallery of details -
showing some of the wide range of possibilities of hand
forging steel. 
this also shows some of my
favourite techniques in my signature 'rivendale'
style.




an ongoing project over the middle part of 2007 was a
commission for a set of front porch railings for a private
home in the riverdale area of toronto. i have documented the
process of creating a custom art metalwork - from first
contact through finial installation. the resulting
photo-essay can be seen : railings




























for riverdale house. the accompanying descriptions of
the project will be of interest to anyone interested in
commissioning work themselves
