bunclody 
				is a picturesque town in the southeast of ireland with 
				accommodation, businesses and services to suit most needs. it is 
				in north county wexford on the co. carlow border. it nestles in 
				the shelter of mount leinster and on the banks of the meandering 
				river slaney. 

the town has 
				a growing population of about 2,300 and is well serviced by a 
				hotel, b&b's, a golf course, shops, mini-markets, newsagents, 
				public houses (bars), fine restaurants, pub food, a laundry, 
				hardware stores, service stations, mechanics and any other 
				services you would expect in a small town.

it has two 
				churches, one roman catholic and the other church of ireland. 
				there is also a little jewish chapel at rainsford lodge. the 
				town has primary and second level schools. there are numerous 
				sporting organisations and societies. 

there 
				are some lovely scenic drives along the slaney valley and to 
				popular viewpoints on mount leinster. the town also has a heated
				swimming pool
				which opens during the school summer holidays. 

another less 
				vigorous activity practised by some of the locals at the 
				weekends, is to purchase a newspaper and then retire to one of 
				the numerous pubs to study form (horse racing). then after a few 
				pints of guinness and a well marked newspaper, pop into the 
				local bookies for a small bet. then back to the pub to await the 
				televised race. 

anyway 
				if you do visit, you will always find something to do, whether 
				it be vigorous hill walking or a leisurely river walk, or 
				perhaps a tour of the pubs. or even eat an ice-cream cone on one 
				of the seats along the mall (a stream that flows through the 
				centre of main street). see map.


bunclody 
				also has an annual festival called the 
				eileen aroon festival, which creates great activity in the 
				town, with pub quizzes and pub talent competitions, free music 
				on the square and lots of other activities and events to suit 
				everybody. this festival is held about the second week in july 
				and more information will be posted on this site as we get 
				nearer the event.  

  i've left twitter 
				and gone to bluesky.
