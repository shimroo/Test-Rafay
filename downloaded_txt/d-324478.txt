welcome to charm city cards 
charm city cards is an online-only sportscard store located in baltimore, md and was established in 1989 starting as a retail store until 2005, then becoming an exclusive online storefront. i specialize in factory sealed sportscard boxes & sets as well as non-sports releases & supplies. previously released products are added back to stock every day so please check the newly added 'back in stock' category. 
this operation is a 'one man show' so i do it all from order processing, packing, and communication. you will always be dealing with the same person every single time. please contact me via chat, email or phone should you have any questions.
thanks, dean
