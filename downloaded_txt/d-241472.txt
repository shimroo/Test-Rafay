the thought screen helmet stops space aliens from abducting humans.
it's been used successfully by former abductees for 26 years.
this public-service, non-profit assembly website tells you how to make a thought screen helmet.

if you are abducted by aliens, this helmet will work for you.

 


retired federal aviation administration technical writer-editor michael menkin making a thought screen helmet. construction time for each helmet is four hours.

 
how the thought screen helmet works - it is not a shield
after working with abductees for 26 years and persons with neurological problems for 23 years, i now believe that the thought screen helmet does not work as a shield. rather, the helmet may stimulate another brain activity which stops alien telepathy from being processed internally. that is, it prevents the abducteeã­s brain from converting alien telepathy into human thoughts.
		
the aliens tried to figure out how the helmet works but couldn't. they've cut out pieces inside and outside the helmet as well as taken 15 helmets and three velostat-lined baseball caps from abductees. it's 2025 and the helmet works as well as it did in 1999.
a record of success
the thought screen helmet has effectively stopped several types of aliens from abducting or controlling humans. only one failure since 1999.
worldwide use
adults and children all over america, all over australia, in canada, the united kingdom, ireland, india, germany, austria, france, italy, portugal, spain, china, ecuador, brazil, columbia, and in the republic of south africa are wearing thought screen helmets to stop alien abductions. many former abductees have been wearing thought screen helmets successfully since 1999.
only velostat works
other materials were tried in previous models with less success. only thought screen helmets using velostat are effective. large leather aviator hats lined with velostat with secure straps are recommended for making effective helmets but any hat that covers your whole head and has eight sheets of velostat, part number 1706, will work. linqstat has different conductive properties than velostat so it does not work as well.
cost of materials is $45
you can make a thought screen helmet for $45 if you purchase velostat by the yard.
you can make different kinds of thought screens
for photos of other types of thought screens go to aliens and children, the sister site, in the links section.
