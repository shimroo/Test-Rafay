making tooth brushing an active daily routine for your kids



1. introduce oral health to your little ones 
when talking about the oral health of your kids, it is never too soon to begin introducing it to them. the truth is that the most ideal time to start introducing oral health to your kids is prior to their first visit to the dentist. kids also love to know more about their bodies and because of that they like to explore new things by touching or smiling.   

actually, there are also a wide variety of child and baby friendly crafts, books, songs, activities, and even applications, which can help a lot in teaching our little ones about dentists, healthy smiles, tooth brushing, and almost anything that they have to know about their teeth. the more comfortable your kids are with their teeth and mouth, the easier the first dental checkup of your child will be. 
2. practice makes perfect 
 as a matter of fact, tooth brushing is considered as a very important part of the grooming habits and self-care that we do in a daily manner. and, just like any other habits, toddlers and babies also learn the moment they become more independent. one good way to teach a good tooth brushing habit to your little ones is to make it your group activity. this way, siblings and parents can brush their teeth all together with their little ones. however, it is very important to bear in mind that tooth brushes are oral tools and not toys. this simply means that your toddlers and babies must be supervised closely. in addition to that, little ones can also be able to practice all the motions of tooth brushing. however, ultimately the proper guidance of an adult is needed so that they will be properly guided. 
let us face it, babies as well as toddlers aren’t cooperative at all times and there might be a lot of other things at home that a child would rather do. this is why experts suggest that you use the first this, then that kind of approach in order to encourage more participation to your activity. for example, first we will brush our teeth, and then we will play that game. in that way, the routine of your tooth brushing will become a more positive part of your daily activities, as well as followed by a great fun experience that they can look forward to. 
also, there are songs that you can use for routines such as picking up our toys or washing our hands and you can use the songs about tooth brushing too to develop familiarity and to encourage your child to brush her or his teeth every time you play that song. 
if your child is already more concerned about his or her oral health, then you can say that it will be much easier for you to take him or her to the dentist for a regular dental checkup. lastly, always make sure that you only choose the best and reputable dental office to make sure that the oral health of your little one is always in good hands most especially if you need dental implants in st catharines ontario.
