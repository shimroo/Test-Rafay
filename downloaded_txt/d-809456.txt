the golden gayswritten by ryan “oki”nakamay 29 - june 29, 2025aunty maria lani tunta is the free, fierce, and fabulous mother to a chosen family of queens facing their golden years and ready for second chances. what does it mean for a drag queen to be in their 70s, for a sexual player to keep up his game, for a divorced man to explore being gay for the first time, for a widower to date again? these bitches bicker, tease, and challenge each other to move on, and they do it in makeup and heels. in this crazy life you have to seize the cheesecake. this script was inspired by the groundbreaking show: the golden girls.
