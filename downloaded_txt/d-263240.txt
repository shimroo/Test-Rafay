charming lodge with amazing people!
								let me start by saying ben is awesome!  the fireside lodge is a true gem tucked next to a national forest.  while most hotels are taking away amenities, the fireside lodge creatively gives you all you could ask for and more; wine & cheese, breakfast, bikes, paddle boards and s'mores. we were actually leaving lake tahoe when our suv broke down.  luckily they had a room for us during the week for our unexpected stay.  we booked the room with ben and it could not have been a more comforting place to stay after our grueling day.   the next morning during breakfast we mentioned to ben the details of our car issues.  by the end of breakfast ben was actually under the hood of our range rover tweaking our repair, filling our suspension with air and giving us the confidence we needed to make it safely home.  he even offered to drive and pick us up if the suv went down again!   talk about going above and beyond!  we could not be more grateful for his help and assistance. thank you ben!the fl is a family owned business with a lot of heart and good people.we will definitely be back but next time without the car repair!

comfortable, amenity-rich accommodations
								we were blown away by how personable, welcoming and accommodating the hosts are! the included breakfast was plentiful and fun and we enjoyed the "happy hour" with complimentary wine/drinks and cheese/crackers, and charcuteries. so many other extras: loaner bicycles, s'mores at the firepit, large collection of loaner dvds and games, fully stocked honor bar, sauna, hammocks... if we had more fully realized how convenient and amenity-rich the property was, we have booked a longer stay.

our love for dogs
dogs are welcome in this hotel. we never had a dog that smoked in bed and set fire to the blankets. we never had a dog that stole our towels and played the t.v. too loud, or had a noisy fight with his traveling companion. we never had a dog that got drunk and broke up the furniture. so if your dog can vouch for you, you’re welcome too.
