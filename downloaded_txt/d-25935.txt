  cookham
is a beautiful village situated in the thames valley, england. its history goes back
hundreds of years and there are many seventeenth and eighteenth century homes. holy trinity church dates back to the twelfth century. cookham was
the home of the famous british painter sir stanley spencer, who called cookham
"a village in heaven"  and there is a small
gallery of his works which is run by volunteers.
