connecting people with whales of the pacific northwest.

“we are all intricately connected, from tiny plankton to forage fish, salmon, orcas, tall firs and cedars, mountains, rivers and the ocean. it is time to reflect, to reconnect, and to respond as better caretakers of our planet.”— susan berta, orca network



























where are the whales? how can we see them? 
orca network's whale sighting and education project encourages observation to increase awareness and knowledge about the southern resident community of orcas (j, k and l pods), bigg’s transient orcas and other cetaceans, and foster a stewardship ethic to motivate a diverse audience to take action to protect and restore their critical habitat.



report sightings 






 











all are welcome to the langley whale center.
orca network’s langley whale center on whidbey island, in the salish sea, celebrates and shares the lives of gray whales, orcas and other marine mammals of the salish sea. 



langley whale center

lolita/tokitae/sk’alich’elh-tenaut passed away august 18, 2023. toki’s remains have returned to her home.
she learned  before her capture in 1970 how to be a southern resident orca and even after 53 years in a display tank in miami, she still called out to her family in the unique dialect she learned from them. she was fully capable of returning to the salish sea waters she grew up in. 



toki's legacy































what to do if you find a marine mammal on a beach.
