when you try to lose weight and you pick your food at taco bell :-)





hello rowers who are in need to lose weight.i am one of you.  i have stopped my denial of reality.  there is no way i can train off what i eat without killing myself.i started the slow carb lifestyle.  i purposefully use the term lifestyle and not diet.i discovered how i can substitute all the lame carbs that make me hungry for more as soon as they pass through my throat...legumes legumes legumes!!!!!  hear me loud and clear.  lentils and all sorts of beans.  some beans create a problem and some next to none.so back to the headline, when at taco bell...  order a "cantina bowl" and substitute the rice with black beans.  yes, you will pay a little more.  if you are my size, you will buy an extra side of beans, to make sure that you won't leave open space in your stomach. by doing this you avoid rice carbs that go directly to fat storage and you stay clear from cravings longer.  as a matter of fact, when you stay on the slow carb diet your cravings become very tame.  you almost don't know what to do with your chewing muscles anymore.  for me it was weird to realize that i quasi stopped putting hand to mouth between meals anymore.i did not invent the slow carb diet nor did the author tim ferris in his book: 4hour body.  my friend camron sabour in canada simply said to me, xeno you have to read the chapter of slow carbs and you will lose 25 pounds the first mont.  yes that is exactly how it happened.  it is unbelievable.  my blood pressure is back to normal, i feel great.and for those who say, how can you let yourself go like that when you won an olympic gold medal... i have news for those people.... i did not win the olympic gold medal because i live a life governed by moderation.  woohoo, i wish you a great thursday.... oh yes, on saturday i eat what i want.

usb flash drive workouts for rowing machine





finally!  over 80 workouts, more than 60 hours of fun that lead to smily faces and sweaty shirts.i have run indoor rowing workouts for over 7 years.  i loved every single opportunity to lead my group classes.  my dream was always to go beyond the walls of my own gym.  now i am able to do just that.  people worldwide, who use rowing machines for health and fitness  are now able to enjoy working out and learn safe and sound technique.i always begin with a technical warm up by gradually building the stroke from arms only to the full slide length.  i took extra care of beginners because i wanted them to feel comfortable with their new activity.hinging at the hip joint and supporting the lower back is always a technical point that i zero in right from the get go.  feeling the hamstrings on the recovery is key for a strong healthy lower back.the drive phase emphasizes on using the skeleton strength rather than premature use of the contraction of the upper body.all the rowing workouts on the flash drive are laced with humor.  i am certainly do not take myself to seriously.  laughter/fun is a necessary ingredient to bring continuity to a workout regime which ends up being adopted as a lifestyle.rowing is a great sport which can be enjoyed by young and older for an entire lifetime.i am there to make it happen![caption id="attachment_24" align="aligncenter" width="483"] my first day of rowing and the amazing journey continues.[/caption]
