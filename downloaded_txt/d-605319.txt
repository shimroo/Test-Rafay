            us presented ukraine with a document to access its minerals but offered almost nothing in return


13 hrs ago


ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the united states access to ukraine’s rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on u.s. interests. the proposal, which was a key part of zelenskyy’s talks with u.s. vice president jd vance on the sidelines of the munich security conference on friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks. zelenskyy’s decision not to sign a deal, at least for now, was described as “short-sighted” by a senior white house official.




















        

        
            zelenskyy calls for 'armed forces of europe' as eu leaders bristle at new us policies on ukraine


13 hrs ago


ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy says the time has come for the creation of an “armed forces of europe” because the u.s. may no longer be counted on to support europe. german chancellor olaf scholz meanwhile has hit back at americans for meddling in his country’s election after u.s. vice president jd vance scolded european leaders over their approach to democracy and met with the leader of a german far-right party. forceful speeches from zelenskyy and scholz on day 2 of the munich security conference underlined the impact of a blizzard of decisions by u.s. president donald trump that show a rapidly growing chasm in trans-atlantic ties.

            justice department's independence appears threatened


13 hrs ago


pam bondi had insisted at her senate confirmation hearing that as attorney general, her justice department would not “play politics.” yet in the month since the trump administration took over, a succession of actions has raised concerns the department is doing exactly that. the moves have generated great upheaval and tested the department's independence. recent firings and resignations have rattled the foundations of an institution that's prided itself on being driven solely by facts, evidence and the law. a retired federal prosecutor says some of the decisions have all the signs “of corrupting the criminal justice system."
