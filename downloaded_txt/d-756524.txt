22nd annual fitger's 5k





today i ran in my first 5k.  i should clarify...i walked and ran my first 5k.and what a first it was.i've been training two weeks so far for the william a. irvin 5k in june.  a friend wasn't able to run in fitger's 5k and she offered it to me. after some hesitation, i jumped at the chance to experience a 5k prior to the irvin and with the intention that i would use it as my regularly scheduled training run.  i'm following the couch to 5k training program and i planned to start at a brisk walking pace for the first five minutes and then run for 90 seconds followed by two minutes of walking. repeat until done.my plans were squashed though by snow.  yes snow.  we do live in duluth after all, right? at our house we had about four inches of snow.  when i got down to the starting line this is what it looked like.yes, that's snow you see falling.  the temperature and wind weren't bad; a cool 30 degrees with little wind.  not bad for running when you're dressed right.  waiting for the start was a little bone numbing though.  when we finally got going i noticed right away things may not go as planned.  it was slippery.  even though the course was plowed the minimal slush left made it very slippery. i walked for the first 3/4 mile wondering how the elite runners were faring and why they would risk injury.  on the freeway overpass it was so slippery i could feel my toes gripping into the bottom of my shoes.  not ideal conditions for a beginning runner.but at the first mile i found things had started to melt rather quickly.  instead of mostly slushy snow it was being replaced by lots of quickly growing puddles.  so i started my run.  i mostly followed my plan of running for a minute and a half and walking for two.i was pretty cozy and warm until i started running.  after that, my feet were soaked with freezing cold water.  water was literally shooting out the toe of my shoe at each step.  but pretty soon i couldn't feel the cold so i carried on.in the end, i made it in 44 minutes 41 seconds.  my personal best!  ok.  my only time ever, but i did it.  my training walk/run pace is 14 minutes per mile and during the race i was 14:17, so i was proud. :)after crossing the finish line and hearing the beep of the chip sensors i grabbed a cup of water and two great harvest bread rolls.  then i stood in line forever (okay 30 minutes) to get my women's long-sleeved tee shirt. i'm not sure why we stood in line for so long, hardly moving.  it wasn't the best way to cool down.  but i got my shirt.  mary, this picture is for you! sorry for the photo quality, but this one really looked the best).  i got one size larger than i normally wear because they are fitted and i wanted to allow for shrinkage.  there was a lot of discussion in line as to which shirt people wanted (unisex or women's).  go figure.until next time......

awkward encounters





this evening i had another awkward encounter at our local walgreens pharmacy.before i continue on with my story i should probably clarify that as a reference librarian for the life sciences, pharmacy and medicine i have the opportunity to interact with pre-med, medical and pharmacy students.  i love this part of my job, but it sometimes creates for strange encounters at pharmacy's and clinics.so as has happened before, this evening i went to walgreen's to pick up a prescription.  i handed the prescription to the pharmacist and he says, "i know you."  i didn't recognize him.  luckily he offered information as to our acquaintance.  "i spent a day last year in your office getting research assistance."  i looked at his name and i did remember (often times i don't) this particular fellow. then followed the awkward small talk.  he asked about the twins, even guessing at their age.  geesh.on other visits, after thinking i was home free and unrecognized will come the question, "are you married to clay?"  yes i am.  "i was in his blah blah class."  double geesh.  now that you know all that ails me, please let me escape quietly.but the encounters of all encounters happened while i was in labor with simon & oliver.  let me set the scene.i was in the last 45 minutes of my record-shattering birth-two-babies-in-135-minutes labor.  i was in fine form and we had just arrived at the hospital 10 minutes earlier.  i was sitting on the birthing ball making the most of my horse-lips technique.  ferguson's reflex was coming on strong.  and then there was a tap on my shoulder.  it was a young lady who wanted to know if she could sit in on the labor and delivery.  yes.  and she had a couple of questions for me.  okay.  and she was a pre-med student at umd and clay had been her professor.  great!i just can't hide (oh, it was all okay though, because she was super sweet and so happy to be there)
