                    when it comes to birding there are several things i'm very passionate about.  one was doing a utah birding big year in 2007, when i saw 
                    355 species.  another passion is one i've been at work on for 4 years, a field guide to the birds of utah.  
                    and third, i love sharing that passion with others, and do so through various field trips and my company mountain west birding 
                    company--which offers a variety of guided tours.
