from
1954 to 2001 the atlantic
fleet sales company photographed u.s. navy
warships as they steamed in and out of hampton roads, virginia just outside
of the norfolk naval base.  this web site showcases a small sample
of the original photos from this collection, which is among the world's
most extensive.  the company is no longer in business with the navy,
but we do offer photographic prints of ships to navy veterans and collectors.
