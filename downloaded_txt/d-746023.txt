where to begin?

fundamentals!those new to yoga, or iyengar yoga, are welcome at any of the four weekly fundametals classes (weds, fri, sat, sun). saturday’s class is particularly suited to anyone that might be feeling a bit apprehensive, for whatever reason, to try yoga.the first week of every month is particularly focused on welcoming those just starting. just arrive 20 minutes prior to the start of any fundamentals class and we'll take it from there!here’s what to expectand where to begin.
