the tankless transition: is it time to upgrade your water heater?



the case for choosing tankless over traditional water heaters
as traditional water heaters age, homeowners often find themselves at a crossroads, contemplating the best replacement options. one increasingly popular alternative gaining attention is the tankless water heater. the question arises: can a tankless water heater truly be a superior choice for replacing the aging traditional counterpart and is there good replace water heater near me service?
tankless water heaters, also known as on-demand water heaters, operate quite differently from traditional tank-style heaters. rather than continuously heating and storing a large volume of water, tankless heaters heat water only when needed. this fundamental distinction brings several advantages to the table, making tankless water heaters an appealing option for those seeking a more efficient and modern solution.
one of the primary benefits of a tankless water heater lies in its energy efficiency. traditional water heaters constantly maintain the water temperature within the tank, leading to standby heat loss. in contrast, tankless heaters eliminate this energy wastage by heating water on demand. this results in lower energy bills and a reduced environmental impact, making tankless water heaters an attractive option for the eco-conscious homeowner.

moreover, the compact and space-saving design of tankless water heaters is a significant advantage, especially for those with limited installation space. traditional water heaters, with their sizable tanks, can be bulky and cumbersome. in contrast, tankless models are often wall-mounted and take up significantly less space, offering flexibility in installation locations and freeing up valuable storage space in your home.
another compelling factor favoring tankless water heaters is their extended lifespan compared to traditional units. while traditional water heaters typically last around 10 to 15 years, tankless models boast a longer operational life, often exceeding 20 years with proper maintenance. this longevity not only reduces the frequency of replacements but also provides homeowners with a more sustainable and cost-effective solution in the long run.
however, it’s essential to consider the upfront costs of transitioning to a tankless water heater. while these units can be more expensive to purchase and install initially, the long-term savings in energy costs and the extended lifespan may offset the initial investment.
in conclusion, the decision to replace an aging traditional water heater with a tankless alternative involves weighing the advantages against the upfront costs. the energy efficiency, space-saving design, and extended lifespan of tankless water heaters make them a compelling option for those looking to upgrade their home’s water heating system.

how to maintain your asphalt driveway: tips and tricks that work



keep your driveway in a pristine condition
having an asphalt driveway is great for many reasons. it doesn’t need to be repainted every few years, it is durable and strong, and it saves money on oil changes since you don’t have to worry about your car getting stuck in the snow. but even with all of these benefits, sometimes you just want to change things up! if that’s what you’re thinking then here are some tips from holland asphalt company that will help you maintain your property without having to purchase any new materials or pay someone else for their services.

to maintain your asphalt driveway, there are a few things you should do every season. first of all, it is important to clean your driveway off before winter arrives. if your family leaves the snow on the ground throughout the entire winter season, then this will potentially damage or wear out some areas that may not have been used frequently enough during summer months.
if you want to stay ahead of any potential problems with your drive way, be sure to check for cracks and other damages after heavy rain storms or freezing temperatures. sometimes these extreme temperature changes can lead to potholes forming in certain spots along the surface which could cause an accident if someone isn’t careful while driving over them!
of course there are also times when larger issues arise such as oil stains from your car or large areas of dirt appearing over time. these problems are also easily fixed by cleaning the area with a commercial degreaser, applying new pavement sealant (if you even need to), and then finally resurfacing any damaged spots if needed.

strategies for winning in board games



boost your board game skills
board games are a great way to spend time with your family and friends. it’s also a fun and exciting strategy game that can be played by people of all ages. however, there is one problem: some people don’t know how to win! sbobet website can give you some tips on how to win board games.
know the rules and goals of the game. this is crucial, as it will ensure that you’re always playing correctly. if there are special rules, make sure to pay attention during the game and understand everything clearly before moving forward.
make strategic moves throughout the game. you need to plan out what your next move is going to be in order for you to win! for example, if someone threatens another player’s piece or property on their turn, consider whether or not they have a chance of winning by trying this tactic (make sure you know all of their pieces!). this way, you can save yourself from losing points or getting hit with an unexpected attack on your own turn . it also ensures that everyone has equal opportunities when it comes down to each play through.

don’t get too comfortable near the end of the game. many people think that the last few moves are unimportant, but this is not true at all! for example, if you’re playing checkers and one player has only two pieces left on their side while another has seven, there’s almost no chance for them to win unless they can manage to take out one or both of your remaining pieces . so keep an eye out in case someone starts getting too close to winning near the end.
do not lose focus during games. if you get distracted by other things going on around you (kids making noise, phone ringing), it might affect how well you play because it could lead to losing your concentration . you need to stay focused throughout each turn so that way everyone else knows what to expect out of you and how to play accordingly.
don’t get upset when losing a game. it’s important that we learn from our mistakes, but never take them too hard! sometimes it might be because someone was lucky enough to sneak in an unexpected move or something else like bad luck with dice rolls . whatever the reason is for your loss, just try again next time (and win)!

the best and worst component speakers: comparison



which speakers to chose and which to avoid
components are the speakers that you plug into your receiver to power them. some components can be used in a variety of locations, while others are designed for specific places like cars or boats. so which best component speakers under 200 should you choose?
first, let’s start with the best component speakers. the three components that are rated as being the highest quality are focal, jl audio and rockford fosgate. if you’re looking for a brand name speaker to put in your car or home theater system without having to spend too much money on it, then these are some of the best options available.

the next thing you should consider when buying component speakers is how they work together within an entire sound system. there are certain types of drivers designed specifically for use in specific parts of systems like subwoofers or tweeters – which means that if you want good sounding music throughout your living room/home theater/car then you need to make sure all of those different parts work together.
the last thing you should consider is the type of speaker power it takes to run your component speakers. if you’re buying expensive, high quality components then make sure that they are compatible with your amplifier or receiver – otherwise their sound will be distorted and broken up when paired with lower end equipment.
also, if you want to get the most out of your components, then try adding on some amplifiers or crossovers. there are many different kinds of these products available – all designed to work with specific types of speakers in order to improve how they sound.

restore your gut



put an end to digestive distress and build a strong foundation
gut health is a hot topic these days. it’s no surprise that our digestive system affects so many other aspects of our lives, from mental clarity to weight loss and beyond. yet all too often we take it for granted or ignore it altogether. the truth is that most people can’t even name the parts of their digestive tract, let alone know what goes wrong when they’re not working properly. that’s why i wrote this article at https://theswellscore.com/ on how to restore your gut health!
the first thing we should understand is that the gut isn’t just one long tube. the digestive tract actually consists of two separate but connected systems: the small intestine and large intestine, otherwise known as the small bowel and colon respectively. so what exactly happens in each of these areas?

the first stop on our tour through your digestive system is at the mouth! here we have teeth to chew food into smaller pieces (mastication) while saliva begins breaking it down even further with more enzymes so we can swallow it easily (what a concept!). our tongue helps push this chewed up slurry of food towards our esophagus where things start moving along quickly…
now that our tasty morsels are en route to their final destination need some help getting past all these twists and turns. that’s where the small intestine comes in! this organ is around 20 feet long but only about an inch wide, so it really does a number on our food before sending what remains to the large intestine (or colon).
the ileum, jejunum , and duodenum are all parts of this important digestive tube that work together with your gallbladder and pancreas to break down nutrients as well as decrease inflammation. the latter is especially important because chronic low-level inflammation throughout the body can contribute to everything from autoimmune disease to heart conditions. so it pays off big time if we keep things moving through here smoothly…

what is medicare advantage: what you need to know



benefits of the medicare advantage (ma) program
medicare advantage is a service that is offered by insurance companies. it’s an alternative to the original medicare and it can help you save money on your healthcare costs. the premiums are affordable, but the benefits may not cover all of your needs for medical care. lindsay malzone can tell you everything about this service!
medicare advantage was founded in the 1980s and over the years, it has grown in popularity. according to a research report from kaiser family foundation, an estimated 19 million people were enrolled in medicare advantage plans by 2016.

there are several benefits that come with enrolling in this type of plan: you get access to additional health insurance providers; your premiums may be lower than what original medicare covers; if you don’t like one provider’s services, other options will be available for you; and some types cover vision or dental care which isn’t provided under original medicare.
also, there are several different types of plans that you can choose from. some examples include hmo or health maintenance organization; ppo or preferred provider organizations; special needs plans which is for those who qualify with certain medical conditions; private fee-for-service plan which provides more flexibility like visiting any healthcare provider without a referral first, but costs could be higher than the other options if your doctor charges coinsurance fees instead of flat rates per visit; and medicare medical savings account (msa) also known as an integrated plan, this type works similar to msas offered by employers.
however, there are also downsides to consider when thinking about signing up for a medicare advantage plan: certain doctors aren’t covered by these policies so you might have limited choices depending on where you live; the network could be too far away so you would have to drive a bit further for an appointment; if you are admitted into the hospital, your coverage will depend on which plan you’re enrolled in and there may not be enough doctors that participate or they could ask for high coinsurance fees.

the basics of stock options



investing in the markets
stock options are a type of derivative financial instrument that lets you buy or sell shares in a company at an agreed-upon price. it is a complicated topic, but this blog post will break it down for you easily so you can understand the basics and make an educated decision about whether investing in stocks is right for your portfolio.
the first thing you need to know is that by purchasing a stock option, you are not buying actual shares in the company itself. you are simply using your money to buy the right to purchase shares at some point in the future for an agreed-upon price.

the important thing is this: options give investors more control over their investments while limiting risk exposure on any one position. this means it is possible to make huge gains with small amounts of capital if everything works out correctly. but it also mean losing all of your investment (and then some) if things go south quickly and there isn’t enough time or funds left to recover from those losses before expiration date comes up .
it’s also very easy – once you understand how they work – which brings us back around our original question: should you invest in stocks?
the lastly thing you need to know is how stocks work in general. this is how stock work:
when you buy a share in any company, whether through your work or just because you believe in the company’s mission and their product(s), what happens is that you are buying an ownership stake in the company. as part of this agreement, by owning shares (whether one or many) it means you will be entitled to receive dividends if they become available. dividends are basically like getting paid for being patient with your investment; let companies pay their investors when they can afford it instead of borrowing money from banks or other institutions who often charge high rates during times where growth isn’t at its best (or worse case scenario: not growing at all).

questions patients want to ask dentists



how to maintain oral hygiene
what is the most effective way to brush?
how often should i visit a dentist for maintenance and cleaning?
does sugar really rot your teeth or does it just stain them?
the american dental association (ada) recommends brushing at least twice daily, flossing once per day, and seeing your dental hygienist for regular checkups every six months. we recommend starting good oral hygiene habits early by brushing baby’s gums when you begin brushing your own teeth; this helps baby get used to having their mouth cleaned regularly. some patients worry that the fluoride in toothpaste can be harmful but studies have shown no link between higher doses of fluoride consumption through drinking water and adverse health effects. with that being said, we do not recommend brushing your teeth with fluoridated tap water. many people are concerned about the sugar in their diet but remember this: all foods will cause some damage to your teeth over time; nothing is off limits! the more you brush and floss after eating sugary food or drinks, however, the less damage they will have on your smile. sugar does discolor your enamel but it won’t rot or erode away any of that precious tooth structure unless you let an infection fester inside those pearly whites for too long without seeking treatment from a dentist.

what if i am anxious during my visit?
is there anything i can do at home before visiting a dental office?
if you are anxious about your upcoming appointment, talk to the office staff. they will gladly provide sedatives or mild numbing agents (to be taken orally) if needed before an exam/procedure; no prior orders necessary! if you’re looking for ways to keep on top of oral hygiene between appointments with a dental hygienist, try adding some mouthwash and flossing into your daily routine as well as using fluoride toothpaste. this is especially important if you suffer from anxiety surrounding dental care because keeping up good at-home habits can help reduce some stress when it comes time for professional cleanings every six months. we also recommend trying out sonicare electric toothbrush which has been clinically proven to remove plaque.

integrating stripe into clickfunnels: proven strategies to build your business



using stripe to accept payments using clickfunnels
if you’re a business owner, there’s no doubt that you’ve heard of clickfunnels. it’s one of the most powerful tools on the market when it comes to funnel building and conversion optimization. but what if i told you that clickfunnels could do even more for your business? what if i told you that by integrating stripe into clickfunnels, you can automate many of your processes and save time managing payments?
while a lot has been written on what is included in each plan when using stripe as payment option, one important thing that may not be obvious is losses due to fraud or chargebacks & customer refunds. the reason why these costs should matter more than ever before by choosing stripe integration over other online options is because most companies will give you a significant discount if you use stripe.

for instance, paypal will charge you $30 per month for the basic plan and another $30 per month for the pro plan. that’s a total of $60/month in fees! this is on top of all your subscription setup costs that are associated with using their payment platform such as monthly gateway processing fees etc.
but what about other alternative options like direct checkout? if you want to save money by choosing this option over stripe integration , it would be wise to choose amazon payments instead because they only cost around 35 cents + 0% fee every time someone makes a purchase on your website or funnel hosted via clickfunnels . but even then, there may be some additional costs depending upon the country you do business in.
so when you consider the time & money you could save by using this seamless payment option inside of your business, integrating stripe into clickfunnels makes more sense than any other payment processing platform . not only that but by doing so, not only are you saving money on fees-but also gaining access to all sorts of valuable data about your customers at checkout such as email marketing campaigns (i.e., abandoned cart emails).

why you should hire movers instead of moving yourself



hiring movers can help you move
so, you’re thinking about moving yourself. you’ve got the time, and it’s a good way to save some money. but before you make this decision, consider these reasons why hiring movers may be your best option:
hiring professional movers means that all of the heavy lifting is done for you! movers have the knowledge and experience to pack your entire house in a matter of hours compared to days on your own. check them out and see how they can make your move much easier!
moving costs will vary depending on how much stuff you have and what distance needs to be traveled but average around $30 per hour or $100 per man hour.
packing a box takes under five minutes, but if you have hundreds of boxes, the time adds up quickly.

movers can provide wardrobe boxes to hold hangers and keep your clothes organized while they are in transit. moving yourself means unnecessary physical labor. hiring moving professionals is cost effective when compared with all of the costs that come along with doing it on your own: gas money for multiple trips between residences; rental trucks or u-hauls; having friends help out; hiring laborers to get everything done faster which requires spending more money than originally budgeted.
hiring a moving company is the most stress-free option for you. you can sit back and relax as they take care of everything, or you could spend your time worrying about how to pack boxes efficiently, hiring laborers if needed and purchasing supplies necessary to complete the packing process such as tape, markers and paper so that all boxes are labeled properly.
finally, hiring movers will help you stay on schedule. they know how to pack and load your items quickly so that they can be unloaded at the new house in time for you to unpack everything before the end of the day.
whether or not this decision ends up being best for you ultimately depends upon what your goals are as well as what kind of budget/time frame you have set aside for moving. in any case, make sure that if one option does sound better than another that’s because it truly fits into your lifestyle rather than just like a good idea!

how much does it cost to hire a private bodyguard?



is hiring a private bodyguard expensive?
the question of how much does it cost to hire a private bodyguard london is one that many people ask themselves when they are in need of protection. private bodyguards can be hired for any number of reasons, and the price will vary depending on what you’re looking for.
in order to find out how much it costs, you should have a conversation with your security company of choice. the first thing they will ask is if you want armed or unarmed protection; this could affect the price significantly depending on what kind of weapon you’re looking for (a handgun vs assault rifle).
once that has been determined, then there are some things that will cost extra and others that can be included in the base package. these include: 24/hour coverage, transportation services (limo or private plane), personal assistants, professional bodyguards with prior military experience, etc. there are also some common-sense restrictions such as no bringing large weapons into public places where firearms are not permitted (e.g., planes, certain restaurants, banks).

some people are even hiring bodyguards to protect their homes and family members when they aren’t around. this can be especially helpful during a divorce or custody battle where the threat of violence is very real. even celebrities hire security guards for protection in high-risk areas of california such as beverly hills. if you’re looking for more information on how much does it cost to hire a private bodyguard, then contact your preferred company today!
if you’re a high-profile person or you’re in an unusually dangerous profession, then a security company will usually insist that your bodyguard be armed. a heavy holster is not the most comfortable thing to wear all day long and it can make certain outfits look ridiculous (not to mention how awkward it would be to go through airport security). but when your life may depend on having protection nearby at any given moment, there’s really no other option worth considering.

search for jobs: find moving jobs



finding jobs: how to get a move on
do you see yourself as a master mover? if so, maybe you should try to find moving jobs!
why should i work in the moving industry? the moving industry is one of the few industries where you can truly earn more than a living wage. there are also many benefits to working in this sector, such as: flexible hours and schedules allow for work/life balance, workers tend to experience less stress than workers in other fields, training available through specialized schools or on the job training programs (provided by company) that will give people with no background knowledge about how to move things around an opportunity to learn skills necessary for the field, and no formal education required; some companies offer apprenticeship positions so all you need is ambition!
how do i get hired by a moving company? you can start by looking for a job board on the internet. you can also do some research into what moving companies are in your area, and find out where they post jobs or if you have any connections to people who work at these organizations, ask them about available positions

is there anything else i should know? it’s important to note that not all movers receive the same pay rates. if you’re working with an established company like “movers inc.” then it might be more difficult to get paid well than if you were working with another organization because of the sheer number of employees (and therefore workers)
what are some of the most common requirements on moving job applications? there are no formal requirements for a moving job application, all you need is an idea of the skills necessary to do the job and some basic knowledge about what’s involved with this line of work.
what are some common issues workers in the moving industry might face? workers in these fields can experience injuries from repetitive lifting or other strenuous tasks, be exposed to bad weather (especially when working outside), as well as possible theft-related incidents due to being on site while people are unloading items into their new residence. there could also be issues related to workplace harassment if there aren’t enough supervisors around who have been properly trained and certified

how to get rid of pests: tips and tricks



pest-repelling tips to keep mice, rats, and bugs at bay
pests are a nuisance and can be difficult to get rid of unless you hire pest control columbia sc. they come in many different shapes and sizes, but the most notable pests are cockroaches, ants, termites, beetles, spiders and rodents. these creatures not only make your house look dirty with their presence but also cause damage as well.
tips to get rid of pests: clean up areas where food is stored and make sure that the house stays clean. ants, cockroaches, beetles and spiders all love a dirty environment.
store dry foods in containers with lids or sealable bags. make sure there are no cracks in the plastic so they can’t chew through it as well. spiders sometimes come out at night looking for their next meal; don’t leave your pantry door open when you sleep! keep dried herbs on high shelving if possible and try not to walk above them since this may bring bugs into the kitchen from outdoors .

seal any openings outside like pipes, doors, windows or vents with caulk or heavy-duty insect screen. make sure to seal any holes in the foundation as well.
use a vacuum cleaner with a hepa filter or wet mop and bucket for your house .
keep food items stored in containers which can be sealed tightly, like tupperware.
seal cracks around windows and doors inside and outside of the home. termites will use these to enter buildings undetected so they should always be fixed immediately.
put fly screens on all openable windows (excluding kitchen window). once you have done this it is important that you clean them every week.
spray all surfaces where pests are likely to gather with an appropriate spray product such as raid ant & roach killer or dustmite barrier aerosol.

home reversion plan: thinking about what the future of your home may look like?



home reversion plan explained
we all know that things change. people grow older, they get married, have kids, and move to new cities for work. as life changes, so do family dynamics. one of the most important decisions you can make in regards to your home is what will happen with it once you’re gone or no longer able to maintain it.
the home reversion plan is a way of releasing equity and a legal document that provides instructions on what should happen to your home once you’re no longer able to take care of it. it’s an important way for you and your family members to plan ahead for their future, and can help avoid or alleviate conflicts about the distribution of property after death when things get complicated.
homeowners have three choices – keep ownership in one person, distribute assets equally among heirs; turn over the house eventually back into the hands of a relative or friend (or sell it); let someone else own the home outright with some agreement as to how much they will pay each year in rent until there are enough funds saved up from rental income.

also, you can put a time limit on the home reversion plan, so that it goes into effect at a certain date or after your death.
the first step is sitting down and discussing these issues with family members; evaluate who’s in the best position to take care of things, both financially as well as emotionally; and decide which option makes sense given their age and experiences in life. your estate plan should include this conversation, along with any documents necessary to carry out each option outlined above (e.g., beneficiary designation forms). if there are disagreements about some aspect of the decision, an attorney may be able to help you and your family come to a resolution.
the idea of home reversion plan is that when the time comes, there will be few surprises – it’s all been talked about ahead of time with close friends and loved ones so that everyone can make their own peace with what lies in store for them.

data sourcing: where to find, what to avoid



the science and practicalities
data is a valuable commodity. collecting it, analyzing it, and using it to generate insights is the key to success in any field. but data can be tricky: where do you find data? who should you trust with your data? where can you get reliable information about who owns what data? and how can you avoid getting duped by fake or incomplete datasets? this datasourcehub tackles these questions and more!
data is the lifeblood of any well-informed organization. it powers everything from marketing strategies to building products and services, but it’s also an incredibly difficult resource to find. sourcing data can be even more challenging than finding a good infographic: everyone has their own version or interpretation of information that they claim is accurate! with this in mind, here are seven tips for sourcing high-quality datasets.

the first rule for finding data is to do your research: understand the purpose of the dataset, who collected it and where you can find it. is a particular source known for high-quality or credible information? can you trust their process in collecting this particular type of data? if not, what sources might be better suited to provide accurate results?
many people assume that all open datasets are free – but others argue that publically available does not automatically equal public domain. this means that while some organizations may share information freely online (like github), other organizations require payment before they will release any kind of dataset (like amazon). it’s important to note which companies fall into each category so as not to get scammed!

pros and cons of bluesnap



things to consider when choosing a bluesnap
bluesnap is a service that helps you automate the process of sending out bulk emails. it can be used for marketing, customer retention, and more. bluesnap works by allowing customers to create email templates with images and text in an easy drag-and-drop interface. there are some pros and cons to using bluesnap depending on your business needs.
pros: bluesnap offers a free version, which is great for small businesses. the paid versions are quite affordable too and they have an amazing customer service team that will help you out if needed. you can use the email templates to send marketing emails without having to worry about what goes where in html code or dealing with css overrides on your own. plus, it’s easy to create attachments using drag-and-drop rather than typing everything by hand. also, bluesnap is perfect for small businesses who have done everything themselves up until this point.

cons: bluesnap doesn’t allow you to do much customization of the templates themselves beyond changing text colors and fonts–you can’t add images or change how different sections appear on the template page itself (though these features may be added as time goes). another down side is that bluesnap doesn’t allow you to use your own email address without signing up for the paid version which can get a little pricey. it’s also worth noting that there are limits on the number of emails you can send per day with a free account (250), so it might not work as well for companies in high-demand industries where customer retention is key.
in conclusion, bluesnap is a great service for small businesses that want to send out bulk emails without having to know html code and css overrides.

funerals: how to buy a funeral home



enter a funeral home business now
funeral homes are expensive, funeral home financing, and buying one is a big commitment. but if you’re considering the purchase of a funeral home or crematorium, there are some things you should know before making your decision.
when considering how much money you’ll need to invest in order to own your own funeral home, consider these expenses:
the down payment on the funeral home. this is usually around 50% of the total price. funeral homes can be purchased for as low as $40k and costs up to $750k+ depending on location and condition.
income tax deductions may lower your monthly payments by about 30%. however, this depends entirely on what you’ve been paying in taxes prior to buying a funeral home so it’s best not to count on it if you’re just starting out with no previous income history. if you are able to deduct anything from your federal or state taxes after purchasing a business then yes – investing money now will have greater benefits than waiting until later in life when more time has passed without record of tax deductions.

the cost of actually buying a funeral home can be anywhere from $100k to upwards of $750,000 depending on location and condition – this doesn’t include the down payment.
business licenses are another expense that you’ll need in order to start your own business as you will require certain permits and zoning requirements by law for any funeral homes purchased or built after 1992. licenses usually costs around $500 per year but prices vary depending on the licensing authority where you live so make sure do some research first before making an investment decision without all relevant information.
when considering how much money is needed in order to buy a funeral home, it’s really important not just focus solely on one aspect such as earnings potential because there are a lot of factors to consider. income potential is great but what about the cost? what’s your tax liability like now vs. later in life and how much does it vary state-by-state? is there anything you have to spend money on before buying a funeral home such as business licenses or permits, down payment, taxes – all of which can be costly so do some research first!

what does a realtor do?



all you need to know about real estate agents
what is your greatest ambition in life? to find the perfect home to settle down with your family? or perhaps you are thinking about starting a new business and need some extra space. whatever it may be, real estate agents can help you achieve that goal!
a realtor is someone who sells or rents homes or other properties for a living. they are also known as “agents.” the term “realtor” is often used in the united states and canada.
you can save time not having to look for properties on your own, because they already have listings of homes that you might be interested in. this also saves you from spending hours going through home listings online or driving around trying to find houses with open doors during showings.

some people are uncomfortable negotiating and making decisions about buying property themselves, so an agent will do it for them! they know how much things cost, what’s fair market value, and other important information like this which would take someone without experience (like yourself) quite some time researching on their own. realtors are trained and knowledgeable about real estate and the responsibilities of being a property owner.
if you are planning on selling your home, then agents will help you list it for sale in order to get potential buyers interested in what you have! they know how to price properties competitively so that they can sell faster than other homes available on the market. you’ll need an agent’s help if you want to negotiate offers from different parties or even give advice about making improvements to make your house more appealing to buyers.

window dressing: different types of curtains



how to choose them
curtains can make a huge difference in the look and feel of your home. they come in all shapes, sizes, colors, textures and patterns. choosing the right curtains for your windows is no easy task! in this blog made to measure curtains will discuss different types of curtains and how to choose them based on what you are looking for.
* sheer curtains are lightweight and great for letting light into your home. they do not block the view from the outside, but they still provide privacy because it is hard to see through them. these types of curtains can be a good option if you like natural lighting in your home or have floor-to-ceiling windows that need covering up.

* panel curtains come with different widths and lengths so that you can choose whichever one will fit best on your window frame (or curtain rod). if you want something decorative as well as functional then opt for patterned panel curtains, which also offer privacy even though they let more light in than sheer panels would.
* tab top curtains have two pieces: one piece hangs down from the top and one piece that attaches to the tab at the bottom. they offer privacy, light control, and decorative value for your windows because you can choose from different patterns or colors without having to buy a whole new set of curtains.
* roman blinds are perfect if you want something functional as well as beautiful in your home – they block out most light while still offering a view outside through their slats or gaps between each panel. these types of curtains work best on big windows since there is usually only one hanging down from above rather than multiple panels hanging side-by-side like with other styles listed here (so it will take up less space).

association of naval aviation



ana is the united states navy’s official charity, providing financial support and assistance to active duty and retired naval aviators. incorporated in 1956 as a 501(c)(3), ana manages an annual giving program of over $1.5 million (2010).
the principal activity is fundraising for the long-term capital needs of naval air station pensacola including the combat readiness training center (crtc) and the national museum of naval aviation (nma). the association also provides scholarships to naval aviation cadets graduating from afa-209 at nas pensacola; assists injured/ill aviators with monetary grants; furnishes recreational equipment and supplies to patients at the walter reed army medical center, washington, dc; and furnishes recreational equipment to disabled children at the naval hospital pensacola. additionally, ana provides funding for aviation-related programs of other major commands, installations, and activities to preserve a strong heritage and promote esprit de corps.
based on an agreement between the united states navy bureau of personnel and members of the ana the board authorized the establishment of six subordinate chapters: the west coast region; chicago region; southeast region; norfolk region; hawaii region, and the gulf coast region. the west coast chapter has since been disestablished and is no longer part of ana.
board members are designated by the commanding officer, naval air training & operating procedures standardization (natops), or his/her designee to serve as chapter representatives for each region in which they have significant contacts. with this exception, board membership is voluntary. board members may be active-duty officers or former navy jet pilots who served on active duty before 1 july 1962, with a minimum of 14 years of service. designated chapter representatives must be eligible for the position of commander or lieutenant commander to qualify for board membership.
each year in june, each chapter elects its leadership consisting of a president, first vice president (who is also the regional director), treasurer, and secretary. the regional directors have not been elected since 2000.
the ana board consists of six officers: president, past-president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer; each officer may be an active or retired naval aviator who served on active duty before july 1962 with a minimum of 14 years service. designated chapter representatives must be eligible for the position of commander or lieutenant commander to qualify for board membership. these will total twenty-three people including three alternates for positions held by navy jet pilots.
active representatives serve two-year terms while those designated from the retired community serve three-year terms. if any member of the board fails to fulfill his/her responsibilities, the secretary will send a written notice to that effect. the letter will formally ask for resignation and if not received within fourteen days of mailing, the administrative committee may vote removal from office by concurrence vote.
the primary event held by ana each year is our annual banquet which is held in late may or early june at naval air facility washington-dulles (formerly andrews afb). held since 1959, it is attended by 1000s of aviation enthusiasts from around the world as well as navy jet pilots and their families. activities have included business meetings; recognition dinners for naval aviators with long service records spanning over fifty years; reunions hosted by chapters in major cities; association with other organizations including the navy league, vfw, and american legion; aviation awards ceremonies honoring distinguished chapters and individuals for outstanding achievements in naval aviation.
