    bradford city water authority 
watershed and reservoirs
the
    bradford city water authority has three (3) surface water reservoirs that
    serve the bradford water system. the marilla and gilbert reservoirs are
    open to public use. recreational activities such as trail walking/hiking,
    canoeing/kayaking, and fishing are permitted at our marilla reservoir and
    similar activities exist at our gilbert reservoir, with the exception of
    fishing, which is currently catch-and-release only until the population and
    fish size are appropriate. (fires, camping, swimming, littering, atvs and
    any unauthorized vehicles are prohibited throughout the watershed and all
    reservoirs).  
however,
    the heffner reservoir on west corydon street is the primary water source
    and has always been restricted to public use for the safety of both
    the reservoir and the public. this includes no fishing. we want to
    remind everyone that the immediate property at and around the water
    treatment plant and heffner reservoir is posted no trespassing. 
please
    observe these rules for your safety and the safety of our primary drinking
    water source.
for
    more information please stop by our offices at 28 kennedy street. 
thank you, 
bradford city water authority
