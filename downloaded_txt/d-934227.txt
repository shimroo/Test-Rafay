here is how we help


























the food bank council of michigan (fbcm) was founded in 1984 through the cooperative efforts of the stateâ€™s regional food banks. the purpose of fbcm was to implement a unified strategy to address and alleviate hunger statewide by increasing emergency food resources and advocating on behalf of the hunger relief network. at the time, many cities in michigan faced unprecedented unemployment rates and communities suffered as a result. michigan food banks stepped in to provide emergency support for families and individuals without enough food.



together leading a statewide effort to end hunger in michigan
