hi! 

          i'm sally, and i'm johnny

welcome 

          to our website:
black people 

          love us!
we are well-liked 

          by black people so we're psyched (since lots of black people don't like 

          lots of white people)!! we thought it'd be cool to honor our exceptional 

          status with a rockin' domain name and a killer website!!



 






we 

        hope you think we're as awesome as the black community does!!













        check out these testimonials from our real life friends!







sally 

      loves to touch my hair! she always asks me how i got my hair to do this. 

      that makes me feel special. like i have magical powers!

johnny 

      calls me "da man!" that puts me at ease. it makes me feel comfortable, 

      because i am black and that's how black folks talk to one another.



johnny 

      always plays up his (italian, irish, jewish, etc.) ethnicity to me—as 

      an entree into friendship!


johnny 

        always says: "i'm not racist; one of my best friends is black!" 

        i think he might mean me!






johnny 

        is generous enough to remark upon how "articulate" i am! that 

        makes me feel good!





sally 

        always says things that make me feel special, like: "you're so cool, 

        you're different, you're not like other black people!"





sally's 

        always saying: "you go girl!" while "raising the 

        roof" to mainstream hip-hop tracks at cheesy bars. that's fun! i 

        relate to that.






sally 

        and johnny are always going on and on about how tiger woods changed the 

        face of golf, and the williams sisters changed the face of tennis! on 

        and on...like, almost for too long!





sally 

        and johnny love my hat!!





sally 

        and johnny give me ample opportunities to translate rap lyrics, reggae 

        songs, and/or street slang! like i'm a mouthpiece for many, many cultures 

        of dark-skinned people. 




sally 

      uses a washcloth in the shower and scrubs herself!!

johnny 

      doesn't smell like a wet dog when he gets rained on!








our 

        white friends just don't get it!!





it's 

        crazy—black people really do seem to love them!!
