“during this complex and difficult time, our hearts and our every thought are with the people of afghanistan. we are in contact with our partners on the ground and will continue to do all we can to monitor and respond to the needs of the women we were founded to serve.” -  susan retik, co-founder and ceo

 


    support afghan widows
  

 









about beyond the 11thtwo american widows who lost their husbands on 9/11 started a foundation to counter acts of hate with acts of humanity. since 2003, we have helped thousands of afghan widows learn to support themselves and their children. pragmatism and compassion are powerful allies.we partner with international aid groups to teach vulnerable women the income-generating skills they need to not just survive but thrive. they are living proof that pencils and ledgers – not airstrikes and missiles – are the most powerful agents for change.

documentaryin 2006 our founders traveled to kabul, just five years after losing their husbands on 9/11. beyond belief is the award-winning documentary film of their journey. the film tells of how they found a profound way to move beyond their tragedy by choosing tolerance over hate and action over indifference. they forge a common bond with afghan war widows, and provide an alternate lens through which to view america’s role in the world.
