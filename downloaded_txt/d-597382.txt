hcfo: our final year in reviewdecember 2016by hcfo staffresearch headlines2016 has been a year of reflection for hcfo. after nearly 30 years, the  final grants funded under the robert wood johnson foundation’s (rwjf)  changes in health care financing and organization (hcfo) initiative are  coming to a close at the end of december. over the last 12 months, we’ve  worked to translate the findings from our final grantees and spent time  reflecting on the lessons we’ve learned to move actionable evidence  that can improve health and health care into the hands of decision  makers who need it most. as we think back on the many contributions of  the program, we are struck by the power of relationships in  strengthening the relevance and use of evidence in health policymaking,  and we have many people to thank.read more
