langmagic for artists


for artists, most resources on the web are in english, but not every artist speaks it natively. that's where langmagic comes in. our app is designed to assist artists in comprehending and annotating videos in the language of the original speakers. plus, it's available at no cost for a short period! and if you are a native speaker how about broadening your perspectives by exploring content in different languages?
