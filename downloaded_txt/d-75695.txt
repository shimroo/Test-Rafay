workshops at this year's festival



with so many outstanding musicians in newton stewart this weekend it would be foolish not to take full advantage, and we've done just that with a superb programme of traditional music workshops which are included as part of the weekend pass ticket, £10 per adult or £free for under 25s.

highland dancing competition unable to go ahead this year



it is with a heavy heart that we announce the postponement of this year's highland dancing competition at newton stewart & minnigaff traditional music & dance festival. continued funding cuts have meant some very difficult decisions have had to be made, however we do hope to bring this back in 2025.
