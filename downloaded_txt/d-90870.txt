brooks hyperion max 2 unboxing and review





two years since the launch of the original brooks running hyperion max, one extra season of new colorway and a few thousands kilometers in them, the hyperion max 2 (hm2) has finally landed. for record, the hyperion max (hm) has been my rotation for those fast days and uptempo days. i have worn 3 pairs of these with each lasting over 1000km and only replaced because i did not want to embarrass my sponsor by wearing really worn out but still functional trainers. the hyperion max 2hello! it's been a while!the hm2 was first viewed during the sports paragon trade show in march 2024 post chinese new year and needless to say, a bunch of us has seen it and was excited with it. brooks running has finally introduced a nylon plated shoes that is meant as an everyday trainer - bonus, it is a legit uptempo shoe. the hm2 made it's debut at klscm 2024 when the official pacers were provided with the hot-out-of-kastam diraja clearance hyperion max 2. goh jin jing, one of the prolific runner and pacer has shared this in his thread account.not easy to be pacer!the same hyperion max2 was also provided to pbim 2024 pacers like my friend sheryl here, and they received theirs ahead of the race. blue colorway is limited!some of the sports paragon ambassadors received their pair as well, and me, unfortunately has to wait due to the sizing. but there is no fomo there, as this allows me to observe, listen and learn what this new iteration has in store for me.so, when sports paragon messaged me and said that they have one in us12... i was of course, excited and went to get them before it goes out of stock again.and it has been a while since i update my blog with a shoe review, so here we go!men with big feet need big shoeshyperion max 2 - plated and gusseted!quick specs:lightweight responsive uptempo trainer260grams for us9 size6mm drop neutral shoe36mm-30mm race legal stackdna flash v2 nitrogen infused foampebax speedvault plateresponsive racer feelrapidroll fast transitionexcellent stabilityhighly breathable engineered upper meshdurable high mileage outsolesustainable recycled materialsrm799.00the brooks hyperion max 2 is a lightweight (260grams for us9), highly rockered (rapidroll for quick toe off), nylon plated (pebax) performance trainer and can be used for both racing and training. it comes with brooks full-length dna flash v2 (nitrogen-infused eva version 2) cushioning that is both pillow-y and provide energy return, the ride is snappy, rolling, and quick. dna flash v2with increased stack height  of 36-30 versus  34-26 on original hm, which was also notably lighter at 220grams, the increase of weight is understandable which include the full length pebax plate in the hyperion max 2. the 40grams differences is negligible in my opinion.speedvault - pebax nylon plate presentbonus is the drop on hm2 is now 6mm compared to the older model of 8mm. what this really meant is it can be considered as a near-minimalist trainer, providing a very neutral stance when standing stationery.the top is a comfortable, sock-like fit which is 4-way stretch and fit is highly adaptable. true to size and i do have wide feet that still fit the d-width perfectly well. there wasn't any issue in the toebox as it allowed for my toes to splay out and yet provide a lot of comfort. no hot spot despite running sockless, which i do 95% of the time. breathability is not an issue as i never felt hot running in them under the noon sun and hot tarmac for the past 10 runs. i've use it for both easy and hard runs.really comfy upper with many holes for breathabilitythe tongue is finally gusseted or stitched down on the side. sock like feel as i run sockless except during racing (more due to aesthetic and photo ops). this feature allows you to wear the shoe really fast instead of having to hold on the tongue when slipping your feet in - priceless feature for triathletes when they transition from bike to run.gusseted tonguethe laces that came with this shoe is flat and not stretchy, which help greatly in securing the shoe and lock it down on your feet. the same lace is seen across the hyperion elite 3 and above series and based on experience, no double-bunny loop required because the lace hardly come off once you give it a firm tie down. notched flat lacethe heel lock was solid, no movement that may cause hot spot at the ankle/heel area, and it is also padded for comfort. this is despite the heel tongue that is constructed higher than usual. those of you that may have less ability to dorsi-flex or plantar-flex your ankle may have to test and try it in store to see if it may give you problem when running. take note of the heel tongue that is higher than usualyou may notice in the photo above, there is toe-guard to keep the shape and to protect against minor bumps on the front.padded heel collar that run around the anklestick down insole and as thin as hyperion elite 4the outsole is from green rubber aka recycled materials and significantly thicker than hyperion max.  sustainability in mind, and it is generously thick at 5mm. based on experience with past brooks, this pair will easily surpass 1000km of mileage with no significant impact to the foam integrity.thick outsole covering more area vs version 1 particularly at heel areanot obvious, but the side/lateral did overextend past the outsole - and it actually lend stability overall, much like the guide to stability (gts) that typically runs around the heel portionthe hyperion max 2 is an elite 4 minus carbon platedo not be fooled by the "narrow" heeli could not help but feel the similarity between my hyperion elite 4 (he4) and the hyperion max 2. almost everything minus the obvious carbon plate on he4.they are similar, but they are different. same-same, but different vibe. here are my observations after using both shoes for well over 100km.yesboth shoes felt firm and grounded. you will feel the traditional racer shoes where you can feel the ground. helpful as it allows you to gauge how much more you need to "push" on contact. both shoes are stacked an at race legal. both are super stable. stacked shoe and stability usually do not appear in the same sentencedna flash v2. expect the same responsiveness and ridenocarbon lattice in elite 4 vs pebax nylon plate in hm2.elite 4 is lighter, but not by much.pretty slick and wide toebox even for dlets run there in hyperion max 2sufficient to provide a first reviewi have clocked well over 100km over 18 runs using the hyperion max 2. coming from hyperion pedigree, i was looking out for if this second iteration felt much different than the og. all in, the hyperion max 2 can be summed up as follow:secure feel with lacing to be very spot onsocks-like inner and zero hotspotheel cup perfect and i hardly noticed the thicker than usual padding vs tempodoesn't feel "tallstable with minimal lateral (side to side) movementcushioned comfort and yet eager to go thanks to rapidrollfront viewbut how does it compare to the ghost max that i was using right before this? as data will help me verify better than "feel", this is hyperion max 2 showed itself up in numbers. i have also taken the liberty to compare it against another shoe; the peak up3.0 version 2. a full carbon plated, double pebax race legal racing shoe. a mouthful and it is as enjoyable running and racing in it.first off, the comparison between ghost max and hyperion max 2. the three metric i was looking for to show differences between a fully cushioned daily trainer and a uptempo/speedwork trainer. ghost max ogif it often easy to tell "by feel". however, feel is subjective and differs between people. it would be easier to substantiate with data; and for that, i am comparing december 2024 where i used the ghost max vs january 2024 where the hyperion max 2 were in service.ghost max damon brown - retired january 3, 2025thanks to my stryd pod where these numbers could be quantified, my running around the neighborhood which lends consistency with the data, with the only difference to be the shoe used.sharing 3 metric which i see useful. i left out cp and cadence as these two doesn't change much unless your running style changes. the 3-metrics are:duty factor: this refers to the proportion of time the foot is in contact with the ground during a stride, calculated by dividing ground contact time by stride time. an increase in duty factor indicates an increase in the ground time percentage, while a decrease indicates an increase in the airtime percentage.leg spring stiffness or lss: higher lss meant there is an increase in energy storage and rebound. think of the legs as a spring, and in this case the shoe as the modifierimpact loading rate or ilr: higher ilr equals to higher forces is applied rapidly on the foot, which meant your ground contact time will decrease as in this case, the shoe, shows it's responsivenessas you can see above, between december (left) and january (right), the duty factor on hyperion max 2 decreases, which meant i had more "air time". it then corelates with the ilr, where higher ilr in january also meant shorter ground contact time. the hyperion max 2 also returned a slightly higher lss.i left out vertical oscillation as there is minimal changes (5mm on average) which isn't as representative on some of the more graphical changes in comparison.dotted lines was decemberbut when i plotted both shoes/months on the stryd footpath, the hyperion max 2 showed my feet movement to be lifted higher than ghost max (about 5mm average on the vo chart). bear in mind that there is minimal (0.04w/kg) increase in power between both shoes for the period of time (aka i wasn't pushing/running harder/faster to justify the changes). average pace did not changei rechecked my other metrics and the average pace over both months were similar (5:15) but the overall power has decreased (240w vs 229w) which meant i am using less energy for the runs using hyperion max 2.power decreases with no changes to average pacenext, comparing the peak up3.0 version 2, a double pebax full carbon plated race shoe with the hyperion max 2. i had a similar run which involved 7x1min repeats at cp and looked for a segment that is similar in terms of elevation and path on the same route. it seems that for less effort (17w down), i completed the distance further with hm2. while this is not conclusive but it is interesting to see how hm2 "saves" me a bit more effort over the same intervalsan approximate comparison between peak up3.0 v2 and hm2bear in mind as well the peak up3.0 is a 18-month-old shoes with about 200km in them (which meant it did lose some of the responsiveness already at the time of testing). but does it also mean that i need to out in an all-out effort for another test/experiment?conclusionthe hyperion max 2 is indeed a different shoe than its predecessor. plated and higher stacked, lower drop with newer (flash v2) foam technology, though heavier and taller due to the nylon plate, it indeed performs well as a daily trainer for both easy and uptempo run. with no breaking in required for me, sufficient cushioned foam, this model will allow for longer runs and racing as well - if you have choice of only one shoe and no rotation.prosrelatively light and responsive fast trainer, even for long runs or racesyou feel grounded at 6mm, yet you know the shoe will provide very good cushioning with the dna flash v2.rapidroll aka rocker moves you forward faststable with upper that help reduce lateral movements, thanks to the nylon pebax plate as well.great fit and lockdown, secure heel. super secure laces.no noticeable hot spot.very secure road-grip feel. no indication of slippage under faster pace.same price as og hyperion max at rm799conshigher and stiffer heel tongue may bite into some feet if you run sockless like merelatively light also meant it could be relatively heavyfirmer than expected, likely due to the plate neutralizing the plushier flash v2the hyperion max is available in all sports paragon and brooks store in malaysia. it retail for rm799.sign up at sports paragon reward and collect 25% vouchers using eevanoff25 for your purchase in store while collecting loyalty points. you can collect sports paragon vouchers using spev02 for up to 55% discount on older models as well.both codes will work online at brooksrunning.com.my and sportsparagon.com on selected (non new arrival or already on sales item). apply code at check out!fun uptempo trainer!benefits of following me here...as part of my sponsorship with paragon vests under the team sports paragon, i have a few discount codes you can use to purchase your next brooks shoes if you want. older models at higher discount is available in www.sportsparagon.com website. sizing can be a challenge, which explained the better discount. if you want newer and better sizing, head over to www.brooksrunning.com.my and score a few newer models.i have the full codes and brands that support me since 2023. but if you are lazy to click, here they are...promo code: spev02url: https://www.sportsparagon.com/footwear: 55%apparels: 50%sandals: 40%accessories: 50%promo code: eevanoff25url: https://www.brooksrunning.com.my/25% off of all items ( exclude sale items )promo code: zooteevan20url: https://www.zootsports.my/20% off zoot website non promo items10% off zoot website promotion itemskeep showing up

garmin varia radar rtl515 - unboxing & review





christmas came early for me this year as i cash into my entitlement from aeco technologies as the everymove sports club which i am very much part of the past 2-years is being kiv due to changes in direction from aeco itself. it is a sad moment for me, more so after a whole 13 or 14 years of collboration with aeco representing the garmin brand and myself has been on the forefront of all devices that was launched, learning about them and sharing it here in my blog. as a friend said, cherish the good memories and move on.and this is indeed a move on post, and i write them with mixed feeling.the journey so far with aeco technologiesi've only been reviewing wrist devices mostly over the years; from the first unit of fr910xt and the first ever fenix, to everything cart gps and iteration of all the forerunner (fr) series to all the fenix series, cycling power meters such as vector 2s and vector 3s, all permutation of hrm og to hrm pro plus, cycling computer such as edge 1000 and edge 1040. i even have the vista handheld series such as the hcx which accompanied me in my early days pre-wrist watch garmin, and a vista10, which was replaced as hcx was beyond repair.the edge 1000 (thank you aeco) now belong to my son as he starts his triathlon journey. in fact, he inherited the fenix7x that was given as an entitlement in 2022 and my daughter took over the fenix6 (2020). some older devices were given away to friends that wanted to start the sports, while some ended up as electronic waste as they can't be fixed anymore as they are effectively extinct even in garmin directory.i have always been curious of the radar or varia - and it was indeed a missing link to the garmin ecosystem that i never had. so with the entitlement that was due to me for 6-months (and a lot of bargaining), i managed to exchange it for 2-units of varia rtl515, and you guessed it right - one for me to pair on edge 1040 and one for my son for his edge 1000. (now before you think i left my wife out, i bought a fr965 for me using my entitlement in 2023)thank you aeco technologies, for this and the good memories with garmin as a brand. and yes, this also meant i am no longer representing or able to represent garmin (via aeco) anymore from july 1, 2024 onwards.garmin radar varia rtl515 - a very quick reviewgarmin has a few variant of cycling radar. and by radar we really meant something that can detect vehicles (and motorbikes) behind us and gives you the heads up warning on your cycling computer or compatible wrist devices. it is safety at it's best.couple that with super bright led lights that can be seen hundreds of meter away, and flashes in such a way it should really alert any road users that you are there. radar is indeed an underrated companion for many cyclist. first debuted in 2015 as garmin acquired a south african company that does this technology (thank you ikubu) with the release of rtl500 and rtl501. little changed over the years until 2018 where the new shaped rtl510 and rtl511 came out. the 1 at the back actually denote the european requirement that the led lights must stay on all time without flashing. so anyone outside of eu can use those fancier flashing and strobe functions.a mix feeling, reallythe rtl515 is to date, 4 years old. it is no changes to the design vs the 2018 rtl510. so it does not surprise me when the two units of radar i receieved carries both aeco sticker (aka been in the retail shop for at least the past 2 years) and garmin malaysia (the new mothership) sticker. essentially nothing change in terms of packaging.notice the two different stickersthe old packaging is glossieras how a father should operate, i kept the newer unit for my son, and i took the aeco unit for myself - also for sentimental value being associated with aeco. the unboxing is pretty straight forward with the unit well packed with all things you required to attach to your seatpost.the box at the end showed this unit was dropped before from display :(here is the step by step unboxing, since i did not take any video to show. you can see that the radar unit is in plastic bag, so is the attachments for it, the micro-usb charging cable, the user manual and two sets of stickers. we all love stickers.and here they are, all out of plastic.three different grommet to attach to three different type of seatpost, including aero-post, and two silicon band to secure the unitthe next few series of photos shows how the unit looked like from all angle. comments or observation in the photo captions as required.similar mounting as per the cycling computerrubber cover on the charging port. micro-usbtop view of the on/off button. press 1s to switch it on. do not look at the light.i repeat, do not look at the lightdamn brightthere is light window on both left and right, i believe supposedly lend visibility to people on your flankalso as bright, just less intense from the sidea status led (in blue here) help you to know if the unit battery requires charging, the charging stage and for blue, it denotes "smart" mode where it "talks" to your headunitthe other sidebase mount attached to the rtl515on my steel bike seat postmounted as per instruction. the whole front facing area below the led is the radar consolebright! paring it with my edge 1040 is straight forward. the pairing of the rtl515 to the edge 1000 and edge 1040 were straight forward. it will link as a radar first, and then you will need to search and link it as light. this way, the setting can be optimised as you can control the led behaviour from your headunit very easily. i do not or did not take any video of the unit pairing up, but once done correctly, it will prompt you to update the rtl515 firmware and just follow the intructions on your headunit or wrist devices (i have no issues linking it to the fenix 7x and my fr965).and if you are curious on how the unit behave, this is a short video showing how it detects vehicles coming at speed, and the approximate "distance" based on visual on the edge 1040. the accuracy is good and the past few bike ride was with a lot of confidence that i do not need to constantly look behind even when on straight road to check over my shoulder - and of course using this to supplement the usual looking over the shoulder as i change lane or when i saw obstacle on the front that i would like to avoid.the beep was loud enough to be heard going at 35km/h and it was fun watching some of these dots turning red as they approach nearer to you (at approximately 140m). the rtl515 is capable to detect traffics from a 3-lane road as it has a wide "field of vision". it picks up motorbike very accurately as well but not bicycles. i believe part of the reason is that the radar detects significant speed differences between you and the objects coming from behind - and alert you on the actual threats rather than giving a false positive. hope this very short write up provide some insight to the radar units. of course, if you have more questions, please do ask away. as the functionality of this radar i pretty straight forward, there is really nothing more i can write about unless you experience it yourself.this unit retail for rm1050 at all garmin malaysia retail and online store. this could be one of the best money you may spend on for safety if your riding is constantly outdoor in trafficked area. the led brightness alone is already a first line of sight for vehicles - the only way they will miss you is because they are driving distracted or under the influence, or in some cases, they just hate anything on two wheels and look at you as a target to bully. for these reasons above, no amount of radar or careful riding will save you.just ride safe and defensively!see you all on the road soon!
