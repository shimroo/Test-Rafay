over the past two decades we’ve welcomed hundreds of thousands of people into our studios. the 26+2 series (original hot yoga) provides the foundation of what we offer, with a variety of other classes meant to complement a regular hot yoga practice. with three convenient ways to join us — in-studio, live stream, and on-demand — it’s never been easier to get started!
