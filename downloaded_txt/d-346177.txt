two orlando prophecies from 1988

the following are two prophecies over the city beautiful, orlando, florida, which the lord spoke through me in september 1988. over the course of three years beginning in the latter half of 1988 and continuing through the first half of 1990 i conducted some three hundred meetings in which i was teaching on the prophetic gifts and office as well as prophesying about a coming prophetic movement followed by an apostolic movement in which the offices of the prophet and the apostle would be restored  to their proper place of function in the church that jesus is building (mat. 16:18), despite the fact that what god was doing in the spirit realm would be widely rejected by men in terms of its implementation in the natural realm. to this day that i am publishing these prophecies, i continue to adamantly believe god indeed did restore both of those offices to their rightful place of function in the spirit realm, but i am also keenly aware that to this day that fact has been largely rejected by the vast majority of those entities that claim to be part of the genuine church, though the irrefutable fact is that any entity that does not have has has a foundation consisting of apostles and prophets and christ jesus as the cornerstone (eph. 2:20), that entity, regardless of what it calls itself, is not a legitimate ‚Äúchurch‚Äù that is part of parcel of the ecclesia that jesus, as its head, is building!

saving faith

but without faith it is impossible to [walk with god and] please him, for whoever comes [near] to god must [necessarily] believe that god exists and that he rewards those who [earnestly and diligently] seek him.
the first requirement regarding faith is: one must accept, receive, or activate it to become a believer.
but what does it say? ‚Äúthe word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart‚Äù‚Äîthat is, the word [the message, the basis] of faith which we preach‚Äî because if you acknowledge and confess with your mouth that jesus is lord [recognizing his power, authority, and majesty as god], and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead, you will be saved. for with the heart a person believes [in christ as savior] resulting in his justification [that is, being made righteous‚Äîbeing freed of the guilt of sin and made acceptable to god]; and with the mouth he acknowledges and confesses [his faith openly], resulting in and confirming [his] salvation.‚Äù

the manifestation (charismata) gift of prophecy

the entrance of god‚Äôs word gives light, or illumination of the truth (psa. 119:130). by and by, throughout the ages, god has been dispelling spiritual darkness in the church by gradually revealing more and more truth and by gradually giving us greater illumination of the truth. as a result, the church‚Äôs understanding of the truth is becoming more and more complete and perfected. this is what the holy spirit means in his allusion to being ‚Äúestablished in present truth.‚Äù certainly, it is not that the truth of god changes or needs up-dating, but rather this refers to the church‚Äôs understanding of the truth. this process seems to be especially accelerated in these last days in which much fresh truth is being revealed to the church through a ‚Äúnew breed‚Äù of fivefold ministers.

the real truth about the covid-19 plague

under a microscope, the unmistakable and obvious signature of satan, who is the god/prince/ruler of this world according to numerous scripture passages can be seen. coronaviruses were so named because the virus appears similar to a ‚Äúcrown.‚Äù this is satan‚Äôs signature as the god/prince/ruler of this world. jesus himself referred to satan as the prince and ruler of this world.

a prophetic word to local church leaders

the greatest church-growth program ever devised in the history of mankind and the church jesus is building is the fivefold ministry model outlined in ephesians 4:4-16. every senior church leader in america and some other nations around the world has at their ready disposal some of the most battle-tested, god-anointed, god-appointed, life-experienced fivefold ministers on the planet living right in their ‚Äúbackyard,‚Äù so to speak, in the form of highly-experienced preachers/teachers/ministers who reside in their geographical sphere of operation ‚Äî in their immediate locality, their region, or state. god has distributed these mighty warriors of god all around you like salt on a plate of food. these are kingdom-assets god has blessed you with who are eager to do what they can within their range of ministerial expertise to help you in the task of building your local church.

a prophetic word for 2020

n 2020, one of the emphases of the spirit will be eschatological events, because god wants his betrothed, the genuine church he is building, to understand that jesus‚Äô return is imminent‚Äìhe is coming back soon! eschatology is the knowledge and study of endtimes.

firebrands from heaven

‚Äúon any given sunday,‚Äù what emanates from most pulpits in america, sad to say, has the spiritual depth of scotch tape! regardless of how pious-sounding and eloquently delivered the religious rhetoric, it is nonetheless void of the divine-power required to edify and activate the hearers‚Äô spirits. why?

12 reasons ‚Äúcovenant agreements‚Äù are not of god

recently, i interfaced and interacted with a group whose primary commonality is their claim to be apostolic leaders, which, in my view, is extremely dubious in the case of but only a few. in the aftermath, a great disappointment and matter of dismay to me was being made aware, despite the decades of disapprobation and disrepute, some of their number, including some of their senior leaders, continue to employ in working/relating ‚Äúcovenant relationships‚Äù with junior leaders of their group such ‚Äúspiritual covenants‚Äù of the ilk described and referenced herein. i was deeply grieved in my spirit by what i saw, discerned, and experienced at that conference. a major part of my concern regarding this group (as a group), is their ostensible lack of spiritual discernment and understanding regarding worldly and demonic influences that are apparently part of their theological and belief systems. as a result of almost continual prayer for several weeks afterwards, i was impelled by the spirit to unburden myself by the writing of this article and others i will be writing to articulate some of what the lord has shown me regarding the nascent apostolic-prophetic movements, past, present, and future.

uncovering the myth of spiritual covering

‚Äúspiritual covering‚Äù as theorized by those who teach, promulgate, and adhere to it is an absolute myth. no semblance of the version of ‚Äúspiritual covering‚Äù taught by its proponents exists anywhere within the pages of holy writ (scripture). i will take it a step further and state straightforwardly and unambiguously: ‚Äúspiritual covering,‚Äù in the vein that it is presented by its proponents and proliferators, is an unmitigated lie and complete myth!  it is a complete fabrication concocted by the originators of these fallacious doctrines by which to facilitate and perpetuate their purely self‚Äëaggrandizing objectives of subjugation, domination and control of the sheep of god‚Äôs flock.
