bet shalom is a reform synagogue affiliated with the union for reform judaism (urj). our synagogue is a sacred community - a kehilah kedosha. like the israelites in our torah, and the ger b’toshav - those that joined them along the way, we bring our individual uniqueness and diversity to enhance the whole. we are united through bet shalom in creating and sustaining a vibrant and caring jewish community that supports living jewish values, ritual, education, and opportunities for tikkun olam - repairing our world.




    there are many ways for members to connect with one another, including study groups, social networking, committees, and more.

    we maintain a robust calendar of activities and events at bet shalom.

a note from rabbi locketz

i am excited to return to the synagogue this week and to reconnect with our congregation. i have spent much of the last four months only a mile from bet shalom, but i have lived quite differently than i have for most of the past 18 years as a rabbi. in the months leading up to this sabbatical, i made a list of things i wanted to accomplish during my time away that covered three pages of a notebook.

four questions for passover



apr 13, 2022




in just a few days, we will join together with family or friends to retell the ancient story of our people’s redemption. the passover seder is one of the most celebrated rituals by jews around the world, in large part because it takes place around a dinner table. instead of coming to a sanctuary, we sit in a tight circle, tell stories, ask questions, and eat food.
