former bases dot com home page



welcome to the former
bases web site.
over time, the machines of
war elimanated the need for thousands of bases. man power for
ground pounding and "hand to hand" combat were no
longer needed, to great extent, and the bases that housed and
trained these men were closed. then, after the cold war had
ended, and due to greater fighting technologies, once again, the
"hit list" appeared and many more bases were closed. 
this site was built to
preserve the rich history and memories of the former us bases
that existed in the united states and some us territories over
time. this site is working to be the single most complete
encyclopedia of former u.s. military bases of all branches of
service. if the base you are searching does not appear on the
list, and it is a base that is no longer an active military base,
in whole or part, from any era, please make the webmaster aware of it.
