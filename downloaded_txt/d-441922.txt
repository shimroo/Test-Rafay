âone year ago i never would have imagined myself sitting in a therapists office. i'm so glad i found the courage to call guthrie and associates. it's a lot easier than trying to go it alone. it feels like i'm finally putting my life back together..â


âthe counselling we received at guthrie and associates has made a huge difference in our relationship. in fact, our marriage...which a year ago was on the brink of collapse is now stronger than ever..â
