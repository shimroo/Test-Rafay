i am 
























i'm a washington, dc based engineering leader who works with small and large businesses to build innovative engineering teams with a focus on execution.
since 2004 i've focused on architecting software solutions for big and small data, especially for the federal government. i developed a social media research platform, a line rate cyber security system, a highly parallel nlp system, and numerous geospatial analysis packages.
my favorite language is python - i've been to six pycons since 2008 - but by lines of code i've definitely written more java. i enjoy mentoring developers in both, and also in the general practice of computer science and devops.
