 **a note to my to new customers!** hundreds of my repeat customers know this as fact.  all my handbags have been cleaned and reconditioned. leather has been treated; fabric, vinyl and interiors have been cleaned. an expert in the field handles any repairs if needed.  this is not an auction site that sells vintage handbags that have not been lovingly handled to insure the handbag is in quality condition when sold! the handbags are sent in pure white tissue and boxed in the proper fashion to insure there is no damage in shipment!



 terminology regarding the condition of the vintage handbags please remember when buying vintage purses there are normally minor imperfections , unless these are very noticable or detract from the style or attractiveness of the item they are not normally mentioned. looking for perfection, then vintage is not for you! (mint condition) mint - as close to "new" as possible for its age. no problems.
          (excellent condition) normal wear expected for age.  any problems are not easily visible.
          (gently used) normal wear expected for age.  shows very minimal wear
          (used) a purse that was used everyday. not abused.... but used, shows more noticeable wear. (rest assured i do not sell handbags that are not attractive or fit to carry.)
important information please read:



payment policy:

no refunds ~exchanges  or store credit only. please be sure of your purchase, email me with any questions. i do my best to give accurate descriptions of the items and any possible flaws. again, when ordering these vintage handbags keep in mind that they are vintage and will not look like a brand new item even if they are listed as mint. the handbags are mint for vintage. let me know if you have specific questions. if you are not completely satisfied with your product, you may exchange or receive a store credit by simply returning your purchase within 2 days after receipt. the item must be in the original condition as it was when shipped. all returned items must shipped with insurance covering the full value of the item. thank you!
