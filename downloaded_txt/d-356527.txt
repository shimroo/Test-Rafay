fuck yeah leaked albums. new crystal castles albums (about 2 singles  leaked and a full album ironically and annoyingly named crystal castles  [again]), but a bunch of the tracks are full of shit... so here i have  uploaded are my favs. their style has evolved out of the screaming,  8-bit electro that they once were and more towards a glitchy,  rock-grunge noise. doesn't beat their first album by any means.  *as these songs are ... brand new... i can't find videos for them.  but trust me they are good.download mother knows best  by crystal castles here download baptism by crystal  castles heredownload not in love  by crystal castles hereand  if you would like the album anyway, download  crystal castles album (2010) heretracklisting:1.  fainting spells 2. celestica 3. doe deer 4. baptism 5. year of silence 6. empathy 7. suffocation 8. violent dreams 9. vietnam 10. birds 11. pap smear 12. not in love 13. intimate 14. i am made of chalk

uffie, a self-proclaimed alcoholic and party girl from "france" (born  in miami, raised in hong kong and now lives in paris?) is pretty hard  to categorize. i'm not entirely sure where her vulgar mc work and  house/techno-y beats lay. either way... her music definitely has a  badass personality. however in a recent interview, it's pretty clear  that a lot of it is a huge facade :(.  download pop  the glock by uffie here download hot  chick by uffie here and since i haven't posted much dubstep in a while.. here's something  from joker, a producer form the uk, in honor of the  upcoming tron movie. so psyched to see that shit. amazing beats on this  track... many taken from headhunter events.  download tron  by joker here

chromeo!  on tour! the electro band's instruments mainly consists of a keyboard,  synthesizers, a talk box, and guitar. pretty dance-y.  download  mercury tears by chromeo here second, one of my favorite songs of all-time, closet face by  copy (not  to be confused with cut copy, another electro group). he is a  little-known artist who deserves a lot of recognition. a lot of poppy  8-bit, electro, and techno beats go into this song, almost making it a  sort of dubstep track, just not as grimey.  download closet  face by copy here

up for download today is an artist who is the subject of many  copyright lawsuits. greg gillis, or better known as girl talk,  is a mash-up artist who remixes multiple songs into a single track. all  his songs are pretty good party music. the album night ripper  is one of his most-played, so download it here!  download night  ripper album by girl talk here and here's another dubstep track by rusko, woo  boost. personally one of my favourites by him - the bass and beats  really kick in around 30 seconds.  download woo  boost by rusko here

electro remix day. today's song #1 is runway to elsewhere (breakbot  remix) by pacific!.  the song has been transformed with the love of breakbot, who has added  some robotic vocals and additional bass. it'll make you wanna headbang.  download runway  to elsewhere (breakbot remix) by pacific! here the second track of the day is sound of love (the twelves  remix)   by husky rescue.  the twelves are a beautiful band from brazil that is most known for  their magical remixes, but also has a few solid singles (works for  me and i feel fine are my favs). they use the french  vocals and add in their usual drum machines and keyboarding to make for a  very chill, yet more upbeat song than the original.  download sound  of love (the twelves remix) by husky rescue here bonus: download  works for me by the twelves here

this band is so fucking awesome, but you've probably never heard of  them. they remind me of the smiths, a sound that is  almost impossible to regenerate. they are torn curtain,  a currently unsigned band that hails from brooklyn, new york and so far  has 2 tracks. from the sounds of the ep, they will definitely be  getting bigger, so be that i-knew-about-them-before-you-did guy and  check it out. my favorite track is nail in the coffin, but as  i'm told by one of the band members, the tracks are pretty equally loved  by everyone.  torn curtain  currently offers their music for free download here.
