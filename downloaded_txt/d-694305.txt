lost world arts



primitive art and fine photography from around the world


gallery of fine
photography

 © 1999-2008 karl lehmann

the gallery of photography is divided into
exhibits comprising four to seven photographs each for faster downloading. each
exhibit contains work from a specific continent or region.
on the left is a thumbnail version of one photograph from each
gallery. to see a larger version and the rest of the exhibit just click on the
image. you may then click on any
photograph in the exhibit to view a larger version and a description.
you may also choose a gallery from the list on the right, or you
can search an alphabetical index
to all the images on the site.
if you are interested in a particular subject or region, please
email images@lostworldarts.com. we have thousands of images of nature, wildlife,
people and cultures from all over the world in stock. all of the images in our
library are available for purchase; we can provide either digital files or 35mm
transparencies.

most of the photographs displayed on this site are also available as fine art
prints, signed and archivally mounted.
information on print size and pricing can be found below the larger version of
each photograph, along with a description of the image.
all of our prints are created directly from the original slides, for two
reasons. by avoiding the use of an internegative we achieve the maximum possible
sharpness in the print. it also allows us to use higher quality printing media,
which are far more resistant to fading or color shifting than the papers used
for printing from negatives. we use either fujiflex super gloss or
ilfochrome super gloss printing material, depending on the contrast in the original transparency.
both are polyester based, rather than paper based, for durability. prints on
either of these media have an estimated life of at least 75 years under normal
display conditions, much longer in dark storage.
to protect our prints we use only archival techniques and materials for
mounting and matting. each print is mounted and matted with westminster
rag board. this board is composed of 100% cotton and buffered for stability. the
prints are hinged to the mats, rather than dry mounted, ensuring reversibility.
colored mat board is not archival, so all of our mats are natural ivory in
color. the ivory mat
creates a beautiful museum quality display but a colored mat can be added
if desired. if so an acid free board should be chosen and it should be positioned on top of the
original mat rather than in direct contact with the print.

our gallery will continue to expand, so bookmark us and visit
again!
