why study in australia with academia?
preparing for your future starts by choosing the right certificate or diploma.
there are many training institutions in australia that could help you achieve that goal. so why choose ours?



we’re a medium-sized institution


                            as a medium-sized institution, we’re able to offer our students the best of both worlds. 
                            unlike a larger institution, you’ll receive levels of one-on-one attention and support that wouldn’t be possible with a larger student body.
                        
at the same time, we’re also better-resourced than a smaller institution. 
                            we have larger workshops, and are able to attract high-quality instructors who bring with them years of experience not just teaching, but in their industry as well.
                        




we offer a range of student resources

for overseas students in particular, our resource centre will help get you settled, assisting you with student visa requirements, accommodation, part-time work and more.
in addition to qualified course counsellors who can guide you and help you make a decision, we also offer a range of other resources.
our learning management system (lms) allows you to access coursework and student resources, talk to other students and communicate with your instructors from anywhere with an internet connection.






we have a focus on hands-on learning

we believe that people learn better by doing, not observing.
to that end, many of our courses in melbourne and brisbane feature a heavy emphasis on practical learning, with many of your lessons conducted in workshops instead of the classroom.
both of our campuses feature well-stocked and up-to-date workshops, complete with all the equipment and tools you will use once you graduate.




we offer placements that prepare you for work

it’s one thing to practice essential skills in a workshop - it’s another to do it in a real workplace. that’s why many of our courses also include a work placement requirement.
thanks to strong relationships across a range of industries, we are able to provide you with the sort of learning only a real workplace can provide, turning you into the most capable and work-ready candidate.
