what we offer






							  interactive theater
							




							play's the thing! our interactive theater productions rely heavily on improvisation and audience participation, which allow us to customize our shows to fit the particular needs of our clients. all our murder mysteries are presented with a humorous slant as you meet our cast of hilarious characters and get entangled in a web of lies & intrigue.
						  






							  full theatrical productions
							




							comedy, drama, play or musical, theater to go has produced them all! we have a long history of producing award-winning theater in the delaware valley region and beyond. under the leadership of ruth markoe (director/producer), t2g has established a reputation for high-quality stage productions. 
						  






							  musical movie sing-alongs
							




							take a favorite classic musical film, like the wizard of oz, grease or annie and combine with on-screen lyrics for singing along, add in our mix of costumed characters & goodie bags and you've got a fantastic afternoon of fun for all ages! great for fundraisers and youth events.
						  






							  all avenues of live entertainment
							




in addition to our murder mysteries and other theatrical services, theater to go is your source for a broad range of entertainment options: clowns, stilt walkers, costumed characters, event hosts/mcs, djs. stand-up comics, seat fillers, event & party planning, photography/videography, even a flamenco dancer!
