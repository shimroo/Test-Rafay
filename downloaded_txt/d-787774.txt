on this memorial day





remembering a fallen hero




as you are well aware america is currently at war with iraq (on iraqi soil). many white men, white women and some "misguided" negroes have died in this war. due to the bloodshed and decapitations america is now forced to remember her dead and try to heal her wounded.

all of america, black & white are "told" to "support the troops" and "remember america's fallen heroes"...so in keeping with the black fist--"black laws/constitution"...
general nikki x would like to take a moment to also remember a "fallen hero" who died on american soil fighting for "freedom" and "liberation".

this brave, strong, proud "american" fought until his final breath to insure his "fellow americans" would somehow enjoy the freedoms the united states constitution "dictate" all "americans" are entitled to share in and enjoy.

remember one of (white america's) most beloved famous president's most repeated saying, "all men are created equal".
well, that young brave "american" must have lucked up and read thomas jefferson's writing and took those words to heart.

please sit back and enjoy the following "tribute" to this brave heroic "american" and the "sacrifices" he made in his quest for "freedom in american".

let's take this "historic journey" together and pay our respects to a man who was and will never be laid to rest at "arlington national cemetery" but "nevertheless" deserves our utmost "gratitude and remembrance....especially on a fine, warm sunny day like "today"!

our dear brother nathaniel turner (family and friends called him "nat") was born in southampton, virginia on october 2, 1800. "nat", the son of slaves, was the property of benjamin turner, a prosperous plantation owner. nat's mother and grandmother had been brought to america from "africa" and had a deep hatred for slavery. (sounds like 2 fine upstanding women to me)

nat grew up sharing his mother's view of slavery. taught to read by his master's son (bad move on his part, huh?), nat developed deep religious beliefs and encouraged by his parents, gradually began to believe that god had chosen him to lead his people out of slavery. (doesn't sound so far fetched to me, can anyone say "moses")

in 1831, bro. nat was sold to a white man named joseph travis. in february of that same year an eclipse of the sun convinced nat that this was a supernatural sign from god to start an insurrection. however, it wasn't until august 23rd (my god, that's today) that nat and about 7 other slaves killed "master" travis and his family to launch his rebellion. in all about 55 whites were killed.

bro. nat turner had hoped that his "action" would cause a massive slave uprising but only 80 joined his rebellion. over 3,000 members of the state militia were sent to "deal" with nat's rebellion, and they were soon defeated. in retaliation, more than a hundred innocent black slaves were killed. bro. nat went into hiding but was captured 6 weeks later.
that strong, brave, black (american) man of african origin was viciously executed by hanging on november 11, 1831.
he was 1 month into his 31st year of life.

a white man thomas r. gray, met our "american hero" in prison and recorded his account of the slave rebellion on august 23, 1831.

the late insurrection in southampton has greatly excited the public mind, and led to a thousand idle, exaggerated and mischievous reports. it is the first instance in our history of an open rebellion of the slaves, and attended with such atrocious circumstances of "cruelty and destruction", as could not fail to leave a deep impression, not only upon the minds of the community where this fearful tragedy was wrought, but throughout every portion of our country, in which this population is to be found. public curiosity has been on the stretch to understand the origins and progress of this "dreadful" conspiracy, and the "motives" which influences its "diabolical actors". the "insurgent" slaves (that sounds familiar doesn't it?) had all been "destroyed", or apprehended, tried and executed, with the exception of the leader (that's "our hero" he's referring too) without revealing anything at all "satisfactory", as to the motives that governed them (was this white man for real?) or the means by which they expected to accomplish their object.

everything connected with this sad affair (sad for whom?) was wrapped in mystery, until nat turner, the leader of this "ferocious band" whose name has resounded throughout our widely extended empire, was captured. this "great bandit" was taken by a single individual, in a cave near the residence of his late owner, on sunday, october 13th, without attempting to make the slightest resistance, and on the following day safely lodged in the jail of the county. his captor was benjamin phipps, armed with a shot gun well charged. nat's only weapon was a small sword which he immediately surrendered (they say), and begged that his life be spared (i seriously doubt "he begged" for anything). since his confinement, by permission of the jailer, i have had ready access to him, and finding that he was willing to make a full and free "confession" of the origin, progress and consummation of the "insurrection" (there's that word again) movements of the slaves of which he was the "contriver" and "head". (the general)

by his own words, (according to and, as told to thomas r. gray) these are the accounted words of bro. nat turner called "the confessions of nat turner" (from his white man's cage/jail--- 1831)

i was 31 years of age on october 2, 1831, and born the property of benjamin turner, of this county. in my childhood a circumstance occurred which made an indelible impression on my mind, and laid the ground work of that enthusiasm, which has terminated so fatally to many, both black and white, and for which i am about to atone at the gallows. it is necessary to relate this circumstance-trifling as it may seem, it was the commencement of that belief which has grown with time, and even now, sir, in this "dungeon", helpless and forsaken as i am, i cannot divest myself of.

being at play with other children, when 3 or 4 years old, i was telling them something, which my mother overhearing, said it happened before i was born- i stuck to my story, however, and related some things which went, in her opinion, to confirm it--others being called on were greatly astonished, knowing that these things had happened, and caused them to say in my hearing, i surely would be a prophet, as the lord had shown me things that had happened before my birth. and my father and mother strengthened me in this my first impression, saying in my presence, i was intended for some great purpose, which they had always thought from certain marks on my head and breast.

the "confessions" of our beloved slain brother continues...

my master, who belongs to the church, and other religious persons who visited the house, and whom i often saw at prayers, noticing the singularity of my manners, i suppose, and my uncommon intelligence for a child, remarked i had too much sense to be raised, and if i was, i would never be of any service to anyone a slave. to a mind like mine, restless, inquisitive and observant of everything that was passing, it is easy to suppose that religion was the subject to which i was directed. the manner in which i learned to read and write, not only had great influence on my mind, as i acquired it with most perfect ease, so much so, that i have no recollection whatever of learning the alphabet--but to the astonishment of the family, one day, when a book was sewn to me to keep me from crying, i began spelling the names of different objects- this was a source of wonder to all in the neighborhood, particularly the blacks- and this learning was constantly improved at all opportunities.

when i got large enough to go to work (slave work), while "employed", i was reflecting on many things that would present themselves to my imagination, and whenever an opportunity occurred of looking at a book, when the school children were getting their lessons (slave were not allowed to go to school), i would find many things that the fertility of my own imagination had depicted to me before; all my time, not devoted to "my master's service", was spent either in prayer, or in making experiments in casting different things in mounds made of earth, in attempting to make paper, gunpowder, and many other experiments, that although i could not perfect, yet convinced me of its practicability i had the means.

the "confession" continues...let us return back to bro. nat...

we remained at the feast until about 2 hours in the night, when we went to the house and found "austin"; they all went to the cider press and drank, except myself. on returning to the house, "hark" went to the door with an ax, for the purpose of of breaking it open, as we knew we were strong enough to murder the family, if they were awaken by the noise; but reflecting that it might create an alarm in the neighborhood (that's rich, huh?) we determined to enter the house secretly, and murder them whilst sleeping. "hark" got a ladder and set it against the chimney, on which i "ascended" and hoisting a window, entered and came downstairs, unbarred the door, and removed the guns from their places.

it was then observed that i must spill the blood first. (sounds like what america's doing in iraq right now, doesn't it?) on which, armed with a hatchet, and accompanied by "will", i entered my master's chamber, it being dark, i could not give the death blow (our brother nat was a "compassionate" black man, wasn't he?), the hatchet glanced from his head, he sprang from the bed and called his wife, it was his last word, "will" (known thereafter as "will the executioner") laid him dead, with a blow of his ax, and mrs. travis shared the same fate, as she lay in bed. the murder of his family, 5 in number, was the work of a moment, not one of then awoke; there was a little infant sleeping in a cradle, that was forgotten, until we had left the house and gone some distance, when henry and "will" returned and killed it; we got here. 4 guns that would shoot, and several old muskets, with a pound or 2 of powder.

bro. nat's "heroic saga" continues...


we remained some time at the barn, where we paraded; i formed them in a line as "soldiers" and after carrying them through all the manoeuvres i was master of, marched them off to mr. salathul francis' about 600 yards distant. sam and will went to the door and knocked. mr. francis asked who was there, sam replied, it was him, and he had a letter for him, on which he got up and came to the door, they immediately seized him, and dragged him out a little door, he was dispatched by repeated blows on his head; there was no other white person in the family. we started from there for mrs. reese's, maintaining the most perfect silence on our march, where finding the door unlocked (devilish wicked white slave holders were so "trusting", were they not?), we entered, and murdered mrs. reese in her bed, while sleeping; her son awoke, but it was only to sleep the sleep of death (that was heavy wasn't it?), he had only time to say who is it that, and he was "no more". 
(deep..)
henry h. garnet, speech on slavery in buffalo, new york on august 16, 1843. 12 years after nat turner's vicious "murder" as a result of fighting for his "american freedom" on american soil...
the "patriotic" nathaniel turner was goaded to desperation by "wrong and "injustice". by despotism, his name has been recorded on the list of infamy, but future generations will number him upon "the noble and brave"!

well, there you have it folks, the story of one of "the black fist's greatest heroes of all time"-- general nat turner-- he did what he had to do and unlike "your" president george w. bush, nat turner fought a war that was "brought to him" not "the other way around"!
he was a black slave who fought to free himself as well as his black brothers and sisters, and he did it all in the name of god.
general nikki x is proud to have been born on the "same day", my dearly beloved brother general nat turner "took matters into his own hands" to "free himself & his people from the chains of "american chattel slavery"! 


"rest in peace-- dear general "soldier" nat turner-- rest in peace"
--and--
"happy birthday/earth day"--- general nikki x!!!
black fist, black power, black nation

black resistance day/nat turner day!









(the following is a re-post from 2008 in honor of our hero, the great general nat turner)

(pictured above at a "black resistance day" event is general nikki x (speaking at the podium). seated are guest speakers sis. mary muhammad & michael reily. standing next to general nikki x is general kabaka oba.) 

beautiful black brothers & sisters,

today is august 22nd 2008. we must never forget the black fist organization (then called "the black special forces") yearly salute to our dearly departed revolutionary soldier and beloved brother, nat turner. we honor this revolutionary soldier every year around the anniversary of his rebellion to bust out of american slavery. we called this great historically celebrated event on cincinnati's fountain square, "black resistance day!"

black resistance day was founded in 2001 by the co-founders of this organization, generals kabaka oba and nikki x, assisted by the great major general minister abdul muhammad ali. together the three of us put together 3 major black movement type rallies to celebrate, commemorate and elevate the conscienceness of the black man, the black woman and the precious black child!

those 3 major events put together by the aforementioned above are in order of creation:
1. black power day -- founded in april 2001 & always celebrated in the month of april.
2. black freedom day -- founded in june 2001 & always celebrated in the month of june.
3. black resistance day -- founded in august 2001 & always celebrated in the month of august.
(historical note: the first ever black power day was held one day before the fatal shooting of an unarmed 19 year old black youth by the name of timothy thomas by (then) cincinnati police officer steven roach, a white man. that fatal shooting of yet another unarmed black man by police was the straw that broke the camels black back in this city. alas! the 2001 riots began!)

make no mistake about it. myself & a co-founder (kabaka) were always so proud of these events. we'd advertise on local black talk radio and local white talk radio. we'd print up & distribute flyers in the black communities of cincinnati. we'd physically getting out into the streets throughout the different black communities to let our people know about our events by word of mouth. there were long planning sessions back in those days between kabaka & myself to make sure everything, i mean everything was just right. we believed that dear beloved bro. nat turner should be celebrated for his great heroic act back on august 23, 1831 and be forever remembered for it. back then in those long planning sessions, in agreement with the major general minister abdul muhammad ali, kabaka thought it would be great to celebrate nat turner's rebellion and general nikki x's earth day/birthday at the same time. he called it "the celebration of two black militant soldiers". i thought [publicly] celebrating bro. nat turner day/black resistance day was enough for fountain square. however, kabaka & abdul insisted on it being "nat & nikki" celebrated together! and that was that. (please note the writing on the sign in front of the podium i'm speaking at in the black resistance day event picture above for validity)

the videotape of those events were incredible to see and hear. the lectures in celebration very powerful, and every guest speakers to grace our events on stage over the years, always a revolutionary treat! today i still feel proud and honored to know that i along with another conceived and actually put something so powerfully educational and so black militantly driven together then boldly presented it right there in the heart of downtown on its fountain square for all to see! black & white.

i will forever feel blessed & honored by the knowledge of being born on the same day nat turner stood up against his slave-holding oppressors and finally said, "no more!!!" and in that same respect, i always felt it my duty to tell the truth in my lifetime whether people accepted it or not. there is a saying kabaka & i coined and it goes like this, "the truth never changes, only the audience!" that phrase still stands today!

there were only 3 black fist members ever involved in the aforementioned events from their conception. and once again those 3 people were: general nikki x, general kabaka oba and the major general minister abdul muhammad ali.

--except no imitations or revisions of black special forces/black fist history from: 

--present day impostors who were never involved in any way shape form or fashion in the conception and planning of these now historic events. impostors who attempt to lie and revise black fist history for their own sadistic personal gain, & only after kabaka's death. i might add.

--or from present day impostors who were never there at all. only now attempting to live off other people's credits & accomplishments. impostors who live in a world of distorted fantasy in an attempt to feel a part of things revolutionary. to make themselves feel big & important. 

--or from a nasty little stalking sexual pedophile predator type midget known on this website as "lester/terry lee the human dummy".-- 
(see my 3 past blog entries from newest to oldest titled: the new "willie tyler & lester" show., "stop targeting me & pay your rent punk!", and "for tiny terry lee...the clown formerly known as..."  for further/refresher information)--


--"let the truth be always told, never stole"!!! --
gnx, august 22, 2008.



r.i.p. 
bro. nat turner (1800-1831)

"the struggle continues"..... 

black fist, black power, black nation!!!!! 
black power, every hour!!!

happy 4th of u-lie amerikkka!!!





 (this post is an annual tradition here on the black fist blog.  wouldn't wanna break tradition ... now would we?)
 

today in america most people will be celebrating what is known as independence day or the 4th of july.

the black fist and those of you of like mind feel the complete opposite. we feel no independence and no reason to celebrate.
black people were in the wicked throes of amerikkkan chattel slavery in 1776.
general nikki x would like to take a moment on this national hell-a-day to give a little, how should i say this, aaahhh yes, ode to the 4th of july.
dig this.....

happy 4th of u-lie amerikkka!!!
stripes - represents the whip marks on our backs. the beatings-usually performed by another slave-were done in front of all the other slaves; thus terrorizing the others into submission, as well as creating disunity.

stars - are we saw when we were getting our asses beat by our overseers/officers and were forced to perform back-breaking slave labor in the hot deep-south sun.

red - is for the blood of the black soldiers that fought and died to help america gain its independence. george washington, thomas jefferson and the "founding" fathers would then label blacks as slaves/three-fifths human beings/private property in the constitution of the united states.


white - you know what that is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

blue - is how our forefathers/mothers felt when they were stolen from mother africa and never given reparations for over 300 years of forced, free labor.
i am not included within your glorious july 4th anniversary! your independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. your rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence obtained by your forefathers, is shared by you, not by me. the sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me.
this 4th of july is yours, not mine.
you may rejoice. i must mourn.
- frederick douglass
july 5, 1852 



here at the black fist blog we could not agree more!!!


black fist, black power, black nation!!!
