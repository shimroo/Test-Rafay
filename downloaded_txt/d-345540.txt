mrs. rosa parks gave us courage
to sit down to stand up for what we believe. 
							on december 1st, 1955 mrs. parks boarded a bus and took her seat in the 'colored' section. as she rode the bus home, it began to fill up. when the bus driver demanded mrs. parks to give up her seat, she refused and said, "no". police arrested her, and what followed is civil rights history.	 
							celebrating 65 years of courage 
							give and get back. taxpayers can take a deduction of up to $300 for cash donations when they file for their tax return.
