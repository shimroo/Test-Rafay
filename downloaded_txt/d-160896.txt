“amazing experience with dr. delaney with my nose job! my nose before and after is so incredible to see! would definitely recommend for anyone wanting to get their nose done.”

“best practice in houston. dr. delaney fixed my lip injections done at a med spa.  he took time to set out realistic goals for future work i’d like done. i’ve seen dr. kridel for years and he’s the best of the best. you are in the best care under these doctors and staff.”

k.k.











“i chose dr. delaney to address my concerns regarding facial asymmetry. he has such a sense of quiet confidence, and i immediately trusted him. he was able to perform multiple facial and neck procedures all on the same day.  he is talented, detail oriented, genuinely kind and caring.  his bedside manner is calm, warm and welcoming…” 
c.a.











“i am thrilled with my new face! i look just like myself only better. dr. kridel and his team couldn’t have done a better job, they are not only professional and exacting but warm and personable as well.  i would highly recommend dr russell kridel and his staff. you won’t go wrong.!”

m.c.











“dr. kridel and his team are truly incredible. my personal life savers.  i felt safe and confident in their ability to help me fix my perforated septum.  its been a journey, from diagnoses to surgery to post surgery. i felt that i was in the best hands possible. everyone was incredibly professional and understanding.  i never felt judged and most importantly i felt that there was a solution so that i could finally move forward with my lift.”

a.l.











“my only regret is not coming here in the first place for my rhinoplasty.  i had my first rhinoplasty form a local surgeon who mostly did boob jobs, big mistake.  my nose looked almost the same only it deviated to one side from my face making it asymmetrical and disturbing my facial harmony. dr. kridel and his staff were super kind made me feel welcome the entire journey. my nose looks amazing and i can’t thank him enough!”
