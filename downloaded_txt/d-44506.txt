    beetroot juice, green juice, and carrot juice.
    a complete juicing program. 


      nutritionists agree,  green  juice,  carrot juice, and  beetroot   juice provide the nutrients you need to stay healthy.  get all three juices in the garden trio. in an easy-to-use powder form, for a    well-rounded nutritional program.

according to nutritional researchers there are three juices that form the basis of any   effective juice program: green  juice,  carrot juice, and    beetroot juice. together, these three juices provide you with a simple way to add   their natural, healthy nutrients to your diet. 

 this is the aim garden trio.


aim barleylife also in caps.

    aim   barleylife is bursting with nutrition. it contains 2½ times the beta   carotene found in a an equivalent weight of raw carrots and about 25   times that found in an equivalent weight of raw broccoli. beta carotene   is an important antioxidant known to protect cells. it is implicated in   cardiovascular health and is believed to have anti-cancer benefits.

    research   has found that green barley extract has antioxidant and   anti-inflammatory activity, immune system support, and   cholesterol-lowering effects.  anecdotal evidence indicates that aim barleylife helps maintain whole   body health and provides increased energy and stamina.

aim justcarrots carrot juice. 

    it   is well established that carrots are a healthy food. they contain many   important nutrients — beta carotene and other carotenoids, b vitamins,   vitamin c, the minerals calcium and potassium, and much more. of all of   these, it is beta carotene that traditionally has received the most   attention.

aim just carrots has one of the highest sources   of natural beta carotene—up to 360* percent of the u.s. government’s   recommended daily allowance (rda). drinking one glass of aim just   carrots carrot juice provides you with 18,000 to 20,000* ius of beta carotene. in   addition to beta carotene, aim just carrots contains vitamin c, calcium,   and potassium. aim just carrots is monitored for maximum nutrient   levels.

aim redibeets beetroot juice.

    one cup of raw beetroot is high   in carbohydrates and low in fat. it contains phosphorus, sodium,   magnesium, calcium, iron, and potassium, as well as vitamins a and c,   niacin, folic acid, and biotin. although these are not found in “rda”   quantities, we must remember that nutrients derived from a natural   source may be “better” than those found in supplements, as they are   found in an organic form. when these nutrients are captured in a juicing   process, they remain in a form that is much easier to assimilate than   synthetic nutrients. the iron in beetroot juice, in particular, is noted for   being much more easily assimilated than man-made forms of iron.
