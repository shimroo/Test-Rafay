welcome to answerstat 



the information hub for healthcare contact center news and resources
answerstat is a leading resource providing medical contact centers with industry news and information to hospitals, healthcare organizations, and medical contact centers, along with key industry software and services vendors as well as support organizations.

healthcare call centers also aid in communication between patients and their medical practitioners, as well as facilitate effective communication between care providers. as there becomes greater emphasis on the quality of healthcare, there will be a corresponding need of medical providers to turn to healthcare call centers to more effectively and efficiently serve the medical needs of patients and their families.
in the united states there is constant pressure to contain healthcare costs while improving patient outcomes. contact centers and telehealth initiatives stand on the leading edge of driving many innovative healthcare solutions to accomplish these goals.
answerstat offers its support as the information portal for healthcare contact center news and resources. but don’t take your word for it:

“i have enjoyed your publication for years. you do a wonderful job of providing relevant content, in a personalized, down to earth manner.” – gina tabone, msn, rnc, vp strategic clinical solutions, accessnurse

answerstat covers topics of critical and relevant interest to healthcare contact centers, including telephone triage, physician referral, appointment setting, and reminders, medical telephone answering services (medical tas), and telehealth.
answerstat also addresses critical agent/hr issues and contact center management concerns. moreover, answerstat provides technology coverage on ip, voip, saas, telephony, telecommunications equipment, and platform software. it is distributed free to qualified readers, decision-makers, and influencers worldwide, with primary emphasis in the united states.
