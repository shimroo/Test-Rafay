deep, engaging, tailored: the tour for everyone in your party






conversations, not umbrella tours


"tim was great. knowledgeable. cheeky. motivating. it was a wonderful tour. we could have talked for hours. this is the exact reason small groups are the best. one on one, non scripted information from a dedicated and knowledgeable professional. thank you, tim."william l.london, uk




experts, not guides


“william literally writes the book(s) on the d-day memorials which led to an incredibly informative day tour. from age 77 to 11, we were all captivated by his knowledge and his ability to connect the dots.”carolyn b.normandy, france




tailored, not one-size fits all


“fantastic way to learn or refresh your understanding of key aspects of the history of britain... one of the great things about a context private tour is your guide. you can tailor your experience to your group's individual interests. this was our third context tour. we are 3 for 3 in terms of top shelf guides, each very knowledgeable and personable. highly recommended!"owen m.london, uk

your review:
our guide, peter, is a glaswegian insider with extensive knowledge of charles rennie mackintosh, having served as curator at glasgow school of art for 30 years. he arranged a thoughtfully curated tour introducing us to scottish art in the kelvingrove gallery and museum, riding the glasgow subway and included a special visit to the glasgow art club. our lunch together at the willows tea room was a delightful interlude. peter’s vast knowledge helped acquaint us with glasgow’s art and culture and a provided a very deep dive into mackintosh design. highly recommend!
