class action suit filed on behalf of tx lottery players
 re: the stolen $95 million jackpot
nettles vs rook tx lp, gary grief and igt
this lawsuit was filed on behalf of all texas 
lottery 
players on 2/14/25. our $95 million jackpot was
stolen and we want our money back. they did us
dirty and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it.
read the court  filing - it's self explanatory! click here (pdf)
ya'll keep asking ... can i trust the texas lottery?
 state senators have finally come to players rescue
senate finance hearing - a must watch!  
i have sooooo much news to share but i can't post 
it 
all right now. what you must do is watch the hearing 
 held 2/12/24 at the capitol then decide 
for 
yourself if you 
can or want to  trust our state lottery. so you know, when
 the hearing begins, they discuss the tlc's budget for maybe 
 20 to 25 minutes then after that, the show begins. click here

lottery.com to sell texas lottery 
tickets in europe and africa
texas scorecard by daniel greer 2/6/25
it was announced this week that lottery.com 
intends to sell 
texas lottery tickets 
to international players. even after
having no retailer license and after filing 
false information 
with the sec last week. 
if ya'll only knew what all 
was "really" 
going on here, you'd be calling for law 
enforcement to start putting handcuffs on 
several 
individuals. when is the tlc 
going to stop these people 
 from winning 
our games and permitting such activity? 
there is more to come. click here
