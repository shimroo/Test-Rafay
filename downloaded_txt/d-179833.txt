cultural competence


feb 20, 01:00 pm - feb 20, 03:00 pm

credits: 2


                                        what is cultural competency?  
"cultural competency means being aware of your own cultural beliefs and values and how these may be different from other cultures—including being able to learn about and honor the different cultures of those you live and work with."

the three elements of cultural competence are:
• attitudes.
• skills.
• knowledge.

4 steps to becoming culturally competent
• learn about your culture and biases. many of the biases we hold are  unconscious, meaning we're not aware we 
           have them. 
• actively listen. active listening is a useful tool for practicing cultural competency. 
• show interest through participation. 
• seek out cultural knowledge.

buyer confusion in a transitioning market


feb 21, 10:00 am - feb 21, 01:00 pm

credits: 3


                                        when the market shifts out of a hot sellers market, buyers expectations and behaviors change.  seller concessions, inspections and house sale contingencies may no longer be out of the question. 

rising interest rates and slower demand may also change the landscape of financing options. 

some buyers may park themselves on the “fence” and attempt to wait for “the bottom” when it comes to lower prices. 

in this course, we will examine these conditions and how to help buyers navigate through what might seem like a confusing market.

buyer representation best practices


feb 21, 10:00 am - feb 21, 01:00 pm

credits: 3


                                        when being interviewed and hired by a seller, the knowledgeable licensee successfully reviews the agency disclosure form followed by a written listing agreement. with informed consent, the seller who hires you signs both documents. now that buyer advocacy has come to age, and now that all buyer clients must sign some kind of representation agreement, we’re following the same procedure with buyer clients by successfully reviewing the agency disclosure form followed by a written representation agreement when being hired.

in this course we’ll include the representation agreements that not only clarify the “rules of the road” for both the licensee and the buyer, but also shift risk while offering professional, quality services. let’s face it ... today’s buyers want, need and expect your advice and advocacy. all clients do. and we want, need and expect their trust and loyalty for the value we bring to the table. 

we have a right to be hired, and we have a right to earn a success fee for our services. so, if you stumble through the buyer representation agreements and wish you had a better understanding and better, smoother scripting, this course is your guide.
