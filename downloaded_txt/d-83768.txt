helping communities grow since 1854 



the harrisburg area ymca was founded in 1854 by prominent businessmen looking for ways to keep young men off of the streets and out of trouble. the objective was to improve the “spiritual and social conditions of young men.” over the next century and a half, the association not only survived and grew, but remained true to the spirit of its original mission as it provided help for the city’s needy, relief aid for local soldiers during times of war, and guidance for the young men and women of harrisburg to grow and mature. 



serving the community & building strong futures 



it is our mission to provide services to aid in the spiritual, mental and physical development of each person enabling them to be beneficial and contributing members of our society. we are still fulfilling that mission today by granting over $500,000 worth of scholarships to families in the harrisburg area. the harrisburg area ymca offers quality child care, swimming lessons, the teen achievers club, health and fitness classes and wellness areas, summer camps for all ages, along with a wide variety of other activities that appeal to all ages.our active older adults take trips together, and strive to maintain healthy lifestyles through activities at the ymca. our child care program is the one of the largest providers in the harrisburg area, serving children from northern dauphin to the camp curtin area, downtown and before and after-school care on the east and west shores. our swim lesson program celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2006 – and the y is still the largest organization offering swimming lessons to the members of our community. 






our history















for youth development 



at the y, we believe that children learn best when they are supported and challenged, and our recreation staff works with each child to ensure maximum learning and development through our youth recreation programs and education programs. these programs are geared toward teamwork and sportsmanship development as well as skill work. our volunteers and staff provide the ideal environment for learning and growing in groups, and the children in our care experience new ways of looking at problems, making friendships and working with diverse teams.in addition, we believe that all families should have access to the quality child care that they need. that’s why we not only provide the best childcare in the nation; we work hard to give families the financial aid they need to enroll children in ymca programs. from ymca infant and toddler care to ymca teens, the ymca is the best place for children to learn and grow. 



for healthy living 



in communities across the nation, the y is the leading voice on health and well-being. with a mission centered on balance, the y brings families closer together, encourages healthy living, and fosters connections through fitness, sports, fun, and shared interests. as a result, millions of youth, adults, and families are receiving the support, guidance, and resources needed to achieve greater health and well-being for their spirit, mind, and body. at our y, you’ll find both competitive and casual activities ranging from team sports to social clubs. with a class for every interest, you can explore new forms of exercise and make new friends. 



 







 



for social responsibility 



at the y, we believe that everyone, no matter what their circumstances deserves to live a healthy, whole and responsible life. that is why we have taken on a focus on social responsibility. every day, we serve a membership of children, adults, families and seniors from every socioeconomic background. programs are innovative, engaging, and forward-thinking. and because of your help, we are poised to do more. the ymca’s goal; that everyone in the harrisburg community have access to the ymca regardless of their ability to pay for services, is realized through financial assistance to those who can benefit from child care and membership at the ymca, but cannot afford services. we thank the many volunteers, board members, donors and staff for their tireless work and energy to ensure that our mission is offered to everyone in the community. 



the y. for a better us.® 



you know the challenges that we face in the harrisburg area. people of all ages and backgrounds are struggling to reach their full potential. more and more children face seemingly insurmountable learning gaps. families find it difficult to spend quality time together. people are not connected to their neighbors and face time happens through a phone. and instead of seeing the income gap shrink, it seems all we do is watch it grow.but when challenges arise, the y and the community have always worked together to provide solutions.. after over 160 years of serving the harrisburg community, the y understands what our community needs to be its best. working with supporters of all kinds, the y provides everyone the opportunity to be healthy and thrive, to connect with others, and contribute to a better community. everything the y does is in service of making us – as individuals and a community – better.for a better you. for a better community. for a better country.for a better us.®
