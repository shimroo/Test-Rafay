paddy and the pale boys are not 
for the faint of heart. the band's 
 raucous, two-fisted romp through irish music can be 
experienced at any number of events throughout the course of the year, from irish 
festivals, pubs and st. patrick's day events to private parties and weddings for 
the irish non-conformist rebels. paddy's favorite 
sons never fail to send them home with a smile on their face, sore feet and plenty 
of stories to share the next day. paddy and the 
pale boys play the traditional songs and music of ireland and scotland, along 
with some good ol' boy country and rock'n roll. the band's original numbers are 
found throughout each of their three cds. these songs include sit like a 
man, dakota girl,  twin sisters of blue hill, 
eleanor and others. some of these 
band's recordings are available for download on this web site including songs 
from the band's latest cd release, sit like a man. within 
this site you can also find out more about the band and its members, check out 
the upcoming schedule of performances, browse through the photo galleries and 
even order your very own and very official paddy and the pale boys t-shirt.
