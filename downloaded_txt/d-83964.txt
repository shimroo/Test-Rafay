all about me 
learn all about
your goofy webmaster: education,
work, hobbies, interests, my wife, my dogs, you name it... 
existential-phenomenology

what is
existential-phenomenology? if you
can pronounce it, you're doing well. this page includes an overview of
the philosophy, as well as a long list of links to pages on major
thinkers,
such as heidegger, husserl, merleau-ponty, sartre, and much more...

psychoanalysis
and beyond 
explore
psychoanalytic thought from freud
onward. you'll find an overview, plus tons of links from major
psychoanalytic
thinkers, including freud, jung, adler, rank, reich, and many, many
more... 
perennial
philosophy 
the term
"perennial philosophy" was coined
by leibniz, but popularized by aldous huxley, according to whom it
pertains
to a primary concern "with the one, divine reality substantial to the
manifold
world of things and lives and minds." this page includes an overview
and
tons of links to thinkers in the perennial philosophy tradition. 

myth
& metaphor 
drawing on the
thought of thinkers such as
carl jung, levi-strauss, cassirer, joseph campbell and james hillman,
this
page is dedictated to the exploration of myth & metaphor. 

music

all the best music
of the past, plus the best
music of 2000, including my top 25, and picks from rolling stone,
                        spin, entertainment
weekly, and amazon.com. 
movies 
my top ten list of
best films every year since
1980 (and more to come). includes links to pages with more information
on the films, actors, directors, and official websites. all direct
links
go to the internet movie database (imdb), which is a fantastic resource
for film fanatics like myself. you can also purchase videos, dvds,
books,
scripts, and soundtracks from amazon.com. 
related links 
a mind-bogglingly
large collection of links.
this will keep you busy for several months...
