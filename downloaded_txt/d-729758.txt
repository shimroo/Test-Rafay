about us
this formidable movement started more than 60 years ago. its mission is to support every company (manufacturer, distributor, rebuilder, service provider, retailer, and broker) who is not an oem manufacturer or dealer. that includes every size and type of business that finds a way on a daily basis to impact our industry…whose critical common bond is their independence from the original equipment manufacturers and who is committed to providing solutions to customers who are looking for alternatives to the oem.
