what we do
 





employment institute

employment institute
auberle believes in the transformative power of meaningful employment. our flagship workforce development program, the employment institute, prepares the unemployed and underemployed with an opportunity to change the trajectory of their lives (and their family’s lives) by connecting them with a career level job with benefits – all while wrapping them in auberle’s vast array of holistic services to ensure their long-term success.

housing

housing
auberle places a strong emphasis on sustainable housing as the cornerstone for breaking the cycle of generational poverty. our family emergency shelters address immediate needs, while our interconnected housing and homeless prevention programs counsel families on financial literacy and mortgage assistance to move them toward stable housing.

young adult services

young adult services
auberle recognizes that not all young people have a safety net in place to catch them during challenging times. our programs for young adults are designed to care for and empower young people who are transitioning out of the foster care system, experiencing unstable housing, and learning to live independently so they can thrive as successful members of our community.
more






foster care

foster care
auberle understands that individual success is intricately tied to family well-being and community support. as the largest non-kinship foster care agency in allegheny county, responsible for 50% of teenagers and 25% of children overall, our goal is to provide safe and loving homes for children while equipping parents with life-improving resources to keep families together when possible.
more






behavioral health

behavioral health
auberle realizes the connected nature of poverty with mental and behavioral health and invests in a variety of services that empower individuals to overcome trauma, build resilience, and treat addiction through a family-focused lens. our unique programs meet people where they are – whether at school, at home or in another group setting – to address mental and emotional health challenges and foster sustained success.

our work is unlocking big change in western pennsylvania
providing holistic services to individuals in need of a helping hand has been at the heart of auberle’s mission since 1952. from basic needs like a loving family, safe housing, and life skills development, to more complex challenges like quality mental health care and career training – auberle is a creative problem-solver, collaborative partner, and innovative program provider across the region.
