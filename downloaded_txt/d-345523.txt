physics and astronomy - study the world and the universe
the study of physics & astronomy allows us to address the age-old questions, âhow
                     do things work?â and âwhere do we come from?â physics forms the basis for other sciences
                     and much of our technology. additionally, an understanding of physics plays a crucial
                     role in addressing many important challenges such as energy production, semiconductor
                     technology, and climate change.

world-class faculty ââ  supported by grants such as from the department of energy, getting time on major
                        telescopes and computational facilities, advancing the fields of bioimaging and radiation
                        oncology
cutting edge research ââ  the origins of the elements,â  planets, stars and star clusters, and galaxies
hands-on experience â complete research as an undergraduate, use a 1.0m telescope, networking opportunities
                        and social activities with the award-winning chapter of the society of physics students (sps)
state-of-the-art facilities â wright center for photovoltaics innovation and commercialization (pvic), toledo heavy ion accelerator (thia), ritter astrophysical research center (rarc) including the ritter 1.0m telelscope, ritter planetarium and brooks observatory, radiation and diagnostic equipment to perform research in medical physics, several
                           parallel computing clusters, as well as access to the ohio supercomputer cluster, used for theoretical and computational research
â variety of programs â undergraduate bachelor of the arts and bachelor of the sciences degrees in physics
                           and in astronomy, nsf research experience for undergraduates (reu), doctoral program in physics and in astronomy, including the only campep-accredited program in state of ohio with both ms, and ph.d. degrees and residency
