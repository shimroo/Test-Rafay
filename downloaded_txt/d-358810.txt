	 hey donnelly, you cheated!  take your punishment!
	 
    


i thought that if you broke the rules, you would be punished.  there is a reason that people have made rules.  we don't want scumbags like brendon donnelly unfairly taking an advantage over everyone else.  that is percisely what happened on tuesday, june 21, when the washington nationals beat the the anahiem angels who still won't accept the fact that they play in anahiem and not los angelos.angels reliever brendon donnelly was called in and nationals manager frank robinson expertly called the umpires out to check donnelly's glove for pine tar.  pitchers can gain an advantage over the batter by putting pine tar in their gloves then rubbing the ball in the tar to make it harder to hit.  donnelly's glove was found to have pine tar, so he was ejected and later suspended for 10 games.  he cheated, so now he is getting punished.but donnelly doesn't think he should be punished.  he is appealing the 10-game suspension, now saying "i'm not using it [pinetar] to cheat."  what else would you use pinetar for?  last time i checked, pine tar does nothing but helping you cheat.  if it wasn't going to help him perform better, he wouldn't have used it.  this is almost as laughable as barry bonds' interviews.  if you cheat, you have got to suffer the consequences.frank robinson was also suspended one game and fined $1,000, because angels manager mike scioscia approached robinson after donnelly was suspended.  he tried to appeal the punishment for good reason.  why should he be punished for what scioscia did?  granted, the punishment wasn't harsh, but he shouldn't be punished period.  scioscia got the same punishment even though he initiated it.this seems to be the norm now in sports and in life.  students get away with breaking the rules.  some people at my school cheated on a test, got f's after they were caught, then got their parents to call the school, and got to retake the tests.  in the nba, the pacers fight with the fans, but then a few of them appeal their punishments and win.  nba commishioner dan stern had nothing to do with overturning the penalties.  it was an "arbitrator," someone who is not involved at all in sports and just feels bad for anyone who bitches to him.  last i checked, dan stern was the commishioner, and he is allowed to make decisions.  those players should be happy that they aren't going to jail for assualt.if you want to win, sometimes you have to break the rules, but if you get caught, accept the consequences.

	 i know who will be the next broncos rb!
	 
    


denver rbs-pick carefully and you might have a title!all eyes are on denver right now as it is the changing of the back. it seems to be an annual fantasy football tradition now to change the running back every off-season. whoever starts gains 1,000+ yards in a season. however, that might change this season. for years during the broncos 1,000 yard running back era, alex gibbs was the man making it happen. he became the broncos offensive line coach in 1984 only to leave in ‘87, but he came back in 1995. that was terrell davis's rookie season. that was also the broncos first 1,000-yard season off their nine-year streak. alex gibbs left last off-season to be the o-line and assistant head coach for the falcons. that year, atlanta finished first in rushing with an awe-inspiring 5.1 yards per carry. they were 14th the year before. that can be attributed to a degree to vick being injured for most of the year, but it is still an amazing feat by an amazing coach. gibbs' teaching will probably stay with the offensive lineman who he has taught for so long. the only loss on offensive line was all pro guard dan neil.tatum bellbell is definitely the most talented of the broncos rbs, but can he take the punishment of carrying the ball 20+ times a game? i think not. he was plagued by injuries all of last preseason. just as his first injury was healing, he broke his thumb, setting him back even more.  as you know, injuries are a big turn-off in fantasy football. in his senior season at oklahoma state, it was his ankle that kept him out of some preseason practices and later cost him two games late in the season. when he does play, he has been impressive to say the least. he had 75 carries last season for 396 yards (5.3 yards per carry) and three touchdowns. he only caught five catches, but for eighty yards (16.0 average) showing he can really move with the ball after the catch.maurice clarettforget the fact that maurice clarett sued the nfl, lied to the police, and bashed ohio state. that all means nothing when you look at the fact that he has only played one injury-free season of high school football. it was his freshman year, so he didn't get many carries anyway. he missed a game in his freshman year at osu because of a shoulder injury and missed the first half of the next season due to a suspension for lying to the police about a stolen car. if clarett can't survive in high school and college football, how do you think he'll do in the pros? how will he do in the same league with players like ray lewis and others who will want to knock his head off? as lavar arrington put it at the 2004 pro bowl, "if he can make it that rookie year without being assassinated, i think he'll be alright."quentin griffingriffin and dayne seem to be the fantasy front-runners as they are the only two who can stay healthy. griffin started out last year as the starter. he exploded for 156 yards and 3 touchdowns (2 running, 1 receiving) against kansas city. griffin is only 5-7 and 195 pounds, so he can't take the punishment of having 20+ carries, nor can he break many tackles. he has great speed though, which is why he won quite a few footraces in the kansas city game. during the game, he had a few huge gains, but for the most part, he was stopped for minimal gains or losses. further statistical study validates that perception. this chart shows how many times he gained certain amounts of yards:  quentin griffin vs. kansas city  0 or    fewer yards 0-3    yards 3-5    yards 5-10    yards 10-15    yards 15 or    more yards   7 4 3 2 2 3  to compare him to a better running back (in nfl terms and in fantasy football terms), let's look at priest holmes's performance in the same game.  note his consistency in actually gaining positive yardage: priest holmes vs. denver  0 or    fewer yards 0-3    yards 3-5    yards 5-10    yards 10-15    yards 15 or    more yards   3 8 5 6 3 1  in the four other games griffin played in, he only gained 155 yards on 62 carries (2.5 average).ron daynequite frankly, he is not a very good running back. in his four years with the giants, he gained 2,067 yards on 585 carries (3.5 average). he tried running over people with his big 245-pound frame, but he wasn't very fast. he is basically the opposite of quentin griffin. in denver, there won't be many people to run over because the offensive line clears them out, but with all pro guard dan neil leaving in free agency, the broncos might need to have someone big. also, with the inadequacies of all the other denver running backs that i have mentioned, he might be the only competent one. not many fantasy owners think he will be “the one”, but he might surprise us, resulting in a great late-round sleeper.the denver running back situation becomes murkier every season. this season seems to be the hardest to predict yet. ron dayne just might be the top contender! most people are going to be looking at tatum bell. bell will go pretty early in most drafts, and dayne will be available near the final rounds. just like last year, when no one thought droughns would win the starting job, no one expects dayne to win it. the odds must be 50-1 on him, but the dark horse will come out from the dust and win. no, not giacomo (the winner of the kentucky derby for those of you who have better things to do than watch a horse run around a circle), but ron dayne.
