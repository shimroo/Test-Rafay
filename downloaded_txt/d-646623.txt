 google reviews












					peter crisp				


					great product & service.				





					peter marsden				


the product arrived quickly and most importantly fixed my issue. the rattle from the rear springs has disappeared. i am so happy as it was very annoying!






					robert jones				


great to deal with and polybushes have made the world of difference in comfort to my defender






					paul pardington				


this is the second lot i’ve put on my car, which has now done over 200k. they’re much better than standard bushes.






					rust & oil				


1st time i’ve bought directly from polybush….. impressed






					mark southgate				


great product i have used them a lot and always fast despatch






					justin muers				


due to a mail strike the product arrived later than i wanted it to, but, that is not the fault of polybush. i love the product and look forward to my next opportunity to install their bushes in my vehicles.






					ryan dunn				


always been happy with polybush. never disappointed.
changed to another brand once that was allegedly better. load of nonsense. didn’t last a year on the racecar. back on polybush, 2yrs passed and haven’t looked back






					nathan gibson				


great product, good customer service. used on my fiesta time attack car with no issues. very happy with them






					graham c				


all bushes on my land rover defender (1995) have now been replaced with poybushes. the effect is a noticable drop in road noise being transferred to the cab. the handling and ride is now smoother. when they need replacing many years hence, that will be a lot easier than getting the old standard bushes out!






					richard neath				


full set of bushes fitted to my vw transporter. i can honestly say that the difference is utterly incredible. the pot-holed roads up here on skye suddenly seem far less dreadful! the decrease in body-roll is really noticeable also.
great service and so approachable. polybush – a massive thank you.






					tony manyvong				


would recommend definitely buying again, even all the way from states!! great quality and very easy to install on my 1990 mazda mx5 miata.






					marcus m blake				


while all the pieces did not fit for my vehicle – stabilizer bar ends for my l200 k34t gjentur – everything else did, front and rear. it has been two years since the installation and they are still in good condition with tons of off-road km under them and what looks like tons more to go (if allowed, 4.5 stars)
i strongly recommend products from polybush.






					richard neath				


i ordered a full set of bushes fitted to my vw transporter. i can honestly say that the difference is utterly incredible, the potholed roads up here on skye suddenly seem far less dreadful!
the decrease in body roll is also really noticeable. polybush, you provide great service and are so approachable. a massive thank you!






					pete calkin				


a big difference right out of the box. the van feels tighter and more direct without feeling harsh.
everything just feels ‘newer’ in terms of ride quality and driving feel.






					fiesta st150 race series				


since fitting the polybush bushes to our fiesta st150 race cars the handling has been vastly improved, lap times have also dropped and the cars are far more driveable.
