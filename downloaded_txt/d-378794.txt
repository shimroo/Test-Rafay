tgea pride
chaiya and rabbit represented tgea for a second year in a row at the safe space nova sponsored pride prom on may 31st at the beautiful alexandria torpedo factory.  hats off to the organizers who held an amazing event for queer youth to celebrate a prom as their authentic selves.  in addition to popping music and great food, there were quiet spaces, many community booths, and door prizes for the attendees. if you have a teen, you may want to consider this for next year!

on june 1st, chaiya and rabbit also represented tgea at alexandria pride. a highlight of the event was the inauguration of two pride cross walks near market square. this was tgea’s second year at this event and the weather, ambiance, and vibes were perfect! 

chaiya is leaving the area but not the cause or tgea!
by rev emma chattin
chaiya will be leaving the area and relocating to another state this month. she is leaving her role as educational outreach participant and facilitator for the parent’s group, however she will always be committed to the cause, and will remain a tgea board member and remote participant. (if covid taught us anything it’s that we can always bridge the distance between us.)
i met chaiya in may of 2014. we had many conversations, and she joined the first parent’s group a month later, on june 27, 2014. in 2016 i asked her to join the reconstituted tgea, and she was elected as a board member on august 28 of that year. she has served on the tgea board ever since (8 years!), serving a term or two as clerk, filling a variety board functions, participating and leading numerous educational outreaches, and staffing the tgea table at many’a pride event.
i will miss the proximity of chaiya’s presence as both a dear friend and a co-worker in service to the community. at the same time, i am excited for her as she begins this new phase of her life, and i look forward to what new things may come from her next adventure! i mean this in all sincerity: go chaiya!  (but not too far) 🙂 
if you would like to drop chaiya a note, please click this link!


 community notes
special thanks to orit of the wren project!
for sharing her table space up front at reston pride (the organizers placed our purchased space as the last tent on the far row).
you’re the best orit! 

pride proclamation and rally on thursday june 13th!
we just wanted to get the word out that we are doing a rally for the pride proclamation on thursday of this week before the school board meeting. we would love for you to come and support the proclamation, speak at the rally, and/or participate in the school board photo after the proclamation.
here is the link to the event on fb: https://www.facebook.com/share/kucugtj2d1fyfvid/
we’ve had some successes this year and we want to celebrate them. joy!
we will bring rainbow m&m cookies for the rally.
﻿yum!
-vanessa and chris
