allen iverson : iverson's image both good and bad after summer







posted by dal on   when allen iverson helped two college students in a car wreck in virginia in august, few noticed his good samaritan deed.
now, roughly six weeks later, in the wake of a pending lawsuit against him, people are noticing iverson and the bad publicity that seems to follow him.

"i could do a million things positive and everybody would talk about the one negative thing," iverson said. "i'm used to it and it don't bother me that people don't recognize, as far as you people and other people that don't matter. the only people that do matter is the people that i do it for, the charities, the people that benefit from it."

nuggets : denver nuggets lose in 5 to san antonio spurs







posted by dal on   
 
the nuggets' post-season run came to an end, as the spurs beat the nuggets 93-78 in 5 games. it was one of iverson's worst playoff performances, where he made just 31 of 92 shots, after scoring 31 in the their game 1 win.
"i felt like this was the worst playoff series that i've played in my career," iverson said. "it was kind of frustrating, coming into a new situation, wanting to be the one that gets this team over the hump, get them out of the first round. and to play like i'm not capable of playing is just frustrating."
but the outlook looks good for the nuggets, we saw a glimpse of the nuggets full-force near the end of the season where they won 10 of 11. once they get a full training camp together, they could possibly be a top 1-2-3 seed in the west. hopefully, they'll be able to keep camby in the off-season, and have a healthy k-mart come back in october.

however, the nuggets aren't celebrating just yet. two years ago, they were in the same situation where they won game one, but lost the next four straight. nuggets will need to stay poised to beat the spurs in what will definitely be a tough series.

iverson even got ejected from the game in the 4th.  after the game, his quote about steve javie was very interesting. âi thought i got fouled on that play, and i said i thought that he was calling the game personal, and he threw me out. his fuse is real short anyway, and i should have known that i couldnât say anything anyway. itâs been something personal with me and him since i got in the league. this was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad.â  that's 3 straight losses for denver...

nuggets : mile 'hi' to a.i.







posted by dal on   
ai made his highly anticipated debut as a denver nugget, all decked out in baby blue, white and yellow (still need to get used to the colours), and played a good game despite a loss to sacramento.
he fought through jet lag, car sickness and pregame  butterflies that felt more like birds before he finally got to play his first  game for the denver nuggets.  he posted 22 points, and 10 assists -- not bad considering he hasn't been playing any ball in game or practice for a week.  he would've had 20 assists had his teammates made their shots.
overall, ai's debut brought a new level of excitment to denver...even though they did lose, the fans got to see how exciting it was to watch a.i. play hard, hustle, pass the ball and doing everything he can to win the ball game.   can't wait until the next game.

allen iverson : iverson traded by 76ers to nuggets







posted by dal on   it's finally happened!  after a decade with the philadelphia 76ers -- from being rookie of the year to being the league's mvp - allen iverson has left the sixers for good.  it's been a funny series of events.  think about it: iverson gets benched by the coach and gm, and then iverson demands a trade.  they couldn't find the right team until denver nuggets and new york knicks get into an ugly brawl in which all-star carmelo anthony is suspended 15 games...which then leads to nuggets desperately seeking a superstar like allen iverson.  an amazing turn of events.
personally, i'm excited.  finally a change of scenery for allen iverson and another shot at the playoffs with a fellow playoff team.  the two highest scorers in the l playing side-by-side.  that's gotta be exciting to watch!
i know all of you philly loyalists are going to hate this one...but face it - what's done is done -- move on, if you're an a.i. fan then i'm sure you'll continue to follow him as a denver nugget -- just like this site will continue to cover a.i.

sixers : unhappy iverson scuttles trade to bobcats







posted by dal on   allen iverson was nearly shipped to the charlotte bobcats but his unhappiness at joining the newest national basketball association team reportedly doomed the deal.
charlotte was one of the few clubs that could fit iverson's contract into their salary cap. the hornets spend 38 million dollars in salaries, about 15 million dollars shy of the nba's cap of 53.1 million dollars a team.
players who likely would have joined the 76ers would have contracts that expire within 18 months, meeting philadelphia's needs.
