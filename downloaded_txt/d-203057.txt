"the loss of trust in public institutions calls for a new generation of leaders who can restore americans’ confidence in democratic norms and in one another. schar school students are uniquely qualified for this mission: in my experience, they are humble, compassionate, hard-working, and ready to take advantage of opportunities that come their way. a schar school education prepares these students to effectively manage resources, devise and evaluate complex policies, and recognize emerging threats."

mark j. rozell, dean, schar school of policy and government
