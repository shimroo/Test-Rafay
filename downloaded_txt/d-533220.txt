come and join us
hunting can be a controversial subject. we believe in what we do, but we respect the right of other people not to agree with us.  however, before you make up your mind on hunting, please do come and visit us and see it for yourself. we are proud of the contribution we make to the local community, to farming and conservation and to the rural economy. if you would like to come out for a day with the fitzwilliam (you don’t need a horse – for every person who hunts on a horse, five or six follow hounds in cars, on bicycles or on their feet) then contact the hunt secretaries via the contact details on the contacts page.
