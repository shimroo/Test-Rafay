we have developed a new process that can achieve large amounts of rust in just a few days time on otherwise brand new steel. on any of our lamps that have steel, we can do a rust finish. if you’ve been looking for a old looking lamp or lantern, and our aged finishes were not your cup of tea, a rust finish with the bright oranges, reds, and browns may be perfect!ask about this finishes’ availability on any of our lamps or lanterns!

at times, our customers approach us in search of specific lamps that haven’t been manufactured in decades, and sometimes even more than a century. they request us to replicate these unique pieces. one such project involves recreating one of the most exquisite railcar chandeliers ever featured in the old catalogs – the 2-arm and 4-arm fleur-de-lis adams & westlake center lamps.our current assignment entails crafting three of the 2-arm fixtures and one grand 4-arm chandelier for the rear observation room of a coach owned by the president of a prominent railroad company. this coach boasts exceptional trimmings, and these lamps were no exception. as we progress, i’ll share more photos of our work.the initial step involves designing every component of these lamps and devising our production strategy. subsequently, we’ll create masters for casting. fortunately, resin 3-d printing will greatly assist us in this endeavor. castable resin “waxes” eliminate the need for silicone molds, ensuring that the quality of these brass castings will be nearly perfect to the clean 3-d models we have produced.

who knew an 1880’s railcar chandelier would fit so well?

a customer ordered one of our railroad car chandeliers… but for the first time, not for a railcar, but instead his kitchen! he ordered a dual oil/electric set up, so that he can use the lamp causally for kitchen light but so the lamp is also authentic and not just a facsimile. the nickel plated finish was the obvious choice for the setting, and we think it looks great!
