there are many ways to market your business but one of the most popular ones is direct mail. some contractors will mail individual pieces like sales letters, postcards, etc. from lists they purchase. others will use what is called marriage mail. an example of marriage is val pak, (there are many others). many home improvement type of businesses use marriage mail very successfully. while you can only zero in by zip code, unlike individual mailing, marriage mail is much less expensive. some contractors will use both methods.

the single biggest mistake that is made by most who use either method of direct mail is to mail to a list once, harvest what leads come in and then go to the next area. big mistake! one of the keys to successful advertising is frequency. the more times that a prospect sees information about your company the more inclined they are to remember and call you when the need arises. if you mail once and your competition mails once it becomes a race to see who can mail into an area and just happen to hit that prospect that is ready to buy at the right time. trust me, the last one in wins and the first one is never remembered.

when planning direct mail plan on sending mail to the same list several times during the year so the prospects have a better chance of remembering you. the best direct mail response is only about a 1% response rate. frequency will more than double that return rate. if you mail 1,000 pieces and get 10 leads chances are that mailing 3,000 pieces to the same list will net you not 30 but from 50 to 60 leads. this will increase the effectiveness of your mailing and significantly reduce your lead and job cost.

if you want to really increase your response different media to your mix. for example, distribute door hangers or flyers in the same neighborhood as you mail into. you can also get email lists and email marketing, direct mail and door hangers will maximize your response and decrease your overall expense of generating leads.


everyone says that this is the information age and that the internet has changed everything. well in some respects, things are different especially when you consider that the world wide web is not ever 10 years old. one of the things that have not changed is the consumer's hunger for facts and for being comfortable when they make major decisions.
