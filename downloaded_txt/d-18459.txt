books that matter by poets who inspire




support  ❤️































if nothing
"unflinching and tender, this volume affirms nienow’s distinctive poetic gifts."—publisher's weekly, starred review










zombie vomit mad libs
“zombie vomit mad libs by duy đoàn (nov., alice james) includes all the play, allusion, and potential violence of its title. it brings diacritics to english, suicides to lists, and screenplays to poems with a frantic, perplexed drive. … the volume cites movies and other texts with the scattered, interrupted brief thoughts that characterize its zombieness like a new genre of horror on the page."—poetry northwest 










wish ave
"...a haunting study of fateful human relationships and the damage we do ourselves as we damage others."—library journal










the holy & broken bliss
"ostriker confronts the intricate dance between spiritual despair and revelatory beauty in her ethereal 17th collection. ... [the holy & broken bliss] resonates long after the final page, reminding readers that even in a fractured, plague-stricken world, there is still a living, breathing force within all things."—publishers weekly










autobiomythography of
"...in this visually lush and lyrically dexterous collection of poems, falomo offers his readers work that bends and reimagines the limits of language, blends the divine with the digital present, contemporary music with the voices of the past while the speaker traverses the friction between their american & nigerian heritage."—i.s. jones, author of spells of my name
