          payments to nonresident aliens 
      


payments to nonresident aliens are generally subject to income tax withholding of 30 percent, unless the foreign national is eligible to receive a tax treaty benefit. before inviting or otherwise agreeing to pay a non-u.s. citizen, departments must ensure that the individual is or will be present in the u.s. under a visa classification that allows them to legally receive payment.

          recovery of payroll overpayment 
      


overpayments are defined as wage and salary payments in excess of what an employee is owed.  departments have the responsibility to review payroll earnings and benefit reports each pay period to identify errors and should report any discrepancies immediately.  employees are responsible to verify the accuracy of their pay each pay period and immediately report any discrepancies to their supervisor or the payroll department.








  procedure for recovery of payroll overpayments
