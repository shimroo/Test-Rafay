yes! thank you very much. there was also a place that only served breakfast and lunch. ran by a very colorful lady. her name might have been heidi and the restaurant might of been called hedi's. but man loved that place too. loved the loud vibe of the locals and loved the omelets and the blueberries compost topped pancakes!

my family rented the only house on 45th street, newport  beach in the 1950s but i cannot remember the address.â  
                        the yard faced balboa blvd. as well as the  garage!45 st hadnât been built yet. my grandparents had built  their house on 46th st at what later would be neptune! 
                        hope you can tell me address. i think it might have been  133.
                        thanking you in advance,

hey jim, it's  annabelle. 
                    i am the blind woman  who has memories of sailing on the m.v. phoenix glass bottom boat with my  american uncle joey when he was the captain for the santa catalina island  company in 1988. i'm not sure if you have this, but i wonder where i could find  a recording of the boat whistle of her sister, the m.v. princess. i'd even like  a recording of the s.s. catalina and the s.s. avalon, both known in their days  as the "great white steamers". where can i find these whistles? also,  whatever happened to the recordings of the whistles you used to have on tales  of balboa? things like the balboa ferry, catalina flyer, m.v. phoenix, and  tikiboat? every time i press enter on the links that say "click to hear  the m.v. phoenix", and the like, nothing happens, just a message appears  on the screen in a graphic that says, "please wait". if you have any  further information, questions, or suggestions for me, please feel free to  email me at any time, as i check my emails several times each day. if you like,  you can also give me a call as well. my phone number is 541-844-1558. if you  get an answering machine when the phone rings, don't be fooled by the greeting,  as it is simply me with an australian accent, which by the way is my natural  accent, and not some fake one that i put on. i hope someday that i will be able  to switch to my natural accent. when i talk to people on the phone, my english  is what a lot of people call an "american" accent, which really irks  me to the point of getting mad. i'd rather say that it's "unaccented  english", or "plain english". here's what i say in the greeting,  in case you can't fully understand it. 
                    g'day, mate! you've reached the house of annabelle! the lovely house of  australia! i can't come to the phone right now, but if you leave your name,  your number, and a message after the tone, i'll get back with you as soon as i  can. thank you and have a nice day! cheerio!". 
                    kind regards, 
                    annabelle

  hello jim
                    i am writing from lake charles, louisiana. do you know  anything about edward abbott and his brother in law, clinton andre. they were  in balboa in 1880s and in 1989 abbott was thought to have built a cottage on  the corner of bay avenue and palm street. edward abbott's brother came to  southern louisiana and that is where my family is descended from. enjoyed  reading about balboa on your website.thanks

jim:  thanks for making this site available to us. i'd  just like to welcome by buddy mike back to the wedge. he's been on an extended  mission and is now anxious to make an appearance in the surf.  a 1965  orange high graduate and motor-head dude he will now make an impression on his  stomping grounds at balboa peninsula.  welcome home mike.  walt

jim- 
                        thanks so much for resetting the cam  view.  as a kid in the late '50s and into the '60s, and further on into  the '70s and '80s, it's the view that i would have many thousands of times when  retuning from surfing, or a bike ride to my friends house on 24th street (a  sting ray bike, complete with a playing card in the spokes to "make a neat  noise"), or going home after a shift at the orange julius (across from what  was dillmans'...now a pizza place, i think), and also as a change collector on  the ferry (every local kid worked on the ferry at some point, it seems).   also, as a doorman at the short-lived bubbles balboa club (that art-deco  building at palm & bb boulevard), where the second version of the ink spots  headlined), i would stand at my post outside the front doors, in my phillip  morris outfit, while patrons waited to be admitted, and stare up at pretty much  the same view: off to the southeast, towards the hills (now covered with  houses).  at the time, there were no high rises, just the two very first  ones that are short, squat, identical buildings set between macarthur and  newport center drive.   
                        thanks again. have a wonderful day.

ha! i thought so! what a crack up!  it  actually happened right as i was watching:  all of a sudden, the camera  dropped, and my first thought was "seagull".  they are indeed  pesky little things, but it's their world, too, i suppose.  little  bastards!  god, the crap we used to have to clean off of the boat covers  so the poop wouldn't rot the fabric.  and the sea lions almost capsized  our shield sailboat one time.  still have the shield, moored now in santa  barbara, where it gets used by the local scout troops (hey, they cover the  liability and mooring fees, so it's a win-win).   
                        hope you are well. peace! thanks for the  shout back.

hi jim- 
                        did the ferry cam get knocked out of  whack?  it now points much further down. only half of the bay is seen. 
                        enjoy your day!

jim: 
many thanks for continuing this, it is my home page url.   when it went down it was disappointing to me.  back in the 60sâ, i  grew up in south orange county going to orange coast college, spent many days @  the wedge & pierâ¦  also bunked on the balboa island 1 summer, great place wish  i could afford a place there.  thanks againâ¦

hi jim!!
                        so glad to see you're keeping the web site up!!  how do  we donate to help the cause??
                        would there ever be a way to swing the camera about 2  degrees to the left, so we could see the other ferry dock at the same time?
                      no matter what---thank you for this service, bringing  wonderful memories of days gone by.

to all of my good friends and neighbors.
                    due to popular demand i have decided to keep tales of balboa active. as you can see, it's a somewhat smaller site then  in the past. but now i'll be able to keep it 
                    updated with your thoughts and memories.
                  thanks for all of your good wishes.

hi jim:  i will ask again.  does anyone remember  the fast food place that was located in the little triangular shopping center  at the corner of west balboa & the coast highway known as the chubby  burger? it was in business before 1963 and closed it's doors in the late 60's  if i'm not mistaken. i always thought it was called the burger probably because  the word burger on the sign, out front, was much larger than the word  chubby,  i missed the word chubby.  it was located at the edge of the  coast highway where the alley restaurant is now located.  my surf- ing  buddy, scott scheid, and i would stop in there before or after out trips to the  wedge....they had the most perfect fried chicken ever and we would always eat  in the car.  those were the days, we didn't know how blessed we  were.  walter quigley, orange high graduate 1965, quigleyontop@gmail.com
to all of my good friends and neighbors. 
                        i 
                        just wanted you to know that as of april 1st i will no longer be a notary public. for the first time in balboa history, there will be no notary public serving the local balboa community. i'm sure our newport beach city counsel will get that warm fuzzy glow from the knowledge that they   taxed a 24 year old successful small business, out of business.

                        i  was searching articles about my father and i came across yours. my father was  peter stewart. i wanted to thank you for the things that you said about him.  and also to let you know that he died due to complications of the aids virus. that  he got through a blood transfusion in the 80s, due to a serious car accident.  looking back on his art makes me cry because i am so proud of the things that  he did. my oldest daughter follows in his footsteps as an artist. he was also a  surfer and that is where i followed. i could never draw. thank you again for  your article.

hi jim:  you are missed.  my wife and i have a  philosophy about people who are removed from the scene for any reason.  we  look at, what we refer to as, the 'five gallon bucket of water theory'.   when we're on the scene our hand is in the five gallon bucket of water.   when we are removed from the scene we remove our hand from the water and the  water replaces the hand.  this is much the way our presence within any  enterprise in life is registered.  we tend not to be missed much, but  that's not the case for you my friend.  i miss what you were doing and so  i guess i kinda miss you.  farewell, walt

to all of my good friends. i've just crossed over the 80s mark in my life and i feel it's time turn the reins of tales of balboa over to a younger balboa enthusist. if you feel you would like take over the operation of this two decades old institution, please contact me. you will need to have some knowledge of website operation.

                        to all of my friends and viewers;
                        it appears the live balboa island ferry cam is experiencing technical problems, and it may be down for several days
                        until the decision to repair or replace the camera can made.
                        thanks for your understanding

                jim:thanks for including my  email to you on "tales of balboa" not that bob (me) is a great  writer, and certainly not trying to tell you what to put on your  website/blog,  but wouldn't it be neat if the email below i forwarded to you, could remain at  the beginning of your website. as an old-fashioned guy raised by my dad, i  learned to simply, just not complain - period. you're doing a wonderful service  to all of us who look forward to reading "tales of balboa".

jim you are much appreciated  by folks like myself who grew up on balboa island and made numerous friends  working at the jr many years ago. so keep on doing what you are doing with your  terrific website - thanks for everything. to those of us who love  and appreciate the time it takes for you to put together tales of balboa, it  doesn't matter a hoot if occasionally the view of the "ferry" doesn't  match up with the climate of the day - so what - right?
                        best wishes and thanks !

hi jim,
                        i love the webite except for one little thing.  your  "live" cam hasn't been live for a while now. although it's always a  beautiful view that i enjoy,  a day late isn't live.   i used to peek  at the old "live" cam to see how the weather is, and the crowds,  before i head down to balboa.  i thought it might be temporary, but it  feels like weeks or month, or more since it's been live.                is this permanent?  or can i expect the live feature to  return some day.
                        thanks,

hi jim- 
                        thanks for the book!  it made me think  back to my time on the island (1952 - 1987), and even further back, when my  grand parents were there (1922 - 1956).  while i was there, the island was  very much like the peninsula: funky, low key, not pretentious at all.  the  jr (jolly roger, where wilmas is now) was the local hang out, as was the vi  (village inn)...like dillmans was there down from the balboa hotel.  sure, we had a rich contingent, and a  hollywood crowd, but it was different then.  there was a big shot disney  exec who lived on crystal, and he often would throw weekend-evening parties and  preview movies on a screen set up at the end of the street.  one of them  was the original herbie...we all saw it before release.  but  being a kid, we didn't know about it.  it was just mr. prescott showing  his movies, again, and us kids would buzz around on our stingray bikes while  the adults got tipsy on double martinis and smoked like chimneys. we were all  just island people. only about a quarter of the houses were lived in  year-round.  it was a marvelous time...very magical. 
                          most of the houses were still old beach  shacks.  sadly, almost all are gone, replaced by ugly faux-tudor mini  mansions.  no more row-boats in the front yard.  the peninsula still  seems to have a bit of that old school charm...the island, none. 
                          i am glad a saw the best.

                        thank you so much for your prompt response  regarding my   question as to whether the date stamp on your ferry cam was one  day   behind or in real time.â  as a true, old newporter (born and raised,  and   family there since the 1870s...great-great grandpop worked for the    mcfaddens. i'm not someone who moved there from somewhere else), i sure    appreciate being able to view your cam.â  i left due to too many people    infiltrating the area.â  but then, hey, that's what makes kalifornee   great,  right?
                        would you like a monetary donation?
                        hope i can help!

hi jim:
                        i visit the web site every day and enjoy it big  time.   i’m not from this area but i spent lots of time in the area from san    diego to long beach during my time in the us navy 1961 â 1963 aboard the   us  galveston clg3 home port san diego. most of my friends &   shipmates were  from the east coast since our home port was phila pa.   before we made the trip  to the west coast. i loved the area from the   get-go. i told all my shipmates  that i would stay here when my hitch   was over, but when i was discharged my  roots in bristol tn. was calling   me home, so i returned to tennessee. my love  for the west coast is   still inside me 50+ years later. i hope to visit the  balboa area with   my family soon.

hi jim: my wife and i drove over to orange  county on march 23, 2019 to visit family.â  i entered my 1979 ford pinto wagon,   with the surf board on top, in the every sunday  'balboa car show' on   march 24th.â  i enjoyed it very much and also spotted  something i never   knew existed.....a production car known as a chevrolet  corvette nomad   station wagon.â  a  photo of that   car is attached.â  i always dreamt of owning a nomad, but  this tops it.   someone correct me if i'm wrong about my understanding concerning  this   car.â  i think it was originally produced for a car show in the early    fifties.â  i cruised the peninsula all day with the best of dick dale    playing loud.â  i love balboa.â

hi jim:â  i would like to share this  concerning the passing of our   beloved dick dale.â  our thoughts and wishes  to his wife lana.â  my very   good friend scott scheid was on the edge of  passing some years ago when   i called lana dale and requested that dick please  give my buddy a call   to lift his spirits and to not mention that i asked asked  him to   call.â  you see, scott was a great fan of dick dale and also surfed  'the   wedge' with me when we were in high school back in the early 60s. scott    also played guitar and wrote many songs and was inspired by dick.â    scott  gave me a call not long after my appeal to dick.â  he said..."hey   man,  did you tell dick dale to give me a call"?â  i broke down after a    fashion and said yeah i did, but initially said that i did not.â  scott   was  so happy about the call and dick called me which was a surprise as   well.â   dick had a big heart, he mentioned that he thought that scott   "is a sweet  guy".â  i can never thank lana & dick for that kind   thing that  scott so appreciated and heaven is richer for having both   dick and scott.â

hi jim
                        the familyâ had a home at 207 apolina on the big island   from  the early 40's until sometime in the 60's. it was a weekend/summer   home. we  were from the pasadena area. i used to hope on the on the   round-the-island  ferry all the time. what a blast! 15 cents. tim morgan   worked at the fun zone  and sang at some of the localâ "night spots".   the late bobby  hatfield and i used to hang out around the island. i   also worked at the jolly  roger in the summertime. paid my way at usc by   working in the movies doing stunts  and double work. i just completed a   novel entitled "kate". this is a "feel-good"  love story, centered   around the olympic sport of girls fast-pitch softball. the  release date   is sometime around the middle of this april. the website is www.katethenovel.blogspot.com . check it out if you like. thanks - bob ps - your website is great.   talesofbalboa@outlook.com  - soon to be made into a movie as well.

the landmark balboa pharmacy sign has been around as long as anyone can remember. in january, 2017, during a winter storm, the sign collapsed. many thought that would be the end of another piece of   balboa history. but thanks to the efforts of balboa pharmacy owner, mike martin,  the sign is now in the process of being restored. thanks mike.

 it appears that the pan y vino restaurant, on balboa blvd, has been sold, and word has it, that it's going to be a mexican restaurant.
                        a new restaurant, balboa kabob house, has opened in the old balboa international cafe location, on the corner of main st. and  bay ave. this location was the old location of the balboa bakery which moved into the old bay arcade location on the bayfront.

my name is steve souder. from pioneer  fishing family   started by jake souder about 1907 . i had an uncle by marriage  named “   chili “ who operated the ferry in the 40’s or 50’s he had a very    visible red beard. any chance there is a photo ?                   our family boat was the “ louise” a 40  ft. fantail tied   up at western cannery for years.                i remember the day’s   when mom and pop  would rent a skiff with a wooden bait tank , trailing   behind from the  pavilion and go fishin. â thanks for the memories . scs

in  reply to the question about the cookie shop near the ferry landing, it was the  chip yard. here's a story about it:â https://www.chipyard.com/our-special-chocolate-chip-cookies.php 
                        after mitch hurwitz graduated from estancia high school,   he  went to college (paid for by cookie profits) and had a big career   as a  hollywood writer and producer.

hello jim from bethany beach, delaware.â  mediacom   cable  is off so started playing around on my tablet.â  low and beholdâ  i    happened on your blog.â  wonderful surprise now being enjoyed by   husband  tom anfinson and me as we read through all the memories.â  tom   sends his  best and passed along that he is out of scotch.                  â  when clearing out a bunch of really old photos dating  back to ww   ii,â  i came upon several taken on the beach adjacent to newport  harbor   yacht club about 1944.â  though it was against the law to photograph    navy ships in the harbor, the pictures show ships being refueled across   the  bay.â  my great grandmother anna lemke was holding me and my   grandfather  lawrence lemke was sitting on his surfboard in the water.â    my great great  grandparents owned a small cottage on balboa boulvard,   four houses from 8th  street.â  i remember a few years later crossing the   street barefooted, and  hopping across the street car rails hoping not   to be bitten by red ants.                â  living for nearly 40 years on   the east coast, we now reside  in bethany beach, delaware, three block   town resembling old balboa.â   though we miss our friends, balboa is only   a wonderful memory to share with our  eight grandchildren. thank you   everyone for sharing stories of years  past.â  dick dale continues to be   so very special for all of us who loved  being a part of his history.â    and special good wishes to jim.

this  has been so fun to read! thanks to those that   have reached out and shared their  stories.â                 i  just read   a post that caught me by surprise by dennis halloran. dennis went to    school at mater dei with my mom, nana salazar. he stated nana dated   judge roger  robbins. there's more to that story, i'm roger & nana's   daughter- stephenie  robbins- ramirez. how funny to read this, loved   it!â                 another  post by "steve" said that he dated alex   salazar, my aunt, (named  after her father, my grandfather). nana and   alex were sisters. my grandfather  remarried later in life, he moved   south of the border and opened a mexican food  restaurant across from   the bull ring in tijuana.â

so  sorry to hear of the passing of the baer.â  we were   teammates at harbor  high 61-62.â  he went on to become a legend in   newport.â  just stumbled  onto this website as a result of a story in the   register this morning, march  19, 2018.â  so many great posts.â  i wish   there was a way to respond to  them on the site but that does not seem   to available.â â  too many  memories of growing up in newport and corona   del mar in the 50’s and 60’s to  even try to describe.

jim, 
                        here is another short email for you.â â  my  family joined   the balboa bay club as a charter members in 1947 or 1948 member  #h14   and we kids                  used it all summer at their beach and paddling on the    their paddle boards we did not stand up as now but laid down on those   big  boards and                  i had fun padding between the docks looking at the bay    bottom and we could see the fish. on june 11th, 1949 i had my 10th    birthday partyâ in the captain’s room by the dock ramp. i was the  first   kid to have a birthday party there as i was told.                the   daily pilot had an article about my birthday party  and the last line   said that a “good time was had by hall.”

jim,
                        in place of writing a long emails,â  i  â plan on writing short information that is easy to read.
                        i am a resident of newport from june of  1939 and my   story is after wwii and the lifting of the submarine nets out of                  the jetty my brother took me to island  market on the island and   bought me my first bubble gum that he told                me about   before the war and it was not  available until then, what a joy it was   for a kid. i can still taste it.

dear  jim,
                        thanks  so much for all your efforts and the wonderful   memories they reignite and  preserve.                â on  a sad note â   sorry to report that donald “baer” davis, longtime owner and  operator   of great hangout/bar/restaurant, baer’s lair (pch & balboa blvd),    and pal/contemporary of other “tales of balboa” notables woody payne,   jerry  overland, peter torre, john mcintosh, hank butcher, hans prager,   rick lawrence  (many more, of course), passed away february 17, 2018,   experiencing  complications following heart surgery.â   baer would have   turned 75, on sept 27, 2018.â  a lot of folks were looking forward to   that.                  better  related news â baer’s longtime time friend and   often co-worker, michael stomp,  is still “layin’ the liquor down,” to   many of baer’s old friends, several days  a week, at the alley, pretty   much at the same pch location as was baer’s lair  in the 70s and 80s.

i  wonder if those junior lifeguards realize what a wonderful time they are having  with such a special program? 
                        they are so lucky to grow up in that area.  i enjoy   watching them go back and forth on the ferry and will miss seeing them    when the program is over.

i'm happy to have found your website. my great  uncle   and aunt, bill and charlotte thompson owned and operated bills market on    balboa boulevard many years ago. my dad grew up helping at the store   in the  1950-60s. they used a model t runabout to deliver groceries. my   dad has stored  it for many years and my husband and i recently bought   it from him. we don't  have any pictures of the store or even the   address. we have a picture of them  with the car from the 1950s. we   would love to find any archived photos or articles  about the store.   could you direct me to anyone that might have such  information? i would   really appreciate the help.

i  grew up in o.c. swimming across the bay, body   surfing and sunbathing in laguna  and newport, and yes, we used baby oil   to fry ourselves. â my grandmother  and i loved blackie's for fried   shrimp, â i was reminiscing about a  terrific bakery on balboa blvd.   people lined up on the sidewalk on the weekend  for the cinnamon rolls.   he made something called a french kiss, and the best  pastry i ever ate,   a french waffle. â  he broke my heart when he closed. my  husband and i   lived at '_007'. the 1 was always missing. â it was one of  the original   buildings on the peninsula. â when the bay and ocean met  during a storm,   our building needed exactly two sandbags. that was the winter  you   couldn't drive for the flooding and my neighbor was fishing from his   kayak  on balboa blvd. â our building had housed hippies, but at one time   was a  bordello. â our apartment faced the street and had the buzzer the   madam  would use to warn the girls and clients the police were coming.   we had our own  bathroom but it was down the public hallway. we never   locked the door until we  realized a homeless fellow was using it. â my   hubby helped him out but we  started locking doors. we lived next door   to mr. cucamonga and i enjoyed  watching him drive his classic cars.   â every weekend we ate at dillman's.  so, so good. â yes, i loved the red   leather booths. â we enjoyed our  walks around the island and lido. my   hubby always recognized the retired movie  stars living in the area.   â one night there was a tidal wave alert. how we  would all have   evacuated i have no idea. â i woke up terrified at a deep  rumbling until   i realized it was a jet from o.c. airport. â my fantasy was  to live in   the house built to look like a lighthouse, on balboa island.  â best   years of my life and i still dream of falling asleep to the sound of    the 
                        rigging on sailboats in the bay.

hi,
                        as a child we stayed at the twin palms apartments about   10 doors up from the  fun zone for a month every summer. mornings would   be donut holes and fishing  with dropper loops from the dock. after   dinner it was balboa bars and skee  ball.                   we used to tell my mom we wanted to ride the ferry   across to the island so we  could get a dime each direction, then we   would swim across and spent the money  at the pharmacy on candy and   toys. we fished from the pavilion dock on special  occasions.                   we used to swim around the balboa pier for something to   do. go figure.â  after 50 years i still vacation in newport, only now i   stay at the marriott  suites so i don't have to cook or make beds.                   the late 60's were crazy especially around the 4th of   july. 
                        thank you, marty

as a   small child back in the early /   mid 60’s my grandparents ran a   restaurant on a corner & also lived   above the restaurant in an   apartment , i also remember them having a   raft shop , bar & snack   shop on the other end of the block. we   would help out in the restaurant   & snack shop ( frozen chocolate   dipped banana’s ) earning money so   we could go play at the  “ carnival   area “ that my brother & i use   to go to ?  we also would ride the   ferry to pass the time. my memories   seem to be fading more the older i    get but i also remember there was an   above ground swimming pool that   was in front of the apartment building   that was down the same   streetâ¦. all of this was right on the beach. if   anybody could give me   the name of the street & any more information i   would certainly   appreciate it . i  will be planning a trip to balboa   & would love   to go back to “ memory lane “. i have never had so much   fun as a child   & great memories. my grandparents , don & marie   ball. and   george & nila fatino.

                        under your editors note heading, the word 'possible' is   not spelled as it should be. i'm sure it's just an oversight. 
                        pj wheeler-island resident from birth (1952) until 1987,   when i got   disgusted with the overcrowding, as well as with the   plastic people who   need to say they live in newport just because they   have no self esteem   (and guys who have small penises, too!). i guess i   don't need to mention   the hummer drivers with size 8 shoes. i'm   thinking eastbluff, cameo   shores, and where there used to be cows   (newport coast).

i used to enjoy seeing the enlarged, full   screen, old postcards on this   site.  now when you click on the   postcard images they are small and in   one corner.  hard to see them.    what happened? can it be fixed to show   them larger?  the banana stand   photo is blank.  thanks jim.

i was ten years old living on balboa   peninsula in an apartment behind   and back of an italian restaurant -   gandolfo's, with dad, mom and   sister.  gandolfo's was on the south   side/ocean side of balboa blvd.,   corner of what is now palm avenue.    could be one street east or west but   i think it was palm  as a ten   year old with a bicycle and fishing pole,   it was a little slice of   heaven.  i would collect empty bottles and   cash for deposit at the   market on the north side of balboa blvd. near   where the municipal   parking is now, and then spend the money either at   the fun zone, or   rent a kayak for a few hours.  if i was lucky to have   enough, i'd bike   up to newport and pick up some smoked albacore.
                        in off season - there was the fog and haze and few beach   visitor; it was   even better deserted.  i will never forget balboa   peninsula.  we lived   there about a year and a half/two years; went   first to newport beach   elementary school, and then later that year or   the sixth grade ended up   at rand mcnally in cm where we lived briefly.    my dad was a union   plumber and due to the recession in 57/'58, money   was scarce on a good   day.  when it got better, we moved back to   anaheim; but balboa peninsula   was the best.

hi jim and fans!
                        i notice a lot of folks asking for personal memories, so here's my two cents:
                        -the mayflower house at the corner of park and coral on   balboa   island...almost "munsterish"...used to dare my buddies to dash   through   the yard. -bayside drive curving through along north   bay...before it got re-aligned. the gum trees are still there. 
                        -the ferry boats, before they added the pilots   houses...it wasn't really   that long ago. late 60s? and the old wooden   gates to close off the end. -don maddocs, at the island market...there   actually used to be a great meat market there! -riding bicycles on the   island bayfront...legally! -the red golf carts of salisbury realty...go,   barbara humphries! - the old fire station, a few stores down from the   bridge...when i was   born (at 121 1/2 pearl, in 1952), mom called the   fire room there to ask   for help in my birth... the guys on duty had to   walk down to our house,   as the truck was getting new brakes! and   bingo! out i came, right then   and there!
                        -parking before the street sweeping thing... -the   greeter, at the pottery place in laguna. -and the boom boom room, also   in laguna...used to go in pre-legal age   easily...oh, the hearts i   broke!...sigh...those were the days! -exploring skeleton caves, where   promintory point is now.                    -having the island damn near empty in winter time...only   about a quarter of the houses had permanent  residents. -ozzie, at the   ferry. remember ozzie?                  -the only pool on the island, in the 100 block of   pearl...rip chris   meyers. i will love you forever, dear boy. will you   remember you and i   as well? so young an sweet... -dirty k and her vw   thing, at dads donuts.
                        -the very first housing monstrosity, the stones house,   at north bay and   sapphire. the beginning of the crap being built all   over the island now. -the open space in the hills above crystal cove.   munching mushrooms straight from the cow patties before surfing. -the   horse stables south of cameo shores...great, but probably not the   most   environmentally clean. hey, what was, in the sixties? -oh, and so much   more...maybe on another visit. sadly, i would never   want to go back.   too many people. (i know, honey, let's   reproduce...that'll help...)
                        -ha ha ha...

just wondering if anyone remembers a   little bar, called the galley, that   used to be on balboa blvd., down   the peninsula, back around 1972? i   believe the owners were jim &   bobbi.
                        also a place called wheeler's trading post. there used   to be a fellow   that sold audio stuff there named john p. murphy. he   called himself   "murf the surf".
                        any memories would be very interesting.

hello, definitely a interesting balboa   site, and for me a cruise sailing   down memory lane in balboa, i was   born in upper newport heights, lived   on palisades roadm which later   became bristol street and eventually the   whole area was covered by the   corona del mar freeway and a huge   industrial area, macarthur blvd to   red hill to bristol street, when i   was a kid, that was all farms and    john wayne airport was just a small   airfield and storage for relic ww2   aircraft,, pby's and other assorted   planes we played in as kids,,  my   1st job was at the balboa pavilion/   daveys locker. lying about my age   as a young teen, i got a job at tale   of the whale restaurant, and   daveys locker, starting as a busboy in   winter and a baitboy on the   dock in summer, by the time i reached   puberty i worked my way up to   position of masterbaiter, lol, and worked   on the docks during the day   and in the tale of the whale at night, a   young workaholic, eager to   learn, i worked for mike and evelyn gross,   baiting up skiffs and   private boats as well as baiting up davey's 1/2   and full day fishing   fleet, the westerner , thunderbird, and the del   mar. off season i   worked as a busboy and upstairs banquets in the tale   of the whale   restaurant, for bill couette and phil toser and mike gross   at davey's    , eventually when i got my sealegs at 16, i became a summer   deckhand   on the island holiday going to catalina daily, i remember the   day the   pavilion queen came to port as a new part of the pavilion fleet,   and   started it's new life being transformed from a ferry to a tour and     party boat, the lounge in the tale of the whale was a class act, great     piano bar and ambience,  bartenders names were dave and art, cocktail     waitress was a 6'2" amazon with a period correct beehive hairdo that     made her about 6'6" i cant remember her name, but she was a fixture at     the piano bar & lounge for years and years,, john wayne and buddy     "beverly h-billy" epson among other antiquated  ho-wood stars one     wouldn't think as being sailors, were breakfast regulars at the tale of     the whale ba
                        my 1st apartment was across the street from arts landing   on the   boardwalk, in a little summer bungalow court on the corner of   adams and   the bayside boardwalk, my cottage was called the  "shady   nook" i paid   35$ a month  , i rented from a ancient old seahag named   helen, the   bungalows rental office had a 1930's era handpainted sign   of a poodle,   with a saying "" this is the only pooch allowed in this   court".  great   little bayside bungalow completely furnished wih pots   and pans,,   occasionally during unusual high tides we would have to put   the   furnature up because the water would fill the streets and enter   the   bungalows, we would take surfboards or sabots and paddle thru the     streets and alleys,    then i moved into the balboa inn on main   street,   across the street from the prison of socrates, i remember   paying a   heaping $65 a month rent including occasional maid service,   had a great   view of peninsula, ocean and the balboa pier, from the top   floor apt, i   couldnt afford such steep rent in those days so i took   on a room mate.   many years later i heard wilt chamberlin lived in my   old apartment at   balboa inn, long before the dennis rodman era in   balboa/newport.
                        the balboa inn was a bit downtrodden & nearly empty   in those days,   like a ghost hotel, heidi's cafe, the balboa bakery,   dillmans, the fun   zone were all a important part of my childhood and   formative years. as i   got up in my teens, i worked at alley west in   newport and hanks ocean   front cafe, fish and chips, i later had an   apartment above the stag bar/   liquor store and chinese food, then   moved to an apartment above the   alley west on corner above the dory   fish and chips, before charlies   chili moved from it's old bayside   location to a spot next to baldys   tackle shop, by the newport pier,   places like sids blue beet, the little   heidleberg, henrys market, and   blackies, does anybody remember the twin   brothers freddy and frankie   who grew up and lived as dory fisherman   with their father at newport   pier ? back when that laid back beach   lifestyle was the real deal,   before newport and balboa got it's post   modern stucco makeover and   faux cape cod replica facelift, becoming what   is almost unrecognizable   to me in modern times, i left my childhood   haunt there in the early   70's, seeing the writing on the wall, all good   things come to an end,,   when they painted over the old "prison of   socrates" sign that was   painted in the 50's on the brick wall in the   alley on main street in   balboa, and put in some tacky new york pizza   place, pianted all the   brick walls. i knew it was time to leave my home   town when chuck   norris bought woodys wharf, the quality of life in   newport was   lowered, and the rent rose beyond affordability for an   un-entitled   local born kid, of coarse by then the new powers that be   were hiring   low wage slaves from the south to do all the jobs that we   grew up   learning and enjoying as kids,,  the rest is history now, behind   the   orange curtain.

                        it appears to me, after following the 'surfline' cam at   'the wedge' for   over a year and watching the wave formations there,   that 'the wedge' is   not what it once was.  it seems that the wedge   breaker itself has   disappeared except very rarely.  i remember hitting   the surf there   without studying the forecast and i was always witness   to this wedge   after which the location was named.  back in the   thirties it was known,   even then, as 'the hook'.   i have noticed, in   at least two locations at   the base of the jetty where the surf meets   the rocks, that possibly a   few boulders are breaking the straight edge   of that base and causing the   waves to form differently.  is this a   fairly recent development or am i   imagining this?  i'm going to be   studying old video and still images to   compare them with what i see   now.  has anyone else noticed this?

jim,  hello "employee of the month".  i hardly   recognized you without   your beard.  you look at least 10 years   younger.  i keep hoping someone   will remember me from the last time i   lived in balboa 1978-1984 and send   me a message, but at age 76 i   suppose most of my friends have died off   by now.  maybe they would   remember my husband bud wilson better than my   name.  would love to   hear from anyone that knew us then.

jim, you should save and put all these comments in a   book and save them   for posterity.  i don't want to lose any of these   memories. the   histories of people's lives and mine in balboa are so   charming to read   and remember.  i'm so afraid that as time and   technology marches on   these personal stories will disappear.  please   consider saving them in a   published form.  only a real book will   survive.

can anyone help?  i lived on the island in the late   50's early 60's and   remember a large black sailing schooner moored   down by the lido area.    was there for years.  does anyone else   remember the ship and have any   information about her?  what the story   on the boat owner, how long it   was moored there and what happened to   it.  much appreciated.

the seashore around the balboa peninsula is the   medicine which is   particularly good for my soul.  it has a curative   effect which can not   be explained to anyone.  i suppose everyone has a   place on the face of   the earth that strikes him like the balboa   peninsula impacts me, but my   balboa is special in all the world.    treatment for nostalgia is so   soothing, i'm gifted to have it.

my brother tom and i are planning a kayak adventure   through the harbor   and the back bay water ways.  thinking about just   renting instead of   using our own equipment.  going to have to check on   the fishing   requirements in the back bay.  anyone have an answer on   that.  maybe   we'll rent an electric boat for the day or some other   more relaxing form   of getting around. one way or the other, we're   gonna have a great time.

                        i asked about balboa peninsula gas stations of 1986 on   this forum a few   months back. your info posted below definitely helps!   you nailed the   apartment complex that i was looking for dead on. i   have checked all the   old environmental websites for "leaking former   gas tanks" etc. and   identified all the old gas stations you mentioned   except that mobile   station on 15th and balboa blvd!! i had ruled out   the location(even   though it looked feasible from google earth views)   because i did not   know a gas station used to be there. also, i was   searching through the   newport beach city website where you can read   old building permit   applications and i confirmed your info. feels like   a 100 lbs bag has   been taken off my back to finally figure out where   it was! thanks. there   is something magical about balboa peninsula   every time i go there, hard   to explain! actually, i want to move there   this spring when my   huntington beach lease is up, but i'm not sure   how i'm going to find a   reasonably priced apartment that actually has   parking. also, its been   pretty cold this winter so its gunna be tough   convincing my wife to move   there. i wish i knew someone that owned an   apartment complex there. at   50 years old, i figure if i don't move   there now, i never will.

it's wonderful to hear from you dick and thanks for   setting us straight   on 'the king gillette house', but i will always   refer to it as 'the dick   dale house'.  if  one wants the truth he must   go to the source.  i, for   one, would love to hear more about the   house and your history on the   peninsula; there's no time like the   present and where better to drop   your pearls for posterity.  with   great respect,

i am sorry but your story about king gillette is   wrong.  he did live   there as i met the sweet elderly lady that cooked   for him in the mansion   and she gave me pictures of him and told me how   he lost the mansion    getting sued by the man he hired to live there   and take care of him and   his wife. there is a lot more to the story   that the kind lady told me   after i bought the mansion. she lived over   in corona del mar. i had the   mansion paid off in full but i ended up   in a horrid divorce and had to   take a loan for a million dollars and   the 2 bankers renaged on my   contract and i lost the mansion. but in   the end they both ended up in   jail. one day i will write about it...

according   to an article that appeared in the la   times by author-historian jim   sleeper this should clear the air on the   balboa peninsula's king   gillette mansion and hopefully satisfy mr. or   ms. anonymous. newport beach has a mythology all its own. the town's   capacity for   myth-making is nearly as predictable as the tides that   bathe it. and   nearly as changeable. a fine example was encapsuled in a   times article (april 10) about an   architectural monument at the tip   of the balboa peninsula known as the   "king gillette mansion." properly   speaking, it was king g. (not c.) gillette, the son, not the   inventor   of the safety razor, who bought the site and built the home in   1925   (not '26), after newport contractor paul b. ellsworth took out a     building permit for a nine-room (not 23), shingled structure to cost     $12,000 (not $24,000).                  among balboa's best-nurtured tales is that gillette   never spent a night   in the place. in a feature story last year,   beatrix padway, whose   father-in-law once owned the place, opined,   "gillette never moved in   because his wife fell in love with the   architect and they ran off." this   year's times version has it that   just as gillette and a convoy of   moving vans approached, a wave of   biblical proportions swept over the   roof, whereupon gillette turned   tail, ne'er to return.                  if so, he missed the better part of eight years'   construction, which   included two more stories, a whole second half and   14 additional rooms.   following these post-wave improvements, gillette   sold the property in   1933 to r.v. jones (not the padway brothers), of   hollywood, for $75,000.                  next comes the cherished "feuding (padway) brothers and   house divided"   story. it likewise falls. in november of 1936 (not   '31), jones (not   gillette) sold the residence to barney padway,   president of a beverly   hills mortgage company. it was barney (not   martin and james) padway who   immediately remodeled the three-story   spread into two mediterranean   houses. far from any "brotherly feud,"   padway occupied one half, while   the other half was designed for his   brother, judge joseph a padway, of   milwaukee, wis. when completed,   each half contained 15 rooms.                  ultimately the padways would occupy the landmark until   world war ii,   when it was taken over by the military. alas, it was the   army (not the   coast guard) who commandeered the mansion for a base   from which two   104-foot crash boats were dispatched to retrieve downed   fliers at sea.                  two years after the war, barney padway sold the "divided   house" to   andrew and lucille bailey for $40,000. after sprucing it   up, the baileys   sold in 1972 to dr. jim diffley for $150,000.                  reflecting a continuing rise in real estate values, the   showplace sold   again in 1976, this time for $275,000. as is well   known, the purchaser   was aging guitar-twanger richard anthony monsour   (also known as dick   dale), "king of the surfing fender-benders." at   this point, the beach   house was described as 17 rooms with six baths.                  in 1986, dale was evicted after defaulting on his   mortgage they say   (though sex makes better reading). then in   considerable disrepair, the   place passed to the federal deposit   insurance corp. from which al and   loyce grasso bought it.
                        however, the times was perfectly correct in stating that   the grassos are   now (as of 1990'2) in the process of restoring the   $1.4-million   fixer-upper to its mid-1930s mediterranean grandeur. 
                        i trust that these facts will not confuse the harbor   cruise directors,   whose "ferry" tales have been such a fecund source   of local   history--especially those regarding the "king gillette   house."

hi jim-
                        on the ferry cam, the date stamp (upper left corner)   says one day   previous to the actual date of viewing. but the title   (under the shot)   says live. which is correct?

i'm approaching 70 years old now and visited back at   christmas time with   family at corona del mar.  we stayed 5days and i   treled out to the end   of the east jetty next to corona del mar.  there   is one rock about one   third of the way outthat is very unstable and   should be tended to by   some city people as someone my loose his   balance out there.  there is a   rock like that on the west jetty by the   wedge also about half way out.  i   love that hike out to the ends of   both jetties.  i'll be doing it every   year 'til the end of time.  i   love the beach, i love balboa and cdm.

as a kid in the 50's used to eat at the "jolly roger"   and play in the   water all day, i was first one in and last one out!    my sister and i   used to swim across to the "boat house" once in a   while, don't think my   parents knew!  one time i remember a big boat   couldn't see us and we   went under it, i remember seeing the boat go   over us, must have been 60   feet long, wonder how long it really was,   maybe 15-20 feet, but i was   young and it looked like an ocean liner!!    great memories of balboa,   huntington beach, (thousand steps!),   laguna, remember the "pottery   shack" and the guy that waived to   everyone on the north end of town?    hint of the time, i was in the   first class to graduate from sunny hills   high school in fullerton!

jim: sad to hear about the gallery closure, but happy   to hear about your   planned walking tours of the downtown balboa.    hotels on the peninsula   would love to hear that.  i'm sure that other   businesses would push it   for you as well.  just stayed with family on   corona del mar last week   and thoroughly enjoyed it.  while there i   read the paperback on the   history of corona del mar.  my god, i never   new.  what a dramatic   beginning.  have you read it. many stories about   ship wrecks all over   here.  has anyone written a really good history   of the balboa peninsula.    that would sell to every walking tour.  put   lots of old photos in that   book too. you'll do just fine with your   tours, bet on it.  i'm going to   miss this site.  shoot me a line jim.    jim, think about the potential with the chamber.

i emailed you yesterday to tell you how sorry i am   about the cams. then   it dawned on me - how am i going to see the boat   parade? how am i going   to watch all those cute jr. lifeguards coming   and going on the ferry in   the summer? how am i going to watch my   daughter riding on the ferry? how   am i going to check out the weather?    i know there are many more things   i see on your site - thanks for   all your time and work.
                      ricki
oh no.........every day i start out w/ your site and   get to think back   to all the special memories. i wish the cams could   go on and on. i was   sorry when you moved from near the arcade as i   liked those cams, but   this is so sad.thanks for all your time and   effort - it has been much   appreciated.

to all of my good friends.
                        first of all i want to wish you a very merry christmas and the best new year ever.
                        i'm sorry to tell you that balboa gallery has gone out   of business. because of this, the two live cams showing the fun zone and   bay front will be shut down in a few days. the only camera remaining in   use at this time will be the ferry cam.                  the last few weeks have been a real mess for me due to   closing the gallery and i may have missed some of your messages. for   this i'm sorry.  i look forword to the coming year with high hopes for   balboa. i'm now looking into the possability of giving walking tours of   downtown balboa. let me know what you think. thanks for all of your   support, and your wonderfull messages.

hi there, thank you for your site i really appreciate it! 
                        like many people here, i was born & raised in   newport & spent my   summers on the island & at the beach on the   peninsula. i have the   best memories of balboa & the peninsula :) i   had my first job at   pizza pete's at the fun zone. and most of my   friends worked nearby at mr   fun foods, the boat rentals, the ferry and   so on..
                        i had my first kiss on the boardwalk in the summer of   1986 and now he & i are engaged- better late than never! :) 
                        i cried when i heard that the few rides that were left   there & few   shops were all closing :( i still live nearby, but   haven't been able to   bring myself to return there...
                        i want to remember life as it was growing up at the beach & hanging out with friends...
                        every summer weekend, we would get dressed up and go out   to parties at   someone's apt/house on the peninsula or sneak off to   the beach to drink a   few beers & then go "cruise" balboa blvd. and   then maybe get into a   little trouble, lol...but not really, it was   all such innocent fun! 
                        what great memories!! 
                        it makes me feel sorry for my nieces who are 16 & 18   and they aren't   interested in much except "talking" w/friends online   & texting   people. 
                        i know that life is about change & progress, but i   long for those   hot, fun & carefree summer days & nights when   time seemed to   stand still & there was never a shortage of fun   things to do &   late nights spent hanging out with friends &   loving life! 
                        i wouldn't change a thing!!! 
                        thanks for the memories. and please, if anyone has pics   from the   70's/80's of the fun zone, i would love to see them..i've   forgotten the   names of alot of places, and it would be great to see   some photos. take   care

                        does anybody remember a cocktail lounge called "talk of   the town"? my mother used to date the manager (she could only remember   his first name was art) and she got pregnant. he doesn't know he has a   daughter (my sister) and he may want to know. if anybody knows anything   that could help in finding art, it would be greatly appreciated. thank   you!

jim: at first it was all about getting my memories of   balboa recorded in one place, but now i have taken a liking for your   wonderful talent.  as a photographer myself i can appreciate your great   works.  i will stop in when i get over there in late november or so.    now that part of the family has taken residence at corona del mar i will   be closer to balboa, a very special place and a special place in my   heart.  i  don't know how to come close to describing my connection to   this tiny community as it seems to escape me, but that  is aside from   your beautiful photographs. thanks jim,

there was a mobil station on the corner of west balboa   blvd. and 15th street, 1500 west balboa blvd. it was next to an   apartment complex that had very limited parking. there was also a unocal   station on the corner of newport blvd and 30th street. there was one   other station on the peninsula around newport blvd and 34th street i   believe it was an exxon station, these are the only ones i remember.   hope this helps.

hello, can anyone tell me how many gas stations were   on the balboa peninsula in 1986 and what their addresses were? i live in   huntington b. and recently returned to visit balboa, which brought back   a flood of memories from 1986, when i was dating a japanese exchange   student from uci. she returned to japan. i wanted to find her old   apartment address but i cannot remember for my life. all i found was   here name and her old phone number 714-536-0428 in my records, but no   address. i do remember that there was a 6 car parking lot for her   apartment (which was usually full) and i used to park behind a service   station (in its own parking lot), which was directly adjacent to her   parking lot. can anyone help? alfred.j.

i begin with apologies as this is unpleasant, unreal   and unimaginable.  on july 2,2015 late afternoon, the day began so well   on a once in a lifetime vacation with my favorite person ever. balboa   was so beautiful though after the following events, nothing is. late in   the afternoon we arrived at balboa. riding a tandem bicycle had been a   dream for more than a year so we rented one. i had no idea that as a man   on a roadbike pulling into our lane with nowhere to go,....would change   lives forever and leave my best friend and true love hating me because i   could nothing but use my body to cushion her. she was still injured,   but the injury is deeper than imaginable. unable to see the accident   given time and position, she has lost trust in me. i implore the help of   the man on that bike to help me restore the trust of the one person i   hope for the most,......please.....

                        you hired our 19 year old son grant in 1986 to work part   time at your playland arcade.  he had to quit soon after because he was   losing his battle with bone cancer.  we were so grateful you hired him   in spite of his health issues;  he so wanted to live a normal life and   you gave him an extra boost....he loved that job.
                        thank you!

my great aunt was ethel strebe and she and her   husband, george strebe, purchased the doll house in the 1950s.   they   subsequently got divorced and ethel died about 10 years ago.   all of   her six siblings are also deceased and no one on our side of the family   knows what ever happened with the doll house at balboa.   does anyone   out there have any recollection of the history of this establishment?

remember dancing to stan kenton's band at the   rendezvous ballroom the summer of 1947?  june christy opened the show   with "i cover the waterfront."  we danced the new yorker, the balboa,   and i finally learned the huntington beach hop which was a great step   but more complicated than the other two.  stan would announce a break by   saying, "it's blue room time," and the band would go across the street   to this bar named the blue room.  fabulous memories of these days.  also   spent every spring break at bal from whittier high school, class of   '49.

just recalling a day body surfin' the wedge with my   buddies scott, rick and mike summer of 1964.  guess someone got the surf   report and we headed down from city of orange.  nice big breakers and   nicely formed wedge.  maybe it was the very first time we had done this   as we were all from different parts of the country, somerville, ma,   pewaukee, wi, flathead lake area, wyoming and minn., minn..  we were all   new to california and loving it.  we were going to orange high. scott   and rick graduated in '64 and mike and i graduated in '65.  we hit the   surf that day and it tested me to the max.  i'm sure the others felt the   same way, but nobody wanted to say quits first.  i recall cutting back   one time when the whole ocean floor sand was showing under me.  i was in   a standing position when the wave broke and dumped me flat standing.  i   was having fun.  i think it was mike who quit first with a bloody chest   or nose,  i don't recall.  rick also was somewhat damaged in the same   way,but he kept on.  scott and i made it out fair.  we will never forget   that day

does anybody remember a place at the corner of w.   balboa and the coast hwy. called the burger that had fantastic fried   chicken.  it was there in '63-'65.  what a great place for a couple of   beach bum buddies to get a fast meal then hit the surf.  rick reminded   me of the time that stewart drove his yellow '58 chevy off of the   parking lot accidentally  and  ending up door handle deep in the beach   sand.  i think it was near balboa pier.  he also reminded me that we   were a curious group as he could not remember us ever drinking alcohol. i   think he is right, for the most part we were pretty sensible.  i'll   never forget the night that stewart asked us all to chip in for gas to   go to the beach then he took us all home and went out on a date.  gees   we were stupid.  that's ok, rick reminded me of the time stewart   pretended to have forgotten his wallet while eating at oscars.  we all   slyly left the table for one reason and another until stewart was left   at the table to pay his own bill as it should be.  we all stood outside   looking in at him.  more to come.

as a young man i spent a week on balboa island with my   first love molly. we spent many of those nights at the fun zone playing   arcade games, laughing, eating junk food and having fun. it was the   most carefree fun time of my life and it was there that we fell in love.   tragically she died  a few months later but, when i go back, it's as if   she's with me holding, my hand and telling me she loves me.

the very first timei went to balboa was in august of   1963.  visited that little beach next to a small pier on the harbor on   15th st. right next to the american legion.  the landry family from   anaheim were relatives who took us in for a while til our family got   settled into orange, they were relatives and we were very thankful for   their help.  it was the landreys who took us to that beach.  my cousin   rose was gracious enough to take me across balboa blvd. to the ocean   side of the peninsula where i experienced the great pacific for the   first time.  i sure did like rose a lot, same age and all.  rose, drop a   line here please.  walter

went to balboa every summer with my family back in the   fifties and sixties.  some of my most fond memories.  practically lived   on the beach from morning til night.  then on the ferry to the arcade   for more fun.  used to shop in a little grocery store that was on same   street as the ferry if i remember right.  great times and great   memories.

i was the ups driver in balboa from 1969 to 1985. i   knew a young man who worked at the bay department store at 303 main   street his name was derik farnsworth. we used to have some great   conversations on the street while i was unloading to deliver. he road a 3   wheeled bicycle. i was wondering if anyone knows if he still lives on   the peninsula or how he is doing. we were down on the peninsula last   weekend and i began thinking about all the wonderful people i knew. i   noticed a young lady riding a 3 wheeled bike and it made me remember   derik.

what a beautiful and wonderful place. my husband and i   had a very enjoyable boat ride. whale watching turned out to be   smittened by the dolphins ride! they appeared to be so playful and   having a terrific time swimming as fast as our boat was moving out   toward the ocean. the boat just left the mouth of the channel, heading   out to the open water. just that quick the dolphins appeared, as though   it was a daily routine for them ( the dolphins ) just waiting for the   tour boat to come and the dolphins would have playtime and entertain   everyone. just luv it.  the entire area of balboa peninsula island was   beautiful and everything was scenic. the memory will be forever in my   mind.  crab cooker , the best.

to the writers wanting to know newport phone prefix   before area codes, i think it was "harbor."  costa mesa had liberty,   kimberly, and midway i believe.  my parents lived on newport island from   1941 to 1943, went to honolulu to work until the end of the war, and   came back to newport 6 months after the war ended and built a house near   western canners on 31st street.  i don't know if it was the pre-war   house or the 31st street house they said they were on the old   switchboard style phones that you listened for the number and type of   rings to know when you should pick up your phone to answer it.    unfortunately they were on the same exchange as the local doctor who   delivered babies in the middle of the night and had to lobby the phone   company to get them a different number so they didn't have to hear it   ring whenever there was a baby about to be born.  i also think the older   phone numbers were only 4 digits not 7 or 10 like we had later on.
                        ps to the phone number conversation - it was liberty 8   and midway 6 - i remember that for sure, and they were associated   primarily with costa mesa addresses.  we lived up in the costa mesa   section of newport heights and both numbers were used on our street.

whatever happened to vi's pies across the street from   the theater?  the black bottom and others were so good.  also the fine   bakery on the street leading to the pavilion.  we purchased several   swimsuits from the bay department store  in same block.  we also had   many dinners at dillman's and pops.

anyone remember when davey's locker fishing skiff   rentals was at the present location of ruben e. lee - where pch crosses   the harbor. they rented red 14ft skiffs made of honest to god wood. my   dad hooked a giant bonita once that pulled our little boat all the way   out beyond the buoy marking the harbor entrance.  swells were about 15ft   to 20ft that day. only time i've ever been seasick. had that big fish   smokes at a place up on newport blvd near 22nd in costa mesa.

i just got an e-mail from mike murphy telling me he   had contributed material to jim fournier's book, "tales of balboa." he   said he had talked about the "bar wars" with woody, baer, and the guys   from alley west. also some stuff about dick dale at the rendezvous. murf   says it is a great book and that i should have one. are they still   available? mike had left his real estate biz on the mountain for a few   days to play a gig in washington. hope it went well for him. he had a   great run as an entertainer and was one of the very best. 
                        the stage at woody's wharf was a good vantage point to   people watch.  i recall a tragic night when a woman in a party of four,   that was sitting at a table next to the glass wall overlooking the wharf   and twenty feet from the stage, choked on a bite of steak. with a look   of horror on her face, she grabbed her throat, waved her hands, and fell   forward into her plate. i stopped playing and called out to the   restaurant staff that we had an emergency at the window. 
                        bartender, hank vaulted the bar and ran to the woman's   side, who was now on the floor. her son-in-law was giving her mouth to   mouth resuscitation. hank tried to get him to stop so the heimlich   maneuver could be administered that would pop out the lodged food, but   the hysterical man would not quit. hank tried to pull him away and   yelled at him, "you're forcing the food down her throat!" still, he   fought him off with several wild punches and continued. the paramedics   arrived in minutes, but it was too late to save her.
                        the guests at woody's were an eclectic bunch. a favorite   was the man who would hang out at the bar wearing a stethoscope and   often in scrubs, identifying himself as an ob-gyn, named dr. fallopian.
                        one memorable night, a man and two women took the   half-circle booth, directly in front of the stage. the women were   dressed in expensive-looking, tight, black dresses, the man in a   beautiful black suit. he sat at the nine o'clock position, the women at   twelve and three. ms. twelve gazed around the room with a look of   disdain at the "peasantry." after ordering drinks from the waitress, she   got up and walked regally to the rest room. a song or two later, she   returned with the haughty attitude of a star walking the red carpet.   attached to the four-inch heel of one of her black pumps, was a six foot   length of white toilet paper that trailed her every step. she stood at   the side of mr. nine, who had downed a couple shots while she was away.   he stood up, she slid into her spot and he sat down. at this point, i   was trying to suppress a laugh and unable to sing and, with most of the   rest of the room, watched this trio who were oblivious to being the   center of attention. 
                        suddenly, mr. nine began convulsing. he placed his hands   over his mouth but that couldn't stop the projectile vomiting as he   spewed huge amounts of stomach contents all over and across the formica   covered table. as it ran down onto their laps, ms. twelve, using her   extended pinkie as a squeegee, tried to push it back to the center of   the table and kept yelling, "ish, ish." 
                        as in the last days of pompeii, vesuvius kept erupting.   ms. twelve, at last yelled, "get up, you dumb son of a bitch!!" covered   in puke, the three slid out from the table and, with the man in the   lead, followed by ms. three, the packed house crowd at the bar parted as   if for moses at the red sea. 
                        bringing up the rear and, to her credit, still looking   as regal as one could with vomit from her waist to the hem of her black   dress, ms. twelve walked with measured steps to the exit. behind her,   still attached to her four-inch heel, trailed the six feet of white   toilet paper.

i was fortunate enough to spend many a summer sunday   at the bay at cypress st.  in august, we would rent 1 of the plummer   court cottages for a week. i was 3-7 years old back then.  then they   tore that block apart and built that ugly condo. 
                        i saw the demise of the original fun zone.  there is now   a ferris wheel nearly on the water by the auto ferry.  it seems to me   that it can't be the original ferris wheel that sat between the bumper   cars and the store on the corner.  does anyone remember how many seats   were in the "original" ferris wheel???  (circa 1959)  it was tall enough   that you could see the beacon at the end of the jetty. 
                        i miss the "old" balboa.  and whatever happened to that   great big black music box that sat in the "middle" of 3 pinball arcades?    and where did all those mechanical games end up???  oh well...thanks   for letting me cry and rant.  at my age, i'm happy to sit and ride the   ferry across the bay a few times and reminisce.  :)

to the writer wanting to know alpha characters for newport beach
                        my mom always said costa mesa where we lived was   liberty, or it was said as "li8-". but you thought it was kimberly.    maybe newport beach was liberty then?

to kenny: re ocean toad...absolutely i remember the   toad...i was just a kid, and my mom, betty ann wheeler, was head of the   accounting office. this was probably the early seventies. there was   some...er...interesting stuff going on with the books that she called   attention to, and when the dead body belonging to a vegas "promoter" was   found floating under the toad, she promptly quit, realizing there was   an under current of shady characters who owned the toad. she'd   previously been with the ancient mariner under pete siracusa.

the name of the hypnotist at the villa nova was pat collins, the hip hypnotist.
                        does anyone remember the ocean toad? i performed there   for a few weeks as did, i believe, two other acts; jerry keko and jason   chase. i used to write material for their acts. i didn't know i was   their writer but they would often help themselves. jerry called me once   and said, "ken, don't play yuma. they don't like your act."

what a wonderful read! i was looking for chuck beauvais info and found other great stuff. 
                        like mike murphy, i performed at woody's wharf beginning   in 1972. woody payne was a beautiful guy. the morning he was killed, we   were to have met for breakfast to talk about opening a bar on 17th   street. woody had a non-compete clause from the sale of the wharf and we   had discussed using my name and his money. i recall he had a skateboard   factory and not loving it. i was performing at the spindrifter, on the   water side of coast hiway, near the arches. woody had gone next door to   the italian place (villa ???) and about 1:45 was walking across pch to   the arches bar for a last call drink before our 2 am meeting. when i   came out of the club, woody payne had been hit by a car was lying in the   street. not my favorite memory.
                        i remember, after 2 am closings at the wharf, we would   sit at the bar, drink, and laugh sometimes until the sun came up. the   story about the bumper sticker comes from the guys at alley west hiring a   professional to paint "woody drinks at alley west" on the side of   woody's new el camino. not to be outdone, instead of removing it, woody   hired another professional to paint "beer, 5 cents a glass" beneath the   first sign.  they played gags on each other for weeks. one morning,   woody drove into his parking lot to find eight goats grazing on his   roof.
                        one night, a huge samoan abalone diver took offense at   something i had said on mic. he lumbered up to the small, two-foot tall   stage, wrapped his massive right hand around my left hand and the neck   of my guitar and with his left hand grabbed the front of my shirt,   guitar strap, and chest hair and lifted all 220 pounds of me up and off   the stage and was going to throw me through the window into the bay. i   could see bartenders hank and baer getting ready to come to my aid and   probably die with me, when woody walked up to the mountain and said,   "hey, man, you're ruining the show. put him down or you'll have to   leave." my captor looked down at woody and then up at me and back down   at woody and shrugged his giant shoulders. as my dangling feet returned   to the stage, i gave a silent prayer of thanks to god and woody for my   deliverance. 
                        the reuben e. lee was my home many months a year for   several years. it was a magical place to perform. i was there the night   gazillionaire peter grace (wr grace) tried to buy a seat for dinner and   even after offering a huge tip was told it was a 2 hour wait. he left   the boat, drove away in his limo and on monday called owner john   mcintosh to demand the hostess be fired. the story goes, mr. mcintosh   told him he was going to give her a raise. grace replied he was going to   buy the reuben e. lee and fire her and john. then john told peter the   boat was not for sale and only a part of the huge holdings of far west   services. that was when grace started negotiations for the purchase of   the corporation with a more than tidy sum going to mr. mcintosh and the   other owners. as soon as it became a grace property, the magic left and   the reuben e. lee eventually was hauled out to sea and sunk.

my mom told stories of her time on balboa island; she   left illinois and came to california right after world war ii.  my   sister says she worked at a few places there ... one of the places had   the word "tea house" in it and then a restaurant that was across the   street.  wondering if any of those details sound familiar to anyone who   is still around from those days.  she loved balboa island.  i do too.

hello i live now in portland oregon but lived on the   island as a child in the '50s-c.56-60. lived at 110 agate just across   the street from the then methodist church and a half block from the   ferry. my family bought it c. 1913. we still have snaps of the water   tower. the family name was bradford and were part of the "pasadena   colony" i guess (altadena,actually) but we never identified as such. is   there anyway to find out who constituted the said colony?are we listed?   :)  doing research for long undiscovered and recently contacted family.    be glad to offer scans of wwi era bi if anyone interested.  thanks!    jeff colby,portland

my family owned summer homes first on the island (   i.b. and cornelia potter) and then on the peninsula ( marion and lp   elliott/ doris potter). my mother and her brother spent their summers   there, sailing and swimming, then brought the next generation along as   we arrived. to this day, i look back on those days as some of my best   memories and balboa as paradise on earth for kids. my cousins and   siblings still visit whenever we are in the vicinity, dig our toes in   the sand and remember all the good times.

jim, trying to find your gallery web   site; what's the address.  where are you located.  must tell the story   of my high school basketball buddy.  we were sittin' on the beach in   1964 and in a mood of stupidity i gave him a shove.  i had no idea what   his capability was that day at 15th  street near the stuft surfer, but   he twisted me in knots ; i think i had sand everywhere including my   mouth and nose.  i never got pushy with scott scheid again.  by the way,   our non-profit seeks hard assets in the form capital investment in   resort residencial real estate and we will do it on balboa peninsula   when it is time.  i can't think of a better place. thanks for your tales   of balboa and the web cams. walter, orange high '65.

walter,
                        yes that was dick dales house but that would have been   in the late 70's early 80's. he owned a surf shop on east balboa blvd.   and a hair dressing salon on west balboa blvd. dick is a great guy, and a   fantastic musician. we became friends and still talk regularly. i was   the ups driver on the peninsula from 1969 to 1985. the house was   originally built by king gillette, the razor guy. it has been sold a few   times. another notable who owned it was humphrey bogart. lauren bacall   owned the house next door. that is an interesting story as well.

fill me in, that big house out next to   peninsula park, the last house on the channel as you walk toward the   wedge belonged to dick dale in the early 60's and maybe beyond.  am i   right?  dick is still working and can be found by entert his name into   search.  he works hard. i sure love the peninsula.  my buddy scott and i   surfed the wedge back in '64-'65.

just discovered your site.  what a   pleasure in reading all about newport beach and balboa.  we had a summer   home on anade behind the library.  as a youngster my folks would come   down from pasadena and rent a house on balboa island.  i've had many   haircuts from mr. balboa, bills market was a great little store.  bill   would cash my out of town checks and our two sons would find pop bottles   and turn them into money for the fun zone.  after wwii when they   dredged the back bay they piped the sludge into west newport along river   and neptune.  i purchased a city block out there that for a year it   took to bleach the muck out into clean sand.  linda darnell liked the   area and purchased a lot from me.  a friend, stan ahlman , we formed a   partnership and remodeled and built several  houses in nb. our first bid   job was a remodel for ray milland on lido.  dillman's was our favorite   watering hole and max always was glad to see us when we arrived.  george   pearlan had a couple of stations and would adjust my car to keep it   from pinging each summer.  fry of fry's market lived across the street   from us.  the balboa beacon published over a dozen of my stories about   balboa, the area has always been very special to us.

                        thanks so much jim. balboa is so important to me, as a   place i grew up, and where my family had a business for many years. i   think no one else captures the important parts of balboa and all it   means to so many people as you do with this site. simply by posting   email messages you receive from visitors you perform an immense service   to everyone who holds balboa in a special place in their heart.                   my particular time in balboa spans the years from 1957   to 1992. surely the 'golden years' in there somewhere. i treasure   hearing from people who love balboa and the time they were there, either   as visitors or residents, or something in between. every message you   post triggers a memory for me. you cannot overestimate the importance of   this web site.                   as i related to your site some years ago, my family   owned playland arcade in the block between the fun zone and the pavilion   from 1957 to 1992.                   i'd be especially interested in hearing from people who   remember playland arcade. and to the very many young people who i was so   fortunate to have working with me at playland, thank you. i'd love it   if you could post here and relate your memories of that time.

to bill cook,
                        i was the entertainer at woodys in 1971&1972. jim   would have to verify, but there was an artist named virgl partch that   used to do sketches i believe.

                        my girlfriend and i use to go to woody's on sunday   afternoons in the early 70's.  for a period of time they had an artist   who would rapidly paint great pictures on large canvas, from the back of   a boat while speaking to the patrons via microphone.  he was quite the   artist and showman.  my girlfriend, who became my wife, bought one for   me and it has been my prize possession, even more so now that she has   passed away.  he rarely signed the art but he did mine.  i am hoping   someone can tell me the artist name.  i can only make out the first few   letters.  it looks like beau ?

                        i have no problem whatsoever being a realist and wow...   were you having a bad day when you sat down and wrote this rambling   foolishness? newport beach in no way, shape or form sucks. it is, and   always has been paradise.                   sorry that you hate smog, but it is a reality in   southern california. and as for your concern about “the hills” â¦ well,   it’ called development, growth, and progress.                   the attitude of those who live on balboa remains much as   it always has been: friendly, welcoming, and one that clearly   represents someone who lives a blessed lifestyle.                   arnold now lives in oc, no one cares where you were   born, and in all the years that i personally knew john wayne â he never   referred to himself as “mr. morrison”. yes, he did dislike the airport   because the take-off flight-path was lmost directly over his home, but   why you take issue with oc naming the airport in his memory is â¦ well,   silly.                   i do agree that anyone who arrived in our community   after 1978 missed decades of amazing events and history, but that they   have been, since 1978, building their own amazing history.                   and finally, speaking for those of us who still live in   and love newport beach and south oc, we too are glad that you didn’t   spawn any hate-filled off-springs that would probably find themselves   more comfortable in the mobile home community that you now reside,   rather than the shining star of orange county, california.

merry christmas to all of my good   friends. sorry about the problems with tales of balboa. balboa gallery   moved to a new location on the bay front two months ago and it has taken   all of this time to get an interner connection. add to this computer   problems and we have a real mess. i'm glad to say things are back to   normal. i hope. i've added two new live cams for you balboa buffs that   can't get enough of balboa. enjoy thanks for sticking with tales of   balboa through thick and thin.

i love new port beach...the people are   great, the beaches are clean, the views are breath taking. and the   kindness of the owner of 15th street surf shop is beyond cool. staying   after hours to help me find a locksmith on a sunday a hour and a half   after he had closed only to have the lifeguard find them as i waited for   a locksmith. dave is just one of the great people i met there and we   always have a great time in new port beach!...thank you!

i just found out that a wonderful   restaurant/bar in balboa that used to be dillman's, then the shorehouse   at main and balboa blvd. has been taken over, remodeled and turned into a   pizza place called cruisers. it makes my heart sink to think of those   cozy, beautiful red leather booths, classic round bar in the middle,   polished wood walls with trophy fish is now a place for bikers who want   pizza. the interior has been completely torn out, they kept the round   bar but took all the leather away and now have wood planks. i knew max   dillman well and he personally greeted the diners who went there for   full course meals with top notch service and real tablecloths.  so sad.    i wanted to return for a visit, but now i think, what's the use?  all   the places i loved are gone.

you know, i hate to be the realist, but,   the reality is that newport now officially sucks. has anybody else ever   noticed that many of the late summer days are kind of orange in tint?   the inland basin smog is the reason...catalina used to be visiable every   day. now? to see it is a treat. and what happened to the hills? looks   to me like they are covered with plastic people living plastic lives.   and the attitude of people living on balboa island...sheesh! talk about   the hummer driving, small peni* crowd! arnold would fit right in! and   west newport was always a bit rough and tumble, but now it's alot of   folk who would fit in just as well in palmdale or lancaster. and this is   an opinion coming from somebody who was born on pearl street in 1962   (mom couldn't get to hoag)...so i know! i lived there untill i saw the   worst coming (thanks, ms. irvine), and left in '92.  did you all know   that john wayne (mr. morrison to us) hated the airport, and opposed any   expansion of it? and what did the county do when he passed on? renamed   oc airport in his honor! 
                        jim, your site is delightful, but it is about time   somebody pointed out that it is far from peaches and cream. those of you   who didn't arrive until after 1978 wouldn't believe what you missed,   nor that you actually added to the problem by arriving in the first   place.  welcome to reality! i sure am glad that i didn't reproduce and   add to the mess that is now southern california!

i grew up on oceanfront and a street and   have wonderful memories of after dinner walks on the pier, learning to   ride my bike in the park in front of my house and mom sendign me on last   minute runs to balboa market for missing dinner ingredients.  my folks   owned clarke's surf shop on 15th and i spent my childhood riding back   and forth between balboa and the shop - my second home.  i miss those   days!
                        i also remember nana's restaurant as a favorite spot for amazing food.  a family favorite!

hello editor "tales of balboa",
                        i am looking for information about the s. s. wheeler   that was located at 1115 e. balboa blvd.  is there a source of   information, photographs, etc that i could have access to?

our family has been coming to newport   beach and balboa peninsula each summer for about 35 years. the classic   1-2 week beach house rental. so many memories of the fun zone and sadly,   it is nothing like it use to be.
                        no more: scary dark ride, tea cups, bumper cars, merry   go round, balboa market. thank goodness the arcades are still there -   although a bit long in the tooth. now we have kids and they are not   seeing the "fun" in the fun zone. in fact we have nick named it the "not   so fun zone". yes there are carnival attractions if you like $10 2-3   minute rides after waiting in a long line. or maybe you can talk your   kids into going to the museum and learning centers once (good luck   getting them to go twice).
                        also, nothing like getting there in the morning with   super tourists lined up around the corner with backpacks waiting for the   ride to catalina. and forget about trying to grab a slice of pizza or   ferry ride when the self-entitled groms - er junior lifeguards - take   over the whole place.
                        we've gradually moved towards the peninsula over the   years and the most recent stay was south of balboa pier. here's   something the beach rental descriptions fail to mention: "every day,   starting at exactly 7:00 am in the morning, you will here the delightful   sound of major jet liners taking off from john wayne airport". it's   like an alarm clock. count on this.
                        still, the area has its pluses: a great beach and warm   water. bike path that if you are up for the challenge, you can ride from   balboa pier to huntington pier for a nice 15 mile (round-trip) bike   ride. balboa island is still charming (on bikes i recommend taking the   first alley way off the ferry on the right if you want to get to the   main street (marine). world class shopping and dinning.
                        i still love the area, just looking for something that suits my family a little more these days.
                        i just wanted to write this before the balboa brain   trust decides to put another learning center up in place of something   fun. kids are on summer break and want rides/arcades/laser tag and not   museums and learning centers. they do that in school.

our parents took us to balboa the last 2   weeks in august when we were kids in the '40's from bakersfield. does   anyone remember someone who invented what he called a doty board? he let   my dad and brother ride it. a rider would stand on a wooden board,   probably a little bigger than a boogie board, and hold onto a rope. it   had a gas motor and you'd ride standing up. when you let go of the rope   the motor would cut off. doty told dad it would be the "next big thing"   on the bay.
                        loved getting ice cream at the jolly roger window and   balboa bars. and the bump cars, 2nd small ferris wheel, and   merry-go-round at the fun zone.

hello! i am wondering if anyone remembers   my grandfather's restaurant from the 50's & 60's? it was mexican   food on the penninsula just across from the fun zone where you enter the   ferry. i think the name was dad's or maybe nana's, i can't remember.    my grandfather's name was alex salazar, he and my great grandmother ran   the place. it was no frills, perfect for the beach and great food! when i   was very young, my mom & her sisters elenita (nana), little alex   & alice worked at the restaurant and at the frozen banana place in   the same building. he also owned original pizza by the nb pier. i spent   many years running around that place. bob, who owned the fun zone was   one of my grandfather's best friends and was very kind to me. also,   there were trampolines right by the fun zone also. lots of fun growing   up around there.

interesting (old) read:
                        seems the subject of cruise ships in newport beach is   being bandied about again. the local shops may sell more t shirts and   maybe a burger. cruise ship passengers do not spend their lodging and   dining dollars on shore however,  leading to some opinions that they are   nor a positive addition. 
                        location important in my opinion - cruise ships seem   natural in catalina - maybe not so much in places like the bvi and   jamaica from what i have seen. - here is the link that started the ball   rolling - and many are whispering in my ear that this is what all the   coming changes are about .... think the museum has enough staying power   to see the day cruise ship tenders land on their docks for the 711 type   goodies, sunglasses and  one stop boat rentals? - grin

we've been visiting balboa from the uk   for the last 18 years and have seen the numerous changes in that time. i   always enjoy coming back each year, this year for 6 weeks, parking up   in the a street lot and pitching my towel by tower a and enjoying the   awesome view. in those years we have seen the msssteam groms grow from   small boys to young men and enhance their skimboarding skills each year.   go for it. zane, grant and all!!!! our short trips on the ferry accross   to the island for a balboa bar and lunch at wilmas are always a   delight. my walls at home are covered with photographs of balboa, the   ocean and the ferries, keeping me happy when i'm away from what i wish   was my home town! see you in august/september 2014.

my name is harold dieckman.  my sister   and i spent every summer on balboa island from 1959, to 1975.  our   grandmother  bought  a  house on opal ave. in 1959. i don't  remember    the address of that one, but  it  was 3 doors  from the  south    bayfront.  there was  actually  a vacant sandlot next  door then.    directly on  the south bayfront was a  little  walk up food stand, which   also rented pink wooden paddleboards.  the following  year, my    grandmother sold the house on opal ave,  and bought   201,and 201 1/2    ruby ave.  this property stood at  the corner  of  ruby and  park ave.   on the north side  of   park.  we spent  every summer  there from   1960-1975.  in 1969, my mother, charlotte dieckman,  had the  house   remodeled,  and added a custom made black  rot iron front  gate with the    initial "d".  upon  visiting  the island  in may 2014, i was  amazed    to find the  entire house was different, but the  gate with "d" on it    was  still there.  i was  glad to know  that  a small part of  my    family's history still remains in a place that holds  so many happy   memories for my sister  and  i.      sincerely,  harold  dieckman

don't worry about going back.  the bay,   pier, and beach front are pretty much the same.  the ferris wheel is   still there and the pavilion as well as the "penny arcade" (of coarse,   not a penny anymore), shops, restaurants, ferry, etc.
                        my aunt and uncle had a cabin a block off of the newport   pier during the 40's, 50's and 60's and i spent many summers there.    lots of great memories of time at balboa pitching pennies at the arcade   and swimming to the floating dock in the bay.
                        last week i rented a condo across from the newport   grammer school on balboa ave. (the same school my cousin attended in the   40's, she is 73 now and i am 72).  what a nostalgic trip.  my husband   and grandsons (12 and 15) came with me.  we sat on the beach, rode the   waves on boogie boards, walked the board walk, rode bikes, went deep sea   fishing.  what a blast from the past.
                        if i could, i would spend all of my summers there.
                        thanks for this site and the 1951 circa balboa map.  boy did it bring back good memories.

my family stayed in balboa every summer   during the 1950s. we rented a small yellow cottage in an area we called   the "yellow cabins". very rustic, with an outdoor shower. the small   beach was a short walk away, right in front of a restaurant called (i   believe) "the christian hut". very south seas in decor. i went down to   the amusement park every day, to ride the merry-go-round, and toss ping   pong balls in fish bowls. i almost always went home with a gold fish or   two. even though i was only 7 or 8 years old, i wandered about freely.   in the evening, we road the ferry to lido isle.these are happy memories   from my childhood. now in my 70s, i'd love to go back, but fear the   changes would be too great.

                        i remember being on a boy scout charter to catalina   circa 1964 -5 on the island queen. remember the "islander discount" and   having to pay doug bombard a landing fee at two harbors?
                        i have heard  tell that the current pavilion puc  permit   to avalon has its origins in those early island queen trips.  the queen   of balboa being built in 1974 by crystaliner / costa mesa - same hull   as the tiki and one of the hornblower boats.  last but not least the   pavilion queen - converted to a private residence i hear.
                        i also remember the day the flyer came to town and her   first trip to catalina - still an impressive boat.  bob black sending   her off every morning? - please share my best. he would know about the   pavilion queen

my first house as a "grown up", with 3 friends was                   on island ave in 1971. cost $200/month during the school year.
                        my last home on the peninsula, in 1975, was a courtyard apartment                   on the bay (we called it the back bay - but now far up) just past                   lido island. a lovely shade of pink and now torn down. somewhere i                   have a photo of the bay out the large picture window. but i wish i                   could find photos of the courtyard and design. i'd love to find a                   setting like that again!

a tad weird. clearing out old links from desktop i                   tapped on this one. last visit 9/23/2011. opened to take a peek at                   the the ole home town, moved to hood river, ore. 5 yrs ago. the                   first car to drive on the ferry is the exact make and model of my                   car. seems someone has taken my place in balboa. i'm waving from                   here, just turn the camera way north, smiles,

thanks for your webcam of one of my favorite                   places.â  i work in a cubicle, so it's nice to have a view of the                   outside world.â  you used to have this camera pointed up a little,                   so that you could also see the irvine skyline, and i think also                   santiago (saddleback) peak.â  could you please nudge the camera up a                   bit so it's like that again?

re: the jolly roger...the jr closed about 1982. i                   was one of the last waiters, and the last of a years long tradition                   in my family of working there and on the ferry.

                        the freighter that ran aground was the coos bay. as i recall it                   lost it's rudder and drifted out of control, just missing the end                   of the balboa pier. it beached just west of the pier. people can                   e-mail me for a picture. put coos bay in the subject line.

jim,
                        the best christmas gift i could receive is to see tales of balboa                   back.
                        i spent my youth working all over the fun zone, playland and bay                   arcadeâ â  the balboa market, the pavilionâ  and forâ  dal                   grettenbergers harbor cruise. and the old pavilion queen my firsts                   saving account was at the old bank of american building in the                   early 60's. my sister debbie was a go go dancer at the rendezvou. 
                        now living in florida i need to take a look at the bay on the web                   cams ever couple of days to remind me of how magical balboa really                   is.
                        thank you for coming back

hi jim,
                        several years ago i sent you a photograph of my uncle, homer "smitty"                   smith (balboa market). i noticed an email from my cousin, deborah                   (debbie) smith. i sent her an email at that time, but never heard                   back from her (not sure if the email was good). i have not been in                   touch with her since the early 60's, and really wish to now. do you                   have any way of contacting her?

                        britta's went into hidi's second location and was a really fine                   restaurant.â  i miss them both.

                        great having the site back up. i first came to                   balboa in 1943 when my dad was western regional director of the uso.                   we lived right behind christians hut.â  i grew up mostly in santa                   ana but was off to the beaches of newport, on bikes, motor                   scooters, cars and hitch hiking any free moment. retired back on                   the peninsula 12 years ago.â  my wife worked for years at pavilion                   as gm and was partner in the catering operation when we met 30                   years ago. great to see bubbles and dillmans starting back up.

what's going on with the fun zone bay front                   where the bungee jump and the shark ride are.â  where are all                   the visitors going to stand to view the christmas boat parade. is                   it true that the fun zone is going to put up bleachers where the                   hamster ball was and charge a $10.00 per person fee for people to                   use them for just one hour? why does the city let this happen?â                    it's obvious palms are being greased right and left by very deep                   pockets and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

hi jim-
                        do you take donations, or are you independently wealthy? also, i                   will assume that you have noticed that the ferry cam has drooped a                   bit, and the skyline is no longer visible. the skyline makes the                   view complete!
                        keep on trucking, and thank you for your site. pj wheeler, born and                   bred on the island.
                        ps: i always wonder about a boy i knew named derek, who used to                   live above the building on south bay front, about where the pilates                   building is now...the dock was the shell marine fuel station...a                   few doors down from dons' market on the island. derek, where are                   you?

hi jim,

                        i was feeling a bit nostalgic and went looking for photos of mr.                   fun foods online.â  i started working there for millie when i was 10                   years old, way back in 1979, making cotton candy and washing her                   windows.â  i stayed with her there until 1986.â  needless to say,                   that was a huge part of my young life, having worked there from my                   days at newport elementary all the way through my time at harbor                   high.â  i was just hoping to have a look at the place again.â  not                   balboa beach treats, but mr. fun foods, as it was then.â  i was very                   surprised when the only picture i could find was the one taken from                   the side on your site during the floods. iâm writing today to ask                   if you happen to have any others.â  and if you do, would you please                   send them along?â  it sure would put a smile on this balboa girlâs                   face.

for many years i have been aware of a story                   about the chevy dealership on pch in the early 1950's giving away                   vacant lots on balboa island as a premium for buying a car. is                   there any truth to this?

                        hi jim!
                        hooray!! you're back!â  i am a born-and-raised islander (popped out                   of dear old mom at 121 pearl in 1962, finally left in 1988), and am                   so glad you have taken the helm again! i visit often, still laugh                   at the plastic people that live there, and simply enjoy a day of                   memories. when i can't physically go, your site is the next best                   thing. next time i'm there, may i buy youâ  a cup of coffee? would                   sure like to meet you!

dear jim ~ i am so pleased that my friend barry                   kazmer has introduced me to your site. i spent many weekends at the                   rendezvous staying slender doing the "surfer stomp" and attending                   the wild parties during bal week was a risk and lots of fun as                   well. i'll never forget when it became mandatory to show id that                   one had residency there or was not allowed entrance to the                   peninsula without an address of the party you were visiting. that                   was the end of bal week a tradition that holds many memories. i'm                   pretty sure my first frozen banana was experienced on balboa                   island. thank you for bringing forth these memories.

jim, 
                        i am so glad to see that you have returned to the site. i always                   loved seeing what you had come up with each month and seeing which                   old friends had written their messages to you as well.
                        i have to pick up a couple of your books too. i have the original                   book made up from the archives and it has been a treasure!
                        just so nice to see this back! thank you!

i have been monitoring this site since i                   stumbled across it a few years ago while searching for info in the                   prison of socrates coffee house that used to be in balboa. the site                   was partially operational for a while, thenâ  briefly off the air                   entirely. glad to see it's back up and apparently in full                   operation.

what happened to the fun zone? it was casual and                   it was fun, it was a family fun spot with reasonable prices.â                    now it's the very expensive explore ocean,â  with kids in                   uniforms collecting disneyland prices. where's the merry-go-round                   and the bumper cars. thanks for proving that there's nothing that a                   bunch of pompous over the hill, so called businessmen can't make a                   lot worse. just to prove they are the legends in their own minds.                   why don't they get real.

hi jim! â my father (bud lincoln) introduced me to your site many                   years ago, and ever since i actually moved to newport beach to take                   care of him, your website has been my mainstay for weather,                   earthquake info, etc. â i just love it!!! i am especially fond of                   the web cam at the ferry crossing, but i noticed tonight that the                   time was an hour off, so i’m thinking that it was not changed when                   we “sprang ahead” a couple of weeks ago. â thanks for keeping up                   such a great site; it is a valuable community tool and a real                   treasure!!

thanks for tales from balboa. i've been reading                   bits and pieces here for years now as my historical research takes                   me in different directions. 
                        right now i'm trying to learn more about the "orange county harbor                   park" a.k.a "joyland" which was planned during the mid-1930s, but                   was never completed. (they got as far as pushing some dirt around,                   i think.) eventually, a very watered down (no pun intended) version                   of the project was built on the same land and became newport dunes.
                        i was wondering if you know anything about this or have stumbled                   across any interesting joyland anecdotes.

                        i am tony and linda's (mr. balboa barber shop) granddaughter. i                   don't know if you will remember meeting me, but i was my grandpa's                   apprentice for a year out there, and you came in and took a picture                   of us to go with a story you wrote on the shop some months ago. i                   don't remember the exact date, or even the month, but i was hoping                   there was a way for you to e-mail me a copy of the story, or a link                   to it. i am making my grandparents a scrap book of the year i spent                   with them, and i thought the story would be really neat to include, 
                        thanks so much.
                      jessi
dear jim,
                        thank you so much for providing this site! balboa and newport are                   my home away from home and my goal is to live there someday..soon. 
                        growing up in northern california until i was in 3rd grade the                   ocean is deeply ingrained in my blood. we moved back to our native                   montana when my grandpa become ill with cancer but my dad made sure                   he saved every dime so we could visit the wedge as often as                   possible. one of my earliest memories of defiance was not getting                   up off the beach after many requests and just crying when i had to                   finally leave. 
                        now i bring my children whenever i can. we drive a little getta and                   can make it to the beach from bozeman, mt for $50 .00:) 
                        i is heaven to me and cant wait to be there live but until then i                   thank you from the bottom of my heart for the live cam and helping                   me get through the land lock. i love montana too but balboa is the                   ultimate! get sandy for me:)

i sure miss jiffy burgers. wow! i was little                   then but were they the 'bomb'!
                        can you locate the mural on the snug harbour cantina. i would sure                   like to see that again. i know they rebuilt the area. the bartender                   (frank) was a tall older guy with a uni-brow. the keg beer was 90                   cents and we used to smoke tiparillos for 50 cents.

hello again balboa, part ii:
                      jim asked me to finish my story as all of it didn't copy over. i                   really enjoyed going over to the villa marina to watch ann margaret                   singing at the bar lounge. she was awesome. as a family we would                   watch the fishing boats enter the jetty with binoculars to see what                   flags were flying, then race to the balboa angling club to watch                   the days catch raised from the boats for the weight, duration of                   time to complete the catch. during my time growing up in balboa,                   the skipper of choise was john vitalich. he grew up on catalina                   island and learned his technique's from zane grey. he was best                   friends with john wayne and even filled in for john in utah so john                   wayne could go fishing. both john wayne & john vitalich would meet                   up at andy devine's boat, on lido isle, for card games, drinking &                   food.
hello balboa, part iii:
                        the main watering hole in balboa was dillman's. bill dillman &                   karam, beverly hills restaurant owner bought the restaurant from                   the robinson family and the name changed to karam's. karanm brought                   sammy milker from his restaurant in beverly hills to tend bar in                   balboa. a short time later bill bought out karam and dillman's was                   born. i remember family dinners taking place at dillman's along                   with half of the peninsula weekly. bill turned the running of                   dillman's over to his son, max. the last time i was at dillman's                   was in the mid 1980's and i ran into opal dillman, max and his son                   jimmy, the bartender. we all talked about the good ole days. 
                        parking was always an issue in balboa. i remember easter week in                   the early 1960's, newport would install road blocks directing                   traffic to the parking on the ocean front at palm and bringng it                   out from the pier to dillman's on main, by-passing the market.                   there was alot of commotion on balboa blvd. so i walked outside of                   the market to see mt dad in the middle of the street removing all                   of the detour signs and re-directing traffic so that they could get                   to the market. quite a humorous sight. all of the business's shop                   keepers were outside applauding smitty. there was quite a group of                   joksters that hug out together causing mayhem. my dad and a group                   of friends left a restaurant close by the ferry and proceeded down                   the boardwalk past all of the cars waiting for the ferry. one of my                   dad's friends went up to the first car in line and informed him                   that he needed to advance to the line so that once the ferry docked                   he could proceeed to board the ferry. once the car advanced on the                   boarding ramp, the cars behind him all fell into place to board.                   now you have a ferry approaching the dock with no way to get the                   cars off. that little joke took hours to correct but provided quite                   the visual comedy of errors to the bystanders.

                        hello balboa, part iv:
                        in the mid 1960's my dad found elk/deer hunting to be very                   enticing and spent every elk/deer hunting season at a ranch in                   colorado, prompting our move in the mid 1960's to grand junction,                   colorado where my dad created and opened the western slope feedlot.                   he provided the balboa market with the fresh beef from the feedlot                   along with a good portion of the game during hunting season. while                   still owning the villa marina smitty pu on "free wild dinner's" at                   the villa marina once a year providing the game aquired during                   hunting season. the only thing that the customer had to pay for was                   their bar bill. this yearly free wild dinner's were moved to take                   place at dillman's. smitty also took the fresh elk and had it made                   into elk sausage to present to treasured customers & boat owners                   with this delicacy for christmas presents along with gold zippo                   lighters with the balboa markert logo included with the customers                   signature in both the man and woman size for christmas presents .                   he also gave silver zippo lighters with the balboa market logo                   engraved in balboa blue and also gin score pads with the balboa                   market logo. dad was very generous to hiw customers holding them in                   the highest regards. since it was quite a feat to keep both the                   market and the feedlot operating within his high standards he sold                   the balboa market to eugene smith in 1973. smitty passed away in                   the early 1080's. marilyn currently resides in costa mesa. she is                   moving to las vegas so that we can be closer to each other.                   everytime i went to ca. to visit my mom we would always make a trip                   to balboa, walk the blvd.,boardwalk, main st. just to get the                   feeling of being a native of balboa back in my blood stream. i                   loved that feeling. since october 11th we have not returned back as                   all of our memories are now in our hearts, no longer to gaze upon.                   my only hope now is that balboa can regain it's tight small beach                   family feel for all of the people that still call balboa home.

watching your site is like running into old                   friends!! the email from debbie smith brought back old memories                   again.â  the villa marina on balboa island was indeed taken over by                   homer "smitty" smith along with max & bill dillman, frank usedom                   (village inn restaurant), gordy weavil(gordy's bait & tackle) and                   sammy _____.â  they recruited me to do the book work which was an                   utterly chaotic experience but a treasured one!!â  
 bettetee@yahoo.com

is there any way you can tell me the date the                   above photo was taken?
                        my friends say that sure looks like me (in blue) behind the wheel                   house on the ferry. i remember a few years ago on a may early                   morning when a professional photographer was taking pictures on the                   ferry. we stay on the island every may around art walk time. i                   would buy a large size copy if i was pretty sure of the id.

hello balboa,
                        i am writing this to correct some of the information given on the                   history of the balboa market. my name is deborah s. smith. i was                   born in 1949 @ st. joseph in santa ana as hoag was not built yet.                   my brother , dallas n. smith was born in 1951. my family lived on                   bay ave. my mother, marilyn f. smith ran the cottage beauty shop                   out of our home and my father, homer m. smith, smitty, originally a                   butcher,bought wades market down from the pavillion, across from                   the theater next door to the liquor store owned by coy & hazel                   before i was born. he changed the name of the store to the balboa                   market. it was a small little store but business boomed. the larger                   market in town on balboa blvd. part of a large chain, approached my                   dad, told him since he had the majority of the business in town                   along with the fishing community provisioning the boats for their                   fishing expeditions that he should buy their store as they thought                   they were in a bad location. in 1950 the balboa market on balboa                   blvd was born. my mother moved her beauty shop to the balboa inn. a                   short time later the inn sold and she then bought a store located                   down from dillmans. she had the store for 10 years, working in both                   her shop and the market, before selling it to dee murphy. once the                   beauty shop sold she became fully immersed in the market.â                    customers would call in their orders daily, and the food was                   delivered to them in a refrigerated van. alot of the customers each                   had charge accounts provided for ease of shopping. in the late 50's                   we moved to the peninsula, 5 or 6 houses from the wedge on the                   ocean front. i spent the majority of my time at the fun zone and                   the renvdezvous ballroom watching and dancing to dick dale and the                   deltones, jan & dean, the righteous (sp) bros & the beach boys.â                    everyone in balboa hung out there until somone flushed a lit cherry                   bomb down the toilet in the mens restroom and the owner closed the                   venue. in the mid to late 50's my dad bought a restaurant, the                   villa marina, over at the exit off balboa island. i'll never forget                   watchin

i just saw the link to the pavilion interior.â â                    apparently the restaurant took over the operation of the tale of                   the whale saloon and redecorated it with hd tvs.â  they completely                   ruined the quaint, rustic, romantic bar.â  why can't they realize                   they have a jewel of an operation and leave things alone.â â  you                   didn't go to the tale of the whale to watch hdtv you went there to                   enjoy the beautiful bay and the camaraderie of friends.â  what a                   shame.â

                        i'm sorry to bother you, but i have spent hours                   searching the internet w/o success.
                        i have a framed print of the picture of the balboa pavilion w/ the                   nearly bare newport beach peninsula behind it. my aunt would like                   to buy a copy as well, but i haven't found anywhere that sells                   them. i am writing from omaha, or i would have just gone down there                   and i'm sure i would have found one.
                        can you tell me where i might buy a copy over the phone or on line                   and have it shipped to northern california. i really appreciate                   your help. i've seen the photo again and again on websites, but                   haven't found anything about buying one.

in an earlier message i recalled mike mayer who                   lived on the grand canal c. 1948-55 as i had seen his wife sue's                   posting about the punting and sculling soc from 2005. i finally                   located them through the defunct email address on your site, but                   not until after mike died of lung cancer in 2008. mike's dad harvey                   mayer kept boats and foreign cars running on the island; his own                   maroon 1934 mg magnette (now mine) was usually parked at the one                   service station on the island, catacorner from the jolly roger (i                   remember when this was opened with an ice cream stand out front).                   harvey got many persons into sports cars, including virgil parch; i                   have a snap shot of parch with our crowd at the 1950 pebble beach                   road races. on another front, oneâ  correspondent posts re. tim                   morgan at the prison of socrates--yes that was surely tim who                   mostly lives up north now and rarely plays due to arthritis; we                   went to high school together in pasadena; he hung out on the beach                   near the newport pier looking for girls. tim's family owned some                   rental cottages there. in 1960 he was just getting into folk                   music--he earlier performed "day-o" at our 10th grade talent show.

hi jim, i noticed that my favorite live webcam                   is stuck (the ferry webcam). i wasn't sure if anyone was aware.                   it's my connection to "home" 
                        thanks for all you do.

jim,
                        i'm a fan of your photography; i have a number of your prints                   hanging on my walls. do you sell digital images that i can use as                   home screens or rotating photos on my computer? if so, how much are                   they and how would i go about purchasing them?
                        thanks.

hello jim: i recall punting and sculling with                   mike mayer from the dock in front of harvey mayer's place on the                   canal circa 1952--before the mayers moved up on the bluff over the                   back bay. we rented a place on the island every summer through our                   friend margie hadfield who had a real estate office between the                   grocery store and dress shop (?). our parents were close friends                   and i still own a 1934 mg magnette my dad bought from mike mayer's.                   do you have a current email or other contact info for mike mayer?

hi jim,
                        by now most people in town know, but i would like to impose upon                   your site for a moment to let everyone who might visit here know                   that my father, peter torre, some time fisherman, founder of                   charlie's chili, some time bartender, and bisps member, passed away                   peacefully in his sleep monday june 28, 2010.
                        he was in good spirits to the end, but was clear he did not want a                   big fuss made over his passing.â  in accordance with those wishes,                   his family and friends will gather at tony's place in costa mesa to                   celebrate his incredible life july 10th, "around" 1:00 pm
                        come by, hoist a beverage, and help us send him off...

                        i graduated from buena park high school in june                   1961.â  for the prom that year my steady girlfriend (judyâ  mc.) and                   i had a great dinner at berkshires restaurant.â â  those were the                   days.

i remember the tale of the whale rest very much                   because i worked there between my sophomore ( 1972 ) and my senior                   year ( 1974 ) in hs. i went to costa mesa hs and worked weekends                   there upstairs in the ball rooms. i was an busboy and would set up                   the rooms, both sides for weddings, hs proms, business meetings,                   ect......also my mother worked there in the saloon/bar as an                   cocktail waitress downstairs between the 1960's until about 1980 or                   so. the owners bill & rita were great people and also took real                   good care of there employees. for some of you that knew rita, she                   passed away sometime in the late 80's or early 90's. i'm not                   exactly sure when........bill sold the rest. and retired to idaho,                   i believed to be with his daughters. those were great memories and                   fun times........

i also found aâ  copy of "dick's joint"â  in my                   posession circa 30 years (264/1000) in new condition.......looking                   for value? there really was a cap'n dick shaw richard blake shaw,                   master of the famed character tugboat "michigan," died unexpectedly                   while asleep on august 22, 1976. he was sixty years old. a native                   of seattle, shaw attended the chicago art institute and was a                   regular cartoon contributor to colliers and the saturday evening                   post in the thirties. he later was a writer for both disney studios                   and upa where he was an academy award winner for the near-sighted                   mr. magoo cartoon series. shaw began free-lancing in 1950 in                   newport beach, california, and except for frequent conferences with                   his long-suffering banker, enjoyed a lifestyle that was the wonder                   and envy of his many pals. he was a founder and commodore of the                   balboa island punting & sculling society, an odd assortment of                   millionaires and bums, known nationally for their boat trip to las                   vegas and train ride to catalina island, both shaw-inspired. shaw's                   lodgings, however grand or modest, were always "the hotel splendide"                   and provided a watering hole which shaw proclaimed "open 24 hours a                   day." himself a prodigious boozer, but always a gentleman, shaw                   despised drunks. his appetite for, and exploits with the fair sex                   were legendary, and provided inspiration for the drawings herewith,                   penned by a world-famous contemporary and carefully saved by shaw                   for over two decades. it should be noted that although shaw                   abhorred obscenity, like most of us he thoroughly enjoyed vulgarity                   when redeemed by humor. as a friend, who happens also to be                   presiding justice of an appellate court remarked, "hell, tnese                   cartoons aren't dirty they're funny!" finally, a comment from                   shaw's best and dearest friend, virgil (vip) partch, "anyone who                   would depict my late pal in such fashion must have an evil                   imagination ... or else have known him very well."

ron white was a very exciting man who always had                   a great smile on his face. even toward the end his doctor said that                   he had a zest for life. he was a man of different hobbies and                   talents. he was a car salesmen, a fisher and airplane pilot. he                   loved his family, friends and everyone around him. but i believe                   that in the last two years of his life he became more intact with                   his kids and grandkids. i know from personal exsperience. every                   time i saw my grandfather he was always teaching me some kid of                   life leason. before he passed he was making sure that i knew what i                   was going to do with my life. he was a man that always kept you                   laughing about something. there was never a time with him that you                   felt unloved or lonley. cause he was alwasy right there. he will me                   greatly missed and always loved.... by everyone who kenw him, his                   kids steve, doug, louie, vince and maria. his three daughter-in                   laws bonnie, leanne and mary as well as the grandchildren. kevin,                   chris, sheldon, niels and nathen and me amber. oh yeah and one on                   the way... but most of all his loving wife nadine white... 
                          one service will be held at his home on may 15 at 2pm and the other                   of course at max dillmans on may 16 at 2 pm.

â i also heard there would be something written                   about ron white. i am the grandaughter of aj gibson and grew up my                   entire life knowing ron. he was a wonderful man, always full of                   life and had a laugh that i will always remember. he married my                   husband and i in 1996 and had many words of wisdom for us. he told                   my mother two weeks ago "that was one of my better unions"..always                   quick with a joke even at the end of his life. ron you will be                   close in hearts always and missed ~much love, stella

jim:
                          many thanx to you for putting up a website devoted to such a                   wonderful place for so many of us with those memories of years                   past. i have my own wonderful memories as i was lucky enough to be                   born in the 60's at hoag, and i got to live and visit balboa for                   all my childhood years.â  i am lucky because i had both sides                   of my family (watts and bergeron )from balboa- my parents both                   attended newport, my older brothers starting out their education                   where my dad started his, at the elementary school along the beach.                   my grandfather has a memorium plaque amongst the palm trees in the                   park by the pier.
                          this e-mail tho is about my grandmother who has been mention before                   in your mails. hazel along with my grandfather coy spent most of                   their adult lives helping with the development of balboa since the                   30's.â  they owned liqour stores (one shown in your 1951 map/across                   from theater), as well doing other businesses. (remember the                   bowling/pool playing in the pavillion?)â  as a child i got to be                   around all the "good old boys" who met daily at dillmans where i no                   doubt had my first "shirley temple" as i sat and listened to their                   stories and learned to play cards. they were good teachers!
                          my father frank worked the store also and i got to visit my                   grandparents house which was across the street from the wedge.                   can't pick a nicer place to visit. i spent many pennies at the fun                   zone and my brothers learned fishing from the greats around                   there-including my uncle bob watts and great grandpa brader-who                   always had on his suspenders and a smile.
                          anyways as i could go on and on-i really just wanted to let your                   readers know my wonderful grandmother hazel is turning 98 at the                   end of this month and she is still in the area. she was always a                   cheerful store owner/worker and i remember all the people that                   would drop by just to say hello, if not to buy something. in those                   times not many places were down there and definitly not open late                   like they were. i marveled at the fact of them knowing almost                   anyone that came in. they treated everyone the same-john wayne to                   the families that just came for the summers.â  i had wonderful role                   models for how to run your business. they extended credit to those                   that needed it and i was always amazed at how trusting they were.                   the stories they and my parents have for that area is priceless to                   me.
                          grandma isn't now in good health but she has always remainedâ                    positive and upbeat. i have never heard her speak a bad word about                   anyone. she spent many years volunteering with both newport and                   costa mesa senior centers, along with helping with st. andrews and                   hoag. thank you for letting me say thanx to any of your families                   that may have enjoyed my families business and thanx to all those                   that helped raise generations of good people coming from the area. 
                          if anyone reading this cares to send her good wishes, i hope you                   do. she would be delighted people remember. to all those who have                   been lucky, like myself in watching balboa grow and prosper- i hope                   the charm of the honest hard working people who helped form the                   area stays around forever. it will always be in her heart as well                   as mine...born april 30, 1912 she loves to chat and will still tell                   you she has been one lucky lady blessed with loving family and                   friends!!â â â  just being a good person with a good heart and doing                   life in moderation is her best advice to being happy. think i for                   one will stick with that advice.

at around 3pm on april 7, 2010 i was on my boat                   which is on a private pier just down from the caribe on e.                   edgewater and just about 10 feet from the stern of my boat two                   largeâ  dolphin swim by slowly - then circle around between the                   piers and the moorings and then head off in the direction of the                   ferry and the jetty. i have spent a lot of time on this pier for                   the last forty years and this is the first time i have ever seen                   dolphin. perhaps this is bay warming!â â

hi jim.
                          thanks for the great web cams of balboa.â  we enjoy the opportunity                   to revisit balboa vicariously via the cams.
                          please note, however -- in case you were not already aware of this                   -- that the ferry cam has stopped updating.â  additionally, the date                   is set incorrectly (it's one day behind) on the boat rentals cam.â                    otherwise, everything looks okay.
                          regards,

there was a message in april of 04 i believe from                   someone who said they have the last name of dever and lived at my                   grandma bobbie dees address 510 ocean front.â  just wondering if you                   could put me in touch with this person who is probably one of my                   second cousins.â  thanks

jim, my mom owned the clothing store, surf &                   sand from '64-'70's in the exact location where you had your own                   fantastic store and gallery.â  we've had our home down on seville a                   the end of the peninsula since '64.â  i am writing to you regarding                   the 'razing' of the balboa market where i worked from the age of                   14-18 as everything from a box boy (bagger) to checker to produce                   man to butcher.â  i would like to know, does so-called progress                   always have to be insane?â  sadly, balboa is currently a 'drive                   through' town where people who live here don't always stop and                   patronize the local businesses.â  when eugene smith and family owned                   the balboa market, they used to have credit accounts at the market                   allowing local customers to simply pick up groceries and sign a                   receipt, then they would be billed at the end of the month which                   was great for families who sent their kids in to pick up                   necessities.â  the balboa market also had a delivery service for                   groceries which really came in handy for the elderly and in the                   traffic of the summer.â  the balboa market also had the best meat                   department in southern california with fresh swordfish i used to                   off-load from fishing boats every summer as well.â  these were all                   services that enhanced the lifestyle of local residents of balboa.â                    now i heard the current owner also owns the catalina flyer or                   whatever it's called and wanted to knock down the building so his                   customers could have long-term parking right in the middle of                   town.â  what an eyesore!â  if that's been his plan i doubt he's                   really had his heart in getting another long-term tenant in the                   market.â  however, i don't see why the city should buy the building                   then do the exact same thing, especially if they took issue with                   his plan.â  i understand times change but let's look at this on a                   brass tacks level; we have an empty building with 10-15 of it's own                   parking spaces currently, the location is central, the building is                   virtually a landmark with a beautiful mural which enhances balboa's                   character and greets those entering town, and this via

hey jim!â  long time no typy.â  hadn't been on                   your site for quite some time.â  how's biz?â  so, the market is                   going.â  too bad somebody couldn't pick it back up.â  i see you                   must have more than one camera being repaired: the main street                   one?â  a friend of mine will be going to balboa and i wanted to show                   her some photos before she got there.
                          i know this will sound morbid but...who's died lately?â  i was                   thinking about max dillman and the wonderful prime rib they always                   had and it dawned on me he's got to be "up there".â  just wondering.â                    is chucky still at the post office?â  i can always phone or stop by                   but time is of the essence these days.

jim,
                          saw your article on christian's hut, i was told it was first built                   as a bar and sleeping qts. for the crew of the film mutiny on the                   bounty with clark gable in 1935.â â do you know the location on                   balboa,â was it on the island or peninsula,â before it was moved to                   3121 w pch and when?

does anyone remember dan wark, or the wark                   family who resided on the island?â  dan was born in 1947, and died                   in vietnam in 1968, at the ageâ  of 21, after only 3 months of                   service.â  i went to orange coast jr. college with dan in 1966-1967                   and we became best friends.â  we restored my 1923 ford model t                   together, sitting on the beach, watching the bikini clad girls, and                   sanding on the wood spokes.
                          does life get better than that?â  red headed, freckle faced dan wark.â                    what a good time we had, before that dark day... august 18, 1968.â                    shot in the back of the head during an ambush, defending a rubber                   plantation.
                          there will always be more questions than answers.
                          we were young.â  i wrote a verse for my balboa girl friend, to music                   in 1967 for an album i produced entitled, "something in the night."
                          it said:â  "sometimes, i take you with me to the cliffs of newport                   beach.â  we stand and watch the lights of the peninsula tease the                   waters of the back bay.
                          and sometimes, yellow balloons soar high from your fingertips, like                   smiling faces in the sky.
                          and sometimes, we stay at home, and like a child having found a new                   piece to a jig saw puzzle, i fall in love all over." 
                          i was an announcer at kocm fm 103.1 back then.â  playing danny davis                   trumpets while over looking the ocean out the studio windows from                   atop the cliffs created a romantic dimension in my life that only i                   am eternally greatful for.
                          only this unique 1960's setting could touch this 20 year old heart                   so profoundly.â  it could never be duplicated again.â  viva balboa,                   and the great times we baby boomers had in this romantic age of                   orange county.

â hi.. love the webcams.. did you know that                   the one facing the merry go round refreshes every 20 seconds.. not                   every 10.. it counts down from 10 and then counts down again then                   refreshes.. .. just a heads up.. 
                          thanks,

i am outraged that the city of newport beach                   would buy and tear down the balboa market. that building is a                   landmark in balboa. if it was for some useful purpose that would be                   one thing but to turn it into a parking lot is horrible. it                   continues to show the greed of city officials. i can't ever                   remember being in balboa when the market wasn't there, it was there                   at least ten years before i was born. by the way what was the year                   of the photo taken of the market in its heyday? balboa is a                   charming community loved by many, why does the city feel the need                   to destroy that charm? it reminds me of the incident where the city                   came in by night and removed the trees from main street. they                   should be ashamed and the people responsible for this action                   concerning the market should be removed from office. i am sure                   others feel the same way i do and we need to let the city know our                   outrage, i will make my call today.â â â

i really enjoy your site. i cannot believe how                   many years have flown by -- it seems like i was watching the flight                   of the snowbirds (anyone remember that?) just last year. has anyone                   visited the new and improved harbor high? how is it? nhhs '76

hey jim,
                          its been a family tradition for many many years now to visit                   newport beach and stay out on the peninsula.â â  in the past we have                   been renting a beach house from cannery rentalsâ  and staying 219                   east balboa blvd. we loveâ  being able to walk on the boardwalk down                   to the ferry and bay arcade and out to the peir and rubys. anyway                   we called up this year and it is booked for august so i have been                   looking into finding a new place to stay but since i can only see                   photos of a beach house would look like i thought i would ask a                   local if you knew of some beach houses or beach house company's on                   beach side doesn't have to be beach front but something just off                   the beach and within walking distance to the fun zone.â  in the past                   we have paid between $1,500 and $1,700 a week.â  so if you know of                   any places you recommend that would be awesome. thanks so much for                   your time.
                          love your website!â  keeps me updated all year long!

i was just wondering if anyone kept aâ  schedule for                   the new (old) balboa cinema. i think it was a bi-monthly schedule                   with great double and triple features changing every 2 to 3 days.â                    i would love to see one and recreate some of those double features                   for my family.â â  if someone has one and could post a .jpg somewhere                   i would love to see it.

hi jim,
                          could have read it in the blab or just local gossip... but been                   hearing about a polar bear plunge at the balboa pier...
                          fact or fiction... if so,â  let us know what time... can't think of                   a better way to start the 2010!

jim, 
                          it is that time of year again, christmas boat parade. looks like                   you have had some major changes in webcam locations since this                   summer. 2 on the fun zone, lost the one in front of the pavilion                   and the one in the bayâ  arcade has gone away. so just the 4 cameras                   now? only the ferry crossingâ  cam to view the parade, and none to                   view the pavilionâ  and the flyer boarding area?

jim,
                          i came across your site while poking around on google earth. tales                   of balboa is a fun visit.
                          attached are three photos that may interest you for your "photo of                   the month" section.
                          the bumper car image was shot at the fun zone in the early 70's,                   probably "73, as were all of these images.
                          art's landing. . , well is the old art's landing. the boats in the                   fog was shot somewhere close by, as i recall slightly to the south                   of the fun zone.  photoâ   photoâ   photo
                          i wish you much success with your site.

does anyone else remember the christmas tree                   bonfires down by the newport pier on newyears eve?â  the teenagers                   in the neighborhood would go from house to house collecting all the                   christmas trees they could.â  they would pile them into a mountain                   of trees down by the pier and set the whole thing on fire.â  the                   whole town came out to watch.â  i was a kid in newport in the 60's                   and 70's.â  i remember being amazed by this.â

love your web site!â  my family used to vacation                   on balboa island 1955 - 56.â  we loved to go to the jolly roger and                   have tacos, ride the ferry to the fun zone and just enjoy that                   beautiful setting.â  my love was sailing and racing the boats that i                   built while in high school.â  my sister and i would get up in the                   morning and prepare to go sailing.â  i would carry the sail and she                   would carry the rudder and we would walk down to where the boat was                   buoyed.â  i would sail all day up and down the bay in awe of the                   beautiful yachts moored along bay.â  i sailed all over the bay, even                   out the jetty into the ocean when i felt brave. those times sailing                   in my 12 foot sail boat, and racing my b utility racing boat in the                   back bay were the most exhilaratingâ  times of my life.  â photoâ  photo

i was a waitress at the tale ofâ  the whale in the                   early 80's. i really enjoyed the people that lived there at the                   time. bill and rita (caouette) were especially good to the                   employees of the restaurant at that time. i remember evelyn and her                   little candy shop, our favorite breakfast regular's; helen, who                   would always leave a quarter, and betty, who would always leave a                   dollar, a dollar was a lot at that time! my girlfriends and i loved                   to go dancing. i dated a few guys that lived in the area, tim, who                   worked at malarky's and that preppy store next to the pavilion and                   jeff, a cute blond surfer boy. i'd love to find some of these                   people and thank them for the lessons they taught me.

i was wondering if the tale of the whale was still                   in business.â  i used to love to eat there at night as it was lovely                   with all the lights outside.â  i have not lived in orange county                   since 1995 and have regretted it almost daily.

hi jim,
                          sorry i've been out of touch for so long. i lost my parents and                   have spent most of this decade in a very nasty divorce with my                   estranged attorney wife. i still find time to enjoy your e-mails                   and website. thank you! i noticed the e-mail from edward hill                   inquiring about the "casino" sign and thought i should crawl out                   from under my pile and respond with a little history.
                          the casino was never actually a casino. it was just a bar.                   originally the name was workman's casino and was owned by dad                   workman. the name was a carryover from a gambling joint he operated                   on the other side of main st. (in the 100 block) in the 1920s.                   during prohibition, his was one of the many places in townâ you                   couldâ buy alcohol. you would ask for a carton of cigarettes, wink,                   andâ he would putâ a bottle in the box. by the time he moved into the                   storey building, prohibition had been repealed and gambling had                   been clamped down on, so he went legitimate. he soldâ the barâ to two                   guys whose names i can't remember. they may have been brothers.                   they never cared much for mr. workman (few people in town did)â and                   promptly changed the name to fisherman's casino, as the signâ still                   reads. the bar days are marked in old pictures by blacked out                   windows and stainless steel doors in what are now the open arches                   on the corner, as they were originally. the interior was                   highlighted by a semicircular bar against the back wall, which was                   a partition, marked now by a post in the middle of the mithrush                   store. at one point they knocked two openings through the partition                   on either side of the bar and had a dining room in what would,                   yearsâ later, become hidi's cafe. when we did the seismic retrofit                   we pulled up layers of flooring and found the scars where the                   semicircular bar had been.
                          the building was built by fred storey in 1930. balboa marine                   hardware was where the kite store is now. soto nishikawa had soto's                   curio shop on the corner across main from where the post office is                   now. he was the first tenant in the space that would later be                   hidi's, operating two businesses across from each other. he was                   very successful until wwii, when he was sent to an internment camp                   in the arizona desert. he lost everything and died without a penny                   to his name after the war. the first tenant in the corner was the                   balboa sport shop which sold bathing suits and sportswear. upstairs                   in the middle unit was the town dentist, harold stahler. above                   soto's was the raymond beauty shop. also upstairs, over the corner,                   roland thompson (the city attorney for newport beach) had his                   private practice office.â in 1936 judgeâ robert gardner spent his                   first year as an attorney up there. he told me he only made ten                   dollars the whole year. at the far end of the upstairs, fred storey                   had his office. it doubled asâ a summerâ apartment for rowland                   hodgkinson (hodge) who was the police chief. he stayed there when                   he rented his home out to make extra money.
                          as a side note, few people realize as they're walking down main                   street, that yucca valley was born there. it was a venture of ten                   downtown businessmen. among them were fred storey, roland thompson,                   al anderson (balboa fun zone), tommy boucher (harbor master) and my                   grandfather, john vogel. they drilled for water, slapped together                   some buildings, subdivided it and the rest is history. 
                          i guess that's a bit of a long winded way to answer the casino                   question.
                          thanks again,

                          i sit all day long in cubical land, surrounded by gray, brown, and                   icky dark green walls, illuminated by harsh fluorescent lights.â                    even though it's winter the air conditioning is on all the time.â                    your wonderful balboa cams provide a glimpse of the world beyond.â                    hopefully one day i will escape from cubical land and visit your                   wonderful city and travel across the river on the car ferry.â  maybe                   i'll even rent booboo and take him for a walk.â  from the millions                   of unknown cubical workers - thank you!

                          jim,
                          thanks for the website and webcams. i've had fun with my nephews in                   new york when i talk with them on the phone as they view me on the                   internet fun zone webcam. 
                          i have a question about the building in front of the main st.                   webcam that was active. it's the building on the corner where the                   mirbeth store is located. when you look on the back of the building                   there is an old logo/sign of a casino that is faded. we were trying                   to determine the name of the casino, but some of the letters were                   to difficult to read. there is no history about this casino online.                   any history you have on this would be greatly appreciated.â  thank                   you.

in response to bill's email about the buster keaton flick:
                          today for a college film class i watched another one of buster                   keaton's movies, "the cameraman," which also shows him boating                   around the bay with the balboa pavilion in the background. i was                   pretty surprised to see it and found my way here to mention it.                   perhaps he or the production company was a fan of the area!

                          my mom used to live down in balboa during the 70's. my parents were                   separated at the time and i lived in northern california. i would                   always come down to visit her. my aunt also lived down there and                   met her husband, robbie robins. he was the bartender at dillman's                   during the 70's. i remember going to visit and we would always go                   to dillman's for dinner. i remember the daughter, diane. i remember                   her having a daughter. i also remember "uncle herbert's royal                   caboose" i'm pretty sure that was the name. it was right across the                   street from dillman's. they had the train that would go around at                   the top of the circular bar and if it stopped over you, you would                   get a free drink. my uncle is still around. they now live by                   bullhead city, az. my fondest memory is when for christmas one year                   he got me an autographed picture of john wayne. he was my idol                   growing up and that was the best present i have ever gotten. he                   wrote "to mike, my best. john wayne 1978" it was his last                   christmas. i was supposed to go and visit him, but he got ill and                   passed away. but i have always cherished that picture and even got                   to see him once while riding the balboa queen and passing by his                   house. he was standing outside and waved to all of us. memories are                   awesome.

this is great site.â  makes me relive my childhood.â                    i was born at hoag hospitalâ  the first year it opened and lived at                   the endâ  of the peninsula until graduating from newport harbor high                   in 1971.â  the memories of walking to town with the quarter to go to                   the sat. matinee and making sure we hit gundersons beforehand to                   get candy.â  having the beach and basically the town to yourself in                   the winter since most of the homes were summer beach houses.â                    sneaking down to the fun zone, since we weren't suppose to go                   there.â  stopping in at the 5 and dime (i forget the name),â  the                   dory fleet coming in at the newport pier.â  the memories are really                   alive and balboa was a wonderful place to grow up - the beach and                   the bay.

hi, i used to go to the "prison of socrates" to                   hear a folk singer there.â  i can't recall his name for sure, but i                   do believe, after reading a couple of e-mails on your balboa site,                   that it might well have been tim morgan.â  if so, he did the best                   version of "viva la quinta brigada" that i have ever heard. would                   it be possible to contact him?â  it looks like he has continued to                   record and i'm interested in seeing if he has and, if so, if i                   might be able to get some of those recordings. appreciate any help                   you could give. by the way, my memories of balboa are just                   wonderful.â  and sipping coffee and listening to folk music at the                   "prison of socrates", simple pleasure that it was, highlights my                   memories.

hi jim,
                          i received the book and really love it.â        considering my roots are there, i was surprised at the amount of       history i didn't know about balboa.â  i sure will look through my       photos to see if there's any that might be of interest.â  i'll ask my       sister claire & my brother in law.â  his name is dean cordell, and he       ran the paddleboard stand right by youâ in the 50's, also worked the       ferris wheel.â  my father was howard williams, and he was president of       the "then" central newport beach community association and was       responsible in a large part for keeping the beaches public in the area       between alvarado and island avenues, and also for the las arenas       tennis courts & park up by the girl scout house.â  weâ lived on island       avenue, went to our lady of mt. carmel churchâ and my sister and i both       went to newport elementary in the 50's.â  ayway, i'll see what i can       find and will be in touch.

my great aunt and her husband, bob murphy, owned     and ran the rendezvous during the years of the big bands.â  they     also owned the bamboo room.â  i am looking for any photos, memories,     histories of both places.â  nothing was kept by my family. i was     always told the bob murphy was the first (now i cannot remember the     original title) balboa man of the year.â  also, i am looking for     information about using the bamboo room to aide in 'rum running'     during prohibition . anyone who knew him, my aunt jay, and memories     and photos of the rendezvous ball room and /or the bamboo room     please contact me.

                          the old breakfast place in cannery village was called snug harbor.    it was torn down around 2000 and i think the lot is still bare     today.    nobody ever developed it. it was on the corner of villa and     lafeyette or maybe on the corner of 29th and lafeyette    the snug tradition lives on at malarky's - you'll see them post an     ad for a "snug" breakfast on their ad board still.
