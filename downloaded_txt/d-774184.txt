"brilliant for families"


 see more reviewswe are just back from 3 nights camping at this really family friendly campsite. its a relatively compact site but with exactly the facilities you need - a small play area for kids, games room, spotless bathrooms, clean kitchen area with fridge and freezer. the kids made friends almost immediately and enjoyed a "movie night" too. the campsite has a lovely atmosphere, probably because of the wonderful owners michael and susan. in fact, they stepped in and saved us when we were having a tent crisis - they went far beyond the call of duty and all done with a smile. great people running a great campsite. i would definitely recommend a stay!
