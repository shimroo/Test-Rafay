thunderbolt connectair parkflyover request processflyover approval process notes for requestors  
in order to request an aircraft flyover requestors must complete a dd form 2535. this form is generated on https://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/publicsite/index.cfm?fwa=home by selecting the “new request” button.
important note: the requestor is responsible for ensuring the 2535 is completed. public affairs offices and operational groups can assist requestors filling out the form, but must ensure that units aren’t requesting flyovers of their own assets.
key parts of the dd form 2535

section 1 – activity
 
details on the activity being requested


section 2 – event and site information
 
details on the location, time, and audience of the request


section 3 – requestor information
 
information on the person requesting the aerial event


section 4 – federal aviation administration coordination
 
call the local flight standards district office associated with the request area and send them the form for signature
event requests in the highlighted area below are coordinated by the scottsdale fsdo.
their contact information:
  
phone: (480) 284-4450 
fax: (480) 272-7726
email: email the office




for requests outside the highlighted area you can find the offices contact information at the website below:
 
https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/fsdo/

explain how aviation support is an integral part of the event


section 6 – support
 
requestor agrees to support the event as applicable (varies by aircraft and event)


section 7 – certification by requestor
 
certification that information is correct



requests should be completed no later than 30 days in advance of the event. incomplete forms and requests will not be considered. headquarters air force determines whether the event is eligible for support.
if you have questions/need help with the form for a request in the phoenix metro area you can contact 56th fighter wing public affairs at 623-856-6011. it is important to note that once a request is submitted it is open to all units in the local area, so the flyover may not necessarily be out of luke air force base, but the luke air force base team can assist with the paperwork for events in this area.
