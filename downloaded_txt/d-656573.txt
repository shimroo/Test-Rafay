gallery 3.0.9 security releaseposted by dari on july 12, 2013 @ 9:51 am cdt
gallery 3.0.9 is now available!  we are still hard at work on 3.1, but in the meantime a few more minor security issues needed to be resolved.  we've fixed them and recommend that you upgrade to 3.0.9 asap.  thanks to malte batram and dhaval chauhan for their responsible disclosure.  we will be rewarding them cash bounties as part of our security bounty program.

gallery 3.0.6 bug fix release available!posted by dari on march 20, 2013 @ 9:50 am cdt
gallery 3.0.6 is now available!  this is likely to be the last release in the 3.0 branch of gallery - next up we're going to 3.1 and making a lot of big improvements.  but before we do that, we wanted to iron out a few kinks and update a few last libraries before we stop working on the 3.0.x code base.  this upgrade will be fast and painless, go on.. do it!






the future of nukedgalleryposted by dari on march 2, 2013 @ 1:38 pm cst
gallery 3.0.5 was just released, and 3.0.6 looks like it's hot on it's heels...so what's that mean for work here at ng.net?  it means that 3.1 is coming, and with 3.1 comes, hopefully, 3rd party site integration and embedding capabilities.  it's a big effort to make it work, and the gallery team needs to know the user community wants it.  i am not condoning spamming their forums in any way, shape, or form, so please don't. but leave them feedback, whether via the forums, email, etc, asking politely that integration and embedding be included in 3.1.  once that work gets under way, work here can commence on integrating into currently supported cms and forum platforms.





gallery 3.0.5 security release available!posted by dari on february 22, 2013 @ 9:58 am cst
gallery 3.0.5 is now available for download. it contains several security fixes as well as a handful of new features.  the only major security issue involves someone malicious accessing a copy of gallery 3 that is not yet installed, so if you already have gallery 3.0.4 installed and configured there are no known major issues.  however, as always we strongly recommend that you upgrade to the latest code.  go on, do it.  it's fast and painless.
we'd like to thank the following individuals for responsibly reporting these security issues: michael t. boos, amol naik, johannes dahse, sergey markov, james 'albino' kettle, and johannes dahse. for their efforts, they will each be receiving bounties of between $100 and $1000 for their help in making gallery more secure. read our bounties page for details and how to submit any security issues you find.
