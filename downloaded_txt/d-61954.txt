back in 1983 robert palmer, better known to his friends as bob, had a vision. he purchased a rolling parcel of gravelly farmland  on the north fork of long island and cultivated his vineyard. today, owned and operated by the massoud family, palmer vineyards has established itself as one of the most visible and well-reputed long island estate wineries. throughout the years, the vineyard and its wines have received numerous accolades. this praise reflects bob palmer’s pledge of quality and excellence. “i have to set the standards high” said bob, “my name is on every bottle.”
