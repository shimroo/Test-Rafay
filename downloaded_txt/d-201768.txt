favourite quote of the moment:"they don't have long. no one is coming to help them. and you are the one who led them here. strike me down. take the throne. reign over a new empire, and the fleet will be yours. only you have the power to save them. refuse, and your new family dies.": emperor palpatine: star wars, rise of skywalker

        and onto the final episode of skeleton crew, star wars: skeleton crew: season 1: episode 8: the real good guys, and there's a whole load to get through, so today i've added pirate dropship to the star wars d/6 vehicles section, silvos pirate frigate, onyx cinder {armoured}, & onyx cinder {unarmoured} to the star wars d/6 starships section of the site. while i considered putting up one set of stats for the onyx cinder, i thought it's tranformation was so radical that i needed to put up two seperate sets to clearly show what attributes and weapons each form has.

        and we're onto the penultimate episode of skeleton crew, star wars: skeleton crew: season 1: episode 7: we are gonna be in so much trouble, and today i've added blaster musket, & blastech industries e-22 reciprocating double-barreled blaster rifle to the star wars d/6 weapons section, & at attin to the star wars d/6 planets & places section of the site.
        the e-22 is a duplicate of a weapon added back when i was covering solo, and i guess more information has been released since then, so this version is different to the original i did back then.
