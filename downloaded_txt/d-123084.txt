pcotc's training facility is located in white plains, ny—though the club began in port chester, ny in 1940. completely volunteer run, our club aims at encouraging people and dogs to excel in all manner of skills. our family manners training program is designed to produce well-behaved dogs that are welcome in the family and the community. we also train in the competitive dog sports of agility, obedience, rally, and k9 nose work, with some additional specialties such as disc dog, canine musical freestyle and breed handling. over the years, our expertise in developing fantastic family dogs and trial champions has grown along with the variety of activities we offer. pcotc is an akc member club.
