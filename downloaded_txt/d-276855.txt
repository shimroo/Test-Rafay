                           chemistry program. each program is distinct in its core curriculum and requirements

“i was looking for a program that would let me explore different interests in a great
                              academic environment that is also located in a nice location. the ability to explore
                              different departments during the rotations and
having really supportive faculty here is really fantastic and not something i was
                              able to find at other places.
the proximity to hiking/skiing and having a nice city so close by sealed the deal!”
nathan burns, kardon lab


“i chose the u for graduate school because of its focus on you as a person. when i
                              was applying and told various
faculty members about my family, they all supported my decision to pursue further
                              education while being a mom.
in addition, i am constantly impressed by the collaborative nature and caliber of
                              research.
not to mention, the students, staff, and faculty are all top-notch.”
gennie parkman, mcmahon & holmen lab


“the biggest differentiating factor between the u and the other universities i was
                                 considering for my phd studies is 
the strong emphasis utah places on collaboration over competition. the academic environment
                                 here is very 
supportive and collaborative, which was important to me. combine that with the top
                                 tier research studies 
and the incredibly beautiful natural environment and i was sold.”
grace orstad, synder lab


“the bioscience program at the u has a great umbrella program where graduate students
                              have the opportunity to choose from over 180 labs from diverse areas of research.
                              the research labs have a collaborative, supportive and
professional environment. the u also has a diverse international community. with respect
                              to
funding, the university graduate school offers fellowships for international students
                              as well.”
supraja ranganathan, bass lab
