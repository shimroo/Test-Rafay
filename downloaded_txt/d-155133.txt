tri-mer corp. has a unique approach to air pollution control.  because we have numerous different technologies, we take an applications approach to every project, with systems that are optimized for the customerâs application. 
facilities that generate inorganic gases, pm10/2.5, heavy metals, odors and other emissions benefit from tri-merâs applications approach, because it is uniquely â and ideally - suited to their facility, budget, production needs and regulatory environment.
tri-mer air pollution control systems reliably and cost-effectively manage industryâs most problematic air emissions.  our portfolio includes systems designed and built for many of the worldâs preeminent manufacturing and process facilities.  let us share what weâve learned during our 60+ years to solve your air emissions challenges.


every air emission has a tri-mer solution!


tri-mer exhibits odor control, dust collector and scrubber technologies at the nara annual convention in santa barbara, ca. october 22-25


combustible dust: tri-mer dust collectors prevent combustion events; preferred by facility owners, production managers and those responsible for asset protection and liability.



our ultracat ceramic filtration system removes particulate (pm), so2, hcl, mercury and heavy metals at temperatures up to 1650â°f,


 
replacement filters: tri-mer is the exclusive supplier of flkcat ceramic filters in the usa.  as a stocking distributor, replacement ceramic filters are a phone call away.
