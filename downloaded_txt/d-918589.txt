     founded in 1997, bill byrd kia has served the tallahassee, pensacola, and panama city area for nearly 20 years. with us, it's not about selling you the most expensive car to get the best margin. instead, we pride ourselves on customer service and finding the right vehicle to fit your needs. before you go on a wild chase to find the best deal, give us a try. here are a few more reasons why.



the best in customer satisfaction
we never meant to garner extra attention from our dedication to customer service. it's just a part of who we are. once you step on our lot, you will see and feel the difference. our friendly and courteous sales staff, as well as our service professionals, make you feel welcomed, and we use all our free time making sure the buying process is hassle-free.
20-year 200,000 mile warranty
many car companies must honor the warranty offered by the car manufacturer, but few go above and beyond. kia already offers a comprehensive 10-year, 100,000-mile warranty, which covers almost any problems that arise. however, at bill byrd kia, we take this a step further by giving you a 20-year, 200,000-mile warranty at no extra cost. we want you to know that we're so impressed by kia engineering that we're willing to take on the risk rather than you going it alone. few other dealers show that kind of dedication, but we want you to have peace of mind and know you're in good hands.


excellent selection
whether you're looking for a brand new kia, a certified pre-owned kia, or something else, we have you covered. our lot has all the latest kia models, including the top-selling soul and k5. we also have a huge number of used vehicles from top manufacturers, as well as some of the best pre-owned selection of kias in the state. make sure you browse our website, as we offer great deals on used vehicles throughout the year.
great financing options
we're well aware of the stigma that many dealerships have when it comes to in-house financing. however, this isn't the case at bill byrd kia. we have a pre-approval system that lets you know how much you can spend and gives you a basic idea of where your rate and term falls. by doing this, we save you time from shopping around at banks and other lenders. another perk is our fresh start program. this program gives you $1,000 if you aren't approved to help you with the down payment. we don't want to drive our interest rates up to take advantage of you. instead, we want you to improve your credit. that's a promise.
at bill byrd kia, we want you to feel like you're getting the best experience along with some of the best prices in town. you aren't just a customer here; you're a friend and part of the family for life.


    warranties include 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain and 5-year/60,000-mile basic. all warranties and roadside assistance are limited. see retailer for warranty details.             copyright © 2025 by dealeron | sitemap | privacy  | limit the use of my sensitive personal information   | do not sell or share my personal information  | consent preferences | bill byrd kia | 2435 east 15th street, panama city, fl 32405 | sales: 850-740-5399 | www.kia.com
