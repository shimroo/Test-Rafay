🌟 goal achieved!! 🌟

we are excited and appreciative of the support in this year's 24-hour siouxland big give organized by the siouxland community foundation on october 1. we exceeded our goal of raising $3,750 to purchase a new reclining port chair in our infusion treatment area - and it's now here and in use!

about 65-75% of our chemotherapy and infusion patients have ports. a port is placed under the skin, usually on the right side of the chest, and usually means only one stick each visit for labs and treatment. to be maintained properly, ports need to be routinely flushed and checked. the previous port chair had a lot of wear and tear and needed to be replaced.

overall, the siouxland big give raised an incredible $186,253 for 100 non-profit organizations communitywide!

both staff and patients are excited for the new port chair. thank you to all who helped us reach our goal!










we are thankful for the team at sioux valley community credit union who selected june e. nylen cancer center for their casual & pink for a cause donations in october. we appreciate their long-term dedication to our mission of providing hope and healing close to home for siouxland cancer patients.










please join us in thanking jackie and cynthia for all they do for our patients!
