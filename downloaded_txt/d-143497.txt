chalet testimonial
glacier guides three day chalet backpacking trip is about as good as it gets. you get the opportunity to do backcountry hiking led by experienced guides and you can leave the 40 pound backpack home! all food and sleeping quarters are provided at the granite chalet as you day hike through the beauty of glacier national. our group was a fun and interesting bunch from all over the u.s. that loved the outdoors and who were very pleasant companions. a great experience run by a truly professional company.

lodging testimonial
we stayed at this lodge for 2 nights in july 2021. it exceeded my expectations in every way. i was greeted by don by my name when i stepped out of my car. i introduced my husband, from then on whenever don saw us – he knew both of our names and used them! the room is spacious and comfortable. the location is excellent. don was beyond helpful in every way. the breakfast is wonderful and included. it was a variety of things each morning, including huge, homemade muffins. they also have bug spray and suntan lotion for everyone to use. highly recommend this place.
