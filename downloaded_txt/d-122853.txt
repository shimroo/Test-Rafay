quotes from the

            message board:


i am a loyal raider fan and

            the only encouraging words i can offer is that the pressure you apply now and in the future to the ownership does have an effect. after our 4-12 season in 97, the pressure on al davis was so

            enormous that he eventually signed a brilliant young coach and the teams personal savior.

it would have been better to follow the cleveland browns' example...let the jerk move the team, win an expansion franchise, and then build a stadium for the new team.

mike brown, get out of operations, hire somebody who has a least a clue of what they are doing.

mikebrownsucks.com - 
 a great bengals community
by fraidy cat
over the last five years, mikebrownsucks.com
has been a gathering place for frustrated bengals fans from around the world. 
as the bengals have responded to their critics by implementing many changes,
mikebrownsucks.com has also changed from an activist oriented site to a dynamic
and vibrant community of fans.  though there are many sites on the web that
offer better news, fresher content, and flashier graphics, there's no better
site on the web to talk bengals football.   

you won't find heavy handed moderation
here.  you won't find a ton of rules.  what you will find is a group
of people who can dish it out and take it, generally police themselves, and
allow others to express themselves even when no one else agrees.

so with that, welcome to the site.  grab a
cup of coffee, sit down, stay awhile, and be a part of the best group of fans on
the internet.
