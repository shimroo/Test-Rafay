clickable map of native plant nurseries

check out the new clickable map of native plant nurseries in and around maryland at mdflora.org/nurseries.html
we took the list of nurseries selling native plants from the mnps website and created a google map. this new interactive map, with pins on native plant nurseries, allows you to click on a site to get more information including the nursery’s website, contact information, and a short description. we will endeavor to keep the map up to date. however, we advise users to call nurseries in advance when planning a visit.
