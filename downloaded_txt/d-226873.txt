testimonials




““if you’ve never had the chance to see a live carpentry demonstration by fine homebuilding contributing editor, gary m. katz, you’re missing out. katz’s ‘anyone can do this’ attitude draws big crowds at trade shows from coast to coast. katz’s popular demonstration on mastering the miter saw is an appropriate choice for his debut dvd.””

— — brian pontolilo, fine homebuilding




““i attended your seminar in march at the rhode island convention center. during the seminar i thought you had a lot of techniques and procedures that i could use in my business. after having a few months to try them i have to let you know how well they are working for me. your seminar and your passion for finish carpentry are an inspiration to me. i would like to thank you for devoting your time and effort to teaching and let you know how much it is appreciated.””

— — dan stone, hemlock builders
