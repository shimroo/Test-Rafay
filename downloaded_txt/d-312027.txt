inactivity fee: $300: members may pay a $300 inactivity fee in lieu of their annual dues. by paying this fee, all members on the account do not surrender their membership but cannot use any palisades facilities for the current operating year. once the inactivity fee is paid, the member must wait for the next dues season to fully reinstate their membership for the following operating year. beginning in 2024, membership accounts may only be inactive for no more than an aggregate of two seasons during the entirely of their palisades membership tenure. inactive seasons prior to 2024 will not count toward the two aggregate seasons.

unpaid provisional membership accounts will be terminated. terminated members wishing to rejoin palisades must apply for the waitlist.
bonded memberships will be deactivated and cannot be reactivated until the following dues season and all outstanding inactivity fees have been paid.
