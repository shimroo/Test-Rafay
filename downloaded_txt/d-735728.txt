the poly coatings difference



lubricity
the poly-ond process impregnates teflon throughout the entire coating for a lubricious surface that lasts through the life of the part.


durability
electroless nickel is a dense coating of nickel and phosphorus reduced onto the surface for superior corrosion protection and wear.


uniformity
coatings are evenly distributed over the entire surface, including internal and external areas, with thickness ranging from 0.000050 to 0.005 inch.
