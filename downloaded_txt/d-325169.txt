baked and assembled right in our bakery- our gingerbread houses are perfect for family traditions. they come in small (shown here) or large, and can also be ordered pre-decorated. 
 
the sweetest gift one can give! our red velvet cake filled with cream cheese icing.  
 
yummy gingerbread dipped in chocolate and decorated with m&ms.
 
a soft cookie outside and fig filling, an italian christmas classic.
