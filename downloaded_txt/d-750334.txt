featured article

i just got my corvette...
so you just bought your new smallblock c3 corvette and have been less than enthused with the performance of it? well, first thing first, you need to bring it back to baseline specs. your c3 has been sitting around for years, possibly rotting away. start by performing a thorough test of the entire car and make sure everything is up to snuff. if you want a good original driver c3, then go through this list and replace anything that seems worn out, etc, as specified.
now this is all fine and dandy if you want a stock-performing corvette. but you most likely didn't find this page because you wanted a stock corvette.
there are a number of ways to beef up your vette. do you want more power, more handling, more comfort? or all of the above? read on for details on common upgrades performed by c3 vette owners. 

what's new
september 2009: the corvettefaq joins wikia. due to new anti-spam tools, we're now able to openly accept edits again. try out the new editor or see what special pages are available. you can try out new options, or log in and change your preferences.

external links
gallery you can directly upload your own images to share with folks, either there, or here on the wiki.
jim shea's a-car papers and other steering information. its all there just like before.
pookie & tushka - you didn't think i would redesign the site and omit the penguin on the piano, did you?
