the best decision of my life
“i researched many doctors for over a five-year period and decided to go with dr. dibernardo who was rated one of the best plastic surgeons in the country. i got a tummy tuck and breast lift with implants and would love to post my picture. i finally have the body that i dreamed of!”




“beautiful cohesiveness
“my confidence level in them all is 100%.  they presented me with choices just for me even down to my compression garment - it was all for me! i loved my experience, i would definitely recommend dr. dibernardo & his staff!!”




extremely professional and welcoming
“my son needed surgery and from the moment i knew that he needed a plastic surgeon, dr. dibernardo was the only person i would have trusted to perform surgery on my son. thank you!”




perfect surgeon for my breast lift.
“the moment i met dr. debernardo i really really liked him. he was pleasant and informative. i felt like i was in good hands.  he suggested i get a special suture that would enhance the lift and provide better fullness at the top of the breast.”




i could not be happier.
“from the first day, i looked 'down' after my surgery, to this very day, i am confident about myself, and every day i appreciate the results. i was cared for and respected every step of the way. always a professional, beautiful facility, friendly, and willing to work at making my experience as comfortable and convenient as possible.”




njps is absolutely first class
“residing in los angeles, and being a national aesthetic consultant, i know first hand what separates the best from the elites. njps is in a class by itself! 2 thumbs up!!”




dr. dibernardo solved a lifelong skin issue.
“we had been to all the top doctors in nyc and nj with very little success. he took the time to research a plan and execute it based on the best that science could offer. i highly recommend new jersey plastic surgery!”
