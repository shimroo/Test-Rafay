home therapies may offer you more freedom
with the opportunity to dialyze during the day, overnight, or even while traveling, patients may find what was once impossible possible. fresenius medical care home products and therapies can allow patients to take back control of their lives, and by selecting home therapies, patients can experience the associated improvements in overall health and quality of life.














































home dialysis treatment options





















peritoneal dialysis (pd)





there are two types of pd therapy: continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd) and automated peritoneal dialysis (apd). pd uses the peritoneal membrane inside your abdomen as a filter to remove toxins and extra fluid from your blood. typically, pd patients can perform therapy on their own—at home or almost anywhere. pd treatments are done daily, so waste and toxins in your blood don’t have a chance to build up as much between treatments.

home hemodialysis (hhd)





hhd follows the same treatment procedure as in-center hemodialysis but can be accomplished in the comfort of your home. when treating at home, patients are not constrained by the schedule of a dialysis center, and physicians have more flexibility to tailor dialysis prescriptions to patients’ individual clinical and quality of life needs.

solo/independent home hemodialysis





solo/independent home hemodialysis (hhd) is an innovative option made available in 2017, when the nxstage systems became the first and only hemodialysis machines cleared in the us for hhd without a care partner, during waking hours. solo hhd allows for greater control and ownership of care, increased independence with more treatment schedule flexibility, and the feeling of being less reliant on friends and family.

nocturnal home hemodialysis





nocturnal home hemodialysis (hhd) is dialysis therapy that is performed overnight while you and your care partner sleep. similar to daytime hhd but done overnight with longer and slower treatments. nocturnal dialysis more closely resembles natural kidney function since blood is filtered over a longer period of time.

                        traveling with home dialysis systems
traveling is one of the many possibilities you can explore when you use a home therapy for dialysis. with proper planning, you may be able to travel for business or pleasure. all it takes is some extra effort to make sure you can continue dialysis treatment while you’re away.

                        care partner support
home hemodialysis can give patients with chronic kidney disease the opportunity to get back to the things they love. some patients may require a care partner to perform home hemodialysis.

risks and responsibilities
patients should review the following information carefully and discuss it with their doctors to decide whether home hemodialysis with nxstage systems is right for them.

users should weigh the risks and benefits of performing home hemodialysis with nxstage systems.

medical staff will not be present to respond to health emergencies that might happen during home treatments, including, among other things, dizziness, nausea, low blood pressure, and fluid or blood leaks.
users may not experience the reported benefits of home, more frequent, or nocturnal hemodialysis with the nxstage systems.
the nxstage systems require a prescription for use.

 
users will be responsible for all aspects of their hemodialysis treatment from start to finish.

medical staff will not be present to perform home treatments. users will be responsible for, among other things, equipment setup, needle insertions, responding to and resolving system alarms, system tear-down after treatment, monitoring blood pressure, ensuring proper aseptic technique is followed, and following all the training material and instructions that nurses provide.

 
users will need additional resources to perform home hemodialysis.

users will need a trained care partner to be present during your treatment at home (unless their doctor prescribes “solo/independent” home hemodialysis, described below).
users must have a clean and safe environment for their home treatments.
users will need space in their home for boxes of supplies necessary to perform home hemodialysis with nxstage systems.

 
certain forms of home hemodialysis have additional risks.

if a doctor prescribes home hemodialysis more than 3 times a week, vascular access is exposed to more frequent use which may lead to access related complications, including infection of the site. doctors should evaluate the medical necessity of more frequent treatments and discuss the risks and benefits of more frequent therapy with users.
if a doctor prescribes “solo/independent” home hemodialysis without a care partner during waking hours, risks of significant injury or death increase because no one is present to help users respond to health emergencies. if users experience needles coming out, blood loss, or very low blood pressure during solo/independent home hemodialysis, they may lose consciousness or become physically unable to correct the health emergency. users will need additional ancillary devices and training to perform solo/independent home hemodialysis.
if a doctor prescribes “nocturnal” home hemodialysis at night while the user and a care partner are sleeping, risks increase due to the length of treatment time and because therapy is performed while the user and a care partner are sleeping. these risks include, among other things, blood access disconnects and blood loss during sleep, blood clotting due to slower blood flow or increased treatment time or both, and delayed response to alarms when waking from sleep. a doctor may need to adjust users’ medications for nocturnal home hemodialysis, including, among other things, iron, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (esa), insulin/oral hypoglycemics, anticoagulants, and phosphate binders.
