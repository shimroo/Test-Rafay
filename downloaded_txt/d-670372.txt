i am an associate professor of health policy and management at the columbia university mailman school of public health and a faculty research fellow at the national bureau of economic research. i also hold affiliations with the abdul latif jameel poverty action lab (j-pal) and the columbia population research center (cprc). my research has explored three key areas: low-value prescribing, hospital performance and productivity, and health plan takeup. much of this work involves using randomized controlled trials to test interventions in the health care delivery system.
my studies on these themes have appeared in economics journals like the american economic review, the review of economics and statistics, and american economic journal: economic policy as well as health policy and medical journals, including health affairs, jama psychiatry, and jama health forum. my work has been funded by the national institute on aging, the abdul latif jameel poverty action lab, the national institute for health care management, and the laura and john arnold foundation. i received my phd in economics from the massachusetts institute of technology and was previously a robert wood johnson scholar in health policy research at harvard university.
