   what people are sayin'


   
  


“real normal is probably the most incompetent, unreliable, half-assed bunch of hacks you would ever hope to meet.” vincent deverouxproducerlos angeles, ca
 
  


“i've never had a worse experience with any company in my entire life. their total disregard for everything decent and honest cost me my job, my career, and ultimately my wife. actually, now i own a bar in malibu and date 21 year olds, so thanks real normal!” robert stallworthformer ceointercomputech systems
 
  


“they've managed to completely butcher every project i've ever given them, but for some reason i'm compelled to keeping coming back for more.”  madelaine jordanfounderge·sund·heit
 
  


“my attorney has advised me not to comment on the impending litigation until after the trial.” anonymous
