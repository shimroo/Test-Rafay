"we came to see what was available in a king sized bed. gus was the salesman. we did not get a high pressure sales/snow job from him. he was classy, funny, and informed. we bought a mattress and had it delivered yesterday. i would highly recommend shopping at mattress mart. i also like it is a local company instead of a big box conglomerate business."

"guss was an amazing salesperson and treated both my family and myself very well. i arrived 15 minutes before closing and was welcomed by guss and was was immediately advised to "not worry about the time" and stayed extra to get us the mattresses we needed. on top of all that, we bought 2 mattresses but could only take one at a time...guss stayed the extra time to allow us to drop off the 1st mattress and go back for the other one. no doubt we will be going back!"

"my first visit to the drake location, i have shopped mattress mart multiple times through the years. the manager was very helpful, allowed me to try multiple mattresses, helped me define what i really wanted and liked so he could show me similar mattresses for comparison. he honored a yelp coupon i had that he wasn't even aware of, checked the other store for inventory, and assisted me with an early pickup! great experience! i've had a month of great sleep on it now!"
