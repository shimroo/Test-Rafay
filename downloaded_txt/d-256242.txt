as a community, we strive to be:







            christ-centered
          










i am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. (revelation 21:6)christ is at the very center of our parish life. he informs all we think, say, and do. we praise him, serve him, and exist as a community to be in relationship with him.








            committed to excellence
          










the first fruits of your grain, your wine, and your oil, as well as the first shearing of your flock, you shall also give him. (deuteronomy 18:4)we offer our first fruits to god by seeking the highest level of excellence in every aspect of our parish life.








            hospitable
          










do not neglect hospitality, for through it some have unknowingly entertained angels. (hebrews 13:2)we honor each visitor as a special guest and warmly welcome everyone into our community.








            trustworthy
          










let your yes mean yes, and your no mean no. anything more is from the evil one. (matthew 5:37)we live with integrity as a community and maintain transparency with one another.








            merciful
          










you have been told, o mortal, what is good, and what the lord requires of you: only to do justice and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with your god. (micah 6:8)we treat one another with loving kindness and compassion as disciples of jesus christ.








            generous
          










each must do as already determined, without sadness or compulsion, for god loves a cheerful giver. (2 corinthians 9:7)as brothers and sisters in christ, we strive to imitate our heavenly father, who is not outdone in his generosity, by serving the needs of those whom god places in our care.
