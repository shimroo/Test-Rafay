lisa slikerour lady of perpetual help


    "while we cannot measure a person’s heart, we can measure their involvement - how they serve, what they attend, and where they choose to give their money. at the macro level, that data can then be used to measure not only how effective we were in forming missionary disciples, but at the micro level, are we forming hearts for jesus."
    
















rev. david hustst. anthony of padua


    "i’ve been at various parishes where they’ve been building new projects and they haven’t had a tool like pushpay, the digital tools in this time and age are immensely helpful for a church to allow its people to give generously from their hearts."
