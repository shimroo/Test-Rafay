new year’s day 2014 begins with a sense of happiness…





for the first time in several years, a new year's day dawns with an 
overwhelming sense of peace and happiness.  the energy feels good and 
there is a delightful vibe of excitement as though some really good 
things are in store...and i'm grateful for that!

one of the things i did was a google search for my name and this blog came up. i was a bit surprised to realize i'd not updated it in more than four years yet it was still hanging strong on my rankings.  perhaps it's time for some tlc to it! 

the
 year has already begun by me making more use of outlook and the types 
of activities i had jotted down on my planner in the past, are now daily
 objectives so that i am reminded to spend some time on them.  they are 
actually quite simple -- fitness, financial, and writing.  

fitness: 
 before the heat of summer begins, i have a goal weight that i have 
established to aim for.  with a diet of water, juicing, and raw / 
vegetarian, i have faith that i will achieve my goal by my date of 31 
may 2014.

financial:  set 
goals with where i am now and how much to achieve my goal listed.  i am 
focused on achieving these goals by the 31 december 2014.

writing: 
 every single day i will post a minimum of two articles.  i wish to 
heighten my presence again and condition myself.  writing, much like 
physical exercise, must be maintained to keep the skills sharp and 
efficient.  

other 2014 goals include:

launch my embrace life web channel
writing a book
improve my french linguistic skills back to conversational level
spend a week in paris, france 
buy a beautiful, perfectly running mercedes-benz slk

and there they are....so i'm ready to embrace 2014 and have a wonderful year!

perceptionslast night i attended a dallas producers association meeting and it was an interesting study in perceptions.   the theme was "member showcase" and, to me, that signifies that if you are going to show off a sample of your work it should be top-notch stellar as you are trying to impress your peers.one presenter gave everyone a tip on how to bring something into focus when shooting.  oddly though, it was a tip that even a non-shooter like myself already knew.another presenter showed an approximate 4 minute long piece that just went on and on about some sort of new phone technology.  curiously enough, he kept apologizing for the piece.   it made me wonder why someone would show a sample of their work if they were going to continually apologize for it.there was one presenter, who is a dp, that had some really funny clips.  unfortunately, i tried to find my 2 favs from his reel but they aren't on youtube.another presenter showed us a clip that was shot at the lodge.  now let me preface that dallas and honolulu are the two us cities known for having the best strip clubs.  the lodge is at the top of the food chain.  so we were forewarned that the clip would be racy and edgy.  we watched it.  the lights came on.  everyone was wondering what the cautions were about since we see things far more edgier on a basic tuesday night episode of sons of anarchy.  seriously.  a comedian on stage at the lodge peforming before an audience.  everyone is clothed.  nothing racy is being said.   compare that to sons of anarchy where you can see shots of bottomless porn stars sexually riding a biker boy.  granted there aren't any money shots, but it does make wonder about the people and their various perceptions as to what is racy to one person is yawnsville to a group of others.*************************************today is a spectacular day in dallas.  it's in the mid-70's, skies are blue and it makes me reliaze why i like autumn so much better than spring.   spring, as great is it can be, always makes me thing that the heat of summer is just right around the corner.  autumn, however, is like a great big sigh of relief because the heat of summer is over!

 cinnamon and honey honey is the only food on the planet that will not spoil or rot. it will do what some call turning to sugar. in reality honey is always honey. however, when left in a cool dark place for a long time it will do what i rather call "crystallizing".   when this happens i loosen the lid, boil some water, and sit the honey container in the hot water, off the heat and let it liquefy. it is then as good as it ever was. never boil honey or put it in a microwave.  to do so will kill the enzymes in the honey. bet the drug companies won't like this one getting around. facts on honey and cinnamon: it is found that a mixture of honey and cinnamon cures most diseases.honey is produced in most of the countries of the world. scientists of today also accept honey as a 'ram ban' (very effective) medicine for all kinds of diseases. honey can be used without any side effects for any kind of diseases. today's science says that even though honey is sweet, if taken in the right dosage as a medicine, it does not harm diabetic patients. weekly world news, a magazine in canada , in its issue dated 17 january,1995 has given the following list of diseases that can be cured by honey and cinnamon as researched by western scientists: heart diseases:make a paste of honey and cinnamon powder, apply on bread, instead ofjelly and jam, and e at it regularly for breakfast. it reduces the cholesterol in the arteries and saves the patient from heart attack. also, those who have already had an attack, if they do this process daily, they are kept miles away from the next attack. regular use of the above process relieves loss of breath and strengthens the heart beat. in america and canada , various nursing homes have treated patients successfully and have found that as you age, the arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged; honey and cinnamon revitalize the arteries and veins.. arthritis:  arthritis patients may take daily, morning and night, one cup of hot water with two spoons of honey and one small teaspoon of cinnamon powder. if taken regularly even chronic arthritis can be cured. in a recent research conducted at the copenhagen university , it was found that when the doctors treated their patients with a mixture of one tablespoon honey and half teaspoon cinnamon powder before breakfast, they found that within a week, out of the 200 people so treated, practically 73 patients were totally relieved of pain, and within a month, mostly all the patients who could not walk or move around because of arthritis started walking without pain. bladder infections:take two tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. it destroys the germs in the bladder. cholesterol:two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of cinnamon powder mixed in 16 ounces of tea water, given to a cholesterol patient, was found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10 percent within two hours. as mentioned for arthritic patients, if taken three times a day, any chronic cholesterol is cured. according to information received in the said journal, pure honey taken with food daily relieves complaints of cholesterol.   colds:those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon lukewarm honey with 1/4 spoon20cinnamon powder daily for three days. this process will cure most chronic cough, cold, and clear the sinuses. upset stomach:honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache and also clears stomach ulcers from the root. gas:according to the studies done in india and japan , it is revealed that if honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas. immune system:daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacteria and viral attacks. scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in large amounts. constant use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles to fight bacterial and viral diseases. indigestion:cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food relieves acidity and digests the heaviest of meals. influenza:a scientist in spain has proved that honey contains a natural ' ingredient'  which kills the influenza germs and saves the patient from the flu. longevity:tea made with honey and cinnamon powder, when taken regularly, arrests the ravages of old age. take four spoons of honey, one spoon of cinnamon powder, and three cups of boiling water to make a tea. drink 1/4 cup, three to four times a day. it keeps the skin fresh and soft and arrests old age. life spans also increase and even a 100 year old, starts performing the chores of a 20-year-old. pimples:three tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder paste.apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it next morningwith warm water. if done daily for two weeks, it removes pimples from the root. skin infections:applying honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts on the affected parts cures eczema, ringworm and all types of skin infections. weight loss:daily in the morning one half hour before breakfast on an empty stomach, and at night before sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder in one cup of boiled water. if taken regularly, it reduces the weight of even the most obese person. also,drinking this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie diet. cancer:recent research in japan and australia has revealed that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully.. patients suffering from these kinds of cancer should daily take one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon powder for one month three times a day. fatigue:recent studies have shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather than being detrimental to the strength of the body. senior citizens, who take honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts, are more alert and flexible. dr. milton, who has done research, says that a half tablespoon of honey taken in a glass of water and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, taken daily after brushing teeth and in the afternoon at about 3:00 p.m. when the vitality of the body starts to decrease, increases the vitality of the body within a week. bad breath:people of south america , first thing in the morning, gargle with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water, so their breath stays fresh throughout the day. hearing loss:daily morning and night honey and cinnamon powder, taken in equal parts restores hearing. remember when we were kids? we had toast with real butter and cinnamon sprinkled on it!

fashion police & fried foods...ahhh dallas.  the buildings are covered in mirrored glass so we can gaze in wide wonder at our own beauty.  we pay homage to the temple that is neiman-marcus.  we always dress properly even if we are dashing down to the 7-11.at this time of the year, we start to get a mischievous glint in our eyes as we think about the people watching that will begin in 21 days at the great state fair of texas.  the fair is sublime for people watching because we see souls that we never see at any other time of the year.  we wonder where they stay hidden the rest of the year.    it's the type of forum in which the saying, "spandex is a privilege, not a right," really comes into play.so it was with much disdain that i read the list of foods up for consideration as this year's best "fried food" at the fair.   as i read the first item on the list, i honestly felt queasy:• deep fried butter could push the grease-o-meter to a new high. “100 percent pure butter is whipped ’til light and fluffy, then specially sweetened with a choice of several flavors.” it is then surrounded by a “special dough” and quick-fried.i know thousands of people attend the fair for the sole reason of indulging in bad food.  my one indulgence was a fletcher's corny dog.  last year, after being on a kick of eating healthy, the illustrious one and i looked on in glee as we got our obligatory corny dog.  (we like to attend on the first day because it's not terribly crowded, the park is clean, and the grease if fresh.)   we both bit into our respective wienies but there was no wide eyed "mmmmm" this year.  we mirrored one another's face with a look of, "this isn't so good."   if i recall correctly, neither one of us finished our single corny dog.  it was rather sad as we stood there in big tex's shadow and watched people younger than us, that visually appeared healthy and could use a good walk, dash about on rascals.of course this now leads us into our final rant which is on fashion.  tonite, i am scheduled to go to an advanced screening of the september issue.  i felt it was only appropos to whet my visual appetite by reviewing the site people of walmart.   this site has provided me with fresh reasons for my boycott walmart list!

today has been lively.  i've been working on 48 hour film project details and trying to figure out a well rounded group of judges.  i believe that both of the judges i contacted today will confirm.  i'm toying between 2 possibilities for the 3rd slot and will probably make that decision tomorrow.  upon approval by the powers that be at 48hfp, i will then be able to issue a press release announcing their names.  i'm very grateful to so many for helping me to promote and distribute info about the dallas edition of 48hfp.   this city had 22 teams the past couple years but when you learn that cities like des moines are pulling in 45, it just really lights a fire under you to get the dallas numbers up this year.   boston had 90 teams; washington dc had 110 so we have some serious ground to make up.tonite was the monthly mixer for the dallas group of internations.org.  we held it at bengal coast and everyone had a fantastic time.  bc has a fantastic cocktail, lychee basil mojito and it was wildly popular with all who had it.   about half the group stayed for the prix fixe chef's tasting but unfortunately i had another commitment at 9p so i couldn't stay.a handful of people i know from the "gayborhood" and the film community showed up and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves.then it was off to a deep meeting at chi.  much discussion with the police as it was the crime watch meeting - the dallas police department are really fantastic to us in deep ellum.

it's been a while since i posted on this blog.  i handle the dallas reviews for www.wcities.com and i am also the dallas editor for www.ismyhome.com.  i also contribute to luxury and travel blogs -- yes, i actually get paid to do this.  it doesn't cover my living expenses but it does cover some basics like the motorcycle insurance, cell phone, etc.however, with those blogs i do censor myself and keep things light and fluffy.  this blog however, is where i can come to tell you what i really think.  so, without further ado, here goes:what the everlasting f*** is the u.s. government thinking?  we are spending $2.6 million to study why chinese whores drink while working?  the study is referring to the whores as fsw which stands for "female sex workers".  also, the polite term of "gatekeeper" is being used in the study instead of pimp or madame. when we've got people in southern mississippi still living in tents due to katrina and hearing that medicare is running out of money, what is that liberal congealed mess in congress thinking?!further, who are the esteemed "scientitsts" that are going to be hanging out in these whorehouses "observing" why prostititues engage in "dangerous sex" when they are drunk?************************my other vent is networking events.when a person is organizing a networking event, they are dashing about making sure the handouts are ready to go, the beverages have had ample time to start icing down, the food is set up, the laptop & big screen monitor are set up, the furniture arranged, etc.  and then, if the gods are smiling, the organizer will have everything ready to go 60 minutes out but no later than 45 minutes out.so yesterday, i was hosting an event and 45 minutes out everything was finalized and ready to go.  it was my chance to spend a few blissful minutes to just chill as the illustrious one took a power nap on the other end of the sofa.    5 minutes later, the door opens to the sounds of "is this the place for....."   yes, 40 minutes early the first person arrived.   no one else arrived for another 30 minutes.another quandary is when people arrive at 8:25p for an event that's ending at 8:30 and ask, "are we late?"   seriously?  you're seriously asking that?then, as we approach the 9p hour and people are still raiding the cookie tray and chit chatting, some of us are kind of hoping you all might be courteous enough to take your conversations over to one of the deep ellum restaurants or clubs.  you see, we, the organizer(s), have been going non-stop for about 14 hours at this point and still have another 45-60 minutes to put the furniture back, find where all the used cups, napkins, and plates might have been stashed so they can be thrown away, clean up the area where the food & drinks were, get everything sealed up and in the fridge, run the dust mop over the floor and then around 10p, we are finally getting a chance to go home to just relax.*******************and so that the world knows i am not all doom & gloom, today i received a really fantastic gift!  my mom is amazingly creative and she has segued off ceramics and is into scrapbooking.   this morning fedex delivered a scrapbook for harley amadeus von doberman and it is just over the top cool -- everyone that has seen it just loves it and says my mother ought to do this for $$.  the illustrious one and i will be pulling together photos for it and i'll post shots of the completed book.

there's a site that i've become rather fond of -- www.hulu.com.i was first turned on to hulu when i found out that sons of anarchy was being shown there.  the biggest perk for me is the films section because they have things like old black and white classics to relatively modern-day releases.yes, there are a handful of commercials but each film only has about 5 commercial breaks and each break only has 1 commercial for 15-30 seconds.   you can't get that on tv and it's cheaper than going to the video store so a win-win situation as far as i'm concerned.   it's also nice because you browse through the 10 pages listing the current films and check off those to add to your viewing queue.  some films have expiration dates of a few weeks or a few months and others have no expiration date.typically, i like to watch one film per night on the nights i'm not doing something and some of the films i've watched recently are:the night of the hunterwaking ned devine (great!)in the name of the fatherswimming poolthe professionalrequiem for a dreamwimbeldonlock, stock & two smoking barrelsthe fabulous baker boyssomewhere in timekilling zoenobody's fool (great!)...anyway, you get the idea.   definitely check out www.hulu.com.
