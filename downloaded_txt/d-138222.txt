your ultimate guide to internet freelancing
when you google “how to make money online”, you’ll come back with plenty of topics about internet freelancing.
internet freelancing is one of the few legitimate ways for an average person like you or me to make money online.
the job combines the freedom of being self-employed with the freedom to do your job from anywhere with an internet connection. for many people, it’s a dream come true.
of course, starting an internet freelancing business isn’t as easy as setting up a paypal account and watching money roll in.
so what’s the real secret behind internet freelancing? how do you setup contracted work over the internet? today, i’m going to answer those questions in our ultimate guide to internet freelancing.
identify which skill you can market to potential clients
so you want to be an internet freelancer?
on the internet, you’re competing with millions of other service providers. if you think of a service – like writing or graphic design – you have to understand there are literally millions of other people marketing that service online.
you have to compete with these people by:
-offering a better quality service
-offering a cheaper or better value service
when you’re up against millions of people, this can be a difficult task.
start by identifying your skills.
what’s something you’re good at that not everybody else can do?
what has someone paid you for in the past?
what kind of value can you add to a company?
ultimately, your goal is to choose a niche that is under-served by the marketplace. if you can identify this niche and exploit it to its full potential, then you can launch a successful freelancing business.
maybe your niche is being able to create lots of average-quality business logos and graphics in a very short period of time, for example, and sell them at a significantly cheaper rate than your competitors.
or maybe your niche is at the other extreme – high-end graphic design for multimillion dollar clients.
how to market your skills to potential clients
once you’ve identified your unique skill or value-adding service, it’s time to learn how to market that skill to potential clients.
there are a few ways to do this on the internet. the best way to get your name and service in front of clients is to:
-visit forums or groups where these individuals interact and advertise your services
-pay for advertising space through ppc or other methods
-launch your own website and promote it through a variety of means (ads, social media, friends and family, business cards, etc.)
-hand out business cards at industry events
-create a profile on websites like fiverr, odesk, or elance
the same business foundations apply to your internet freelancing gig
one of the most important things to remember with freelancing is that you’re still running a business. sure, you might show up to work in a housecoat and have your dog as a coworker every day – but the same rules of running a business still apply.
some of the fundamentals of launching a business include:
-evaluating your strengths and weaknesses
-determining your target market
-calculating startup costs
-identifying the niche that will be filled by your products and services
-creating goals, milestones, and other important aspects of a business plan
-developing a marketing plan
of course, not all freelancers do all of these steps. some people just fly “by the seat of their pants”, so to speak. freelancing often requires minimal financial investment – so having a concrete, laid-out business plan isn’t always required.
developing your brand
every business has a brand. in freelancing, developing your brand is a way to distinguish yourself from the competition (and as mentioned above, you have a lot of competition).
you can read entire books about branding a business. i won’t go into that level of detail here. but essentially, your goal is to align your messaging and how you deliver it with what your customers need to hear to make the best, most informed decision.
at the same time, that brand should effectively communicate your skills, attitude, and specialization.
if you can create a brand that meets the above requirements in an in-demand niche, then you’ll have more clients than you can handle.
