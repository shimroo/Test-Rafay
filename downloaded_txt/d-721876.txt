_thought 
        you would like to see my card design.  i use openoffice.org writer.  
        i've got 2 card designs - this one and one with boxes that can be hand 
        filled in.  for this card i have a "label" set up in dx4win that 
        prints the qso area in the empty area in the center of the card.
running low on card stock so time for this order!
wray, ab4sf
 
greetings 
        ron, 

nice job on the ares badge that deep blue that you 
          recommended really jumps out. and the material that you use for the 
          badge is durable to any weather condition that i always encounter. 
          "i'm proud to wear that badge ron"

god bless,

hi ron:


                     
                  

just wanted to take a
                    moment to thank you for your attentiveness to my order. 
                    a lot of small and large businesses could learn a lot from
                    the way you handle yourself.  prompt responses, order
                    status updates (via the usps), etc...    all
                    a touch of class and very much appreciated.

ron,

        attached is a jpeg of my qsl card. feel free to use it on your
        page.

          73's and thanks for a quality product...
             -- mike wb8erj




thanks for fast delivery
          of the qsl kit. here is my finished card in jpeg ( which doesn't
          really do the finished card justice), and also the ms publisher 97
          file for it if you want to use it. i would like to find a better arrl
          logo either one with silver in it instead of gold or a red one like on
          the qst cover. a qcwa logo is easy to get from their website but took
          up too much lateral space so i left it out. the card stock is very
          nice. i suspect many would rather print their own qsl's since it is
          totally custom and you can change them at will when necessary. i
          couldn't find any card stock the right size, as yours is, from local
          vendors. yours was a better price than what i
          found the larger postcard size card stock price to be locally. thanks
          again for a quality product and all your support for our ham
          community!

          hi ron,

          rtty
          oceania soabhp. thank you for donating this plaque. from the south
          pacific
          it is hard to make a good score. but last year i managed to break the
          grip
          of our friends up in kh6. i am pleased and will will diplay the
          plaque.
          thanks for thinking of the oceania hams.

          the license plate frames came today and look terrific!  my second
          car came
          from my dad's estate and when i had to remove his ham plates and
          replace
          them with nebraska' alphanumeric plates i was convinced the car was
          the
          ugliest possible.  the frames make them look so much better !!!

          thanks again for the product and great service!

          73,

	      hi ron:
	      
	      enclosed you'll find the final draft of my qsl card i created using your
	      stock paper.  i used the templates to create it and the results were
	      better than i hoped. again, thanks for the fine products you sell and for
	      the service you provide.

	      ron,
	      
	      my qsl kit took only two days to arrive here in ct. thanks. the kit worked
	      great.
	      
	      i just faxed another order to you, this time for a white qsl kit.

	      ron,
	      
	      thanks for quick service. exactly what i was looking for. i ran a special
	      event station and have about 370 qsls to prepare. custom qsls without the
	      custom price! see attached file.
	      
	      thanks & 73,

	      ron,
	      
	      the order arrived in great shape yesterday... monday 2/7/00. the "speed limit
	      20 wpm" sign is hung... the map centered on rochester, minnesota is at hand...
	      and i'm learning to use the dx edge. i love the "speed limit 20 wpm" sign.

	      ron,
	      
	      after using an overlay for ct for some time, i ordered your overlay for rtty.
	       unfortunately, i did not order it in time for arrl rtty roundup but
	      when i received it i was impressed with it's quality.  can't wait for
	      the next rtty test to use it.  just wanted to thanks for a quality product
	      at a fair price.
	      
	      i was so impressed with the overlay, am ordering the qsl kit from you. should
	      be receiving the order in the next few days.  i look forward to using
	      the software to finally create the cards like i want them rather
	      than having to settle for someone else's designs.

	      hi ron,
	      
	      rec. the order today. many thanks for the quick service.  i think this
	      is just what i need to re-organize my 40 year qsl card collection.
	      
	      thanks again and 73 de bill, k4jys
	      








	ron,
	

	you are two for two now. after purchasing the rtty overlay i was so impressed
	with it that i also ordered your qslkit. as a computer user both in my business
	and in ham radio, i was impressed with the ease i could manipulate the formats
	to create my own qsl cards. the quality of the cards when printed were also
	impressive. another fine product that also has great support backing it when
	i had a problem. if only the car companies supported their products like
	you support yours. am making some minor changes to the original format that
	i chose and when totally completed, will forward one for use to use as an
	example.
	

	dave

	ps if we ever have a qso on the air, want to bet what type of card you will
	get for confirmation?
