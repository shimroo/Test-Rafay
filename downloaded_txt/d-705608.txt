 1 "prime rank" is where the leading edge candidate, if prime, would appear in the top 5000 primes list. "5k+" means the primes are too small to make the list.
 2 first "available tasks" number (a) is the number of tasks immediately available to send.
 3 second "available tasks" number (b) is additional candidates that have not yet been turned into workunits.          if the first number (a) is 0, something is broken.  if both numbers are 0, we've run out of work.
 4 underlined work is loaded manually.          if the b number is not underlined, new candidates (b) are also automatically created from sieve files, which typically contain millions of candidates.          if b is infinite (∞), there's essentially an unlimited amount of work available.
 5 one or two tasks (a) are generated automatically from each candidate (b) when needed, so the total number of tasks available without manual intervention is either a+b or a+2*b.          normally two tasks are created for each candidate, however only 1 task is created if fast proof tasks are used, as designated by an "f" next to "cpu" or "gpu".
 6 includes all primes ever reported by primegrid to top 5000 primes list.  many of these are no longer in the top 5000.
 f uses fast proof tasks so no double check is necessary.  everyone is "first". mt multithreading via web-based preferences is available. mt4+ multithreading via web-based preferences is mandatory, requiring a minimum of 4 threads.         





about

primegrid's primary goal is to advance mathematics by enabling everyday computer users to contribute their system's processing power towards prime finding. by simply
	downloading and installing boinc and attaching to the primegrid project,
	participants can choose from a variety of prime forms to search. with a little patience, you may find a large or even record
	breaking prime and enter into chris caldwell's the largest known primes database with a multi-million digit prime!
primegrid's secondary goal is to provide relevant educational materials about primes. additionally, we wish to contribute to the
	field of mathematics.
lastly, primes play a central role in the cryptographic systems which are used for computer security. through the study of prime
	numbers it can be shown how much processing is required to crack an encryption code and thus to determine whether current
	security schemes are sufficiently secure. primegrid is currently running several sub-projects:

321 prime search: searching for
        mega primes of the form 3·2n±1.
cullen-woodall search: searching for
        mega primes of forms n·2n+1 and
	n·2n−1.
generalized cullen-woodall search: searching for mega primes of forms n·bn+1 and
		n·bn−1 where n + 2 > b.
extended sierpinski problem: helping solve the extended sierpinski problem.
generalized fermat prime search: searching for
        megaprimes of the form b2n+1.
prime sierpinski project: helping the prime sierpinski project solve the prime sierpinski problem.
proth prime search: searching for primes of the form k·2n+1.
seventeen or bust: helping to solve the sierpinski problem.
sierpinski/riesel base 5: helping to solve the sierpinski/riesel base 5 problem.
the riesel problem: helping to solve the riesel problem.
ap27 search: searching for record length arithmetic progressions of primes.

   you can choose the projects you would like to run by going to the
            project preferences page.

news 

about ppse and tdp
what you all collectively do during the next 35 days will determine whether ppse is included in the 2025 edition of tour de primes.

if you want to help ppse to be included in this year's tour de primes (tdp), please run ppse and do not run gfn-17.  ppse is about 10 thousand digits below what is necessary to currently be eligible for t5k, and thus for tdp.  it's possible to make up the difference in the time remaining before tdp starts (february 1st), but there are currently too may new primes being added to t5k, and each new prime raises the threshold.  primarily, these primes are gfn-17.  your choice is simple:  run ppse and you're more likely to have an easy project with which to earn a tdp badge in february.  run gfn-17, and you'll probably need to find a megaprime to earn a tdp badge.

everyone is, of course, free to run whatever projects they want to run.  it helps, however, to have the information necessary to make an informed decision.

we did it!

ppse is now officially in t5k.

in order to give the server a little bit of rest, please stop running ppse until tdp starts.
