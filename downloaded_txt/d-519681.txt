pretty certain cfr rule changes





as some of you probably know, i've been tinkering and testing some changes for the next edition of championship formula racing.i'm pretty sure this is where it will land.  specifically, i'm pretty sure about the forced passing bits.  i'm 100% certain about the other bits.so here they are.testsin an effort to simplify down to two basic tables, start speed now has the same odds as testing any other attribute.  a start speed failure results in a mis-shift and the loss of one wear.  start speed is never damaged.  i like removing the stall possibility.  losing your turn on the start when you were trying to go 120 is bad and i think the loss of a wear and a mis-shift is penalizing enough.i also added a mis-shift to the failure result for top speed and acceleration.  i found it confusing that you would test top speed, fail and end up going faster this turn than your new, damaged top speed.  i think having a mis-shift when you fail an acceleration or top speed is more logically consistent.  i think it also makes the rolls more impactful, especially at the end of the race.  it is no longer a no-brainer to test your engine as you cross the finish line.no change to testing deceleration.  i just included the table here for completeness.forced passingthis process underwent the most change.  i wanted to end up with a single table for forced passing. i wanted to make it a little easier for the attacker, but not too easy.  i wanted to change the interaction between the attacker and the defender.the first change was to how "blocking" works.  instead of the defender just declaring that they are blocking to add 2 to the attacker's die-roll, the defender now has an opportunity to spend their own skill to add to the attacker's die-roll.  spun defenders may not.  the attacker will still have an opportunity to add their own skill after learning what the defender is doing.the odds obviously changed as well.  on the one-hand success now occurs on any result 9 or less.  but, a success of 7 - 9 also includes a wear damage to the attacker and the attacker must now roll on the avoid damage table.  this could result in another wear lost and possibly a wear lost for the defender.  the attacker may apply skill to this roll as well.  the defender may not.  if the defender is called on to lose wear, it does not matter if the defender used skill to hamper the attacker ("block") or not.in the end, forced passing is easier to accomplish but will likely be more costly.  avoid damagethis table replaces the old avoid crash table but is now used both to avoid a crash as well as to avoid additional damage after a successful forced pass with contact.  on a 10-12, the result differs based on those two situations.  if this roll resulted from avoiding a crash, the driver loses 2 wear.  if this roll came after a forced pass then the attacker loses a second wear (since the attacker lost 1 on the forced passing table) and the defender loses a wear as well.slips at endthere is a game that can happen in the current rules -- if two cars are lined up with the finish line in sight and both cars can go 180.  it's a dumb game.  so, if you will finish the race this turn you may not take more than 1 slip.zero-base car buildsthis isn't a rule change, but i am going to rejigger the car set-up table so that there are no longer any -1 values.  all of the math will remain the same, but all of the number will be positive.

2024 organized play crowns another back-to-back champ





 congrats to jason schultz.  he was in the driver's seat with only the wbc really in play and he took care of business.  winning wbc took jason from probably the champ to running away with it.jason is now the 3rd consecutive, back-to-back champion in organized play.  fellow, back-to-backers don tatum and stephen  peeples finished 2nd and 3rd this year.  and fellow champ michael polcen finished 4th.jason and don were the only drivers to win multiple tournaments this season.  the big difference in their scores is that jason won two of the biggest events while one of don's wins was a smaller event.thanks to all who raced this year in a op event (111 of you) and i hope to see you all for the 2025 season -- which is already underway.

2024 organized play update





 i've finally done some data entry for this season of organized play... here are the top 10 with ~2 events to go.  (full list here.)the top 3 is a murders row of the winners of the past 5 op titles.  don leads currently but he should not feel very comfortable with that lead.the two remaining events to score are my pbem serieses and the wbc tournament.  both are worth big points and jason has a commanding lead in the top tier of the pbem.  if he does win that series it will be worth nearly 57 points and would give him just over 91 on the season.  if we assume jason wins p1, there will probably still be an opportunity for the top 7 drivers on this list to make up enough points at wbc to end up at the top of the heap.  assuming a similar turn-out at wbc to last year, the top spot will be worth almost 60 points.  of course, wbc will be over before my pbem so there is also the potential for someone to win wbc and do just enough in their pbem race to pip jason (or don).  keep an eye on people who could get second in the p1 pbem series (jeff harrington, gianluca lari, maybe tim mossman, theoretically a couple others) and people who could win or place 2nd in the divoll and reilly tier... (robert rund, michael polcen, palmiro matteini, brent fitz, and others).  if they win wbc they might have a shot at the title too.

final 2023 organized play ranking





 the 7th cfr organized play season is over and despite a new ranking system i think the champion is pretty obvious.  jason schultz was the only driver to win more than one event this year.  jason actually won 3 of the 4 events entered.jason's big win was the ikea cup event -- a large table top simulator tournament.  but four other drivers won comparable events.  the kicker was winning divoll -- a tier 2 event in my pbem series.  this was by far the best 2nd event result by any driver.full rankingsrookie of the yearc moratto gets the nod here after placing 4th in redscape c4 in his first ever organized play outing.most improvedwill mcconchie made a big jump in his 2nd season in organized play.  capping it off by winning the tier-4 clark series.  this pushed his ranking to 27th, up 87 spots from last year.honorable mention to tim baker who jumped 42 spots up to 3rd in the rankings.  the biggest increase among drivers who finished in the top 20 this season.steward of the yearsince i'm only really paying attention to events now, i'm going to hand this to mr. polcen.  michael officially is in charge of two different series of events... the 4-race redscape ladder plus the table top simulator hosted ikea cup event.  and i know michael would acknowledge that he is mostly a proxy for the wonderful stewards that run various races in those series.  thanks to all stewards.

new op ranking method





some of you may know that i've been struggling this season to get caught up with cfr organized play rankings.  the two culprits i have identified is that i have been busy and past me constructed a pretty elaborate system for calculating op rankings.so i'm simplifying.  a lot.i used to track every result from every race and calculate a whole series of things to try to judge relative competition.  now i'm just going to track the results of events and i'm going to use a simpler method to judge competition levels between different events -- more or less just counting the number of participants.  more here.this makes my work much more manageable.  and so an in-progress 2023 season rankings is here.

wbc 2023 tracks





 i expect someone to get angry here in the finals.wbc steward chris long has picked some tracks for this year's wbc event.a nice mix of tracks below.  the first group are some real classics -- three of the most raced tracks in f1 history.  group 2 is a collection of fan favorite modern era tracks.  then the last grouping includes 2 tracks never used in wbc qualifying before -- kent which is a new design and indy which made it's wbc debut as last year's finals track.  this year's finals is another brand new to wbc track -- midrand, also known as kyalami.  good luck all.q1 redmonza nurburg spa 2007 layout q2 purplemexico citybakusepang 1999 layoutq3 greenkentindianapolisabu dhabifinalsmidrand

cfr 2022 organized play concludes (finally)





 in the end, only 4 points separated the top two drivers this season.  with last year's champion stephen peeples just edging out former two-time champ don tatum.the rest of the top 10 was a mix of regulars and break-throughs.  michael polcen runs his streak of top 10 finishes to 5 seasons (1 short of don's 6 seasons).  chris long and tim mossman have had multiple top 10 seasons before but tim was 40th last year and chris hasn't been top 10 since he finished 3rd in 2018.  james benham made his first top 10 last year.jason schultz ended the season 20 points behind our champion but in only his second season of organized play.  will kennington, justin swaine,  and brent fitz also made their first appearances in the top 10 this year.complete 2022 rankingsbut lets dig into how stephen beat out don this year.  below is a break-out of how each of them got points this year -- their top 5 race results and their top 2 tournament results.  and some general data as well.that general data tells an interesting story.  stephen beat don despite don winning more races (and even a higher percentage of races) and more tournaments.  but you can also see the first clue here of how stephen overcame that -- tougher competition.  by design a field rating of 1 should be average (the median race field rating was 0.97 this year).  so we can see that stephen's average race was considered above average in difficulty of competition while don's was -- on average -- considered below average.this doesn't mean that don was racing against shlubs.  what it really means is that most of don's wins came against smaller groups of opponents and/or not the very best of competition  below are the top 11 races, ranked by field rating this year.  as you can see, stephen won 4 of those races.  don won 2.  stephen also had a second place in one of these races.  in fact, those are the five results that add into stephen's score for the year.  because the points you get for results in a race are multiplied by the field rating of that race, you can see how stephen ended up with more points than don.to find don's other wins, we scroll down that list a little.don's 3rd best win was against decent competition but not the very best.  a bit further down the table, don's 4th and 5th (... and 6th) wins were against smaller fields.  anything less than 8 people is considered a smaller field and will tend to have smaller field ratings.that last bit is based on my most recent adjustment to the scoring (see this post for some detail on that change).  and yes, this change was made mid-season as i saw more than the usual number of smaller fields seem to really skew results.  i acknowledge that this might be controversial.  but i will have more to say about that in a future post.for now, lets congratulate stephen on his #1 ranking and don for another outstanding season.the regularsdon tatum participated in what i am going to assume is a record 35 races this season (and season high 6 different tournaments).  that comes out to 40% of the number of races don could possibly have participated in (and almost 40% of the tournaments).  will kennard participated in 28 races and kevin keller in 25.rookie of the yearrookies did not show prominently in the rankings this season.  but chris manning gets the nod by ranking 68th in his first season, powered by a 2nd place finish in one of the the two races he participated in.  andrew koerber was  close runner up at 70th.most improveddoug galullo had a down year in 2021.  having been ranked as high as 2nd in 2018, he fell to 97th last year.  but bounced back this year to 17th.  much more his usual territory.  honorable mention to jason schultz who won 6 races this year and jumped from 73rd ranked last season to 3rd this season.steward of the yearthis is probably my favorite award.  stewards make cfr happen.  especially organized play.  i try to find new people to highlight every year but in a first... (i think) a repeat for brian dewitt.  brian not only has people nominate him every year... he ran a very impressive 12 races this year.  often as double-headers.other numbersthis season saw a record number of races in organized play at 87 -- 4 more than 2020.  and a larger increase in the number of racing opportunities at 53 -- up from 45 in 2019.  many tournaments are set up such that you can't race in every race because there are effectively or literally multiple races going on at the same time, the number of racing opportunities is always a bit lower than the total number of races.  the total number of drivers participating in organized play was up from last year to 122 from 104.  but 122 is still down from the 219 high of 151.  field size shrunk this year from 9.4 to 8.3.  field size has generally been shrinking over the last 10 years or so.  although it had held pretty stead around 9.5 drivers per race from 2017 through last year.
