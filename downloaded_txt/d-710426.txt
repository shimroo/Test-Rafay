mission possible--quick trip to aruba reveals decline



bob, a member of boycott aruba since it's inception recently took a cruise to see the panama canal.  unfortunately, one of the ports was in aruba.  bob turned unfortunate circumstances into fortunate and interesting discoveries about aruba today.  not four years ago.  october, 2009.here's the "aruba list"...thanks for all you do, bob!aruba is almost dead as vacation resort.the people i talked to on the cruise ship about natalee refused to go ashore because of what aruba did or did not do. at most ports of call there where at least 50 to 60 excursion buses; in aruba maybe 8 to 10.hardly any taxis came up to the ship and those that did complained if the ride was short and did not cost a lot. there have been 1000 workers laid off at the valero refinery and production is down. however and this is a first for you and it is no where on the internet. aruba has installed 9 or 10 wind generators near arikok national park. the last set of props was being installed when we were there. i was right under them as close as they would let me.half of who i talked to were split between she was murdered and dumped in the sea to she was sold as a sex slave.when aruba says look how crowded our beaches are; there is a reason. if two ships like ours is in port they usually allow liberty for about 300 crew members. where do they go; but to the beaches. so for six hours their beaches are crowded with about 600 non paying cruise ship crew members.i asked a few arubans about natalee; the one’s i asked did not recognize the case or know her name.there are no street signs outside of orangestad so it is difficult to maneuver unless you know the area.the pond that dave went to in march 2009 was dry. (monserat pond) i was there and it is full of broken bottles and glass."bob" even had a chance to peep on over to check out the van der sloot residence:photos private property of bob, aruban boycott's anonymous sourceeven the fence looks like a blue web of deceit!

aruba's baby smuggling operation busted



sounds like this woman is trying to pull a "casey anthony" by claiming her child was kidnapped.  at least this baby was saved, unlike caylee anthony.if you are going to be a liar, then you better make sure you're a damn good one...what pieces of human garbage.three arubans involved in selling of baby19 okt, 2009, 08:20 (gmt -04:00)oranjestad/maracaibo —  three arubans have been arrested by local authorities in venezuela for their involvement with the abduction and selling of a baby. venezuelan media announced that the corps of criminal investigation (cicpc) had rescued a barely two-month old baby.supposedly, eight persons had been apprehended amongst which were arubans. one of the suspects, the baby’s aunt, had claimed that the baby had been kidnapped last friday. at least, that is what she had told her sister, who was the baby’s mother. however, it was she who had sold the baby. it was reported that 18,000 bolivar (8,373 dollars) had been paid in four installments for the child.the baby’s aunt had sold the child to an international gang involved in human smuggling. the police had rescued the baby on saturday evening before the suspects had boarded the airplane.during the police interrogation, h. admitted that her husband melesio riera and her daughter manifer johaina barrios (23) had assisted with this case as well. she also admitted that the baby had been stolen with the help of the aruban georgina currie also names gina. currie had supposedly already been pretending for a while on aruba that she was expecting. currie had only worn wide clothing lately to make her family and friends believe that she was pregnant. she had been in venezuela during last august, supposedly due to so-called pregnancy complications, where she had run up a debt during her stay in the venezuelan clinic. currie had informed her colleagues at work that she had encountered financial problems due to aforementioned debt. her colleagues had supposedly even helped her out financially. she had left for venezuela last week to give birth to her so-called baby.it had therefore been currie’s intention to purchase a baby in venezuela. she had even paid a man to act as her husband. the three arubans, including currie and another five involved persons, are imprisoned in venezuela now.it is not known whether they have a lawyer or if the dutch embassy is informed of this case.  (of course they don't know this...they don't know their arses from a hole in the wall.  no one in aruba knows what's going on...absolutely pathetic.)http://www.amigoe.com/artman/publish/artikel_64004.php

members of the curacao "secret club" cause a dike failure in dutch trafficking plan



it's amazing what can happen in three days.  this first article was published on october 12, 2009.  a group of anonymous curacao "professionals" started a "secret club" going under the name "the institute kòrsou fuerte i outónomo--kfo.  (sounds like an online degree program?  maybe these are their some of their graduates?)the group, i mean, "institute" started throwing fists (or shall i say, throwing fits) by openly refusing the dutch's proposal for a statute law for the traffic of persons...literally calling it, "unacceptable", yet offering no alternatives.  the "secret club's" logic?  check out these brain marbles: “this intended legal regulation by the netherlands is an example of the general tendency in your country, where these kinds of regulations are considered a solution for the problems with the antillean youngsters, without bearing in mind the human rights of those involved.” sounds like a bunch of big babies with sour grapes to me.objection against statute law for the traffic of persons12 okt, 2009, 09:48 (gmt -04:00)willemstad — the proposal to constitute a statute law for the traffic of persons is unacceptable. the institute kòrsou fuerte i outónomo (kfo) state this in an open letter to the dutch minister of justice ernst hirsch ballin (cda) who arrived on curaçao today. in the open letter, the institute – consisting of professionals who had supported a no during the referendum – denounces that they will not stop their opposition against the statute law.kfo points out to hirsch ballin, that in the meantime the states of the antilles but also the island council of curaçao have vigorously renounced the draft statute law. “this intended legal regulation by the netherlands is an example of the general tendency in your country, where these kinds of regulations are considered a solution for the problems with the antillean youngsters, without bearing in mind the human rights of those involved.” according to kfo, the citizens of the antilles have free entry to the netherlands. “the approach of the problems of a specific group or high risk youngsters in the netherlands through a statute law that has legal force in the entire kingdom, is heavy artillery and not an appropriate means to solve a problem that is taking place in the netherlands, and the solution does not serve a legitimate purpose”, according to the institute.the institute describes the leaked out draft of the statute law as ‘another attempt to bar antillean and aruban dutch citizens from the territory of the kingdom in europe, based on their origin’. according to kfo, this law fits in the line of thought of the cross reference antilleans (via), and the return regulation, which both had a repressive character.“you even go as far as that in the framework of this law it is legally possible to detain antillean and aruban dutch citizens, while this was never the case in the past. even if the council of state had given the green light, as occurred in the past in the framework of the department administration of justice with the via, as a nation we will never ever cease our opposition against such a statute law.”http://www.amigoe.com/artman/publish/artikel_63710.phpthen three days later, on october 15, 2009, we see this?three arrests due to human trafficking15 okt, 2009, 08:58 (gmt -04:00)willemstad — the police apprehended two males and one female yesterday afternoon because of human trafficking. they were holding two dominican females against their will in the nightclub de rode leeuw on the weg naar sta. catharina. the two females are being taken care of by the bureau victim relief. the authorities were tipped on the case yesterday morning. the police immediately launched an investigation. on the spot, it appeared that two young dominican females had been locked up. the females were naked and were not given anything to eat or drink. their passports had been confiscated. the females, who had worked as exotic dancers, had refused to have sex with customers.various buildings on the terrain were searched, where video images of monitoring cameras were secured. the personal belongings of the victims were found and were returned to them. the managers of the nightclub, a 29-year old male from curaçao and the 45-year old male from africa were arrested as well as the 21-year old dominican female a.e. they are being suspected of unlawful detention casu quo human trafficking.the suspects have been transferred to the police station for interrogation. the victims have been taken care of by victim relief for aftercare.the investigation in this case is being carried out by a team of the division organized crime (dgc) of the corps police curaçao under supervision of the prosecution council. this team – which was recently composed on request of the prosecution council – consists of members of the corps police curaçao, the criminal investigation cooperation team and the royal military police. as of today, they will be responsible for the combating of human trafficking and human smuggling cases on curaçao.  (and who was in charge before?  deputy dog? reno 911?)in an american report of a few months ago, it was mentioned that the antilles hardly take any action against human trafficking. that is why the land was put on a watch list. the netherlands also see to it that the antilles takes this phenomenon seriously. a memorandum of understanding was signed at the beginning of this year to cooperate with the combating of human trafficking. former minister of justice david dick (par) said the american report was superseded because much had actually been realized in the meantime.  (am i smoking some of patrick van der eem's weed, or does that sentence make absolutely no sense?)http://www.amigoe.com/artman/publish/artikel_63857.php

cruise ship adventure of the seas says goodbye to aruba



adventure of the seas abandons arubaoranjestad — the cruise ship adventure of the seas from royal caribbean will not be visiting the harbor of oranjestad after april 20th, 2010.the ship, with a capacity of more than 3000 passengers, will be cruising in europe. various media have announced this. alfonso becloud, director of the aruba ports authority (apa) confirms that the route of adventure has been changed and that the ship will no longer be visiting aruba as of the end of april.the cruise schedule, which can be viewed on the website of apa, also confirms the departure of the adventure of the seas.the sister ship, serenade of the seas of the same company, will be visiting the aruban harbor instead of the adventure. the serenade is of the radiance-class and, in comparison with the voyager-class of the adventure, carries approx. 2400 passengers. the serenade is newer and more modern. the passengers of the ship are also different, according to boekhoudt. the adventure of the seas attracts younger passengers with its facilities such as a skating-rink, wall bars, and a basketball field.”the homeport of the serenade of the seas lies in the bahamas. boekhoudt says he regrets the decline of passengers, especially during the low season, but is positive about the possible chances of aruba attracting other ships from royal caribbean. “nothing has actually been said on this, but it is possible that the cruise company could for example decide to have the grandeur of the seas visit aruba more often, when the demand becomes high enough”, said the apa-director.the cruise ship adventure has continuously visited our harbor for years. during the high season, this ship visits our island every week, and every two weeks during the low season. in europe, the adventure of the seas will be departing from malaga in spain and sail a route in the mediterranean sea. i love this excuse:according to boekhoudt, there is no specific reason for the departure of the adventure of the seas. “it is probably just a change of the ship’s sailing schedule, just like all ships do every few years.” therefore, he does not consider it obvious that the ship would return to aruba within short. “it takes at least four to five years before they adjust their route again.”http://www.amigoe.com/artman/publish/artikel_63202.php

escaped trafficker sues press for releasing his picture



i'm posting your picture!  so sue me!  michelle says so:i think this guy has balls as big as joran's...who in the hell does this guy think he is by telling the press they can't use his picture when he is an escaped and wanted criminal?  someone please catch this monster who "owned" and trafficked over 100 women and spare us all by castrating him, locking him up and losing the key.a dangerous criminal on the run after escaping from jail is going to sue the press for publishing his picture. the man's lawyer says the photograph published by dutch media was taken during his client's wedding behind bars and can't be used as it is a private image.the escape of the man, saban baran, who is routinely referred to in the press as a violent and dangerous criminal, caused nationwide consternation. whilst serving a seven-and-a-half year sentence for his crimes, trafficking women and forcing them into prostitution,  he was given weekend leave to visit his new born baby. during the visit he absconded and has not been seen since.saban married in prison with a former prostitute exploited by him. police sources suggested to the telegraaf daily that he married her with a view to getting out of prison. beatingssaban and his brother hassan were found guilty last year of forcing over 100 women into prostitution. the women were branded with tattoos so everyone who laid eyes on them could see that they were "property of" the brothers. the men also hit the women with baseball bats and forced them to undergo breast enlargement operations.sylvia, one of saban's victims, told rnw, "as soon as we received a customer, saban or his brother would come inside to take the money, so that i could keep nothing for myself. if we didn't co-operate, they would use violence."the photograph in question appeared across dutch media in the immediate aftermath of baran's escape. the man's lawyer gerard spong told the spits newspaper that there was nothing unusual in his acting on his clients behalf, despite the fact he is on the run,  in regard to the claim about publishing the photo.the criminal disappeared a week ago - police suspect he may well have returned to his native turkey.no home leave in future (how about never?)as a result of this case, judges will no longer be involved in decisions to allow prisoners out of jail on home leave. the dutch justice minister ernst hirsch ballin was called to the lower house today to explain why saban baran was allowed out of prison on home leave in spite indications he may be planning to abscond.the minister told parliament that responsibility for the release of saban baran lay first and foremost with the judge. nevertheless, he thinks the public prosecution should have done more to prevent his release. in future it will be the prison governor who decides whether prisoners are entitled to compassionate leave, under direct responsibility of the justice minister. in response, a prison directors' association says, prison directors do not have enough time to consider whether or not prisoners are entitled to compassionate leave.http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/criminal-run-wants-sue-press

"the oldest profession in the world keeps up with modern times"?



citizens want change, government reluctantmichelle says so:why would the government be reluctant to change the laws of prostitution in order to protect women and children?  could it be that these "legal" businesses give handouts to the politicians so change does not occur?willemstad — in reaction to the public canvassing of girls for the prostitution, the appeal sounds for the legal curbing of this line of business. prostitution alone is not punishable in the netherlands antilles, when it regards adults (eighteen years and older).‘the oldest profession of the world’ also keeps up with modern times. an escort bureau has established itself on curaçao, and presents itself, as well as canvasses for personnel via internet. in addition, the amigoe was offered an advertisement for webcam girls at the end of last week. although this was refused, the advertisement still made it in a morning newspaper the next day. “i am making an explicit appeal to the politics to now grab pen and paper to have the law amended”, says the director or social development, keith carlo, former-chairman of the child welfare and fervid adherent of female and child rights.“members of parliament should consider not issuing any more permits to escort bureaus. the law should be amended accordingly.”lawyer berry scheperboer also pleads for an amendment of the law. he is of the opinion that a whole lot can be done, but that the political will is lacking. “the ‘legislator should act immediately’, if this is to be tackled”, said the lawyer, as it is now a ‘free for all’. “we have never had any problems with prostitution as we never departed from the viewpoint that females and children were objects worthy of protection”, according to the lawyer. “it concerns money and not love; the right of the strongest applies.”“if the government states that it cannot do anything, they are right, but they are legislator and they are capable of changing the legislation. regulations should be implemented that can be enforced appropriately.” as long as the government stands aloof, they are an accessory to these practices, according to scheperboer. the younger, the betterbasically the proprietors make use of the poverty, which many people, in particular females, contend with on the island. “one third of the population lives under the poverty line. the risk exists that families contending with poverty will exploit their girls to earn money.” he considers it ‘clever’ that they are on the lookout for adults. “who checks whether this girl (or boy, as this often occurs as well) is fifteen or sixteen year of age; or is it simply the younger, the better.”for that matter, from the language used in the advertisement for webcam girls, it appears to be directed towards girls rather than mature females: “are you 18 years or older and not shy? would you like to have a sideline and flexible working hours? present yourself for the information gathering. it is perfectly alright to take a girlfriend with you.”awarenessin addition to an amendment of the law, carlo is of the opinion that the government should initiate an awareness campaign. “for example: don’t let this fool or entice you.”deputy marilyn alcalá-wallé (par) is in favor of that idea: “we cannot forbid it, and therefore not intervene in the business itself. however, we could warn the population and introduce educative programs. that is an important task for the government, to rear the community to obstruct this matter within their own circles.”the island service culture and education will make sure that the activities regarding this area will be well monitored. responsible deputy alcalá-wallé admits that with the arrival of the new technologies, such as internet, it will become more difficult to keep an eye on all of this. “i am aware that this is developing very quickly, but also the latest developments require contra-developments.”escortit is common knowledge that prostitutes are active on curaçao – campo alegre is the widely known example, but there is also prostitution on the outside. in the past but also nowadays, there are various escort bureaus, which simply make telephonic arrangements for their services aboard pleasure yachts. as far as we are aware, it is new that an escort bureau offers its services locally through the internet.on the website, relax escort services promises discretion and high quality. the bureau is also interested in employing males and females up to fifty years of age and weighing up to 90 kilos. by the way, these are called ‘models’, and the escort bureau therefore offers ‘dates’.the website (relaxescortservice.com) states that the models and escorts are not prostitutes and therefore do not accept any compensation in whatever form for sexual activities or sexual contact. “every amount received by their staff or bureau is only meant for the time spent with the model, or the modeling time for the client”, the bureau emphasizes. the prices start at 175 dollars for a topless body rub (non-therapeutic, according to the website.the offered package is legion. the bureau offers strippers (male & female), dinner dates, and entertainment for couples, and two or more girls. it is even possible to take an escort on holidays. the hourly rate for an escort is 300 dollars.http://www.amigoe.com/artman/publish/artikel_62885.php

human trafficker saban baran flees from prison--dutch claim "terrible blunder in the law"



human trafficker, saban baran escapes and flees the netherlandsmps have demanded justice minister ernst hirsch ballin explain how a convicted and violent human trafficker came to be given a few days leave from prison and then vanished.ernst hirsch ballinsaban baran is currently appealing against a 7.5 year jail sentence for forcing over 100 women into prostitution, together with his brother.baran had been allowed home to visit his new baby, born to one of his trafficking victims whom he married from jail in january.according to the telegraaf, the arnhem court gave the go-ahead to the compassionate leave (compassionate leave???  what about the compassion to the 100 women he victimized?  the dutch need to get with the program, or i'll make sure that secretary of state, hillary rodman clinton puts the netherlands on notice!), despite the objections of the public prosecution department, which said he was a flight risk and that it had been tipped off he was making travel plans.police say they expect baran has fled to turkey and an international arrest warrant has been issued. the netherlands does not have an extradition treaty with turkey.http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2009/09/fury_over_human_trafficker_esc.phpmichelle says so:  well citizens of turkey, keep an eye out for this monster.  the turkish government could have extradited him, but it's obvious their laws and attitudes are not in the best interest of their people, and are not fit for any human being to live under.  he is in your hands threatening the safety of your citizens.  shame on you.  maybe he's hanging out with joran van der sloot now, the professional pimp.  bastards!

fraud, laundering, smuggling, and international drug trade, oh my!



michelle says so:sure, this is in bonaire, and not aruba, but it is part of the netherland antilles, which most likely means that others in the area do or have done the same things.yes, we have corruption in our own country (as many people love to argue with me), but this isn't about the united states.  it's about aruba and the netherland antilles, and it just goes to show how shady and conspiratorial they are...all the while calling themselves the "best" in the carribean.  what a load of crock this is.maybe these people's actions will set an example for other wrong-doers.  but probably not...kralendijk — former minister and deputy burney el hage (upb) ìs a suspect in the investigation on fraud, laundering, gold smuggling, and international drug trade, according to the ‘order for house search’ of which the amigoe came into possession.burney el hagein the ‘order for house search’ of the court in first instance, el hage is mentioned as suspect just like willem van wijngaarden, and albert de groof who have both been apprehended; the latter has been transferred to curaçao. van wijngaarden’s wife, yvonne de vries, is also mentioned as suspect in the order. el hage and de vries have not been apprehended.deza (directorate economical- and labor-affairs) are also mentioned in the aforementioned order as a location, which required searching. various sources have confirmed the authenticity of the document.the public prosecutor (om) of the netherlands antilles is not revealing anything about the investigation (surprise, surprise...). the order for house search does not state what these persons are being suspected of. however, there is a list summarizing the documents and administration, which were to be confiscated from a number of companies and real estate- and development projects.the companies from which the administration should be confiscated according to the order are questron, independium trust, emphora fisheries, struijk overzee, kaya grandi corporate service, bonaire precious metal & minerals, and bonaire precious metals refinery. justice requested the board of governors to hand over the administration on the issuance of ground leases, as well as minutes of meetings, reports, and conversation notations as of january 2006.in addition, all administration regarding the blue lagoon-project must be confiscated, according to the order, as well as data on a number of properties in nikiboko and sabadeco.in the framework of the (international) investigation, eighteen house searches were carried out on bonaire last week tuesday and another four the day after. a house search was also carried out at the residence of upb party-leader ramonsito booi, in addition to the house searches at the residences of el hage and van wijngaarden. booi’s name does appear on the order, but he is not considered a suspect. the 39-year old anthony marsera is the main suspect in the investigation and was apprehended on bonaire last tuesday.http://www.amigoe.com/artman/publish/artikel_62446.php

new regulation should be called the "joran van der sloot standard"



with all the political hostility towards the dutch going on in aruba, and considering how many dutch were/are involved in desecrating the island of aruba because of the natalee holloway cover-up, it is about time aruba takes notice and sets some standards.  aruba kicks out dutch who have overstayed welcomeoranjestad — since the end of last month, there is considerable unrest among the european dutch citizens after the immigration refused them entry onto the island. it concerns dutch citizens who have exceeded the maximum stay of 180 days per calendar year. this never occurred before. since the implementation of the new computer system, the immigration can simply keep track of how long the dutch citizens stay on the island.those exceeding the 180 days will therefore be expelled. another problem is the lack of clarity on the residence regulation. in the immigration policy for foreigners, it states that european dutch citizens may stay on the island for 180 consecutive days per calendar year. the regulation that was employed, was that someone was allowed to stay on aruba for a maximum of 180 days, and subsequently had to leave the island for thirty days, and return afterwards – without any problem at all – to stay another 180 days on aruba. this has been changed recently, the immigration organization of the government, dimas, finally admits.in first instance, a co-worker of dimas stated that the rule of 180 days on aruba, and thirty days off, was still in force. the supervisor of the immigration department at the airport is contradicting this message. he argues that a european dutch citizen is allowed to stay for 180 days per twelve months. “that has always been the case, but nobody ever checked it.”the supervisor continues, “before the new computer system, we had to count the days with the help of the stamps in the passports. this was not done. now we have a new system which makes this control easier.”after 1½ week, dimas is finally capable of providing clarity. according to adjunct director ayesha staring-engelbrecht, it is indeed since recently that the immigration has been counting the number of days that person had been on the island. “no one without a permit may stay on the island longer than 180 days per calendar year”, says engelbrecht.engelbrecht also explains that according to the government, the calendar year starts on the first day that someone arrives on aruba. “it could therefore also start in august.” this confused among the european dutch citizens as they think that a calendar year runs from january up to and including december. engelbrecht said that she currently has contact with ‘a number’ of dutch citizens who have also encountered this situation. the adjunct director said she had ‘come up with a solution’ for these people so that they could still stay on aruba longer than the 180 days. however, this group must be in the possession of a so-called ‘renteniersbrief’ (letter confirming this person is living off private means). “it is true, that the control on the 180 days-rule should have been communicated better”, said engelbrecht. “it is an uncongenial measure, but i do want everyone to respect the current rules.”  according to the immigration department, the immigration policy for foreigners from november 2007 has changed since last month. upon inquiry with engelbrecht, it appeared that there was only a document stating the admission requirements for tourist. the document was dated september 8th, the day before yesterday. in this document, the word ‘consecutive’ – which had always led to an interpretation difference between the duped european dutch citizens and the government – has been deleted. based on the aforementioned, the dutch citizens thought that after 180 days on aruba and thirty days abroad, they could return to aruba; this was actually tolerated for more than ten years until last month.no sunny christmasthe group or european dutch citizens, has meanwhile started a discussion on the internet. from this and other reactions, which the editorial office received, it appears that the duped are not anxious to sound the alarm with the government, especially for fear of ‘retaliation’. “we only bring money to the island”, is one of the reactions. others also wonder why aruba is so strict, as they do not make use of the social provisions. many have a second home here, and remain registered as well as insured in the netherlands.a married couple with a second home says, “upon arrival on aruba, the immigration counted the number of days that we’ve been here. the plan was to return around christmas, but now we don’t know. i really wouldn’t know what to do, if i return at christmas, and there’s a chance that i’ll be sent back.” another reaction, “we regularly visit aruba, but now we do not know what we’re up against; actually we dare not visit the dimas or phone the customs, like we say… ‘let sleeping dogs lie.”http://www.amigoe.com/artman/publish/artikel_62271.php

patrick van der eem arrested again...this time for cocaine



a leopard never changes its spotsoranjestad — patrick van der eem – who was the undercover man to whom joran van der sloot had made a confession – was apprehended yesterday evening around seven o’clock for possession of drugs and making violent threats.  (note: amigoe does not reveal that van der eem was in possession of cocaine...that information came from the netherlands news here.)the police arrested van der eem in his room in the radisson hotel. according to the local media, van der eem had previously stayed in other hotels, amongst others, the rui, westen, and occidental and had checked-out without paying. according to the public prosecutor the drugs, which he was carrying at that moment, were for his own use. van der eem is still confined at the police station in noord and the case will be investigated.van der eem became known through his contribution to a broadcasted television program of crime reporter peter de vries on the disappearance of the american teenager natalee holloway on aruba.he had already been involved in an earlier drug case. he presumably got the scar on the left hand side of his face during his information role in a drug case. in addition, van der eem was confined for a short while last december after a report on battering his girlfriend.http://www.amigoe.com/artman/publish/artikel_61537.phpsee previous story on van der eem's previous arrest for assault on girlfriend with a crowbarhttp://arubanboycott.blogspot.com/2009/05/patrick-van-der-eem-beats-wife-with.html
