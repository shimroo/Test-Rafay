payment comparison

example is based on the average original monthly debt payment total vs. consolidated debt amount, and term received by actual customers who financed a debt consolidation with discover home loans over the most recent three full months of available data. payment reductions are for illustration purposes only and assume you make your home loan payment on time. your actual payment reduction may vary depending on the apr and term of your home loan, the actual terms of your credit accounts, and how you make payments on those accounts. taking cash out in addition to consolidating debt will increase your monthly payment. your actual apr may be higher or lower than the apr shown here, which is based on aprs available as of the date of this communication and creditworthiness. please visit discover.com/home-loans/rates to see today's aprs.
 
based on a $xx,xxx loan amount at x.xx% apr for a 30 year term with a monthly payment of $xxx.
 
benefits and risks of debt consolidation: the relative benefits of a debt consolidation loan depend on your individual circumstances and actual debt payments. you will save on interest payments when you pay the new, lower interest rate loan monthly in an amount equal to or greater than previous payments towards the higher rate debt(s) being consolidated.

keep in mind, though, while your monthly payments will be lower, in the long term you may pay more interest if the debt is extended.
