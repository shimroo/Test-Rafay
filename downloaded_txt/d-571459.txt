of meat and men





i burned tonight’s steak.i charred the chicken last week, and the pork went up in smoke the week before that.i'm scorching, not scoring, at this sport men call"barbeque." i don't mind burning meat -- for now --because, even though he did the grilling when he was around,i'll learn.every week, i trot out some virgin cut of flesh,fire up the grill,and let her go.eating my burned dinner, i chuckleat the times people have mistaken me for a vegetarian.for, you see, i devour both meat and men.
