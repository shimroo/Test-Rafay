october 14, 2024irving penn: kinship, curated by hank willis thomaspace presents irving penn: kinship, curated by artist hank willis thomas, at its 508 west 25th street gallery in new york.on view from november 15, 2024 to february 22, 2025, this show will spotlight works produced by penn throughout his 70-year career, including selections from his worlds in a small room series, his iconic portraits of artists, actors, and writers, and other genres of his images. these photographs will be exhibited within an installation designed by thomas to replicate a structure that penn used to photograph many of his high-profile subjects.often investigating the ways that framing and perspective can shape our experiences of the world around us, thomas will situate penn’s photographs within a bespoke, star-shaped structure with intersecting corners, created using a material similar to the plywood flats of the photographer’s original studio for his portraits in a corner. displayed on the structure’s exterior walls and within its central interior space, penn’s images will invite viewers to inhabit a similarly intimate, enclosed space as the subjects of his portraits captured across the globe—through thomas’s vision, this room becomes a new world of its own.

about the artist

irving penn was one of the twentieth century's great photographers, known for his arresting images and masterful printmaking. although he was celebrated as one of vogue magazine's top photographers for more than sixty years, penn was an intensely private man who avoided the limelight and pursued his work with quiet and relentless dedication. at a time when photography was primarily understood as a means of communication, he approached it with an artist's eye and expanded the creative potential of the medium, both in his professional and personal work.learn more about the artist.

penn's painting practice

as a young man, after graduating from the philadelphia museum school of industrial art in 1938, irving penn harbored dreams of becoming a painter. in 1941–42, he spent a year in mexico painting, but he found his results to be disappointing and destroyed all but a small group of drawings. despite this repudiation, drawing continued to play an important role for penn in his subsequent work as a photographer as he worked out an image and its composition.following his retrospective exhibition at the museum of modern art in 1984, penn returned to painting after more than forty years. he developed unique working methods, inspired by his experiences printing photographs in platinum and palladium metals. after 2000, when penn ceased platinum-palladium printing, he began making inkjet prints from digitally scanned drawings. he also produced freehand paintings using no photographic or printing processes.to complement the essays in the irving penn: paintings catalogue, we have combed through the foundation’s archive to unearth details about specific works featured in the publication.
