  biology
  is
  the
  study
  of
  living
  organisms:

  structure,
  function,
  organization,
  origin,
  and
  evolution.
  
  as
  a
  biologist,
  you’ll
  have
  career
  options
  that
  span
  a
  wide
  range
  of
  professions,
  including
  laboratory
  and
  field
  research,
  environmental
  assessment,
  the
  health
  professions,
  education,
  and
  industry.
  by
  choosing
  one
  of
  our
  areas
  of
  specialization
  (no

  available
  after
  fall
  2020),
  such
  as
  animal
  physiology,
  ecology
  and
  environmental
  biology,
  microbiology,
  molecular
  biology
  and
  biotechnology,
  or

  you
  can
  better
  prepare
  yourself
  for
  these
  exciting
  career
  opportunities.
  
  our

the university of waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the neutral, anishinaabeg, and haudenosaunee peoples. our main campus is situated on the haldimand tract, the land granted to the six nations that includes six miles on each side of the grand river. our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the office of indigenous relations.
