forget what you saw before. yeah, party by force was funny. so were those shitty little dogs. they remain retro cool, but we must break with the past and strive forward! onwards, pancho!

everyone likes games don't they? but here we can see that an unfortunate  (unnamed)  individual needs more friends before he can play.  tough  times when even the interweb calls you a looser!

ho ho ho, it's nearly xmas time, and ancient traditions should be observed. even our feline friends are getting in on the act. this advent calendar has some delicious milk and catnip drops secreted in each compartment. none the less, my sister in search of a pre-dinner treat thought that she would steal one of "my" well earned chocolate buttons, only to find a nasty catnip surprise. ha ha ha. have no fear, they are quite safe for small children if eaten accidentally. god help them if eaten on purpose!

ooo. ahh. what could it be?? maybe it is the latest in the line of iain's new bold artwork? perhaps it could be a graph showing the rise and fall of mr blobby? could it be the route that mr. barton and i took when hunting for our most recent geocache? who can say? peace.

'why would you need a metal hook type thing on the back of your pc?' that would be the question you would be asking yourself if you were me the last few hours. please please please tell me what it is for so i can sleep easy tonight. thank you all.p.s. i'm fairly sure it has something to do with the little people who live inside pentium chips, they need post modern art around the place or they just stay miserable (i heard bent metal is the best sort of art).
