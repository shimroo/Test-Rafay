a little late!





but happy 2010!after so much anticipation ratdog daze came and went.we had a blast !  made some new friends and got to spend a decent amount of time with some old friends.  if you love the weir, the beach, hanging with those of mutual interests you must consider heading there if there is a ratdog daze in 2011.  i was very sorry to learn that robin sylvester was unable (due to illness) to join his bandmates  in negril.  we send him our best wishes for good health.  we were lucky that old dog rob wasserman was available to rejoin ratdog for the time.  it's always good to see the wass.   there were a few other artists sitting in with the dog - a couple of guys from the radiators, jackie greene, bones hillman and richard -the sax player from the resort's house band.   a few other musicians richard "the commander" del boccio, roy jay and a few whose names i didnt catch, also entertained us  late nights/early mornings in the piano bar. before the ratdog daze, there was a series of furthur rehersals held in mill valley.it was complete insanity to get tickets but you all know i managed to be right there on my computer when those tix went on sale. i made it to 7 or 8 of the (i think?) 12. scott was able to get out to a few with me which made it all the more enjoyable. i'm somewhat busy-busy lately, but will try to get back in here when things calm down.

well, here i am...what an incredible weekend!first we were sad that though ticketed, we thought we would have to miss mk's cd release party due to my nephew's college basketball game. zachary plays for western oregon university we had promised early on to go see him when his team plays against a team from a college near us.  turns out it's a different date they will play here...the 27th which complicates plans for coda & band of brotherz...so, phew!  we were on for friday.then a friend calls and offers to get us into a stealth furthur show to be played in fairfax.what to do? what to do?  it's sort of an offer than can't be refused.so husband and i decide to go to both shows.  gotta get our bobby, jeff & jay phil and then our robin and mk warm fuzzies..that is exactly what we did!a friend from work was driving into sf  to meet up with her friends and dropped me off at scott's work.   yay! no car at bart to have to retrieve later.scotters and i had a nice drive on to marin.  the scene outside the bar that  furthur  was to play at was a bit messier than i expected.   ive done crazy line duty before but this wouldve been scary. people had been out in the rain all day. the sidewalk was packed with folks- not single or double file like they made us stand outside the sweetwater for crusader rabbit . i don't know how folks could tell who they were next in line to?we were early so we grabbed dinner at a cafe "sleeping lady" which was next door to the venue .the line was still stationary when we went back out to the street.  crazy!it took a while to figure out how to get into the show as the entrance was just clogged with people. it was really exciting to be inside when we did get inside. everyone inside had huge grins.there was some nice views from the area next to jeff, so we stayed by him. around the end of althea (hot althea) a woman who had been perching on the fireplace next to me jumped down & left , so i jumped up and was able to scrunch up a little more and get an even nicer view!there are videos from this show up on message boards and youtube, when i have a little more time, i will bring them here.furthur was fanstastic, just fantastic.  of the few songs we saw, the let it grow was my favorite- some wonderful places in there...i hope they play it again on nye..for me...c'mon bobby!we stayed for 3 or 4 songs. when bobby announced that they were going to take a few moments to adjust something with the sound, we figured on that being the best time for us  to leave- before they launched into anymore songs.there was still a very big crowd in line!  there were no in/out privileges and the bouncer cut off our wristies .  the two people who were 1st & 2nd in the remains of the line couldnt have looked happier to exchange places with us.  this made me happy. they got to be inside for whatever came after cassidy....................................so, out to sausalito we went. mk's party was harborside.  found parking- not so easy as mark's party had sold out .  it was a totally full venue ..forget about moseying up to the rail.we found our way inside and over to our table (reserved seats for this old girl). got settled in time to hear a very soulful "death don't have no mercy". i don't have the setlist but it was great fun. the band sounded fantastic .  i think the women from jgb were up on the stage for a song....i don't know their names (sorry)about an hour after we were there, familiar faces started wandering in.  furthur was over and bobby, jay & jeff made it to sausalito.mark invited bobby up and they played sugaree together. jeff & jay looked on.scott was starting to fade and cough. he had to work the following day so we again had to leave earlier than we would have liked....still an excellent night for music and reconnecting with the local dh community........................i knew mark was playing in the not so so so faraway sonoma county, but scott was still coughing. it wasnt looking good for us going to see jemimah puddleduck.then,krista called and said she was going, so you bet i jumped into her car and off we went to sebastopol!  vroooom!the venue was nice-had a decent sized crowd for a sunday night out in the country.mark, robin and the other bandmates rocked out.i tried to get more clips but caught myself dancing.i only wish i had more room in my flip to have kept taking clips every song exceeded the previous song in jams & energy.  a great night..a fun weekend...still smiling here.
