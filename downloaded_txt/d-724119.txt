   why isn't everybody going to reds? many of the northshore garden centers and this by far beats them all. i lost count at 13 greenhouses that you can walk through and pick one pot or flats. just a tremendous variety and offerings and stock looks excellent. i wish i had started here first. they have items branded as reds and. many of the named brands like pw that you find in other places. there cashier and computer system situation could be improved, the lines looked scary, but went fairly fast, worth the wait time.

 reds has been our go-to provider for all of our landscaping needs ... shrubs and now trees.  the employees there are extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  we got some great suggestions, lots of personal attention, and also a bit of guidance to find what we were looking for.  wear work boots if you have them, or at least something easy to wash off the mud ... remember they are constantly watering all these living things until they find their new homes!

 we have been buying sod from this company for years. they have the best small volume sod around and will order it next day if you call in. we had a few times that we could not pick up the sod until late and they were out but the way their office and management handled the situation made us feel both heard and respected. thanks reds and we will continue to patronize and promote your business.

 ryan helped us with our landscaping and flagstone path project. ( major shout out to damien and the crew too!) the results were exceptional and we could not be more happy! as with all major home projects, we had a few surprises come up, but ryan was always there to work things through with us. as a matter of fact i got to know ryan so well i now count him as a friend. red's is very lucky to have this man on their team!

 just wanted to thank the 2 wonderful gentlemen who delivered our firewood this morning in highland park. we were running late and they waited for me to point out where to stack our half cord. so very nice! quick delivery and stacking. we can't wait to warm our home tonight! thank you!

 great firewood purchasing experience! i am brand new to firewood and the person on the phone spent 15 minutes going through all the different types of wood, how they burn, and different pricing options. she spent the extra time so i felt completely satisfied with my $160 firewood purchase. the delivery was very quick and on time. i have been burning this wood for 5 days straight and it burns great! i'll be coming back for more. :) happy thanksgiving.
