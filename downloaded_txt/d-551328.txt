welcome to our philatelic treasure drove!
we specialize in scandinavian, baltic states', and russian stamps and postal history, including zeppelin post.
we also offer high quality great britain stamps from the reigns of queen victoria to king george vi and attractive thematic stamps in the increasingly popular collecting field of the usa migratory bird hunting stamps, commonly known as âducksâ.
our focus is in what stanley gibbons would term as "investment grade" material; hence most items featured on the site are unique. we are not a volume business and we do not publish extensive price lists. we take pride in a highly personalized service by providing detailed scans of specific items either via e-mail or post.
our prices are usually 15% less than the michel catalogue values for mid-period items and close to the catalogue value for recent issues.
should we not be able to meet your "wants list" from our extensive stock, we can usually source an item very quickly as we are affiliated with major philatelic dealers across scandinavia, europe and north america. we can also act as an auction agent for our clients.
phoenix stamp company is committed to serve all collectors with outmost honesty, integrity and respect. we are governed by the highest professional standards of the uk philatelic traders' society and american philatelic society.
we are active buyers of anything philatelic within our specialist area. should you wish to sell a collection, we will travel anywhere in the south east of the uk for a consultation.
we are currently buying top quality stamps and postal history: zeppelin post, greenland official year sets, russian and soviet union collections. immediate cash offers!
insurance valuations are taken for a flat fee of â£50.00. the fee is refundable should you decide to sell your collection to phoenix stamp company.
