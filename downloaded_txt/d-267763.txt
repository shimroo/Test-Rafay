guest reviews



awesome dude ranch in the adirondacks.
we loved our 3 night stay at this all-inclusive horse ranch. we were able to ride on the afternoon of our arrival and also the morning of departure as well as mornings and afternoons each day. there were lots of gentle horses to choose from and the guides always made sure we had safe rides on the beautiful mountain trails. the food was delicious with plenty of choices and great service. the chalet we stayed in was very comfy and clean. lots of other activities at the lake and around to participate in. really a nice place to visit and we enjoyed everything about ridin hy ranch and will be back!! - katesmiami on trip advisor
