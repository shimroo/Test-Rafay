who we are

                          global vision technology was founded with the goal of bridging the gap between japanese companies and the global market. our biggest strength is our ability to train cross-cultural system engineers – or “bridge ses” – to provide them to our clients to help their business needs covering both ends of pacific, primarily in the u.s. and japan. this may be a unique niche business for us but we also believe it can make a big difference in our clients' global scale business in many years to come.
