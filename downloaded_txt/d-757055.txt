free recipes - a lifetime 
	collection
	 






tried and true recipes - from mom's 
	kitchen!




the process of trying food recipes - finding the good ones, 
	tossing the mediocre ones is time consuming and frustrating!  so, i 
	usually just rely on my mother's lifetime of research!  she 
	has tried so many recipes over the years, she says she can almost taste one 
	before she makes it!  
this site is the lifetime collection of the tried and the true.  
	recipes from the 
	kitchen of my mother, helen rich, with a few additions from me, 
	my children (angela, ashleigh and taylor), family and friends!
like most children, i have fond memories surrounding "mom's 
	home cooking"!  however, the mouthwatering memories of her cooking 
	are not a figment of a childhood imagination!  simply put, her food recipes 
	are the best!!  ...just ask any of her children, grandchildren, family, or host 
	of friends that have been treated to meals from her gourmet collection of 
	free food recipes.
mother has a huge sweet tooth, so you will find the 
	dessert section to be much larger than the others!  you may find three 
	or four recipes for the same food... it is because we simply couldn't 
	decide on which one we liked best!  
some of the recipe are simple, quick and yummy... others are 
	more gourmet, and require a bit more expertise and prep time.  you will find a bit of 
	everything in this collection.  there are even a few recipes for 
	foods my mother remembers from her childhood!  many are "comfort" foods 
	you will probably remember your mother preparing, others are the spicy hot 
	"tex-mex" that our family craves!  (if you like bland, our recipes are 
	probably not for you!)
we sincerely hope you enjoy the free food recipes as much as we have!  
	use as many as you would like, pass them around, and enjoy preparing 
	special meals and treats for your 
	family and friends! 


it is with love and admiration that we dedicate this free 
	online collection of recipes, the ultimate in family cookbooks, to our "nan" 
	as she is called by her grandchildren!  thank you, mother for the 
	lifetime of reading and preparing fabulous new recipes and cultivating our 
	love of food and cooking.  without you, this incredible and diverse 
	collection of online recipes would not exist for everyone to enjoy.  (a 
	personal thank you for your patience in helping to complete this three year 
	project. especially for rounding up all of your treasured recipes and 
	helping me to get them from magazine and newspaper clippings, recipe cards, notes, letters etc. 
	safely into type so they 
	will never be lost!)
we all love you dearly! ... and, by the way, what's for dinner!!!

i have this cuisinart ice cream maker, and absolutely love it!  
it makes homemade ice cream in about an hour without all of the mess and fuss.  
no need for ice, salt, or pre-freezing a bowl... just pour the mixture into the 
tub and plug it in.  perfect ice cream every single time!  i gave one 
to mom for christmas, and she uses it weekly!  anyone who loves ice cream 
will love this unit.

had to tell you we tried taylor's 
favorite recipe, mexican buildup.  i fixed 
gene's plate and he said" you think i will eat that much."  when he got done he said 
"i didn't think i could eat that much," then he got a little more.  great 
job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this was really the greatest idea one could share with the 
world.  thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  we are looking forward  to trying other 
recipes.   
...lynda and gene



thank you 
	for sharing your wonderful recipe website.  i cant wait to have more time to spend 
	looking at it.  i make your banana bread all 
	the time, and still have the recipe card that you wrote it on in your 
	precise printing!  im going to find a new side dish from your website 
	for our thanksgiving dinner and will toast you and your mom!
