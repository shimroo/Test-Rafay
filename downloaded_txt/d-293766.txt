become part of our prestigious history in san antonio
the mexican american catholic college, a pioneer in bilingual higher education with an emphasis in pastoral and hispanic ministry, welcomes a diverse group of students. priests, seminarians, deacon candidates, and religious, who are often sent by their bishops and superiors, and lay leaders, including international students, attend and acquire academic and leadership formation for effective service in the hispanic community.
macc students with hispanic ministry formation and an intercultural literacy can create programs to benefit, empower, and educate others within their own communities, thus improving the lives of catholics and non-catholics alike.

testimonials
what our students say
mary frances jasteri so enjoyed my time at macc! teri was great as a teacher, hermana guia and i got along so well, and you have done a wonderful job of coordinating the classes and the pastoral aspects of language.  what a gift you all are.  and everyone is so nice!  thank you for a wonderful intensive class.carmen aguinacofirst time i went to macc. i had registered for a course on popular religiosity during holy week… somehow, the course had been cancelled, but i had not received the notification. but, because at macc everyone is important, the course was rapidly reassembled, seminarians convened, and i was blessed to listen to archbishop flores and virgilio elizondo! it was an unforgettable holy week.sr. debbie borneman ss.c.m.i participated in the respecto program and the mini-pastoral 3 week programs. i loved it! i learned more about my own ethnicity and the cultural wealth of my congregation than i ever knew. the encouragement to learn first about who we are has stayed with me over the years to be a bridge builder, not a snow plow. i appreciated the patience, creativity, and joy of the presenters who encouraged us to share our own stories and insights with one another.bishop ricardo ramirezmacc was a life-changing experience for me. it was a moment of grace for me and for the many who were part of it. i loved what i taught (mexican american history, culture and spirituality) and those whom i taught. a great blessing was being part of a dedicated staff and community, especially being associated with archbishop flores, fr. virgil elizondo and professors from latin america. macc was a grace-filled adventure and prepared me well to my years as a bishop.
