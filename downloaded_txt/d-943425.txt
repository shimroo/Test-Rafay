world's hardest riddle! >_oookelcitaooomay 28th, 2006current mood: confusedthe world's hardest riddle i turn polar bears white and i will make you cry. i make guys have to pee and girls comb their hair. i make celebrities look stupid and normal people look like celebrities. i turn pancakes brown and make your champane bubble. if you sqeeze me, i'll pop. if you look at me, you'll pop. can you guess the riddle? 97% of harvard graduates can not figure this riddle out, but 84% of kindergarten students were able to figure this out in 6 minutes or less. can you guess the correct answer? just repost this bulletin with the title "the world's hardest riddle", and then check your inbox. you'll get a message with the correct answer in it. good luck! -myspace bulliten.homg what's the answer!?!? i think the answer's no because of the last part- can you guess the riddle?
