hey! i'm michel.
a curious life adventurer, creative problem solver and geek.
this is my pretty outdated personal website where i used to show off my work, blog my travels and thoughts and provide pretty much all the information you'd ever like to know about me.
be warned, it's all outdated!
gotten curious about me? why this website is called just like ed? perhaps you'd fancy to play one of my games? i'm always keen to hear back from you, so drop me a line if you like!
