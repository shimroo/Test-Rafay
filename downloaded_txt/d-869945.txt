  this is a quaint older (mid-century) motel, quirkily decorated and a great value. walking distance from the beach and restaurants with a breakfast diner next door, and cheap low-amentities rooms that are clean and comfy. the staff was friendly and helpful--we originally planned to stay just one night but decided to add a second because we were having such a great time. would definitely come back again! don't expect anything fancy, but if you need a decent place to shower and sleep while you explore the area this lil motel is perfect.
