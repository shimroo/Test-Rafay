we upgraded our safetouch security system. thomas and clay were our techs and they were both awesome! thomas was the senior tech and was training clay. thomas was very professional. he explained everything to me and my husband. both thomas and clay were very personable and helpful. thomas was very knowledgeable about safetouch and the equipment. it's why i love safetouch. their techs are more than techs. they are also customer service and help desk. thank you thomas and clay!

we woke up saturday morning to the blaring of the alarm on our smoke and heat sensor. i called customer service and the first thing they did was walk me through how to make the alarm stop sounding. we were still at a point where we could not reset our alarm from the keypad which did concern me. after sensing my concern, the customer service rep talked to her service manager and they dispatched an outstanding technician to our house. he repaired the damage within 20 minutes and we were back to normal. i am a raving fan of safetouch.

most excellent service ! we had service upgraded in a commercial building and appointment was for 8 am and tech arrived 15 minutes early. tech was very professional and completed the upgrade in a timely manner. tech also took the time to make sure we understood the alarm system, went through all features and made sure he answered any question we had. if we have any future service needs hope to see him again.

justin was extremely professional and courteous, giving us excellent customer service. we upgraded to wireless security and he was very patient as he explained how to add the app to our phones, and gave me a very well done personal training session on the details of the safe touch home page. now ready to move on with further installation of cameras. i recommend safe touch to anyone considering security for their home (or business).
