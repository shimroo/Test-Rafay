working with global organisations
in 1969 our board of directors, trustees and members comprised those at the forefront of the broadcast industry. in 2020 as our remit has widened and the telecoms media and technology sectors have converged, we still pride ourselves on having as strategic iic partners the major content platforms, telecoms operators and technology businesses. as well as regulators and policy makers from all continents.










membership of the iic
the iic is committed to helping regulators, competition authorities and policymakers,  find the best regulatory and policy frameworks for the widest societal benefit. the iic is the only independent international forum that brings together statutory national regulators, competition authorities, global commercial operators and end-user representatives in a collegiate, neutral environment to debate policy issues.
