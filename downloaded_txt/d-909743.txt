what our clients say






gia is the best realtor. she is very kind, thoughtful, and thorough. she helped educate me on all kinds of things i didn't know and i loved working with her to buy my first home. i would highly recommend her to anyone.


                    olivia pool                



if you are looking for a home in 2025, i highly recommend working with gracen tilton - she went above & beyond for me and will use her for every new home moving forward!!


                    julian lavelle                



i wish i could give more stars, that's all i have to say.positive responsiveness, quality, professionalism


                    fuhren tsai                



i worked with marshall walker real estate while buying a historic house in downtown charleston, sc. the process of was not at all what a normal house buying experience is like, and every step needed oddball special steps. but, in the end, it all came together! the closing was at the end of january, and the process started soon for restoring the house!


                    kevin eberle                



alison frasier, realtor, assisted me in finding a new rental to call home. i clicked a random but well placed button to reach out with my interest in a property and within an hour she had called me and arranged a site visit. after i determined the place was right for me, she connected me with the landlord and has checked in on me periodically to make sure that all is going well. i appreciate that! when i enter the home buying market in the future, i will certainly reach out to alison, but this time directly!


                    latesha smith                



i was looking for a building to relocate my business. i’d called several realtors! alison frasier reached back out to me and did not give up until what i was looking for was found! patient, professional and very easy to work with! highly recommended!!


                    kim jones                



if you are interested in selling or purchasing a home marshall walker and his staff is the best. they sold two homes for me and help me purchase a new house and the service far exceeded what i expected. they work in your best interest before and after the sale and they keep in contact with you as to any further help they can be.


                    alicia butler                



marshall walker real estate group is a fantastic real estate company that provides exceptional service. i have had the pleasure of working with marshall since the beginning of his career, he is extremely knowledgeable and experienced. he is extremely involved in the community and truly cares for his clients!
