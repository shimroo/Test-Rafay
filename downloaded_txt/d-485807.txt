events & programs





march is women's month!
women’s month recognizes, affirms, and showcases the achievements, concerns, and diversity of women. a feminist perspective — one that encourages and advances women of all races, political affiliations, national origins, religions, ages, abilities, sexual orientations, gender identities, and income levels — underlies all our programming. the annual event occurs in march in conjunction with national women’s history month. the national women's history month theme for this year is moving forward together! women educating & inspiring generations. this theme recognizes the influence of women who have dedicated their lives to education, mentorship, and leadership. women’s month has historically represented virginia tech’s broad commitment to celebrating diverse and inclusive communities. to honor this ongoing commitment, the women’s month 2025 calendar highlights programs and events aligned with the virginia tech principles of community. if you have questions, please contact emma stubbe.
