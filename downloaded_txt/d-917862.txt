this website has been created as a means of providing you with both general and specific information about my
            background and practice. it is my hope that, by being able to read through this easy-to-understand
            information in the privacy of your own home, you will become more informed about the dental care you will be
            receiving, thereby making your dental experience more comfortable and less anxious.
within the website, i will introduce you to myself and to my practice. you
            can access information regarding my personal and professional history, including my complete resume. detailed information may be found about the dental procedures offered through my practice, including wisdom teeth and
            other dental extractions and dental implants. i will also provide you with comprehensive information about
            the various types of anesthesia that may be used during your procedure.
in order to best prepare yourself prior to your dental procedure, please feel free to reference the pre-operative care section which will give you an opportunity to
            review the forms you'll need to complete. also, so that the time after your procedure will progress as
            smoothly as possible, you might consider reviewing the post-operative
                care section. in fact, answers to some of the most commonly asked questions you may have, as well as
            prescription "rx" information is also available.

            or in the convenience and familiar surroundings of his or her own office.

            environment in which you will be knowledgeable about and comfortable with your treatment. thank you for
