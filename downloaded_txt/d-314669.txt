our policy is to give patients the best possible attention. to achieve this quality we only accept one patient per hour for any one practitioner. our average number of visits per patient is between 3-4 sessions depending upon the severity and chronicity of the problems.
our existing patients, regularly consulted on this practice, suggest it to be less rushed and extremely satisfactory. given the difficulties of transport today, it allows for sufficient treatment even with a few minutes delay on arrival.

all appointments on the hour
first visit allow 1 hour for assessment and treatment
follow up treatments allow 45 minutes
