 painting is cruel exhibition .  paintings: anti-fashion series. 

painting is cruel
glauce cerveira / theo kaccoufa / gerry smith / katie deith
danielle arnaud contemporary art , london, 2005 
painting is cruel refers to a discussion with the artists taking part in this exhibition.â  having chosen to work in a medium loaded with history and excellence, the artists have also to face the whims of trends, the competition of new media and are challenged to convey the contemporary, the social and the political in a medium often considered not suitable for the task.

solo show installation - paintings: anti-fashion series

the things we do for love
glauce cerveira / solo show
gallery 32, brazilian embassy , london, 2005
 i want to create work that is as arrogant as the moment we are living in, but that has the humble docility of eternity. i want to grab and squeeze my thoughts, suspend empathy and become a detached observer of this amazing spectacle that is our time. 
across the spectrum of these works there is a certainty about bringing the subject directly into the viewerâs space. we have to take part; we are not allowed to keep our distance. how this is achieved involves both the language and the mysteries of how paintings work.
cerveira is interested in what lengths we go to in order to feel wanted, special or to be accepted. the paintings ponder the battle between the persona and the self. (....) glauce cerveira turns fashion into subject matter and then uses it as a springboard for questioning contemporary behaviour.
