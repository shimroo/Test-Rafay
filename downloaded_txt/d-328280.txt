karl moore - germany



shootingshooting is the ultimate skill that all players should be highly proficient at. it is a skill that takes proper technique, practiced over and over, to acquire the muscle memory necessary to repeat it with monotonous regularity. if you can’t shoot, you can’t score!there is no reason for any player not to shoot 80+% from the free throw line, provided they have the proper technique and reinforced by repetitive shooting.it is not uncommon for graduates of the basketball workshop to shoot 90% from the free throw line after they were shooting 50% beforehand.

confidencewe expect a 50 to 100% improvement in all our students. as the skill level goes up, the confidence level goes up. they go hand in hand. so when players lack skill, they lack confidence.we specialize in the entire offensive and defensive package which will totally transform the way a player thinks and plays the game. if you are truly on a quest to be the best that you can be, operating at maximum efficiency, you need the basketball workshop.

footworkif you don’t have the proper footwork to perform all the moves necessary against good defense, you’ll never score.you can be the world’s greatest shooter, but if you can’t get open to catch the ball, you’ll never score!you need to obtain the footwork and skills necessary to shoot pull-up jump shots.
