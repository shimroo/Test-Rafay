jesus moves us
to praise, devotion,
and worship.
church of christ/north is a congregation of 
people devoted to the love of the lord.










who we are
church of christ/north is a congregation of people devoted to the love of the lord.
we are a place where those who have been beaten up by the world can find help and hope in their spiritual walk. so many times congregations over-react to situations in the lives of their members, creating trauma and difficulty too great to bear for a person whose faith is faltering. at north, we try desperately to be sensitive to those needs. north is an open church. anyone from anywhere is welcome here. we believe that in time, anyone can recover if they are loved and valued as a person for whom christ died. consequently, doctrinal problems or personal difficulties tend to heal themselves.
