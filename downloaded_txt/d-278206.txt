food blog





i am starting a food blog because i can see myself blogging about more food in the future and i would like to have this blog not turn into a food blog.  it is now called just desserts! but that may change if i think of something cooler.xoxogeorge

cupcake adventure





after coming across this recipe for white chocolate wasabi cupcakes with sake plum filling, i decided to make them. things i learned and experience from this.1) it takes a lot of wasabi powder to make two tablespoons of paste.2) this was my first cake using white chocolate.  white chocolate is very finicky and overheats quickly.3)  this was also my first cake with a recipe calling for more sugar than flour.  the batter was super thick as were the cakes.4) green food dye comes out quickly.5) plum sake is too sweet to cook with. (at least for this recipe)6) these cupcakes taste better the next day.7) filled cupcakes are not as difficult as they look.

thunder snow





we have snow today in the atl.  it started falling this morning and just started accumulating and accumulating.  there is thunder with this snow (also known as thundersnow).  it kind of gives a different feel to the snow because you have the quiet of snow, interrupted by a bout of thunder.  i just hope the snow is off the roads by tomorrow as i have an interview downtown.

37 days





till i leave the island.  it is sad but i do have good news.  my neighbor is leaving the island this month as well.  since the military is paying for him to move and he hasn't used all his allotted space, i am going to put my stuff with his stuff and just pick it up on the mainland.  it will only be a 3 hour drive with a u-haul versus a bunch of $$ spent on shipping.  i'm excited!  this week i will try my hand at eggs benedict.  wish me luck!

turbo!





so i am trying to get super buff before i go to the mainland because i won't have a gym membership, i don't think i will be as inclined to do outside activities like swimming in butt-cold weather, and i would like to have a little physical prowess while i transition.  in order to do this i have started taking free classes at 24hourfitness of which i am a member.  last week i did this thing that was a cross between step and weight-lifting and today i did turbo kickboxing.  the turbo means it is extra hard and the instructor gets extra annoying when you feel like puking.  it was fun though!  hopefully i can find time to do 3 or 4 classes per week.  this way i don't have act all tough to muscle my way onto the machines i like or wait while the most anorexic woman (or smelliest man) in the world gets off the treadmill.  the classes have muscle-y girls (like me!) and good music!

engh...





after being at work over 40hrs/week for the past month i took a long weekend. delicious.  i did lazy stuff and loved it.  the only thing is i've started going to bed earlier and getting up earlier, but i've begun to need a nap in the middle of the day.  odd.  but i got a little bored on the third day.  i played some madlibs with dave and rediscovered the fun that is madlibs.  still hilarious.  i looked up stuffing recipes because that is included in my half of thanksgiving dinner and found this one for fried stuffing on a stick from paula deen.  i played texttwist and made lunch for a week.  i also counted my change and found $6.35 and 3.55 franks and .20 paseta.  bought a diet coke with that then laid out in the sun for an hour.  i can't stay out too long because i got really pale for my halloween costume.  busy day!!!!btw: check out my flickr!!  tons of new photogs!
