welcome
                          to k9 fencing systems.
                          we know how much your pet means to you and your family
                          and we pride ourselves on helping you provide a safer
                          environment for your family friend.
by having us
                          install a fencing system to contain your dog, you will
                          finally have the necessary boundaries he needs to stay in the yard.
                          once your dog learns the boundaries we create, you'll have peace of mind
                          knowing your dog is safe. you and your dog will also have a
                          much better relationship. your dog will be able to go
                          to the bathroom on it's own and get much needed
                          exercise without you worrying about him
                          running away. a containment system
                          installed by k9
                          fencing systems takes the stress and anxiety out
                          of owning a dog.
 
the
                          fencing systems we use are designed to fit any
                          home, whether you own part of an acre or more than
                          twenty, whether you have one dog or many. the system
                          is customized to meet the specific needs of your dog
                          and family. k9 fencing
                          systems combines advanced technology, professional
                          installation and personalized training to keep your
                          dog healthy, happy, and safe. our collars alert your dog with a warning tone
                          and/or vibration when he's
                          approaching the edge of the safe area and backs it up
                          with a mild static correction if your dog continues. this
                          combination helps your pet obey the system boundaries we
                          create and stay in
                          the yard.
 
unlike
                          traditional fencing, our fencing system can also
                          section off and protect a pool, gardens or other
                          landscaping while helping to maintain the beauty and
                          integrity of your property. we can set
                          the boundary for your dog practically anywhere -
                          through uneven terrain, wooded areas or even
                          under water  all at a fraction of the cost of
                          traditional fencing.
 
what's
                          more, your system will be backed by the strongest
                          product warranties and performance guarantees in the
                          industry. we offer a one-year, money-back performance
                          guarantee along with lifetime product warranties on
                          professionally installed outdoor-systems by k9
