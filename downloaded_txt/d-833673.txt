to my fellow parents and educators, 



from one parent to another, and as the creator of kneebouncers.com, i want you to know that our platform is more than just another website – it’s a labor of love dedicated to early learning and fun. 



it started from a personal need – to create a space where little ones could play games without the fuss of a mouse. our small haven has now grown to include over 100 ad-free, engaging games, videos, and worksheets. we believe that children learn best when they’re having fun, and that’s exactly what we’re here to provide. 



by choosing us, you’re not just opting for a safe, educational journey for your child, you’re also supporting a family-owned small business. we’re still a small, passionate team at kneebouncers, and your trust in us means more than you can imagine. thank you for allowing us to be part of your child’s formative years. 



thanks – and keep on kneebouncin’!
