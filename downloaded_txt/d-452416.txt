abortion clinic workers:
could your job land you in jail?









when abortion clinic owners or directors are engaged in illegal activities, it is common for them to lure their employees into participating in these crimes.
they believe that employees who are personally involved in criminal activity will be so frightened about detection and prosecution that they will keep silent. if you are aware of illegal activities in your clinic, you are wise to be concerned about what kind of trouble you might be in, especially if you participated in, covered-up, or in any way facilitated these illegal activities. even if you are not a participant in illegal activity, there are circumstances in which simply having knowledge of a crime and not reporting it is, in itself, a crime.
what to report
if you choose to remain silent, be aware that whether it’s tomorrow, a year from now, or ten years from now, there will probably come a point at which these illegal activities will be discovered by, or revealed to, law enforcement authorities and your silence could result in the authorities prosecuting you as an accomplice.
while there is no guarantee that coming forward will insulate you from prosecution, the law enforcement community knows that they cannot continue to prosecute cases based on inside information if they go after the whistle-blowers who give them that inside information. that reality has caused most of them to adopt the attitude that they will let the little fish go if it helps them catch the big fish. for example, it is common for the police to give immunity to a small-time drug user in return for information about the people supplying the drugs.
if you suspect, have witnessed, or have even participated in illegal activity at an abortion clinic, you may have the ability to become a source of information that the authorities either don’t have or can’t get elsewhere. and that could be the only protection you have against prosecution. understand that timing is crucial in this environment- any information you have is probably known by others as well. if one of these people contacts the authorities first, the value of your information will be greatly diminished, as will your ability to protect yourself against prosecution. our observation has been that if several people in an office have knowledge of illegal activity, the first person to come forward with it is the one who gets protection.
