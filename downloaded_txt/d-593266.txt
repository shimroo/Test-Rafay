kerosene heater information:


          i have had many reports of flame "dwindling" or poor 
          performance of heaters.  this is caused by poor capillary action, 
          the result of water in the fuel: it only takes a teaspoon of 
          accumulated water to saturate the cotton lower portion of a wick.

postage is added per the amount of purchase.  for us 
delivery, up to $9.00* is $4.95; $9.01 to $29.00 is $5.95 - usually two heater 
wicks and an igniter are mailed for a low $5.95 postage. first class (up to 13 
oz) or priority mail. anything over 1/4'' thick must now be sent at the package 
rate, and now all packages weighing 8 ounces or less are the same postage cost.  
it now costs as much to mail a 1/4 ounce igniter as it does a heavy wick!  
i had held the line on what i charged for postage delivery for 10 years but this 
postage increase was just too much and i had no choice but to raise prices. 

to upgrade a wick order from first class to priority mail delivery,

        viet nam, etc. 
                - ''worldwide'' with some obvious and necessary exceptions.  
                i will only mail wicks and other items to countries which have 
                reliable mail delivery.  some countries have a horrible 
                delivery percentage and i will not ''give'' free products to 
                thieving postal and customs employees.  the countries to 
                which i will not mail products include indonesia, india, any 
                persian gulf or middle east country except israel, and no 
                country on the african continent.
international addresses should be coded with latin characters. 
              our labeling system cannot process different encoding like cyril, 
              hebrew, arabic, japanese, chinese, etc.
international postage rates are by blocks or categories of 
              weight, not by the number of items in each package.
            
out of us 
            order - by the weight of the 
            merchandise ordered:  = 1 oz to 8 oz, 9 oz to 2 lbs, 2 to 3 lbs, 
            etc.  the first category is $17.95 to canada, $20.95 to 
              continental europe; oz and nz, $21.95:  often quite 
            a few wicks can fit into a 2 to 3 lb package for canada, $25.95; 
              europe $39.95 and oz, nz $39.95.  inquire, please  
            by email so i can weigh the wicks you want before you place the 
              order.  if using the add-to-cart buttons to order online the 
              automatic postage charge can be higher but i will refund any 
              amount of postage paid above actual cost.




overseas orders are limited to a maximum 
              of
        20 wicks per order (from 1 wick to 20 
              maximum) due to the greatly 
        increased charges for international shipping in effect  you are responsible for any import fees.





          
         
        (additional postage may be required for large orders of
        boxed wicks.)



postage for orders is by the amount of purchase (different for 
        destinations beyond north america

        we sell the best wicks we can find of high quality and value. some wick 
        manufacturers from the past have essentially ceased production
of some styles and types of wicks, such as hattersley.




        i have many rare 
        heater and lamp wicks made for me, and if 
        the demand is too low to have a production run made
        i may make them myself.








email: sorry, the wick shop does not have facilities 
                for walk in clients, but our web site remains open 24/7 to help you.   
                i answer questions as quickly as possible (via e-mail, not telephone) to help with problems.  i ship via usps 
   every day about noon, so even orders received up to 11:00 am pacific time can receive same-day mailing -
    i give you the best possible service i can provide.  if you  have questions about my
     wicks, your heaters or lamps, please e-mail me at 
   miles@milesstair.com - i am your tech support. 
                
if 
                you do not receive a return email it may be because your message 
                was not actually sent to me.  sometimes the web is down and

                return messages do not go through.  an example from

if 
                you have a tightly controlled spam filter and do not make an

"about_us"
  i do not have a store  i just sell online.  ive been selling kerosene 
  products, mostly wicks, since 1997. virtually all of my wicks are made hattersley in england.  wicks are made to 
  my specifications and tested in my own
  extensive collection 
  of heaters, lamps and stoves.i keep all wicks in stock all year for those 
  who want to be prepared for winter in advance.  i ship wicks worldwide 
  and in fact have the best list and selection of wicks for heaters sold in
  
  europe,
  
  australia and scandinavia.  
in 2005 i noticed that except for rayo lamps,
  wicks for center draft 
  lamps had not been made since before ww ii.  i purchased many
  victorian era lamps 
  of various sizes, measured original wicks, tested new wicking for diameter, 
  thickness and capillary action, and had the full range of center draft wicks 
  made by hattersley in england. 



  http://www.milesstair.com/lamp_wicks.html

   

  proper victorian era center draft chimneys had not been manufactured since the 
  depression, so after considerable testing i had the best samples replicated in 
  borosilicate glass.


  http://www.milesstair.com/chimneys.html

   

  many larger sizes of flat wicks for
  european 
  kosmos lamps had also been unobtainable for decades so i had them made by 
  hattersley after testing for weave, thickness and capillary action in my own 
  collection of lamps. 
  
  http://www.milesstair.com/flat_lamp_wicks.html#kosmos

   

  the proper chimneys for many kosmos lamps had also not been made since the 
  1930s, so i  had them made from borosilicate glass.
  
  http://www.milesstair.com/sans_rival_chimney.html

   

  student lamps made from 1875 through ww i did not have good chimneys 
  available, so i had them made.


  http://www.milesstair.com/student_lamp_chimney.html

   

  the old sad iron 
  heaters similarly had not had new wicks available since before ww ii, so 
  after testing thickness, width, and capillary action i also had them made.  
  
  http://www.milesstair.com/flat_lamp_wicks.html#sad_iron
kindler 
  wicking for gravity-fed stoves made by boss, florence and many other 
  stoves from before ww ii had not been readily available so i carry the full 
  line of kindler wicking.

   

  by 2008 i had more information on kerosene stoves, heaters and center draft 
  lamps on this website than all other websites in the world combined and was 
  the largest independent seller of kerosene heater and center draft lamp wicks 
  in the world.we have worked very hard to earn your trust and respect.  
  we still work seven days a week processing orders.  every order is 
  acknowledged upon receipt. all orders are shipped every day except sundays and 
  holidays at noon and delivery information and a tracking number sent to your 
  email address - there are no delays in shipping orders.

9.23.2020 -  hi miles - i just wanted to say my two 
                chimneys arrived with me today in perfect condition and really 
                well packed. thanks so much for taking care to pack them so well 
                and i notice that both the sans rival and neovulcan are both 
                heavy grade glass and beautifully finished. i can't wait to try 
                them out! thanks again!  p. gurr in oz

8.15.2020 - last year i used your site extensively to research buying kero heaters and everything about them.  so thank you !!

                and now that its time to replace the wick on one of course im buying from you vs the stores i bought the heaters from.

good evening miles. the wick i ordered from yourself (paraglo 
                heater) arrived today safe & sound in ireland. i and many others 
                appreciate all you do for the kerosene community. yours 
                thankfully. robert dunne
~~~~~~~~~~
2.13.17.       i would first like to thank you for your 
                wonderful website. thanks to you and your site i have cleaned up 
                an old, over 30 years, toyostove rb-2a kerosene heater that my 
                parents used to use back in the 1980s. i have it working quite 
                fine now. also want to thank you for the wonderful tip about how 
                to get the kerosene smell off of your hands by using cheap 
                shampoo and hand sanitizer. wonderful, works great!  d. 
                chewning, virginia

your wick for my or77 arrived today. super fast service even 
                given the thanksgiving holiday! when i opened the package i 
                could immediately see that your wicks are far far superior to 
                the other 2 purchased online from other vendors that have been 
                total failures. and i do mean total failures. your wick appeared 
                to me to have about double the material in it - especially the 
                fiberglass top ring. so, i installed it in this cute little p. 
                i. t. a. heater. it has never ever worked properly from the day 
                i purchased it brand spanking new. i let the wick stand as 
                installed in the fuel sump for a half hour or 45 minutes then 
                lit her up. surprise! it lit instantly and turned the globe red 
                within a few minutes - no smell, no smoke, no hastle, no pops or 
                whistles. it just burns and burns right.

                so, thank you again for both your website and great information, 
                plus also your very high quality products. funny thing is, your 
                quality wicks are actually no more expensive than the other junk 
                i've been unwittingly buying online from other sources. i wish 
                i'd known about you from the start.

                best wishes, tim i., iowa
~~~~~~~~~

                  miles,

                two piece wick received in good order yesterday. thoroughly 
                cleaned everything including both tanks in advance. wick 
                installed and heat output back to new for 30 plus year old 
                heater.
              

                most amazing part is how freely the mechanism works with the new 
                lower wick (15-2p).

                thanks again for your excellent service and information on web 
                site.

i just wanted to thank you. my success oil lamp is working 
                beautiful thanks to both the information on your site ( on 
                dismantling stuck wicks) along with the new wick and 
                installation sheet. thanks again k. spares, nova scotia.

mr stair- just wanted to send a quick note back to let you 
                know that i received my two wicks and am very happy with the 
                quick shipping as well as with the great quality of the wicks. i 
                have yet to install and burn either, but in comparison with some 
                "home depot" wicks that we've got around here, they seem to be a 
                more high quality product. i must say that i have received hours 
                of enjoyment perusing your site and learning an enormous amount 
                about kerosene appliances. i grew up in a home on long island 
                during the oil crisis of the 1970's-80's where we used a corona 
                22dk every winter for supplemental heat, and i recall as a child 
                being sent out to "the drum"- a 55 gal drum with a petcock 
                cradled in an x-type frame of 2x4's, to fill 5 gal cans almost 
                on a daily basis during the winters. more recently, after 
                hurricane sandy, both my family and my folks were flooded out of 
                our homes, but amazingly i was able to mail order a dura heat 
                heater from northern tool and have it delivered within a day! 
                although there was no gas to be had, i could still get red-dye 
                kero from the pump less than 2 miles from the floodwaters... it 
                certainly helped us to be able to hunker down in our own home, 
                avoid looters and generally made things easier.. so, since then, 
                i've found myself outfitting my family, my folks and a number of 
                friends with kero heaters and lamps that i've been finding on 
                craigslist and at garage sales and fixing up. thanks so much for 
                your exhaustive treatment of the entire "kerosene world" and the 
                information and inspiration that your site has provided to me. 
                sincerely, dr. adrian l., md, ny

miles, i received my wicks today (post office had a delay or 
                they would have been here yesterday). i changed one and noticed 
                immediately the difference in quality. i have used kero world 
                wicks in the past, the last was a total disaster! each time i 
                changed a wick i noticed that it just didn't fit quite right, it 
                took quite a long time to get the wick to lay flat. they just 
                seemed to be a tad too big for the sleeve. the wick i got from 
                you fit perfectly, it was a breeze to change. 

  i am so happy i decided to purchase our wicks from you. the price was hardly 
  any different from the others. i will be purchasing more from you for sure! 
  thank you!

your website is perfect  accurate, precise, informative and truly helpful.
your emails to me after i ordered a wick were clear-cut, with all the tracking numbers and links exact and easy to navigate.
thank you for a great product and great service.  i will not hesitate to recommend you to anyone i know for their kerosene heater parts and supplies.

                    dear miles:

                    i purchased a wick from you last year for a dynaglo heater.  
                    it was becoming tarred,  using your site for advice i 
                    cleaned the wick with needle nose pliers and it runs fine 
                    again.  thank you for your time and effort on your site,  it 
                    is a true resource. god bless.  phil in pa

                  first, your site is great.  (and your passion for "doing 
                  things right" is the reason i purchased wicks through your 
                  company.  anyone with that much passion and dedication is not 
                  doing it for the money.  and the prices are good, too.)  very 
                  informative in many ways and not only regarding kerosene 
                  heaters.  so thanks for that.  doug w. in pa

i just wanted to thank you for incredibly fast service! i 
                ordered these wicks from you on saturday, november 1 (when i 
                received the email from you stating that you had sent them the 
                same day i thought: "hmm... maybe i got him just before he went 
                to the post office" ), and when i went to my mail box today 
                (monday, nov. 3rd) they had already arrived! clear across the 
                country and via usps which is doubly astonishing. again, thank 
                you very much for your excellent service. c. norman, pa

i am in receipt of your mailing of my wick order. thanks! 
                subsequent to my first order from you, i tried other various 
                manufacturer's wicks. all paled by comparison. that is to say 
                the longevity was less, the capillary action 
                (material/construction) measured relative to a digital thermo 
                reading taken @ both the flame and the lantern housing top was 
                less and overall performance was not as great. yours are truly 
                superior. i can say that as a chief engineer with over 35 years 
                experience. i'm a hands on guy who isn't easily impressed.  r.

                hello miles just wanted to say the wick you made for me worked 
                great! i need to get the right chimney for it but i put one on i 
                had for now. here are a few photos of the lamp and it would not 
                be working if not for the wick you made.

that add on little platinum plated screen for the kerosun is 
                amazing.  the fumes have reduced to almost zero.  i bought a new 
                kerosene heater but didnt even open it.  as it appears the old 
                one with a new wick and that screen still works well.  thank you

  miles, once again thank you for shipping my order to me in record time. i will 
  continue to order my lamp and heater supplies from you.  i installed the 
  catalytic filter i recieved from you on my heater.

  also i installed a new wick. what a difference the catalytic filter has made. 
  now when i go in my garage there is no odor as if a kerosene heater is lit. 
  you smell nothing. i think i will order 2 more for my other heaters.  for 
  someone with sinus problems or breathing problems like i have this is the way 
  to go if you have a kerosene heater.   now when our power is out and we need 
  emergency heat in the house i can rely on my kerosene heater to keep us warm.

   thanks, ron m. in hershey, pa

                unbelievable.  the difference between a wick that "fits" and the
                proper wick is simply amazing.  thank you for the great 
                service and offering these great wicks.  brian in

                i received my wick for my sears kerosene heater today thank you. 
                if it shipped any faster i think it would have ignited on its 
                own. i must say i had the hardest time finding a replacement 
                wick for it over the years never finding the perfect wick. well, 
                all that was solved when i came across your website. not only 
                was i confidently able to determine quickly and easily the exact 
                replacement wick for my heater but i also got an education in 
                kerosene heaters from your great website. it was a welcome 
                change to do business with someone that actually cares about 
                their customers and has as much enthusiasm for their products as 
                you do. being a business owner myself that practices this same 
                philosophy i really appreciate it.  mark s., morrisville,

i first discovered your web site a couple of years ago when i 
                was looking for a safe and alternative source of heating, 
                cooking and lighting for my family in the event of an emergent 
                situation. being an avid emergency preparedness buff, i do a lot 
                of research and information seeking on the web. milestair.com is 
                by far the most informative, complete and sound information on 
                kerosene and its uses. you could say i was "converted" to 
                kerosene and using your site as a guide, have purchased three 
                (soon to be four) kerosene heaters, a stove, oven and even a 
                kerosene lamp. i hope i have to never rely on these items as my 
                only source, i like to be prepared as i see an eroding world 
                situation and tyrants running our government and economic 
                machine. not only have i enjoyed the vast information you 
                provide on kerosene heating, it is comforting knowing i have a 
                go-to for all of my kerosene accessory needs from wicks to fuel 
                pumps. any questions i have had (which have been several) have 
                always been answered promptly. i have always been treated 
                respectfully and dealt with honestly. i just can't recommend a 
                better source for my kerosene needs. my wife and i have 
                literally become hooked to our kerosene heaters during the 
                bitter could missouri winters. my wife, who is cold-blooded by 
                nature, can never seem to get warm with our home's furnace. as 
                soon as we light up the kerosene heater, she is happy as can be 
                enjoying the high quality intense "bon fire warmth" the kerosene 
                heaters put out. your site has taught me how to use heaters, 
                maintain them, keep them in tip-top condition just to name a 
                few. i am truly grateful for the quick speed in which my orders 
                arrive. lightening fast always! your honesty and great work 
                ethic are appreciated! you have provided a wonderful service for 
                our family and for that we are very thankful!   adam

thank you so very much for your impossibly prompt service in 
                filling my order for a wick for my kerosene heater! i have been 
                dealing with mail order businesses for years now -- i haven't 
                left my home in over ten years -- but i have never seen such 
                remarkably fast service. i reside on ten acres of woodland in 
                very rural ohio, yet my wick arrived in two days without my 
                having to pay extra for your service. temperatures have been 
                dipping below freezing around here.... 
                your service is truly fantastic! thank you.  michael h.,

you do not receive enough positive feedback on how wonderful 
                your site is.  i have been looking for a new wick for my kero-sun 
                moonlighter for two years.  i bought the heater in 1980 and have 
                not used it since 1985.  shopping at big box stores and small 
                hardware stores for a replacement wick was useless.  i didn't 
                have enough information about my heater to be able to choose the 
                correct wick by simply reading the information on the packages.  
                however, your site showed me pictures, had the owner's manual 
                and carefully explained the different model numbers and types of 
                wicks.  i just ordered the wick today and i'm confident that 
                when it comes it will be the correct wick and will light my 
                stove with the loving glow it had 30 years ago.  thanks again.

                      and now firefighting, circles to you for for what you

thanks for the fast service on

                      considering any kerosene stove, heater or lamp look at 
                      this website. instructions on use, care and maintenance 
                      are invaluable and free. this has been a great help to me

                        dear miles,

                          i purchased two wicks from you for my kero world 
                        heater and my what a difference.  yours burn better than 
                        those i used to buy at the wal mart.

                        my old wicks i would have had to burn dry twice now 
                        since i installed them, but i haven't burned this wick 
                        dry yet because i haven't needed too.  

                        great products that i will be purchasing from you here 
                        out.  many thanks!

                                on saturday and on tuesday i have them in my hands!

                                thanks! the product is a perfect match/fit and at a great price to boot!

that was 
quick delivery  my order arrived yesterday!  
                       im writing today because i had some time to fit the new wicks into my lamps 
                       this afternoon.
this is my 
   second order from you and im very, very pleased.  i had trouble finding the right wick for an older b&h,
    but the one i got from you fits and works perfectly.  thanks to your descriptions 
   that include both dimensions and make/model references, i confidently bought wicks for a pittsburgh success and p&a.  
   maybe 100 years ago when these lamps were in common use, everyone 
   knew how to fit and trim a wick and what kind of fuel to use.  with your helpful advice, im putting my lamps to use
    fully confident that im doing it right.
 regards,
dorsey, in n.j.

my husband didnt find his much needed wicks locally, so i found your site on
                     the web when i searched for kerosun omni 15 wicks.didnt know how long it would take to receive them, but we got them from oregon to indiana in less 
than 48 hours from the time we ordered them!
   reasonable price, reasonable shipping, outstanding service!!! thank you so very much!

i ordered my wicks and igniter on 11/22/08 
                      and received today 11/24.  first of all, thank you for the 
                      super fast delivery, i am truely impressed and shocked 
                      that such service still exists for online businesses.  

                      i have been purchasing wicks for my dura heat kerosene 
                      heater from a large local retailer since they were cheaper 
                      and carried the same wick as 3 other retailers in my 
                      area.  i have "burned up" 2 of their wicks in just under 6 
                      weeks.  the wicks burn up so fast while never operating 
                      properly from first installation.  the height adjustment 
                      was always sticking, especially  when pressing the knob to 
                      "turn off" the heater. it never once went completely down 
                      on either wick (nor could i get it to go any lower) 
                      causing the wick to burn for about 30 - 60 seconds before 
                      going out completely.  after only 3 or 4 burns on the new 
                      wick, it was a major chore to get the wick to even raise 
                      without catching on something whether due to the soiled 
                      wick or bad fit.  the first time i used up a wick, i 
                      thought it was something i had done wrong... whether it 
                      was the installation (even though it was a pinned wick) or 
                      the wick height while burning.  i looked into the problem 
                      online and was reassured i was following proper methods 
                      for installation and burning.  i found your site in my 
                      research and read about the fiberglass top and cotton 
                      bottom wicks.  since i had "burned up" the other wicks so 
                      fast, i was sold when i read about the nonburning 
                      fiberglass. 

                       i was truely impressed with wicks when i took them out of 
                      the package.  the superior quality was obvious as soon as 
                      i put it in my hands.  after getting the new wick 
                      installed (exactly the same as the other wicks i 
                      installed) it worked flawlessly.  no hanging or sticking 
                      and when i lit it for the first time, it was very clear 
                      that i made the right choice purchasing from you.  i am 
                      generating a very noticable amount of more heat with the 
                      new wick which will save me money.  

                      thank you for your service!  you have not only earned my 
                      lifelong loyalty as a customer, but all my high 
                      recommendations to anyone i talk to that would need your 
                      items.  i appologize for the long email.  i am hoping that 
                      it may help people in the future that come to you and your 
                      website and have any doubts that your products are any 
                      different than anything else that they have tried.  i look 
                      forward to doing business with you again.  thanks again.

i recently 
                    purchased a new wick for my old kerosene heater and one of 
                    the catalytic burners, let me tell you that i could notice 
                    as soon as i looked at the wick that it was far superior to 
                    any i had seen in the big box stores. i installed the wick 
                    just as the instructions said and installed the catalytic 
                    burner as well. the first time i fired up the heater there 
                    was a major difference in how it burned and how it smelled 
                    (there was none). i have read your site all the way through 
                    and will  only use you from now on  with all my kerosene 
                    heater needs. david a, maryland

miles~  the wicks were correct and no problems 
                installing them. the instructions were very, very explicit and 
                detailed. i read them through once to get the general idea, then 
                took each step one by one to replace the old one. took about 15 
                minutes without any problems.. thanks again and you have a very 
                fruitful new year, .....................john m in california

hi, i recently purchased one of these heaters, the wick that 
                came installed with the unit was virtually worthless ! had to 
                raise it daily, take apart and reinstall it higher every three 
                or four days,. it just kept burning away. i recently purchased 
                several replacement wicks from you, installed one in the heater, 
                and it now burns flawlessly, no more daily adjustment, no more 
                taking it apart to raise the wick. i don`t know if it`s possible 
                to make people aware of this in todays legal climate, (lawsuits, 
                etc.). just wanted to let you knqw that you ara 100% percent 
                right when you state all wicks are not created equally. i`ve 
                been running various kero sun heaters (stating in the fall and 
                burning continuously) for the entire winter (long and cold) for 
                at least fifteen years, in northern new york. this heater works 
                great ! just thought i`d pass along the info.
                thank`s t. o`d,  upstate new york

i just wanted to send off a quick note to say thank-you for 
                the promp service. i ordered a new wick on sunday and it arrived 
                on wednesday. that is quicker than i could have had a store 
                order it for me and without the hassle. thanks again and have a 
                great day.  sherry (iowa)

miles:  you are amazing!  
                    order in to oregon saturday, packaged and shipped same
day, received in atlanta monday.  that is very fast service!  even more
surprising is the fact that the usps does have a priority mail service!

i really like the battery powered fuel pump, i wish i had made this purchase
three months ago.  it is a must for anyone charged with the chore of fueling
kerosene heaters.

miles,

                merry christmas! i ordered two wicks from you for my corona dk23 
                - an absolutely perfect fit. after wasting my hard-earned cash 
                at home depot and lowes for wicks that should have fit but 
                didn't, i stumbled upon your web site and i'm sure glad i did. i 
                spent two hours trying to jam a wick in my dk23, i was covered 
                with k1 and aggravated like you wouldn't believe. i tossed it in 
                the garbage in disgust. maybe that was a godsend, as it probably 
                would have been dangerous if i had managed to make it fit.

                your wicks came this afternoon, and i really appreciated the 
                instructions for the dk23 that came with the wick. it took me 
                ten minutes and most of that was just cleaning things up. i hope 
                you stay in business for a l-o-n-g time, and i can guarantee 
                that you'll get my business in the future. my regular heating 
                system is electric, and you can never guarantee that the juice 
                will be there when you need it. the 23dk can heat my entire 
                house, and it's not a small house. even the folks who have oil 
                aren't safe - if the electric goes, the blowers are inoperative. 
                kerosene isn't cheap this year, but the dk23 puts out a lot of 
                heat, and we love it. i feel much better now that i don't have 
                to worry about where the wicks are coming from. 

                and... your web site is wonderful and informative. feel free to 
                use me as a reference - a very satisfied customer. thanks again 
                for your great service. peace to you in this christmas season 
                and our best for a prosperous and healthy 2006.

my wicks arrived today and i installed one in about 30 
                minutes . . . the instructions were very clear and 
                easy-to-follow. now my heater is burning brightly and more 
                cleanly than it has in years. i was surprised how badly the old 
                wick looked when i removed it. many thanks for your swift and 
                courteous service.

                sincerely, richard

thanks so much for the help. i have the order form and a 
                check in the mail heading your way. i went to every hardware 
                store within 100 miles of my house and nobody had a clue about 
                what i needed. it's nice to know someone out there is willing to 
                help. thanks again! robert

hi miles: the wick for my perfection 500 arrived yesterday. i 
                installed it this morning and it works perfect! i think the 
                problem with the keroworld wick was due to the thin construction 
                also since there was air space between the wick and brass guide 
                walls that allowed kerosene vapors through after warm up causing 
                flare up and smoke. thanks again.... greg....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
thank you very much for the reply. it's nice to know there 
                are still people willing to help others out when they have 
                questions. this weekend i'll have to look into raising the wick 
                as you suggested. thank you again for all your help and all the 
                great information you provide to all of us. and you'll be 
                hearing from me soon, as i'll need to order some wicks so i have 
                replacements on hand.  chris
