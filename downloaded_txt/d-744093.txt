travis biehn wins on appeal





travis biehn, the newfoundland-born teenager who was convicted in pennsylvania last year  of making a bomb threat against his school and possessing explosives,  has won his appeal. biehn's conviction was overturned last month, and  the da has not filed a counter-appeal.

travis emailed me last  week to let me know that common sense had prevailed, and earlier this  week he emailed me a link to the text of his appeal, which unfortunately  has gone dead, so i can't link to it here.

to summarize, the  appeal court reached the same conclusion that any reasonable person  would: the evidence against biehn was insufficient to warrant a  conviction.

biehn was originally convicted of making a bomb  threat, but there was absolutely no evidence that he had made the  threat. in fact, he was one of two students who reported the threat, and  the teacher's aide to whom he reported it did not take it seriously  enough to take it any further.

he was also convicted of  possessing bomb-making materials, which, at the time, i erroneously  wrote was more or less a slam-dunk. i was trying to take the most  balanced view that i could, but i was wrong. in fact, under pennsylvania  law, it is only an offence to possess bomb-making materials if you have  the intent to commit a crime with them. and of course, the da had no  evidence whatsoever that biehn had any such intent. on the contrary, the  evidence showed that biehn had legal purposes for the materials.

the  da's argument was essentially circular: biehn must have made the  threat, because he possessed explosive materials, and he must have had  criminal intent, because he made the threat. the only "evidence"  supporting either charge was the existence of the other charge, and  biehn was convicted based on innuendo. the second charge, of possessing  explosives, is a felony.

the appeals court drew the obvious  conclusion, the conclusion that the trial judge should have drawn, and  overturned the convictions.

congratulations, travis. reason has finally won the day.

from  canadian newspapers and television, which treated biehn's conviction as  a major story, there has not been one peep. consequently, a google  search on biehn's name won't find that his name was cleared. the media  is good at reporting stories, but is usually piss-poor at correcting  them, or following them up months after the fact. if travis biehn's  original conviction was big news, then the fact that it was overturned  is equally important. but that sound you hear is, as the song says, the  sound of silence.

before we start waxing triumphant about the  world o' blogs, let me direct you to the trenchcoat chronicles, which  has reacted to news of the appeal by insisting that the trial judge was right all along. that would be the much-touted "self-correcting nature of the blogosphere" at work, folks.

the really important thing, when you're running a single-issue blog like the trenchcoat chronicles, dedicated to the proposition that schools are filled with out-of-control, dangerous kids, is never to admit that you could be wrong. because it's hard to piss your pants if you let go of fear.

fear  is what this whole sorry story is about. biehn was charged, in the  absence of evidence, because of fear. he was convicted, based on  innuendo, in a climate of fear.  his conviction became news touted by a media that acts to magnify that  fear, and commented on by bloggers who were, by and large, too busy  pissing themselves to use their brains.

the results is that  whenever anyone googles travis's name, they'll find a pile of hysteria  suggesting that he was once a mad bomber.

that's the crime here.

life is not baseball





in baseball, it's three strikes, and you're a complete and worthless moron who is chased out of town by rabid dogs and sportswriters.

in life, you get to reiterate the same dumb bullshit a fourth time. in fact, you get to keep repeating it for as long as you can find people dumb enough to listen.

yes, it's a terrorist strike on tim hortons ... again.

yer daily paranoia





now that the conservatives are in power, everything is messed up here in the world o' blogs. somebody has to post paranoid conspiracy theories and similar drivel, and angry in the great white north is too busy being a martyr. where will you get your daily dose of wild, unsupported and unsupportable speculation? what's a wingnut to do?

gentle reader, we at the wonderdog institute for the politically insane have heard the call, and we are on the job. which brings me to yesterday's diplomatic crisis, in which canada and the united states nearly came to stern finger-wagging over arctic sovereignty.

it is tempting to observe that angry speculated at length over the possibility  of armed conflict between canada and denmark over hans island, but has  yet to make a peep over the possibility that we might invade the united  states and teach them a lesson they won't soon stop giggling over. but i  digress. again. which i do a lot, these days, as i am now digressing on  the subject of digression. dammit! stop typing!

where was i? ah, yes....

does  anyone recall our last spat with the us over the arctic? it occurred in  1985, when they sent a coast guard icebreaker called the polar sea through the northwest passage without asking nicely.

does anyone recall who was in power down there? a republican president named ronald reagan.

does anyone recall who was in power up here? a conservative prime minister named brian mulroney.

does anyone recall what their relationship was like? downright cuddly, by the standards of the day. they used to sit around, get plastered, and sing old irish drinking songs  together for the benefit of the cameras, although reagan often had  difficulty remembering the words. mulroney, for his part, had a hard  time saying "shamrock shummit, or shummit like that" as the evening  progressed.

every time we've had a conservative pm over the past 30 years, the americans have challenged our sovereignty in the arctic.

coincidence? you'd like to think so, wouldn't you?

what secret messages have the conservatives been sending to washington? what military threats  have they made? i can't tell you, as i'm busy hiding in the closet for  fear of the blueshirts. i may not get to finish this post before they  come to get me.

as a matter of fact, i hope i don't get to finish  it, as i'll only end up writing something relatively sane. i might  point out, for example, that standing up for canada over arctic  sovereignty is something of a red herring when the real issues in our  relationship with the us involve the privacy of canadians, that security  perimeter, and so on.

and where's the fun in that?

hide the razor blades





maybe  santa claus wants hans island, too. whatever the reason, canada must  have really pissed him off, and in retaliation he's giving us this for christmas: one of these two men will be our next prime minister.

that's the bad news; the good news is that the other one will be finished in politics.

paul  martin is leading in the polls, though not by much, and he may just be  able to pull off a second term. his strongest ally is stephen harper,  whose tin ear for politics, utter lack of charisma, and inability to  connect with the public resulted in his squandering a commanding lead in  the polls in a mini-campaign swing through ontario this spring. no  canadian politician has demonstrated harper's ability to repel voters.

yes, with stephen harper on his side, paul martin just might win this thing.

stephen  harper enters the campaign as the underdog, but his strong campaign  team includes such allies as paul martin. martin, during his short term  in office, has developed an international reputation as an ineffectual  ditherer. he's had over a year to prove himself to voters, and yet  nobody in this country -- including paul martin -- actually knows who he  is and what he stands for.

yes, with paul martin pulling for him, stephen harper may just become our next prime minister.

that,  my fellow canadians, is the reality that faces our sorry nation. if,  thanks to a steady diet of happy pills, you fail to see just how foul  our future appears, consider our recent history.

pierre trudeau,  love him or hate him, was not lacking in vision. his vision of canada  made a mark on our country, whether you call it canada or trudeaupia.

brian  mulroney, whatever his myriad faults, had a vision of his own, and he  was not afraid to destroy his career, his party, or his country to  pursue it. so he did.

jean chretien, finally, had a ... no, on  the other hand, he seems not to have had any vision at all. what he did  have, however, was the common touch. he may have been a thug, a weasel,  and a slimeball, but he could connect with canadians and make them  believe that thuggery, weaselhood, and slimeballitude were reasonable  traits that, you know, a reasonable person would have. and that, ladies  and gentlemen, is the politician's art.

what choice faces us today?

on  the one hand, paul martin, who is so lacking in vision that a staff of  seeing-eye dogs must lead him from one ineffectual wafflefest to the  next.

exactly what the hell is paul martin's vision for our fair  nation? nobody knows. the odds at this point are on "none," for pauly  has had over a year to demonstrate vision and has thus far come up with  diddleysquat.

all paul martin's government has proven itself to  be good at is the game of parliamentary procedure. it may come as a  shock to some of his supporters to learn this, but that doesn't impress  the public much. it's the equivalent to saying, "buy this car because  i'm a good salesman," or "vote for me, i'm sneakier than him."

the  best thing he has to offer -- and make no mistake, this was the main  selling point that won him the last election -- is that he is not  stephen harper.

on the other hand, we have stephen harper.  stephen harper and the conservatives, whatever their faults, are not  lacking in vision. unfortunately for him, they've told us about their  vision for canada, and many canadians aren't impressed. a lot of people  think it sucks.

that leaves harper to flounder about trying to  convince people that he's actually the new, improved stephen harper  leading the new, improved conservatives, and that he really does love  this second-tier socialistic country just the way it is. yes, harper has  a new vision for canada that isn't utterly repellent. he's just  reluctant to tell us what that vision actually is.

so far, the  little detail that the conservatives have provided, is, well, similar to  harper's portrait of a tree in the photo above. it's crudely painted  with a broad brush and utterly lacking in detail, but at least it  matches his tie.

and at least it's not a corrupt, liberal tree!  in other words: "this car may be a lemon, but the price is fair -- you  should buy it!"

face it: the best thing stephen harper has to  offer -- and make no mistake, this is the point that has hobbled martin  with a weak minority -- is that he is not paul martin.

welcome to  the new canada. and please hand over your belts, ties, sharp  implements, and anything else with which you may injure yourselves. it's  going to be a long, dark ride.

a done deal done





i already said my bit, but i'm a long-winded type, so....

let  me say that i'm proud of canada for passing this legislation, and  acting as a leader. i hope that other nations will follow suit.

let  me say that i am happy, after all those people harmed and lives ruined  by prejudice that canada has eliminated one of the last legal obstacles  to equality fo homosexuals. we've come a long way.

let me say  that i will be proud, when my grandchildren are learning history, to  tell them that i was not among those sending the black folk to the back  of the bus. history will regard this one as a no-brainer, as we now see  the civil rights fight in the states.

let me say that in a time  when gay men are still beaten up for being gay men, we still have work  to do as a society - just as racism is still with us.

i think that's about it.

update: one-trick  pony peter rempel, ambassador of conservative maturity, reaches deep  into his bag of rhetorical tricks and pulls out, well, his usual bullshit. why peter uses such a large bag to store a such a small trick, nobody knows, but i'm sure it impresses someone.

interestingly,  i never did conflate same-sex marriage and gay bashing, as peter  claims. he's apparently unable to understand that one can point out that  gay-bashing is an ongoing problem simply to point out that gay-bashing  is an ongoing problem. and while some of us apparently think (and in  peter's case, i know that's a stretch, but bear with me) that  gay-bashing is just a problem for the police, it does indicate that our  society is not as tolerant as we might like to think - unless, of  course, you believe that these crimes are all committed by visitors from  mars.

peter claims that it is possible to oppose same-sex  marriage on rational grounds. as risible as the notion of a rational  rempel is, i'd love to read those grounds. we've heard it all before, of  course, but i think there's a good deal of humour to be derived from  peter's floundering attempts to write rationally.

so go ahead, peter: try to think. keep a bucket of water handy to cool your brain.
