dr alberto francesco anfossi, secretary general, compagnia di san paolothe quality of the process implemented by esf and the evaluation reports produced (work upstream of the final selection by the permanent commission of the regional council) contributed to a large extent to the success of the implementation of this new harmonised mechanism at the grand est region level. esf perfectly adapted to the specificities of the mission during which it demonstrated professionalism, responsiveness, and fairness in the processing of projects. it is important to remember that the deadlines were particularly tight. the schedule was respected and thanks to the reactivity and the involvement of the team, the evaluations were given to the region ahead of schedule. finally, i would also like to emphasise the quality of the team assigned to the management of the project, highly professional and qualified. the region is fully satisfied with the service provided by esf and warmly thanks them for the work performed.christophe sagnier, research & innovation regional direction, grand est region, france“esf’s multi-disciplinary expertise and robust processes have proven instrumental in designing and managing competitive calls and evaluations for our research programmes, in particular our axa post-doctoral fellowships. esf has also supported an impact assessment of axa’s philanthropic research programmes including a career tracking pilot. we are looking forward to expanding our strategic partnership with esf in order to increase the effectiveness of our funding towards academic institutions and researchers in europe as well as in other regions such as asia, africa and latin america”.
