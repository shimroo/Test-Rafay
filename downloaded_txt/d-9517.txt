        presented by dr. andrew weeks, this talk attempts to provide practical and accessible information about why we form habits and often behave in automatic ways. whether you are worried that you are spending too much time on your phone or are struggling with drug use, this talk provides you with an understanding of how the brain changes when these habits form, what keeps them going, and what you might try if you want to make a change.
