	 epilogue
    


i spoke to carlos last night.  he asked how i'm liking ia.  i told him i love it here.  he said he didn't like it when he lived here because there's not much to do as far as "going out".  i told him i outgrew that phase a while back.  he said he hadn't been going out much here for a while and then had to recant that when he mentioned his friend's family being in town.  he reiterated that ia is just not the place for him.  "i know," i said while thinking, "that's one of the reasons i moved here."i asked if he missed me yet.   "do i miss you? of course i miss you.  you've been gone a while," he replied with a melancholy tone.  "it's only been a month," i said.  "has it?" he thought to himself.i told him i'll be down in no visiting at the end of next month.  he asked specifically which weekend & if there was something going on.  i told him there didn't need to be anything going on (uh, didn't i just say i'm over the whole going out thing?!).  he asked what i'd be doing & i told him i'd be visiting friends & checking on my friend from brazil.  after a few awkward moments and several long pauses, he was ready to get off the phone.  we said our goodbyes and hung up.with that, i feel completely free of him.  moving to ia has been a very good thing.  i'm finally feeling the healing.

	 moving on...underground
    


i've completed my move to ia, including a move to a new blog. i've decided to leave la (and all the bad stuff) behind.  since i'm cutting ties with bad associations, the new blog will not be available to negative people.  interested parties can email me for the "underground" blog address.

	 from party girl to professional woman
    


i finished with my last going away party at sailfish this evening. it was the perfect close to the series of reluctantly organized (and i was the reluctant guest of honor) going away functions. my boss obviously spent (at the most) about 5 minutes on my presentation. there were more folks than the room could accommodate, which he realized with heads poking in the door but too polite to come in while i was nervously giving my going away speech. i later learned that he then leaned over to his aa and said, "we needed a bigger room!" funny how people have under estimated my impact...or how many people are interested in seeing me before they think i'll tank. marcelle was the only one who had a heartfelt story to tell, referring to how i took her in after katrina & treated her like family. nice. wasn't she the one who forgot my kid at aftercare...3 times?unfortunately, my boss showed up at my going away after party at sailfish, leaving me feeling uncomfortable when i was trying to drink & pump people for information. thankfully, he lingered at the other end of the bar with carlos (it ended up turning into sja corner). i was glad i didn't have to talk to either of them. carlos had slithered up behind brian at the work function and forced a hug. that was just nifty after brian had faked a friendly hug as well. i was glad b. didn't bother to come to the bar (he's always kept his superficial friendliness confined within the walls of work), since i had to suffer through the awkward & unnecessary overly final forced goodbye "hug" from carlos. that should be the last time i hear from him.i'm ready to move to ia with my focus clear: family, career, & my health. i now see how much of a circus freak i was to the folks in la, and i hope they've enjoyed my entertainment as the party girl. they've promised to tell stories about me after i'm gone (i can only imagine), but that's the thing about me...i can't change what i've done, but i can change who i am. and only my true friends stick by me before, during, & after the metamorphasis.

	 peace via disclosure
    


i just finished a long, intimate conversation with carlos. i told him that i now understand why he came into my life (to help me work out my issues with my father) and that i don't blame him for the way he treated me all these years. "so there is some good in knowing me?" he said sarcastically. i told him that he was {essentially} who the universe had sent to me for me to be able to work out my daddy issues of relationships with emotionally unavailable men. he was his typical self (uncomfortable with intimacy) and tried a couple of times to dismiss my feelings, but i didn't let him. at the end of all this disclosure, i felt the peace i've been needing for such a long time. his only response was, "just as long as you don't end up as my boss!""i feel the same way!" i replied. i assured him that it was unlikely that we'd ever end up working for one another since he's in manufacturing & i'm in es&h. he said it was possible since we work for the same company. i'm going to go on my faith in god that it won't happen.as he was preparing to leave, he said he'd see me again before shorty & i depart."i don't think there's anything else left to say except good-bye," i stated.he lingered for a hug...i gave him a non-emotional one and he left.my girlfriend in fl once told me, "people come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime." i now know the reason for carlos in my life, and his season just ended. the thing is, when it comes to the ideas in the celestine prophecy, i was in his life for some reason, season, or lifetime as well. i'm finished. i'm not sure he is. either way, i'm at peace with my time in no...which brings me back to italy.when espen (the norwegian) and i left the little spot in rome where we shared a bottle of wine as i poured out my heart to him, we were so giddy in the peace that we felt through spiritual intimacy that we didn't know where we were going.me: "i don't even know what street we're on!"espen: "i bet it's via something!"i know geographically where i'm going in ia, but only god knows where i'm going spiritually.

	 all that you left behind
    


as i walk through my home which is now filled with boxes, the memories are starting to come back.  the finality of the move is starting to hit me and as marcelle noted earlier today, i have mixed emotions.  i'm excited about the opportunity for change in my life (both professional & personal), and the culture change for shorty.  i'm sad that i've no true friends outside of work to say goodbye to...and maybe only 1 or 2 there.  i'm sad that i had to live here through katrina, but glad that i've have so many good memories from both before & after the storm.  i'm saddest of all that i spent so much time in a relationship that was unhealthy for me that it pollutes much of my memories of here.  and i'm not sure if there's any way to resolve all those feelings so i don't bring them with me.  either way, tonight is my last night in this house, and i've got to find a way to let the pain be all that i've left behind.

	 surrender - or not
    


carlos called again several times yesterday.  at one point in the conversation he mentioned new year's."if you're in chicago for new year's, give me a call.  i love chicago!" he said."i don't know, carlos. i don't know that we'll be able to be friends considering everything that's happened," i said, feeling defeated. had i really been that naive for so long? "it'll be extremely difficult for me.""extremely difficult, but not impossible," he said, trying to trump me. "all i'm saying is, if you're in chicago for new year's, marcelle & i will be there. by the way, is she watching the world cup game at your house tomorrow?""yes," i replied.  "why?""oh great, i'm coming with her then. she mentioned in our staff meeting that she was watching the game locally tomorrow, so i'm coming over.""uh, did it ever occur to you that she and i may have had plans?!"  i exclaimed."oh, maybe you're right!" he said.  "well, i'm still coming over."i think it's time i stood up for myself, put my foot down, and told him no. if it takes embarrassing him in front of his boss & one of my closest friends, that may be what i have to do.

in light of warren buffet's donation, i was reminded of bono's non-prof. i've already taken steps 1-4, and i'm planning on taking step 5 once i get settled in our new spot.  this just reminds me of what i really want to be doing with my life, as opposed to maintaining my status as the patron saint of emotionally unavailable men.  i think i'll leave that invisible title here in no since i left my halo on some jack@$$'s bedpost.  i can be much more effective if i put my thinking to better use...i'm thinking about how i can help make the world a little bit better than it was when i came into it.

shorty came home today (yeah!) and we spent the afternoon watching guess who, being us. after the movie i went for a power walk, thankful that i didn't call carlos about our private going away dinner which he obviously forgot. once i came home and took a cold shower (damn it's hot outside!), we headed out to meet marcelle (my friend from brazil), her non-boyfriend, and other folks for dinner at sake cafe. while we were waiting for marcelle to arrive, g. (the new cost accountant) said, "oh, there's carlos!" i rolled my eyes, thinking, "he is like f*cking herpes...he just keeps showing up!"after we seated ourselves, i excused myself by saying, "i need to go to the bathroom," and immediately called my prayer partner from the ladies room. i told her the situation, including my eye rolling exercise when i saw carlos making his way to the front door of the restaurant."you can do this," she said."you're the woman!"  she said, " don't let him get to you!  you put your bra on one cup at a time!""actually, i put my bra on both cups at a time," i responded.she laughed and said, "wow! you're good! but don't let him get to you...just go in there and be you! it's just for a few more days..."when i returned to the table, marcelle had arrived with marcos (her non-boyfriend) and the seating arrangements had been conveniently changed to sandwich me between carlos & shorty. i got through dinner by correcting shorty's etiquette and cordially dealing with carlos' requests for condiments.the group said goodbyes to one another outside the restaurant and i purposely neglected to give g. & carlos any affection thinking, "any 25 year old who says, 'eatin' ain't cheatin'!' and is probably going to naively become carlos' new bitch doesn't need a hug from me!" everyone made their way to their cars...except carlos. instead, he followed us to my car."alright, njeri," he hesitantly said."alright, carlos," i disaffectedly replied."is that your car?  i don't know njeri, i think you might have taken out that pole," he commented."did i?" i uncaringly replied.  "no.  i just got the cone.  it's plastic, so it's no big deal.""oh yeah.  that's true," he said, lingering next to my door as i slid into the driver's seat."i never said i was a good driver," i stated, wishing i had a bottle of blink-be-gone to make him disappear. i knew he was waiting for me to give him a hug, or ask him to come over, or ask him why he didn't call me back the other night, or any other myriad things that would continue the game we've been playing...but i didn't. i just got in the car and drove home.i know it's up to me to sever the ties that bind us together, and i'm doing everything i can to hold myself together with grace and dignity as i leave this pitiful relationship. by being a mature lady through dinner, i've set a new standard for what our interactions will be in the future: he can linger all he wants, but i'm still moving on without him.

	 r-e-s-p-e-c-t
    


the young black folks from work threw their "going away" dinner party for me on friday evening. i wasn't really inclined to go since these functions are like attending your own funeral, but since i was the guest of honor, i humored them. as soon as i arrived, i scoped out the waiting area and chose to sit next to d. who'd arranged the function as opposed to next to carlos. when we moved over to the grill table (we were at shogun), carlos & i ended up sitting on opposite ends, but he planted himself right next to the "new" cost accountant. the two of them then proceeded to flirt with each other for the rest of the evening.after dinner, we went back to d's apartment and played cards until the rain stopped. they coaxed me into my swimsuit and then out to the pool for a late evening swim. carlos continued flirting with the cost accountant, including pinching and playful splashing in the pool. the worst part was that she flirted back. i had to sit there and watch this the whole time because the get together was for me. on top of it, carlos pretty much ignored me for the duration of the evening which simply made it worse.when i just couldn't stand any more, i collected my things so i could leave. i took the half empty 6 pack of heine's and started out the door. carlos asked if he could have one & i ignored him, but being the sja that he is, he persisted."come on, you can't take all the beer!  if you didn't bring any, you can't take any!  don't you know the manlaws?!" he exclaimed."last time i checked, i wasn't a man," i retorted & headed for the door."come on, just give him one," d said, reaching for the beer in my hand."if carlos can't return phone calls, then carlos can't have beer," i stated.  "y'all have a great evening!" i said."oh, so now it's personal," carlos said, while i turned to exit.as i closed the door behind me i heard d say, "now carlos, why you didn't walk that girl to her car?!" but i just kept walking. i didn't want to let on for all these clueless 20 somethings the turmoil that had been brewing without their knowledge. as i was making my way across the parking lot, the younger engineer came running out and yelled, "i was told to walk you to your car!" "that's okay...i'm fine.  you have a great evening," i said with a tired voice.  i got in my car and headed home.i was so upset by the whole evening that i called my prayer partner to share my feelings about the event.  i told her that it's so obvious to me that he's working on the cost accountant as my replacement.  "he couldn't even wait until i left town!"  i ranted for the duration of the 15 minute drive home about the ordeal."are you home now?" she asked."yes," i replied as i closed the car door."can i ask you a question?" she calmly asked."sure," i said."are you still going to dinner with this fool tomorrow evening?" she flatly asked."i don't think we're going to dinner," i replied.when my other girlfriend, serena asked me that same question yesterday afternoon, i told her i didn't think i was going."why would you go to dinner with him after he flirted with g. right in front of you?" she said.long story short, i didn't go to dinner with him.  i really thought about everything and what my tech friend carol said to me the last time we got together, "it's like battered woman syndrome."  in retrospect, it is emotionally battered woman's syndrome.  i have little (if any) respect for carlos now because he's been abusing me for 8 years.  someone like that doesn't deserve respect until they get professional help and truly change which he's obviously not doing since he's working on a new bitch.  but that's not my problem.  all i have to do is respect myself.

	 what's what
    


i was watching the today show this morning and was a little taken aback when i saw that the  miami cell of moorish american radical black muslims had been exposed for their plot to blow up buildings on us soil. the only reason this had any significance for me was because my ex-husband is a member (or at least was when we were together) a member of this group. seeing it on the news at 7:01 am took me back to my college days when my ex-husband used to talk about "the revolution", but worse, had me brainwashed to believe this was a good idea (when i thought i was beginning to understand what's what). with my son's upcoming trip to la in the balance, i called my best friend (who used to live with us) to get her opinion on the situation.when i asked her if she had seen the news, she told me she'd seen snipets of the story and thought it was crazy. she asked me if my ex still thought like that. i said, "well, shortly after 9/11 i talked to him and he said, 'america got what they deserved...' after which i couldn't talk to him any more because to me...it was just wrong! i don't care if you think western society is evil...you don't kill thousands of innocent people!" i told her that it concerns me that every time my son goes to la to visit his father, he is being programmed to think like these people. "he's got shorty saying, 'when i grow up, i'm going to be in my dad's army,' referring to his crazy group!" now that i'm beginning to understand "what's what", i'm not inclined to let my son be led in the wrong direction."wow," she said, "my 20 year old mind can understand it, but my 32 year old mind just doesn't get it!" [i'm paraphrasing]. i tolded her that in light of the crazy ideas being shared, i'm not sure i should still send my son to la to visit his dad this summer. we batted the idea around for a while and she finally said, "well, he is the boy's father..." i'm still not sure what i'm going to do. to me, it's just amazing how time can change one's perspective. i just pray that i can keep my son safe long enough for him to figure out what's what on his own.
