all earrings you see here are only $5.00ea or 5 for $20.00.i mostly use sterling silver ear wire, however, if you like the 'yellow gold' look better, i can make any designs using gold plated ear wire.i can also make any of the earring desings into necklaces.  i use 'rattail' cord and the necklace length can be any size you would like.  feel free to contact me with any questions that you may have.  my e-mail address is sji_creations@msn.com
