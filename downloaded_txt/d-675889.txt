thursday 5/14 & saturday 5/16





sorry i haven't post the last few days but was out of town.  you can always count on someone to be at the washington park shelter at 5:30 on tues. and thurs.  and we usually run a 4-5 miles.   this thurs. will be no different.  the following route is 4.1 miles and it shows to start at the tennis courts but we will meet at the shelter.http://www.usatf.org/routes/view.asp?rid=195600the old state capitol art fair is downtown this weekend so lets start again at panera west for our saturday run.   this is an old route but should be new for some of you.  we leave from panera and run through panther creek.  i will put a cooler out with water at cockrell ln and mathers so there will be water at mile 2 and 5.  is 7:30 a good time for everyone?http://www.usatf.org/routes/view.asp?rid=115021

saturday 4/25





lets try a different starting location on sat. and start at 7:30 from panera west. i'm training for another half on may 9th so i will be running 10+ on saturday. by the comments it looks like some of you would like to run 8 so i am posting two routes. both routes will run together for the first 4 and then we will split at the fit club.here is the 8 mile route:http://www.usatf.org/routes/view.asp?rid=287311now the 10:http://www.usatf.org/routes/view.asp?rid=136309this route shows 11.48 miles.  if you just want to run 10 miles then at washington park instead of running the whole park loop turn at the clubhouse hill and follow the route back to panera.see you saturday and don't forget to hang around after your run for coffee and bagels.

tuesday 4/21





we will meet at the washington park shelter at 5:30 and do a hill workout.   we haven't ran the hills for awhile and i know everyone are missing them.  we will run east to the gazebo and go down that hill and then head to feldkamp.  we will group at feldkamp and run up 7 times.  the goal is to sprint up the hill and jog down then take a 60-90 second break and then sprint back up.  we will finish with a cool down run back to the shelter.sounds fun!!!
