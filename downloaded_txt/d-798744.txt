we are closed for 2024 camping seasonwe are taking reservations for 2025 camping season! great bay camping is a "family run" campground, where campers are respected and soon become members of our extended family, whether you are here for a few days or longer! no matter if you are in a popup tent or in an rv you will be thrilled by the beauty of our grounds and the squamscott river. other campgrounds and rv parks can't compare!an inviting escape
