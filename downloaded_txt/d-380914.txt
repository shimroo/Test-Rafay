 my new blog - behold the bejewelled - 


 please come see my new posts there: [link]  the mythic life, re-jewelled; this is my new blog devoted to the notion of 'remembering mythic living' ..."wednesday, january 19, 2011 to be connected, or notat the end of the day, the vision of an interconnected, meaningful and peaceful world sits paramount to the dream of childhood. if one grew up in a 'behaviorist' household where your psyche got shoved into the unconscious bag to conform to rewards/ punishments... the western banana split might have shoved that inherent dream to the edges of your awareness quite young... but we all remember that sense, that divine knowing all babes have... of the heaven that is possible in the now here.... that sense wakes us up from the illusory dream of the maya-maya world of separation, pain and betrayal of all our hopes. the mythic quest, therefore, is simply the awareness of the soul's journey to restore the meaning, and follow the invisible signs that there is a purpose to the journey. today the outside maya has never looked so heartbreaking, so devastating, so anti-life. so anti-dreams, when is so much conspiracy to kill all that is possible on our planet... which truly could become heaven, if we re-membered the wholeness... the holiness that is possible when grace restores our vision."[ the mythic life | 2011-01-19 18:44 | 13 comments | permalink ]  more >

 on cancer, personal loss, death and reckoning with 'god'


ok so it sounds like you need a sermon on the mound from the priestess of love herself.... so here it goes: indeed the experiment of this whirld, this maya realm is all about the injustices of the human condition.  did some all-mighty benevolent force set it all up to punish us?  is there a lack of compassion when the frail, unconscious, week and simple souls feel abandoned?  is this true?  from one perspective, of course it is experienced like that is what is going on.  existentialists often tout how the 'new agers' are so fascist and un-christ-like when they say that the downtrodden and dispossessed 'signed up for' some sort of karmic bullshit to have such an unfair existence.  of course not! ....... and yet -- life is a dance of chi - flow - power ---- and as infinite expressions of the one force, the one love that has no opposite (fear / death/ decay/ evil ) --- it can be extremely confusing for us dealing with what seems to be a reality of construct coming out of a biological evolutionary process condoning murder and meaninglessness...... the goal is for the god to awaken in the form of the suffering unjust.  that is what is known as the christ consciousness.   and that is basically the aquarian age -- when critical mass reaches that state.  what would that look like?  the vedic scriptures talk about the great kali-yoga.  that is the age of the great hypocrisy.  and there are all these realms of the maya, that we must journey through as souls to find that buddha compassion.  according to the vedics, indeed, one must first get really pissed off at god and denounce the illusion of fantasy (!!!) -- before he/she ascends to the next ring of enlightenment.  he must denounce god and the whirld... to get to this point, just before we see the absurdity of the maya.... before we pierce the veil and see beyond.... through the looking glass... that it's all a set-up.  yep it's all a con.  did some outside 'god' set it all up?  what if we are a part of that god that set it up?  the realm of duality set up full of 'rules' to obey, push against, then break - and ultimately discard.  the agreement that something is no longer real -- like a superstition -- banishes, the reality.   the teachings of 'a course in miracles' states that what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.  so the illusion of death and despair is the massive hallucination the whirld of maya is prescribing to.  as well as the 'stuck souls' in bodies on this suffering planet..... what's it all for?  it's only for redemption.  it's only for re-remembrance of who we really are!  we are made of the same stuff as the stars.  we are as gods.  we are connected to that divine spark. we have the power to find that in this incarnation... but sometimes it's not yet 'time'.... but remember time is an illusion... this state is an illusion... and only the journey towards complete love is real.... you know yourself that the flow of the chi, the tao, can be used for what seems to be the 'dark' and what seems to be the 'light'.... however indeed that is the point of this realm... for life to try all possibilities... and in the end to choose, it-self... it's own inherent nature.... that's the paradox.  what happens when the god-sparks forget them-selves (small s) --- ???? ... and this is what you just experienced.... you saw no 'mercy'... and that the pain didn't seem fair.... anguish, despair and pain..... i get it beloved.... this planet is toxic and 1/2 will get cancer in this decade... because of the toxicity of what our shadows have done to this realm... it's dark, painful and horrific.  more slaves on the planet today... more wars.... and more corruption on the highest levels... how sophisticated we've become at destroying ourselves!  it's maddening.... well i believe inside the eye of this needle, is the divine "i am"  --- were some sort of 'switch' happens and we wake up ---- i don't think we are here to muddle along and one day whilst carrying water and chopping wood, the awakening happens.... no.  i believe that we are standing at the precipice before we jump! towards our own nature -- towards a more cosmic evolution.  and the cancer, is a disgusting reminder... that indeed we must take our power back.  we must turn towards the light.  i do not believe that the suffering is in vain... i do believe the souls move on, and even those 'left behind' on this miserable planet... will find moments of grace... and their souls will evolve.  the 'christ' energy has incredible compassion and yes even anger towards the dispossessed.  i do not think it any small thing your 'reckoning' with the divine.  indeed it is what is called for now.  this is our finest and darkest hour.  it's incredibly painful.  the greed, corruption and atrocities to life!  look at the toxins used to 'disperse' the oil spill!  no different than allopathic doctors.  medical doctors know nothing about the well-being of the body.  they are taught to treat the body like a machine that dies and get's sick.  that's the paradigm.  and mds die younger than the average death rate in all western cultures!  the paradigm is flawed.  in a concentric circle, in a unified field... there is an alignment.... there is a cooperation in nature.... there is beauty and order and miracles in the consciousness of creation... but i do not see it as 'out there' .... it's inside and outside in ---- it's through and deeply through - the soul's progression of awareness via the time/ space continuum -- which i believes is only here to get us to 'let go' and 'let god'.  the true 'god' of love, compassion, forgiveness, grace, and the belief that our soul's are innately good.  that life is benign.  not to be fought, attacked or overcome... but to face our fears and find something extraordinary beyond all the pain and suffering... or rather inside of it all... right there in front of our faces.... christ means the annointed one. who annointed him?

 the cove


 their own version of 'oceans 11' and it was better than - and more so!   i have just signed the letter to obama and biden with these comments: i just watched the cove in west la.  i am disgusted with the farcical iwc's nonsense, and japan's nonsense science and cartel with impoverished nations – trying to legalize whaling including small cetaceans!  this is ‘empire consciousness’ with no regard for conscious and intelligent life.  this entire coup is so corrupt – i think the iwc needs to be investigated and something must be done to protect our dying oceans!  the mercury poisoning and the devastation to our marine life is unconscionable!!!  this is a must-see film.  it is not ott with graphics and only the last 5 minutes shows what their 'mission impossible' coup uncovered.  it doesn't pull on your heart strings to a place where one cannot discern and consider the story and the important information. i think those men (and woman) are the sexiest bravest men alive - and what a beautiful soul that woman diver had!   empire consciousness has created this massive cover-up in japan.  however if we had hidden rocks and cameras in our own empire, who knows what we would uncover also?  it's not that japan isn't trying to be the next empire just like we did after the europeans.. but it's the cartel they have created with the iwc, international whaling commission.  really dispicable... japan buying countries into joining the iwc.  countries that have been literally manipulated into japan's nonsense science -- actually trying to say cetaceans are the reason the food crisis, ocean fish crisis is so severe!  the reason is the japanese cartel on the world wide fish markets.  in 40 years, or less, it will be gone.  70% of all humans get their primary source of income from fish from the seas.   new commissions and new visionairies are required to expose these horors -- but also to create a less corrupt mandate, governed by science and thorough investigation by environmental groups.  it is very powerful the man who trained 'flipper' is the biggest activist in this film.  i am inspired.  deeply inspired.  bravo to these renegade film makers!  go see this film!  one of the best ever made since schindler's list but way easier to watch!   relevant links: social vibe - whaleman[link]  the awful iwc[link]  the cove movement[link][ environment | 2009-08-21 07:55 | 12 comments | permalink ]  more >

 a new blog?


i was hit with the profundity of this yesterday: often when i have 'ran away' from myself, my life or a version of my self or my life i wanted to run away from --- i became more courageous in the things i did, the places i went, the extremes i went to -- in order to run away. i never felt like i was running away, but rather running towards... but usually i was fleeing in some sense... so isn't that interesting? in a seemingly cowardice act --- one becomes more drastically heroic than ever imagined? the energy to run away from what one no longer wishes to be... in my case, the energy i expelled to discard that which i no longer identified with - allowed me to plunge fully into a new self/ life/ adventure... and i therefore boldly went where very few would have dared to go 'with a plan'.  this boho adventure has, in retrospect, defined me.  and i think allowed me to realize i was indeed a hero in my own story.  by default?  not totally.  the crux was the impetus to 'create again'.  no matter what.  i must... bla blah.  it didn't matter what i focused on doing, it was harnessing the elements to literally leap.  it was a taking off and literally a charging forth. i suggest everyone live their lives as if the audience is watching.  because it is.   (btw, in as much as i love the space the old scarlet jewels blog holds, but am considering launching a new blog with a new vibe... solely focusing on what it means to live the mythic life.  sub-themes include the synchronicity thread, as well as the divine imagination.... i am not sure...) for now/ for today -- i will put the ideas here in this new category.[ the mythic life | 2009-08-14 09:39 | 3 comments | permalink ]  more >

 legions of light in stealth mode


 i've been contemplating the following as of late: 1. the lesson of wall*e: the reason the world's productivity machine that has fed industrialised capitalism has come to a crashing halt in the last quarter is very good news!  this means, children, that our world will not become like wall*e.  doesn't that make sense?  simple simon, right?  so let's plant some seeds!  2. newage 101 (ie 'the secret', louise hay, eckhard toile, etc) ..... first step.  one needs to detox her  'ego' , and get out of her 'mind'.   then one aligns with their self, heart, joy, love, truth, authenticity, and one's humanity.... generally this is only the first step.  this doesn't mean the ego is bad or the mind is bad.  this means when that part of one is running the show, running one's personal life, also running the planet, running the schools, running the institutions, running the societies... then we are in big trouble!  (like now!)  3. but, that is only a perception. "a miracle is a change in perception" !!! so, the idea is that one re-members (like humpty dumpty) who she is.   we put ourselves back together again! that's the game.  4. therefore - there is no 'other' and no one 'out there' that can fix it for us. no real messiah in the objective sense (ie obama).... but we manifest perhaps a symbolic 'unifier' who is radiating at the pulse of the collective's desires. today in the aquarian age - this means a transpersonal more collective spirit of cooperation and brotherhood/ sisterhood with our fellow humanity. there is no issue that is not connected to our lives. therein is the idea of self sustainability.  5. going back to point 2 - the ego and the mind are not bad.   new agers get a grip. we need an enlightened mind and a healthy ego/ persona.  that's what makes this fun. aligned with the heart, the kundalini, the shakti, the spark of imagination, insipiration and creative force. the spirit comes through the electrical currents of our biological experience.  6. oh yea, and  and the universe is made of magic. so righteous ones, please stop hating disney. get on the only ship that is here. all you ever learned in life you learned in kindergarden (that's why i left the uk - they try to skip that part!)  7.  what does heaven on earth look like? we're in this together.  let's find a way to embody who we really are. and let it always begin, with me!    legions of light update 12 march 09.[ futurism/ evolution | 2009-03-12 17:26 | 7 comments | permalink ]  more >

 intelligentsia


 it seems to me, that there is enough evidence to suggest, that: one must 'learn' less to learn how to critically think. one who is taught too much, therefore cannot truly think. one who is highly schooled in a highly competitive environment, therefore, might be trained to be stupid. and those who have the funding for more progressive education, are groomed to think slowly and to solve the world's problems. but how can the gentiles teach the masses, then, when the evil matrix wants to condition the sheep they are smart, because they have learnt so much? here-in lies the problem between altruistic western empires and roman thugs. neither wins.[ poems & musings | 2008-11-27 08:32 | 10 comments | permalink ]  more >
