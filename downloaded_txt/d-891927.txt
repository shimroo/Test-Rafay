plant breeding consortium

						with more than 35 core faculty actively developing new cultivars, germplasms, and parental lines - the consortium has more plant breeders than any other u.s. university.
					











vision
world-class programs committed to graduating the best plant breeders and to helping address agriculture problems and opportunities through plant breeding and strategic partnerships.




mission
to foster collaborative research, innovation, and education in plant breeding. we strive to prepare the next generation of plant breeders, and develop resilient, high-yielding crop varieties that address regional and global agricultural challenges, promote food security, and sustainably support the needs of future generations, through interdisciplinary expertise.







crop cultivars
nc state plant breeding consortium programs use conventional and genomic-assisted breeding techniques to develop numerous cultivar lines that benefit local, regional, and international communities.
