our ethos & history



health & safety








a case study





m&m demolition were contracted by wiltshire council to carry out the demolition and associated works at a former leisure centre. we were challenged by restricted vehicle movements through peak hours due to close proximity to neighbouring high profile commercial properties. we had pre-commencement meetings with the client, client representatives and obtained licenses & plan works from local authorities.
we minimised our impact to the environment with pre-planned vehicle movements, a full-time on-site residents liaison officer, a dust suppression system and cleaning the surrounding roads, post demolition.
the project completed safely and without fuss from neighbours, not to mention, on time and on budget.




























more projects










m&m demolition used their experience to manage the project professionally in order to complete the east block demolition, revealing the complex temporary works system they installed to retain elements of the original structure. the rmd slim shore propping system is fixed using resin-anchored dywidag rods and plates, with concrete thrust blocks cast in the ground to ensure structural stability. the works were completed on time with no hidden extra costs.
