love, ron 











“although i have never actually, physically “met” you, i do feel i’ve known you for the past few years. sometime ago you had unexpectedly sent me some kind words about my own website (astro …read more chakras). that event, along with the coinciding passing of my best friend, also a very gifted psychic, helped me to realize that i, too, am very gifted. in fact, since that time – which i think was about 2 years ago, or more – i’ve met several other psychics, and they all say that i am very gifted, and capable of channeling. you did not say anything that was profound, but the sincerity of your words was very obvious. they touched my heart, and even from a distance, i could feel the honest love that you emanate. not only did you make a difference in my life, but i’ve also learned how to pass on that same loving energy to others in need. keep up the great work in helping to light the world.”

“i am happy to write a character reference for athene raefiel. i’ve known athene for almost 15 years, as a teacher, friend, personal psychic, and mentor. without athene’s encouragement…read more belief, and spiritual classes, i’d never be the great spiritual psychic and counselor i am today. i’ve taken many classes from athene. as a teacher, she encourages, supports, clarifies, and shares her truth. she excites the students that are just beginning, and supports the older students. i’ve taken a variety of psychic and personal empowerment courses from athene and have used the information on a daily basis. i also had the pleasure of teaching a children’s workshop with athene. she has the patience to teach the young and the old.as a personal psychic, athene has been honest, to the point, and very accurate with my life changes. athene has encouraged me to channel and tune into my own guides to get my answers. she believed in me and shared her truth. what more would one want in a friend and psychic?i highly recommend athene as a teacher and spiritual counselor. she is a natural teacher and it shows in all she does. athene truly “walks her talk.” athene is still my mentor. she is like a mother bird that constantly encourages her young to fly. well, i soared, and still i return to thank her for all she has done for me. i’m now a full time psychic and spiritual counselor and teacher. thanks to athene raefiel.”
