brian kahn inc. strives to deliver superior legal advice and solutions with integrity, innovativeness and initiative. 












welcome to brian kahn inc. attorneys 



in 1997, brian kahn inc. developed its own office building which it named “umlilo house”. the source of and inspiration for the name (which means “fire” in zulu), emerges from the vision and culture of the firm which is dynamic, progressive and effective in achieving success for its clients. we have the infrastructure, commitment and passion, but can only do so to the optimum where permitted by our clients. 



in all we do, in whatever we do, and whoever we do it with, we seek – in a word – to “dazzle!”
