whatsapp is rolling out customizable themes and backgrounds for chat 	- [internet] 03:05 am est - feb,14 2025  - post a comment whatsapp is rolling out a significant visual update, bringing more personalization options to its messaging platform. users will be able to customize their conversations with new pre-defined themes and backgrounds, moving away from the app's long-standing green theme.

the update introduces a range of new chat themes that alter the background as well as the chat bubbles themselves. this enables users to select a theme and instantly alter the look and feel of their conversations. while whatsapp once allowed for custom wallpapers, this new feature provides greater personalization with 30 new background options along with the theme options.

importantly, one can always upload an image from the phone gallery if one desires a personalized background. such new themes can be used in all conversations as a group or separately to some conversations so that users can personalize their whatsapp with ease.

it's also worth noting that such visual changes are personal and will only be observed by the user who sets them up, and not by the recipients of the chats. this feature is also applicable to whatsapp channels, where one can personalize their subscribed content as well.

the release of these colorful features has already begun on both android and ios. while availability at launch is limited, a wider global release will begin in the following weeks.

apple now allows users to migrate purchases from one apple account to another	- [briefly] 04:39 am est - feb,12 2025  - post a comment apple account purchases of apps, music, and other content have historically been non-transferable between accounts. apple today published a new support document describing how users can migrate purchases between apple accounts. if an apple account is only used for making purchases, those purchases can be migrated to a different account, allowing users to consolidate their apple accounts. after completing the migration, users will be able to download the purchased apps, music, movies, tv shows, and books. even subscriptions will be migrated along with the other purchased content. icloud data will not be migrated since it is not tied to purchases. however, this feature is not available to users in the european union, united kingdom, or india. apple will not allow users to migrate their purchases in the following scenarios:



neither apple account can be a child account created through
family sharing.
neither apple account can already be used for migrated
purchases. learn how to undo a migration of purchases. if you undo a
migration of purchases from a secondary account, you won't be able to
migrate purchases again for 1 year.
you can't migrate purchases if both the primary apple account
and the secondary apple account have music library data associated with
each of them.
you can't migrate purchases if you've set your apple one
subscription to provide icloud storage to a third, different account.
learn about apple one and icloud storage.
if your primary account has never been used for purchases or
free downloads, you can't migrate purchases.
you can't migrate purchases from an apple account that's been
deleted or deactivated.
you can't migrate purchases if your apple account is locked or
disabled.
neither apple account can be receiving any special access to
apps or content. for example, an apple account enrolled in the vpp
program through an employer to receive special access to apps.

new breakthrough: light speed computers take over!	- [technology] 12:46 pm est - feb,07 2025  - post a comment 

in the video, the speaker discusses the evolution and future of computing technology, focusing on the emergence of light-based computing, particularly through the innovations of photonic chips. as the demand for computing power continues to rise, traditional electronic chips are struggling to keep pace due to limitations in speed and scalability. the speaker introduces a new class of chips known as native processing units (npus), which utilize light instead of electricity for calculations, significantly increasing computational efficiency and density. the discussion also highlights the technological advancements made by q.ant, which has developed a fully functional commercial light-based computer that employs lithium niobatea material crucial for minimizing light loss during computations. the video emphasizes the potential of photonic computing to outperform traditional gpus, particularly in ai applications, while also addressing the challenges of controlling light and the implications of integrating photonic systems into existing computing architectures. finally, the speaker suggests that the future of computing will likely consist of a combination of various technologies, including analog photonic, digital, probabilistic, and quantum computing, each serving specific applications.

ai laptops: exposing the truth	- [hardware] 06:37 pm est - feb,05 2025  - post a comment in this video, the hosts explore the concept of 'ai laptops' and whether they truly offer any advantages over traditional laptops. they clarify that an ai laptop is generally characterized by having a neural processing unit (npu), which can handle lightweight ai tasks more efficiently than a standard cpu or gpu. however, the hosts find that many laptops marketed as 'ai laptops' do not actually possess this capability, and numerous existing laptops with powerful gpus are overlooked in this branding. the video reviews various ai tools, such as adobe photoshop, zoom, and microsoft's co-pilot, assessing their actual performance and utility. the hosts conclude that while npus have the potential for future applications, current software does not fully leverage their capabilities. ultimately, they suggest that upgrading for an ai laptop may not be necessary, as improvements in battery life, performance, and cooling are more relevant.
 


deepseek r1 cloned for $30?! phd student stunning discovery	- [technology] 12:01 pm est - feb,05 2025  - post a comment in a groundbreaking development, a phd student from uc berkeley successfully replicated the 'aha moment' experienced by deepmind's deepseek model using a reinforcement learning (rl) approach. this achievement, which can be accomplished for as little as $30, showcases the potential of language models to develop sophisticated reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning. the 'aha moment' refers to a point during the model's training where it begins to effectively allocate time and resources to reevaluate its answers, indicating a significant leap in its cognitive capabilities. the student utilized a specific game called the 'countdown game,' where the model learns to achieve a target number through arithmetic operations, providing a clear reward signal that enhances its learning process. the results demonstrate that with a well-defined reward system, even smaller models can learn to think independently, offering exciting possibilities for future applications of ai in various domains.

galaxy s25 ultra vs iphone 16 pro max vs....everything else!	- [mobile] 05:56 am est - feb,01 2025  - post a comment in this comprehensive battery test, the host evaluates the performance of nine flagship smartphones to determine which has the best and worst battery life. the devices tested include the pixel 9 pro xl, oneplus 13, vivo x200 pro, iphone 16 pro max, oppo x8 pro, honor magic 7 pro, galaxy s25 ultra, galaxy s24 ultra, and xiaomi 14 ultra. the test is meticulously controlled, with all phones set to 150 nits brightness, 100% battery health, and connected only to wi-fi to eliminate unnecessary variables. a series of applications, including social media and demanding games, are used to assess battery performance.

key observations include the variety of processors in use, ranging from apple's a18 pro to snapdragon and mediatek chips. the xiaomi 14 ultra, notably, has a smaller battery than its predecessor, which raises questions about its performance. the host also employs a thermal imaging camera to analyze heat generation during usage, revealing the pixel 9 pro xl runs the hottest while the iphone remains the coolest.

after conducting a standby test overnight and active usage tests, results show a significant difference in battery longevity among the devices. the vivo x200 pro emerges as the champion, maintaining 15% battery life after an extensive testing period, while the xiaomi 14 ultra disappointingly falls short, dying the quickest. the battery performance rankings convey the importance of battery capacity, chip efficiency, and software optimization in determining a smartphone's endurance.
