anderson valley's first bonded winery

husch vineyards is a small, family owned winery on the way to the coast of mendocino, just 2 1/2 hours north of san francisco. under the direction of 3rd generation family members husch produces 22 different wines, of which six are distributed nationally. small lots of special wines are available exclusively at our tasting room, a converted pony barn dating back to the late 1800s. 

quality is the key word at husch: in the vineyards, in our winemaking and in our friendly customer service. it all starts in the vineyard. our wines are made from grapes grown on vineyards managed by the winery, allowing us to bring consistent, high-quality fruit to the bottle. our winemaking team pays careful attention to the fruit as it comes off the vine, creating memorable, hand-crafted wines.

the friendly and knowledgeable tasting room staff strives to make your visit to anderson valley memorable. with our long farming heritage, husch wines showcase the fruit in each bottle and reflect a true commitment to quality and value. the husch vineyards family and staff love to share recipes to pair with our favorite husch wines. we would love to hear about your favorite food and wine pairings. contact us.
