the convention center of the future is here


more than at any time since its opening in 1986, the javits center is fulfilling its mission to support new yorkers. operated by the new york convention center operating corporation (nyccoc), a public benefit corporation, the javits center has played a critical role in new york’s recovery and resurgence, helping to create a safer and stronger future for the empire state. with an historic expansion project completed and 850,000 square feet of flexible exhibition space along the scenic hudson river, this iconic facility is continuing to drive the economies of new york state and new york city by hosting blockbuster events of all shapes and sizes. nowhere in the country will you find a venue with the extensive resources, services and staff of elite professionals dedicated to making every trade show, convention and special event a success. it's no wonder that nearly 40,000 companies have chosen the javits center as their preferred venue every year, making it the busiest convention center in the country. and when you consider that the javits center sits at the nexus of manhattan's resurgent west side neighborhood, it's easy to see why whatever's happening, happens here.

                          what started in the 80’s as an intimate gathering of 25 brands at the plaza hotel quickly grew into something else, something bigger. it grew into coterie- the merging point for the industry talents that create tomorrow, today. 

with curation and connection at its core from the start, coterie now showcases over 1000+ brands, twice a year, to an international community of buyers, retailers, experts, influencers, media, and stylists. this is where relationships are built, trends are set and the most important industry shifts take place.

                          everyone deserves a safe place to sleep. 
by giving up your bed for one night, you can ensure that youth facing homelessness will sleep safely at covenant house. 

covenant house welcomes every young person with love and respect. in addition to safe shelter, youth can access nourishing food, clean clothing, and essential services like job training, education, healthcare, mental health counseling, and legal aid — all the tools they need to build futures free from homelessness — at no cost to them. sleep out raises the funds that make this possible.

                          mongodb is a general-purpose, multi-model database that supports modern, mission-critical applications around the globe. developers have consistently ranked mongodb as one of the most wanted databases, which has led other database providers to emulate the mongodb api for their users. cosmos db is a prominent example of this, although it does not offer the same ease of use, performance, or functionality. in this webinar, we will explore the key differences between mongodb and the cosmos db api emulator for mongodb to help you decide which database is right for your applications.
