what you need to know about the us department of education as linda mcmahon goes before congress





trump is aiming to shut down the u.s. department of education (usdoe)—a long-standing conservative goal—but everyone should know that doing so would require congressional approval (also read "trump wants to shut education department heres why what that means") sometime soon, trump is expected to sign an executive order directing the future secretary of education to carry this out with the idea of transferring education responsibilities to the 50 states, with the presumptive nominee, linda mcmahon, developing a plan for closing the usdoethe chronicle of higher education article below raises a lot of important questions should this dismantling occur. where would its essential functions like student financial aid be transferred—to the treasury or justice department? how is elon musk's department of government efficiency (doge) involved in overseeing budget cuts? why are universities concerned about funding cuts, and what legal challenges have arisen regarding unauthorized access to student data? how are house democrats and college leaders opposing the move, especially as related to research funding and institutional stability? what federal agency or mechanism would trump's administration use to enforce education-related policies such as bans on dei programs and transgender athletes in women's sports? it's incredible to learn that 20 house democrats were recently locked out of the usdoe building after demanding a meeting with the acting secretary to protest trump's closure plans.-angela valenzuela what you need to know as linda mcmahon goes before congressby alissa gary february 12, 2025linda mcmahontom williams, aplinda mcmahon, president trump’s pick to lead the education department, will testify before the u.s. senate’s education committee on thursday.if she’s confirmed, trump has said her first task would be to “put herself out of a job.”trump has promised to shut down the department in favor of reducing federal spending and putting education in the hands of the states — a sentiment embraced by conservatives since the department’s founding 45 years ago.a president can’t unilaterally eliminate the department without congressional approval.but the trump administration has already tried to shutter an agency — directing mass budget and staffing cuts at the united states agency for international development — and pause billions in federal funding, including for higher-ed research. courts have ordered the administration to unfreeze funding; news reports indicate that some parts of the government, including the national institutes of health, have not fully complied.what the department doesin higher education, the education department distributes grants for minority-serving institutions and student success, manages the federal work-study program, argues civil-rights cases, and awards more than $120 billion a year in federal student aid.it’s unclear what exactly trump plans to do with essential functions, such as financial aid, if he closes the department. some trump allies have floated moving financial matters, like grants and loans, to the treasury department. civil-rights cases could fall under the department of justice, said kenneth l. marcus, a lawyer who served as an assistant education secretary for civil rights during the first trump administration.marcus believes some shifts could be beneficial: integrating education with other departments could result in more staffers with certain skill sets — like accountants and lawyers — handling non-policy matters like finances and investigations, as opposed to former educators and school administrators.“that could facilitate a smoother function and greater efficiency and possibly a shift from administrative approaches,” marcus said.christopher f. rufo, a conservative activist and trustee at new college of florida, a small public institution that’s seen its curriculum and culture reshaped by republicans, laid out his own vision for the shutdown in an article on tuesday.if the education department closes, rufo wrote, student financial assistance should “spin off” into a different, independent financial entity that would evaluate costs and reduce the total amount of loans. (federal student aid is an office of the education department but already operates independently, thanks to a decision made nearly three decades ago by republican lawmakers.)even if the department remains operational, trump and the department of government efficiency, or doge, spearheaded by the tech mogul elon musk, could severely reduce its size and capabilities. doge posted monday on x that it had ended 89 contracts with the education department worth $881 million. most of those cuts fell within the institute of education sciences.trump’s attempt to dismantle the department is another example of “unprecedented governmental overreach and intrusion” into higher education, said lynn pasquerella, president of the american association of colleges and universities, or aac&u.even if the department’s responsibilities and funds are transferred elsewhere rather than cut, “it’s not clear that there’s capacity to handle these enormous tasks,” she said.other closure attemptstrump is far from the first republican politician to try to eliminate the education department. in 1980, ronald reagan called the agency a “bureaucratic boondoggle” during his campaign against then-president jimmy carter, who had founded the department the previous year. reagan later said he’d seek to close it as president.in 1996, conservatives were united behind shuttering the department, but the idea was blocked by then-president bill clinton, a democrat. more recently, in 2023, a republican representative from alabama introduced a bill that aimed to “abolish” the education department and transfer responsibility of pell grants and federal loans to the treasury department. that bill died in committee.u.s. rep. thomas massie, republican of kentucky, introduced a bill this year that states simply: “the department of education shall terminate on december 31, 2026.” the bill hasn’t advanced further.trump in his first term proposed cutting $9.2 billion, or about 13 percent, of total federal funding to k-12 and higher education, but his cuts were not adopted by congress. his administration also came up with a plan to merge the education and labor departments, but that didn’t go anywhere, either.this time around, trump seems more intent on eliminating the department and cutting federal spending, said patrick mcguinn, an associate professor of political science at drew university who studies federal education policy.“the pace and scope of change that we’ve seen in just the first few weeks of trump’s administration indicates that he’s quite serious about doing some of these things,” mcguinn said.closing the department could complicate trump’s education agenda, mcguinn added. in his first week in office, trump issued executive orders that aimed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts across the public and private sectors. last week, he issued another order banning transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. to ensure those rules are enforced, trump needs a government agency, mcguinn said.“same department,” mcguinn said, “but used for a different purpose.”pushback and privacyon friday, about 20 house democrats were barred from entering the education department’s building after gathering to demand an impromptu meeting with the acting secretary, denise l. carter, hoping to protest trump’s plan for closure.“a year ago, i’d be able to walk into this building and not be locked out,” said rep. maxwell frost, democrat of florida, in a video posted to his x account. “this is what they’re doing. elon is allowed in. but not you, not your elected representative, not parents, not students.”musk, who owns the social-media platform, responded to frost by saying the education department “doesn’t exist.”musk came under fire last week when some of doge’s employees received access to education department databases containing confidential student data, including social security numbers, personal information needed to receive financial aid, and even family members’ immigration status.that worried the university of california student association, a group representing the uc system’s 295,000 students. the association filed a lawsuit on friday against carter and the department to block the doge employees’ “unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous” access to student information.amid doge’s targeting, analytics data show a spike in downloads for the complaint form used to allege violations of the family educational rights and privacy act, or ferpa.after a judge intervened, the education department agreed to suspend doge’s permissions until at least february 17. the federal student aid office published a statement asserting that its staff “have not engaged in any activities that would expose data through unauthorized or unlawful means.”on thursday, mcmahon could also face questions about trump’s orders banning diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and threatening cuts to grant funding; those moves have prompted lawsuits.in an email to the campus community last weekend, jeffrey p. gold, president of the university of nebraska system, provided guidance on grant cuts and implored faculty, staff, and students to continue conducting research. “as we work through this time of change, please continue to do what you do so well,” gold wrote.pasquerella, the aac&u president, advised colleges to keep an eye on executive actions but to focus time and energy on their institutional missions.“it creates such disruption, chaos, and uncertainty,” pasquerella said, “that people are spending a good deal of time focusing on putting out fires and how they can respond to the latest executive order, and not being able to focus on the day-to-day work.”dan bauman, a chronicle senior reporter, contributed reporting.read other items in this what will trump's presidency mean for higher ed? package.we welcome your thoughts and questions about this article. please email the editors or submit a letter for publication.

learn about texas v. becerra that threatens crucial protections, section 504 of the rehabilitation act





friends:the texas v. becerra case has the potential to shape the future of section 504 of the rehabilitation act, potentially jeopardizing decades of legal protections that guarantee accessibility in education, healthcare, and other public services.my daughter benefitted from section 504 when she experienced a disabling injury. i shudder to think what would have happened without section 504. i urge all concerned to write to atty. general ken paxton about this. i provide a template letter below that you can fashion for your purposes and upload to his website.for more information: https://dredf.org/protect-504/ also read the blog i post below from the educator's room. let's not find yet another way to hurt kids.-angela valenzuela[link to send letter: https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/contact-us-online-form]dear attorney general ken paxton,i live in [city name], texas, and i have friends with disabilities. one of which is hard of hearing and uses hearing aids and a transcription service to be able to attend college.i care about section 504, because i i can see how without section 504 my friend and others with disabilities would not be able to access primary school, higher education, and have the right to have accessible communication, have building and spaces that have ramps and elevators help those who struggle with mobility, as well as not allow workplaces to discriminate against individuals with disabilities, as well as many other ways to make daily life accessible. i support the updated section 504 rules. the updated rules are stronger and provide examples of what disability discrimination is.i am very upset and angry that you have joined a case in texas called texas v. becerra that goes against section 504 and the updated rules. you are asking the court to get rid of the section 504 rules and the entire law. if the court does what you ask, people like my friend would not be able to attend college classes and get equal treatment. she will not have equal rights. without having the tools for these individuals to access education and the workforce, you severely limit their ability to be productive members of society, and hinder their abilities to grow educationally and professionally. revoking this law would corner many of these individuals whose life is already difficult to not even be able to financially support themselves, and this would be an unkind and merciless treatment of our fellow citizens.i want you to withdraw our state from texas v. becerra. you should support section 504 and its rules. you should not be attacking our rights.sincerely,[your name]source: https://theeducatorsroom.com/in-a-new-lawsuit-17-states-sue-to-do-away-with-504-protections/a high-stakes lawsuit, texas v. becerra, is currently making its way through the courts, threatening crucial protections for people with disabilities under section 504 of the rehabilitation act. seventeen states have challenged the federal government’s updated rules, putting at risk decades of legal safeguards that ensure accessibility in education, healthcare, and other public services.join our community of 70,000 other educators as they navigate hot topics in education.in this case, a coalition of 17 states (alaska, alabama, arkansas, florida, georgia, indiana, iowa, kansas, louisiana, missouri, montana, nebraska, south carolina, south dakota, texas, utah, and west virginia) has sued the u.s. government, arguing that section 504 is unconstitutional and should be eliminated. if successful, the lawsuit could dismantle essential protections that prevent discrimination against people with disabilities.what is section 504?section 504 of the rehabilitation act, first implemented in 1977, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by entities that receive federal funding. the law mandates that schools, hospitals, and other federally funded institutions provide equal access and accommodations to disabled individuals. the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) recently updated the rules under section 504 in 2024, incorporating stronger protections based on extensive input from disability advocates.these regulations require schools to provide appropriate support for students with disabilities, ensure that hospitals have sign language interpreters, mandate captioning for videos, and require accessible medical equipment for wheelchair users.why the lawsuit mattersthe states behind texas v. becerra argue that the federal government overstepped its authority in implementing the updated section 504 rules. however, rather than targeting specific provisions, the lawsuit seeks to dismantle section 504 in its entirety. if successful, this case could strip away fundamental protections, making it easier for discrimination against disabled individuals to go unchallenged.what comes next?the legal process is already underway. by february 25, 2025, both the 17 states and the federal government will submit legal briefs outlining their positions. other states that support section 504 may also file documents in its defense. disability advocacy organizations are expected to submit amicus briefs—legal arguments from non-parties explaining the broader implications of the case.once the court reviews all submitted documents, a ruling will be issued. the outcome will shape the future of disability rights and accessibility laws in the united states.

 grad programs have been a cash cow; now universities are starting to fret over graduate enrollment





friends:check out this recent hechinger report on graduate degrees and programs in the u.s. despite a brief enrollment rebound in 2023, we are witnessing that domestic student numbers are declining, with international students now driving most growth. this is some extent an artificat, i believe, of the growing economic divide that is playing out currently within all communities regardless of race or ethnicity. college is simply very expensive and student debt is crushing for the working and lower middle classes.  high tuition, rising debt, and uncertain returns on investment have made prospective students circumspect about getting a master's or doctoral degree. so unfortunate since it's such a gift and privilege to be able to pursue one's intellectual passions in and with one's life.experts warn that continued enrollment declines could create workforce shortages in fields requiring advanced degrees. yet, the issue has received less attention compared to falling undergraduate numbers. universities are now racing to adapt, balancing financial sustainability with evolving student demands.they're also having to manage the recklessness of a trump-musk administration that is disfiguring american higher education, as we speak (see earlier post, "nih budget cuts are the ‘apocalypse of american science,’ experts say, time magazine.") aside from the courts, the only thing that will save us are the midterm elections taking place in approximately 17 months.-angela valenzuelagrad programs have been a cash cow; now universities are starting to fret over graduate enrollmentby jon marcus, june 10, 2024 | hechinger reportemily sharkey, executive director of mba admissions and recruiting, and peter severa, assistant dean for mba student engagement, at georgia tech’s scheller college of business. adding a designation in science, technology, engineering and math “seemed like a natural fit, and we were seeing some of our competitors doing it,” severa says. credit: terrell clark for the hechinger reportatlanta — two construction cranes hover over a giant worksite just outside the scheller college of business at the georgia institute of technology.what they’re building is both a show of optimism in and a way to attract more students to something universities badly need but are beginning to worry about: graduate education.the $200 million project will house scheller’s graduate and executive business programs in one tower, connected to georgia tech’s school of industrial and systems engineering in another. linking graduate business programs with other disciplines has proven to increase demand; scheller has already added a science, technology, engineering and math designation to its master’s program in business administration, with a resulting bump in applications, the school says.at a university focused on technology, doing this “seemed like a natural fit, and we were seeing some of our competitors doing it,” said peter severa, scheller’s assistant dean for mba student engagement, in a conference room overlooking the construction site.it’s also a kind of enticement that’s become essential in response to signs that, after years of increase, the graduate enrollment on which universities heavily rely for revenue may be softening as prospective students question the cost of grad school and as shorter, cheaper and more flexible alternatives pop up.“what we’re seeing now is a combination of a leveling off and a big question mark as to where this long-term trend will go,” said brian mckenzie, director of research at the council of graduate schools.unlike undergraduate enrollment, which has been on a steady decline, graduate enrollment has gone up over the last decade. undergraduate numbers fell by 15 percent between 2010 and 2021, according to the national center for education statistics, while graduate enrollment grew by 9 percent. that was fueled in part by a change in 2007 that let graduate students borrow up to the full cost of their educations, unlike undergraduates, who can borrow only a limited amount.related: interested in innovations in higher education?

 nih budget cuts are the ‘apocalypse of american science,’ experts say, time magazine





friends:this publication in time magazine explores how research institutions and hospitals, which serve our communities, operate. in short, the u.s. national institutes of health (nih), the world’s largest biomedical research funder, recently announced major cuts to the "indirect expenses" covered in its grants—reducing them by nearly half. this is an agenda that elon musk is championing under the guise of "efficiency."in case you don't know, "biomedical research" are fancy words for conducting research on diseases, medical conditions, and biological functions. research of this kind explains all the innovations to treatments like cancer—that happens to be on the rise for young people in the u.s.—as well as therapies, and healthcare technologies. it consists of laboratory studies, clinical trials, and data analysis, all of which enhance medical advancements and improve patient care. i understand, for example, that there will soon be new, more effective chemotherapy treatments on the horizon that could revolutionize the treatment of cancer. radiation therapy treatments are always improving, too. i should know. i'm the beneficiary of these technological advances.however, the consequences of this decision could be dire, posing a significant threat to scientific progress. with fewer resources, layoffs, hiring freezes, and slowed research advancements are likely. additionally, the funding reduction may discourage young scientists from entering the field. experts warn that these cuts will delay the development of future medical treatments and limit the availability of new drugs in the years ahead.in response, states across the country have mobilized against the policy change. while a temporary restraining order has given researchers some time to adjust, concerns remain about how the u.s. can maintain its leadership in biomedical research with significantly reduced nih support.as someone who has personally benefitted from biomedical research, i urge us all to get our voices heard.what can you do? reach out to whoever represents you in congress and let them know how you feel about this horrible blow to the research enterprise.go to this link and put in your zip code so that you can find out.regardless of their party affiliation, believe me, it makes a difference for you to reach out to them via phone calls and emails. phone calls are better, in my opinion, but both are good as this creates a record that impacts their decisions.-angela valenzuelanih budget cuts are the ‘apocalypse of american science,’ experts saythe main historical building of the national institutes of health (nih) inside bethesda campusgetty imagesby alice parkfebruary 11, 2025 1:02 pm estthe u.s. national institutes of health (nih) is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world, and its grants create the foundation of basic science knowledge on which major health advances are built. on feb. 7, the nih announced that it would cut "indirect expenses" in the funding it provides to research grants by nearly half.“we were all just dumbstruck,” says dr. richard huganir, professor and chairman of the department of neuroscience at johns hopkins university school of medicine, who relies on nih grants for his research into therapies for autism and intellectual disabilities. “i’m calling it the apocalypse of american science. this will basically change science as we know it in the u.s.”"we're going to see health research kneecapped," says dr. otis brawley, professor of oncology and epidemiology at the johns hopkins school of medicine and the bloomberg school of public health. brawley has overseen grants at the national cancer institute (which is part of the nih) as well as received them for his cancer research.the funding cut took effect on feb. 9 and targets indirect costs, which include facilities and administration costs.in an immediate response, 22 states sued the nih and the u.s. department of health and human services (which oversees nih), calling the action “unlawful” and saying it would “devastate critical public health research at universities and research institutions in the united states.”hours later, the massachusetts attorney general issued a temporary restraining order preventing the nih from immediately cutting billions in the grants it issues to scientists and their institutions.here's what to know about the ongoing funding turmoil at the nih.what's an 'indirect cost'?nih awards around $30 to $35 billion in grants each year to a wide range of disease-related research projects. it helped fund the mrna technology that eventually led to the recent covid-19 vaccines, for example.in a feb. 7 post on x, the agency said about $9 billion of its annual research grant budget goes toward indirect costs, which are charged by academic institutions receiving the grants. institutes that receive nih grants negotiate indirect cost rates, taking into account how much they need to pay for things like heat, air conditioning, and electricity inside research facilities. administrative costs include those required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements to conduct the research. once a rate agreement is reached, it applies to all federal grants from nih to that institution.indirect costs can range from nearly 30% to 70% of a research grant, depending on the institution. certain non-academic institutes that have fewer resources than academic universities tend to have higher indirect rates, from 90% to 100%, says brawley. in its x post, the nih says harvard has charged 69%, yale 67.5%, and johns hopkins 63.7% in indirect costs. (johns hopkins' rate recently changed to 55%, brawley and huganir say.) under its new policy, the nih would cap indirect costs for all institutions at 15%.huganir says indirect costs are essential for modern-day research. in addition to keeping the lights on in labs, they cover maintaining and staffing critical scientific equipment and resources such as animal facilities, dna sequencing, and imaging.“right now we are in the middle of developing therapies that could really cure certain forms of intellectual disability for millions of kids across the world,” he says. “we are terrified that the research is going to stop.”why is the nih cutting indirect cost payments?the nih did not immediately respond to a request about what prompted the change, directing journalists to the agency’s grants policy statement. however, elon musk—tasked by the trump administration to address efficiency in government spending—called out the high percentage of indirect costs that the nih had been supporting. “can you believe that universities with tens of billions in endowments were siphoning off 60% of research award money for “overhead?” he wrote on x on feb. 7.the 15% cap puts nih grants in line with those from private philanthropic agencies that support research. the nih says that these entities—such as the gates foundation, the rockefeller foundation, and the chan zuckerberg initiative—allow a maximum of 10% to 15% of a research grant for indirect costs. but philanthropic foundations and academic institutes aren’t comparable to the federal government when it comes to funding science, brawley and huganir say, since foundations tend to support more focused and specific endeavors, such as individual faculty members or targeted projects.who will pick up the slack?so far, it's unclear. in his post on x, musk hinted that endowments should be part of the solution. but health experts say endowments aren’t a consistent or practical source of funding for overhead costs, since many outline narrow purposes or projects for the funds that are legally allocated and can’t be redirected to cover things like research expenses.“nobody else can really afford to pay for it,” says brawley. “what’s worked nicely over the last 50 to 60 years is that the nih does a lot of basic science research, asking questions that people can’t make money from. and the corporations, including biotech, can swoop in, and take that basic science information and do engineering and turn it into things you can sell and treat diseases with.”how will the new nih policy affect research?without the funding to support indirect costs, much of the scientific work that has been a mainstay of the u.s. biomedical field may not happen, or would take much longer. “the bottom line is that we are going to have a lot less resources, which obviously means we are going to have to lay people off, and research will be slowed down,” says huganir.brawley is also concerned about the quashing effect such actions will have on young scientists to remain in the field and create new labs. “nobody wins the nobel prize for what they did when they were 50,” he says. “i’m worried about the loss of creativity from young people; that’s where all the really good ideas come from.”read more: 8 symptoms doctors often dismiss as anxietyhe also notes that while a lot of attention has been focused on large academic universities with big endowments and deeper financial resources, the policy will likely have an even stronger impact on smaller community hospitals that supply many of the patients who participate in clinical trials. “people who are getting treated in clinical trials now for cancer will find many of those trials will close down,” he says.that will affect the pipeline of new treatments for diseases like cancer. brawley says that drugs approved in the last six months have been tested in trials over the last decade, so curtailing funding in research today will slow down the pace of progress and eventually result in fewer drugs. “i anticipate that the number of drugs approved is going to go down dramatically in the next five to 10 years,” he says.what will happen to current nih research grants?“we have been working all weekend trying to calm faculty and students and everybody who is concerned about future careers in science,” says huganir. “we have lots of committees addressing different aspects of this, and we’re trying to come up with ideas about how we can compensate for any losses we are experiencing.""that may mean laying people off and maybe putting hiring freezes on new faculty," he says. "we will have to make up for the difference through cost cutting in some way.’with the temporary restraining order, nih grantees have some time to come up with a plan for how they will try to maintain the pace of scientific research with much less nih support.“perhaps we need to reimagine or re-envision our entire system for how we fund science and how people make money off of science,” says brawley. “but the way to do that is not to threaten on friday night to cut everybody’s indirect [costs] down to 15%.”ultimately, scientists say the american public will pay a price for the drastic funding cuts. “the american people should know that this is going to impact them—the health of their families and their children,” says huganir. “and the economies of communities around these institutions that get a lot of nih funding are going to be impacted as well.”

bernie sanders' good government vs. steve bannon's and donald trump's dizzying "muzzle velocity" 





been meaning to post this. it should be read in tandem with this opinion by ezra klein titled, "don't believe him," that you can read or listen to here. in particular, klein underscores the power of steve bannon's strategy of "muzzle velocity." the idea is to "overwhelm the media — if you give it too many places it needs to look, all at once, if you keep it moving from one thing to the next — no coherent opposition can emerge. it is hard to even think coherently."they want us all to get the sense that "this is trump’s country now....it does what he wants. if trump tells the state to stop spending money, the money stops. if he says that birthright citizenship is over, it’s over."what gets obscured through this reckless bravado of muzzle velocity on steroids in his first few weeks in office is the reality of trump's weakness. klein makes the excellent point that while he may be impacting the coherence of any opposition, what must also get recognized is that he's flooding his own pond. lots of good nuggets here. what the opposition must do, klein wisely says, is to not believe him that he is king. if we treat him that way by surrendering their power, it's as if he were king. but good isn't gold. muzzle velocity and sowing chaos. geez, how devious.bernie is gold. if only he could have been our president.one last point: the animus he and our governor hold toward immigrants is very real. the president's, too (never mind that his wife is an immigrant). hence, the impact of his executive orders is atrocious, and we simply do not know at the moment the limits of his anti-immigrant agenda. eyes wide open.-angela valenzuelawhat trump didn’t say in his inauguration speechby bernie sandersthe simple truth is that trump ignored almost every major issue facing this country’s working families in his first speechthu 23 jan 2025 06.08 est | the guardian‘our healthcare system is broken, is dysfunctional and is wildly expensive.’ photograph: carlos barría/reutersi was at the trump inauguration on monday, and needless to say, i disagree with almost everything he had to say.what really struck me, however, is not what he said, which was not surprising given his general rhetoric – but what he didn’t say. the simple truth is that donald trump gave a major speech, the first speech of his second presidency, and ignored almost every significant issue facing the working families of this country.how crazy is that?our healthcare system is broken, is dysfunctional and is wildly expensive. we remain the only wealthy nation not to guarantee healthcare for all. not one word from trump about how he is going to address the healthcare crisis.we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs – sometimes 10 times more than the people in other countries – and one out of four americans is unable to afford the prescriptions that their doctors prescribe. not one word from donald trump on the high cost of prescription drugs.factchecking trump’s inauguration speech, from inflation to healthcarewe have 800,000 americans who are homeless and millions of our people spend 50% or 60% of their limited income on housing. we have a major housing crisis in america – everyone knows it. and trump, in his inaugural address, did not devote one word to it.today in america, we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had. the wealthiest three people in america now own more wealth than the bottom half of our society. but trump had nothing to say about the growing gap between the very rich and everybody else. and maybe that’s because he had those three people – the three wealthiest people in america – sitting right behind him at his inauguration. and, i should add, those three people – if you can believe it – saw their wealth increase by more than $233bn since the november elections. no wonder they were sitting right behind trump. they couldn’t be happier.during his inaugural speech, trump did not have one word to say about how we are going to address the planetary crisis of climate change. the last 10 years have been the warmest ever recorded, and extreme weather disturbances and natural disasters are taking place all over the world – from california to india, across europe to north carolina. not one word about climate change – except, of course, to make it clear that he intends to make this horrific situation even worse with “drill, baby, drill”. brilliant.we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs – sometimes 10 times more than the people in other countries – and one out of four americans is unable to afford the prescriptions that their doctors prescribe. not one word from donald trump on the high cost of prescription drugs.we have 800,000 americans who are homeless and millions of our people spend 50% or 60% of their limited income on housing. we have a major housing crisis in america – everyone knows it. and trump, in his inaugural address, did not

word about climate change – except, of course, to make it clear that he intends to make this horrific situation even worse with “drill, baby, drill”. brilliant.as we enter the new trump presidency, we have got to remain focused. we can’t paniczin the coming months and years, our job is not just to respond to every absurd statement that trump makes. that is what the trump world wants us to do. they want to define the parameters of debate and have us live within their world. that’s a trap we should not fall into.our job is to stay focused on the most important issues facing the working families of our country, provide solutions to those crises and demand that trump responds to us.let me mention just some of them:yes, healthcare is a human right and we must join every other major country in guaranteeing healthcare to all people through a medicare for all, single-payer program.yes, we must take on the greed of big pharma and substantially lower the cost of prescription drugs in this country.yes, we must build millions of units of low-income and affordable housing.yes, we must make sure that all of our young people have the ability to get a higher education by making public colleges and universities tuition-free.yes, we must work with the global community to combat climate change by cutting carbon emissions and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and into sustainable energy.yes, we must pass legislation to raise the absurdly low federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of $17 an hour.yes, we must pass the pro act, and make it easier for workers to join trade unions and grow the union movement.yes, in order to help fund the needs of working families in this country, we must demand that the wealthiest people, including those multibillionaires sitting right behind donald trump, start paying their fair share in taxes.yes, we must end a corrupt campaign finance system, which allows a handful of billionaires to buy elections and move us rapidly into oligarchy.bottom line: as we enter the new trump presidency, we have got to remain focused. we can’t panic. no matter how many executive orders he signs and statements he issues, our goal remains the same. we have got to educate. we have got to organize. we have got to bring people together around an agenda that works for all, not just the few.now more than ever, we have to fight to create an america based on economic, social and environmental justice. let’s get to work.bernie sanders is a us senator, and chair of the health, education, labor and pensions committee. he represents the state of vermont, and is the longest-serving independent in the history of congress
