the edward-dean museum & gardensthe edward-dean museum is committed to preserving and protecting its collection of 16th-20th century decorative arts, fine arts, and historical artifacts to enrich its surrounding community and provide a place for social, cultural, and educational enrichment. built by edward eberle and dean stout in 1957, the museum offers a space where art and nature intertwine amidst the picturesque backdrop of idyllic cherry valley. chosen for its proximity to both palm springs and los angeles before the construction of the 10 freeway, this site was designed by our founders to be the perfect blend of nature and art for friends and travelers. edward and dean initially established this as a private museum to showcase their vast collection of art but donated the site to riverside county in 1964. this world-class museum sits nestled among 16 acres of natural beauty, making it the perfect place to sit back, relax, and enjoy nature and beauty.
