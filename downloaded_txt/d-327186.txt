re founder paul ransom, circa 1903

students who agree to attend ransom everglades "believe that they are in the world not so much for what they can get out of it as for what they can put into it. they are unwilling to give up their lives to the selfish pursuit of pleasure. they believe in work and are willing and anxious to do their share of it. they do not shirk the great problems of life, but meet and solve them."
