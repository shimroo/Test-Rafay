event pricing
minor events are $30 for pre-registration, $40- same day at the event, and major events are priced at $40 for pre-registration, $50 for same day. there is no charge for spectators or ride-alongs at the event, all we ask is that they sign a liability waiver at the timing tent.
pre-registration is preferred as it allows us to import the data directly into our timing software ahead of time. you can pre-register and still wait to pay at the track.

autocross registration
we partner with motorsportreg (msr) to fulfill our online registration. msr registration will require a valid credit card to checkout. however, if you select “no” to online payment, the card will not be charged, and you can pay on site. once registered this data imports into our timing equipment to speed up registration. you must be pre-registered to use multi-event passes.
if you’re experiencing any difficulties please contact the autocross chair ax@cumberlandmotorclub.com
