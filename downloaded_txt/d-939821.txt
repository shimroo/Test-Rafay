		              about gbnc		            

		              about us		            

		              the greater boston nepali community (gbnc) is a thriving association of nepalis and friends of nepal living in and around the boston area. over 600 people comprise this diverse group of students, professionals, families and workers. what follows is a brief overview of gbnc, from its roots in the pro-democracy movement of 1990 through its ten years of activities and accomplishments.

this overview focuses on what we - as a community - have done, and the prospects for the future. these events are certainly a large piece of what we are and what binds us together as a cohesive group. however, to truly understand what gbnc is, you must talk with many hundreds who have been in our midst, whether for a week, a year, or many years. every person will have their own stories of what gbnc means to them. indeed, a short essay cannot possibly do justice to over a decade of community interactions - including friendships, marriages, births, transitions, celebrations and solemn moments.		            

		              however, we hope that you will begin to get a sense of who we are, and have the opportunity to reflect on your participation and experiences with gbnc and other nepali communities. perhaps you will even decide to commit yourself to greater participation and support the vital role that community plays in the life of you and your loved ones.
