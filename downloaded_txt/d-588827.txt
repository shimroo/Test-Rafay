naturally advanced biomaterials




ingeo's purpose

ingeo biopolymer is a low carbon, biobased material made from ethically sourced, annually renewable feedstocks. its applications enable multiple circular economy pathways.

sustainability at natureworks 





technology overview

our process starts with greenhouse gas. we use plants to transform greenhouse gases into sugars we can ferment.

how ingeo is made 





applications overview

ingeo polymers and fibers are used to produce products designed for performance and sustainability; from compostable coffee capsules and food serviceware to biobased filament for 3d printing.

how ingeo is applied 








expanding for the future

we’re building a new 75kta fully integrated ingeo™️ polylactic acid (pla) manufacturing complex in thailand with completion expected in the second half of 2025.
