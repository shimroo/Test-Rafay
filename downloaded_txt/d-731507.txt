since 2003 annette has been creating pictorial art quilts that incorporate hand dyed, painted, commercial fabrics, and paint and thread, based on photographs she has taken. her work focuses mainly on nature, including landscapes and flora, but also includes some architectural pieces. her goal is to express her personal experience with a place or subject in a way that gives beauty, peacefulness and a sense of awe to those who view it.
