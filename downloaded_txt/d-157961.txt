click here to take the broadband survey
 
howdy everyone,
liberty county has been advised by the federal government that massive federal grants will be available in 2024 for the enhancement of rural broad band and computer connectivity services. to qualify for these grant funds, liberty county has partnered with the houston-galveston area council of governments (hgac) to conduct a needs assessment survey of the county. this survey determines what various connectivity operating speeds are available to our citizens. i would like to encourage liberty county residents to google h-gac.com and participate in this important broad band survey. when you go to the h-gac web site you will see a large red box titled “regional broadband survey”. just tap on this prompt and the survey document will come up. it is short and simple and is designed primarily to determine the level of connectivity service you are currently receiving from your provider. your help on this item may make it possible for the county to access large amounts of grant funding that will be used for the improvement of computer connectivity services throughout liberty county.

thanks to all in advance for you interest and participation and best wishes to all for a merry christmas and a happy, safe, healthy & prosperous new year in 2024
jay knight
liberty county judge
