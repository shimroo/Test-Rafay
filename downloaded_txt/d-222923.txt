	a celebration of america's sports car
 




an all new corvette in arrives in 2020 with the 8th generation of america’s sports car.

the 2020 corvette from chevrolet
we’ve entered the next stage in the evolution of corvette. i’m not even sure it is an evolution so much as an all-new car.
going from the front-engine and rear-drive format to a mid-engine rear-drive format has changed the car – completely. gone are the days of being in the back half of the car and looking over that long c3 hood. now you are sitting in the front half of the car. now the car pushes you into to the corners instead of pulling you into them. if you’ve ever ridden in the first car of a roller coaster and then the last car, you know how different that can make the experience.
editor david harned in the 2020 corvette coupe
i’ve had an opportunity to spend a little time in the new car at the chicago auto show and i’m very impressed with this car. the cockpit is so immersive and you feel so at one with the car. it does so much but has never been so easy to navigate. all of the surfaces, textures and materials feel high-end. what an amazing automobile.
contributor daniel thomas and editor david harned discuss the features of the 2020 corvette
the starting price of under $60k usd is also incredible to be sure. that much performance and technology as well as a premium interior in a car that is more than half the price of its competitors. the corvette engineers have done it again. crushed it. knocked it out of the park. what’s more, within the next 5 or so years, you’ll be able to get supercar performance for less than $30k as a used car. incredible!
for 1953 and 1954 the corvette was powered by an in-line 6 cylinder engine. an available v8 in 1955 changed the car entirely i’d bet as it took a huge leap forward in both driving dynamics and performance (99% of orders in 1955 opted for the v8). we’ve done it again with the introduction of the 8th generation 2020 corvette. 64 years in the last format. i wonder what’s going to happen in the next 64 years of corvette?
