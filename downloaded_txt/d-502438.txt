there is only one database used by the insurance companies to set dental fees. this is it.



why buy a fee database at all?with the correct numbers (fees) you can maximize profits and acceptance.



why buy this one?our product is the only one with the actual numbers used by the insurance companies to pay you.



why buy this one right now?not to decide is to decide. you are leaving money on the table. know the numbers!
