leave us a reviewgreat ride!we loved this trip! such a great way to see the area between skagway and juneau. the boat ride was lovely, food tasty (and local!), and whales plentiful! 3 hours in juneau was just enough time to see the downtown, have some lunch, and get back on the boat. we were lucky enough to have seen both humpback and orcas. highly recommend this trip. – megansee all reviews1990-202535 years in business cruising the waters of lynn canal serving the independent traveler1990-2025
