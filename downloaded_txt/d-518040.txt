tortuguero canals
tortuguero national park is you must stop while in costa rica. discover its network of canals, lagoons and dense rainforests and see the turtles hatch. the park stretches north along the caribbean coast up to the village of tortuguero, which has a small population of around 500, no cars, and is located on a relatively narrow spit of land between the beach and a canal.

just north of tortuguero are the various lodges and hotels. all these sections consist of a canal running parallel to the beach on the east, and fed by a maze of serpentine streams and channels from the west.tortuguero national park offers a large variety of hotels and lodges. we selected 11 of them, with whom we operate special packages on a daily basis including transportation, all meals, local tours and taxes.
