simpson weather associates (swa) was established in 1974 and incorporated in 1980. originally founded to deal with fundamental and applied problems in meteorology, swa's environmental consulting has expanded to include areas in airborne- and space-based doppler wind lidar applications, air quality modeling and monitoring, fugitive emissions control, and specialized field measurements, software integration, and instrumentation development. core scientists are augmented by highly experienced and qualified affiliated associates who are called upon to deal with specific problems. a full-time technical and support staff is also expanded periodically by part-time staff drawn from the university of virginia community.
