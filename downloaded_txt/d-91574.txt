what is a fanlisting?

"a fanlisting is simply an online listing of fans of a subject, such as a tv show, actor, or musician, that is created by an individual and open for fans from around the world to join. there are no costs, and the only requirements to join a fanlisting are your name and country. fanlistings do not have to be large sites (although some are) - they are just a place where you can have your name listed along with other fans of the same subject."
