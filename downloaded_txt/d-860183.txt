we are losers.




frank rich on the year we realize how creepy we have become: as of friday morning, "britney spears nude on beach" had been viewed 1,041,776 times by youtube's visitors. the count for youtube video clips tagged with "iraq" was 22,783. not that there is anything wrong with that. but compulsive blogging and free soft-core porn are not, as time would have it, indications of how much you, i and that glassy-eyed teenage boy hiding in his bedroom are in control of the information age. they are indicators instead of how eager we are to flee from brutal real-world information that makes us depressed and angry. this was the year americans escaped as often as they could into their private pleasure pods. so the person of 2006 was indeed you --- yes, you.
