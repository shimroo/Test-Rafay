        basic principles
        simply put, we lose weight if we consume less energy than we use. energy comes from the food and drink that we eat and is measured in calories (cals, cals or kcals). energy is burnt constantly by our bodies, the amount of energy burnt doing a particular activity varies by its intensity.
        assuming that your weight is currently stable, your energy-in and energy-out are equal. to lose weight, this equation needs to be unbalanced, so energy-out is greater than energy-in. naturally, we can achieve this in two ways. we can burn more energy, by doing exercise, or we can consume less energy, by eating fewer calories (note, this need not mean less food by weight or volume).
        for most people losing weight is roughly a 80:20 diet:exercise split, simply because it's a lot easier to deny yourself a ~300kcal slice of cake than walking 2-3 miles to burn it off. you can lose weight without any exercise whatsoever if you wish, but exercise in itself is very good for you either way.
        be realistic
        besides the very basics, you have to be realistic and accept that, if you want to lose weight, youâre going to have to change a few things. possibly the most important realization is that you need to make a lifestyle change. the majority of people need to change their diet, as opposed to go on a diet; reverting to old habits will see you reverting to old body-weights, too.
      


          why our programs get you fast results - safely.
        
        fad diets don't work. often fad diets are referred to a yo-yo diets because your body weight goes
        up and down with each and every fad diet you try. you may take the weight off (sometimes with
        unpleasant side effects) but, you don't have the tools to keep it off for good so your weight
        goes back up. with herbal magic, you will lose weight quickly, safely (with no unpleasant side
        effects) and keep it off. each herbal magic weight loss program combines real food, personal
        coaching, and natural health products. it is the combination of these important elements that
        gives you weight loss results, quickly and safely. there are three steps to help you lose weight
        and keep it off, for good:
        we'll give you the tools to achieve:

        your personal goals
