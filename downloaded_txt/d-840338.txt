our client’s testimonial 









this will be my first time participating so i am excited about it! everything has been seamless and so easy to get started. we can’t wait to get our fundraiser off the ground!






jakeitha










i have been working with midland fundraising for the past three years for all of the fundraisings i do at haviland middle school. during that time, they have been incredibly efficient, courteous, and professional. i organize fundraisers for two groups that have about 150 students combined. each time i do a new fundraiser, they get me all my forms and materials quickly and takes the time to explain what i need to do. she makes my job very easy by providing me with step-by-step instructions and giving me tips on how to make our event successful. always very polite and friendly and doesn’t hesitate to send me new copies of papers that i misplace (multiple times). although i’ve never met her face-to-face, i feel that mysti is a wonderful, reliable contact of mine and i’m grateful that she is in charge of my fundraising needs.






breeanne p.










i am writing to express my pleasure of working with midland fundraising. for the past two and half years, i have used midland for fundraising for my school soccer team. they have been so helpful and always ready to assist from the beginning of my experiences with the company. mysti has always been my representative and has always been available for questions and help with orders. she is very prompt with replies to my emails and very thorough with my questions. mysti has helped with things such as adding tax to our orders since we are a food taxing state (meeting district fundraising guidelines), and she always checks up on our sales and if we need anything at all. she has been very helpful with the selection of products and followed up on all aspects from contract correctness, delivery dates and times, delivered items, and if we will continue to use the company in the future. mysti oliver has been so good and helpful to me that i have referred her to other coaches and teachers at my school to use for their fundraisers! i would recommend her to anyone! she has made my experiences simple and painless!






coach maggie










we have had two great experiences working with midland fundraising. we were a bit skeptical at first about working with a company halfway across the country, but it has not been an issue. mysti has worked with us closely, always working to satisfy both our group and our customers. the products have been of good quality, and any issues with breakage or wrong item have been taken care of immediately. we were happy to find a company that offered items at 50% profit in brochure format, too.






chris c.










“your company has been a pleasure to work with. after years of selling candy bars, my environmental council group was looking for a company that sold high-quality products that were eco-friendly. i am so glad that we found you! i am completely satisfied with the products we have ordered but more importantly, in the high standards of customer service from you. from the very first phone calls and e-mail exchanges with you – i have found you to be helpful, cheerful and so efficient. you took care of any concerns i had with a professional yet personal touch. nowadays, many companies don’t take the time to ensure customer satisfaction; but not with you. i have always been treated respectfully, and you keep in contact with me throughout the fundraising process. i still marvel at your efficiency – especially the one and only time there was a mix-up with one of my student’s orders. you were with me every step of the way, making things right for him and his customer. i can’t praise you enough. i have dealt with many vendors over my 26years of teaching and you and your company tops all of them for customer satisfaction,courtesy, and professionalism! i have complimented you many times over the last few years for your professionalism and outstanding customer service that goes well above and beyond in every sense of the word. you have humbly and graciously accepted it but i can tell that you truly have a sense of pride and accomplishment in all that you do so you say that no ‘thanks’ are necessary. but in this economy, people can choose to go anywhere for their fundraising needs and you have kept me coming back to your company.”
