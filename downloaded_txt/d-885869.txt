we make it easy for groups to discover ireland



























‚Äúa powerful and unique educational experience for our students‚Ä¶‚Äù 



jason gappa - berkshire school ma



we are into our third decade of designing and delivering bespoke educational programmes for students from across the world who want to discover ireland.  we started in 2001, the very week of 9/11.  we have seen currency crisis come and go, foot & mouth control, pandemics, brexit and teachers retire and move on.  students who were approaching 20 then are now approaching 50!simply put, we love designing these programmes and we love creating opportunities for students to discover, explore, enjoy and learn from the great wealth of what the island of ireland has to offer, be that history, literature, performing arts, recreation, or our speciality, peace studies.if you are thinking about bring a group [students or others], to ireland, then email me at info@uisce.org.  i shall be delighted to help you achieve that dream.   meanwhile, take a minute to read what our customers say - a sample of the feedback we love to get.keith mcnair, proprietor, discovery tours & founding director, uisce.
