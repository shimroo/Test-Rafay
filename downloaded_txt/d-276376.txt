						what our clients say
					

 



trail tire in yeg in 144 ave and 127 are kings and queens amongst men. booked my appointments for winter tires for both vehicles a month or so ago. and... read more low and behold appointment day also becomes first snowfall work day. if you are edmontonian you know that the first snowfall every year means people completely forgot how to drive to conditions. so i sat and listened as these folks took countless phone calls from panicked people looking for appointments because somehow winter snuck up on them. with patience and professionalism they handled every call…even the one where you could tell the customer was insistent that his block heater cord charges his battery so he couldn’t understand why his car wouldn’t start this morning despite being plugged in all night. and at the end of it…when my car was ready i noticed something hadn’t been done. without complain and still with smiles (and again this is after 3 hours of non-stop phone calls) they quickly corrected the oversight. i was on my way and would recommend this shop for anyone who needs new tires. just make your appointment early and know whether your winter tires are on their own rims or not. 😄
