about us



after uncovering seven layers of wallpaper during their cape cod renovation in 1937, dorothy and clifford waterhouse stumbled upon various hand-blocked prints, royal seals, and lovely designs with charming colorways. this embarked dorothy’s love of original and historical wall hangings. after further discussion and collaboration with artist binnie wilson, dorothy’s passion turned into a business. waterhouse wallhangings was born in 1950 through her first collection, waterhouse documentary collection of wallpaper and matching fabrics. click the link below to read our full history.
