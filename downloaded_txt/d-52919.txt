ian martin allison“dude…so i recently played my lull 5 at a gig i regularly play with a different bass. huge, space-filling 3d note image, lots of compliments on the tone, and at the end of the night the engineer told me to never bring my old bass again..”




darryl anders“bottom line…mike lull basses are truly my voice and this bass in particular i feel is very special. i got the same rush when i plugged it in that i got from my very first lull bass almost 12 years ago. you keep this up, i’ll be broke and/or divorced…lol. nobody makes a better bass.”
