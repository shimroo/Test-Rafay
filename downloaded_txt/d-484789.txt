			 **please note** when south 
			carolina became a state in 1785, the governmental units were called 
			counties and remained so named until 1800 when the designation 
			county was changed to district. in 1868 the name district was 
			changed back to county, which name has been in use since then. the 
			name of the governmental area changed at these dates but not its 
			function.

earlier, alternate 
				designations for this area include 


cambridge district

camden district

craven county

ninety six district



pendleton district

pinckney district

st. mark's parish

washington district




		for the era prior to 1785, don't forget to check records filed in 
		charleston (or charles town) as that was the seat of colonial government 
		and the place where legal documents were recorded. prior to the early 
		1800's, north carolina also claimed the northern portion of the south 
		carolina piedmont. so, some of the early records will be found in tryon 
		county and mecklenburg county as well as the colonial and state records 
		of north carolina.
