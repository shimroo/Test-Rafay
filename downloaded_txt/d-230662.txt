a brief history of audubon in california

audubon california was established in 1996 as a field program of the national audubon society, overseeing the organization's properties and leading conservation efforts. but our work in california goes back to the earliest days of the national organization, even before its formal founding. audubon's legacy of conservation and activism in the golden state establishes it as a force for conservation along the pacific flyway.
