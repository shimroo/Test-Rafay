larry worked with our architect to get the rustic patina we were looking for and our floors came out perfect. it was a pleasure to work with the folks from heartwood pine floors.

our history
heart pine is the finest lumber ever grown. early american settlers discovered a vast forest of over 95 million acres spanning from the southern atlantic shoreline to the mississippi river. this forest grew trees four feet in diameter and up to 150 feet tall. these slow-growth heartwood pine trees matured in 400 to 500 years.
