reading medical reversal showed me i was not cynical enough regarding medical matters





if you count the first year of medical school until now i have been thinking
about medical matters for over 60 years.with the background of private practice
of internal medicine in the 1970s my "journey" as a patient through the
corporatized medical labyrhynth of a large medical hospital system with and ehr
replete with bogus physical exam reports left me as cynical and resentful as
possible, or so i thought but after reading medical reversal i found my
cynicism soaring to new heights. my cynicism is at least on two levels -1.the
indidual generalist's lack of medical knowledge and 2 the level of accepted
medical practices that are either harmful of ineffective.it is this second level
that cefu and prasad address in their book "medical reversal" some of the
material they discuss is old hat such as the cast trial,and the injection of
material into collapsed vertebra and the hormone treatment of women but there is
more discussed in the book,including the controversey regarding tamiflu,the lack
of utility of a widely used anti sepsis treatment,the sham trial disproving the
value of internal mammary ligation,the sham trial showing the lack of value of
meninsectomy for degerative meniscus tear,and the reversal of the popular
treatment for sepsis. "no matter how cynical you become its never enough to keep
up" lilly tomlin.

why so many more eye drops post cataract surgery in us  than europe





in many european countries a singe intra eye injection of cefuroxime is used
instead of multiple topical antibiotic drops.there seems to be no doubt in
the eye surgery literature that this "intracameral" injection is very effective
reducing the risk of infection by some 4 or 5 fold and seeminly make the use
of post op antibiotic eye drops unnecessary 

so why in europe and not in us? it may have to do with the lack of availablity 
of an intra ocular injection form of cefuroxime in us and the drug company profit from
dispensing lots of eye drops.

alexander hamilton on those who generate chaos





“those then, who resist a confirmation of public order, are the true artificers of monarchy—not that this is the intention of the generality of them. yet it would not be difficult to lay the finger upon some of their party who may justly be suspected. when a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the advantage of military habits—despotic in his ordinary demeanour—known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty—when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the cry of danger to liberty—to take every opportunity of embarrassing the general government & bringing it under suspicion—to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day—it may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may “ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.”




dr. bandy x lee former yale psychiatrist was fired from yale because she believed her duty to warn
trumped ( pun intended) the goldwater rule.her book title is the dangerous case of donald trump.she
knew djt was riding his own storm .

are physicians losing their sense of ownership of their patient's care





are physicians losing thier sense of owndership of their patients care?

i believe so. physicans' language demonstated their care or commtment to their patient as least when i trained
and when i was in private practice. we would say to a consultant could you see my patient.
or i saw your patient  today.the language spoke of their commitment.

in the corporatized medical setting in which i was treated last year physicians did not
personally refer me to another physician.rather they entered a order into the ehr and 
then required me to call and make an appointment.

when i was in private practice in a large sub speciliaty internal medicine group, i would call an collegue about a referal
or my nurse would contact the physcian's nurse and either way the urgency or lack thereof was
transmitted and what took me six weeks to see the next physician in this new world of effecient  
 corporatized medicine would have takeen 2 or 3
days at the most. further i would be anxious to learn of the consutant's views which would
typically be expressd in a phone call or a coffee room conversation.the gi docs would wanted 
a ent consult for me  had no sense of when if ever a consultation reort would be available. out of
sight out of mind. no sense of personal ownership was there.since perhaps with that ownership
there may have also been a pride of owndership that is lost in the new medical world where
suits dictate efficiency.

should nonselective his bundle pacing be called " so called' ?





should non selective his bundle  pacing be called “so called 
non selective his bundle pacing” ?. the publications (1) of  dr rehan
malmud makes a case for just that.

mahmud suggests the possibility that the conduction is actually
conduction though concealed pathways and suggests that the pathway
is  the superior septal connection that were initially described by mahaim.

the theory of his pacing is lbbb is often due to discrete lesions in the
his bundle and that the lead is then placed distal to the block thereby correcting 
the bundle branch block.this concept is hard to reconcile with several  studies
that describe the pathology of lbbb consisting of multiple lesions in the his bundle and
in the branches.how could scattered lesions in the bundle branches be correction by stimulating
the his bundle?

 are there  growing hazards to your health when venture capital buys medical practices






the spread of corporatized medicine does not just pose threats to patient care but also 
to those delivering the care, most prominently the physicians and nurses.that harm has
been labelled moral injury and is described in the book written by dr wendy dean and dr simon
talbot after their ideas were introduced in a stat article in 2018. dr.dean speaks of " a death
of a thousand cuts" 

it is demoralizing to consider  that the road to be a decsion maker in medicine is not
med school residency and fellowship but an enginering  degreee,and a business degree and
to the brightest or best connected  to get a chance to have a gig at mckensey and then on to venture capital.

my rudimentary knowledge of venture capital is that the vc folks buy a business and then organize it to cut cost and make more money so that the business can be sold at a profit after a few years.employees are a compnay's greatest cost so often employees are fired.it is hard to imaginin that at a medical practice undergoingthe venture capital dust up can be good for either the now employed physicans or the patients.

the attack on science and medicine makes  more sense after reading jason stanley on fascism 





i was puzzled as to why someone would verbally attack dr.peter hotez and
threaten him with physical violence. what problem could they have with someone who co
developed( along with dr. maria bottazzi) a covid vaccine ( corbevax) and
arranged to have it avaialble to millions of people .

 two of maga's big socialinflencers ( steve bannon and roger stone ) have attaced hotez with bannon's
 words triggering a wave of anti semetic attacks on the physician scientist who
has been co-nominated for the noble prize for his work on a covid vaccine. what
does all of that have to do with professor stanley work on fascism? stanley tells
us what fascism is all about. according to stanley the right wing attack on the free press and the
scientific community is stanard operating procedure for fascist movement sincethe
fascist leader needs to destroy the legitimacy of anyone who might oppose his
views.

from day 1 trump attempted to denigrate the press.the attack on the
scientific and the medical professions came a bit later. "fake news" has been
the often repearted claim for anything the press says that runs counter to
trump's version.

inflation is not just egg  prices how about echocardiogram price hikes





echocardiogram prices at at least one large megtropolitan hospital system in a
large southern city,have accelerated impressively over the last year.

a family member had an echo last year and again recently. last year's
prices was $1461 and this year $4715 plus an $ 69 interpretation charge .
pulmonary function test at the same well known facility was $ 3871. 

charges for outpatient imaging procedures are much higher than in imaging centers and echos
are magnitudes cheaper in cardiologist offices,



several web sites that monitorcharges reported echo fees in cardiologist offices magnitudes lower than in the
hostials echo labs, i.e. in the order of less than $500 in the same city as my
family members fee of close to five thousand dollars. several years ago anthem
insurance company said they would no longer pay for imaging procedures for
outpatients done in hospitals.

what retired doc learned from economics





from leamers book on maco
humans are pattern seeking story telling creatures.

economics cannot provide the level of certitude that the experimental sciences provide.the best it can do is look for patterns and then tell stories.

what if physics were like economics from jim manzi uncontrolled:the surprising payoff of trial-and-error for business, politics and society.

and how those stories vary-eg milton friedman and there is no free lunch versus the better than a free lunch claim that fiscal stimulus in an economy which has less than full employment will give a free lunch and will generate stillmore free lunches.(this from the advice that arose fromthe work of lerner and hansen taking keynes thought and turning them into just about the coolest tool a politician or elected official could have ever received.)

it began with ayn rand and may have ended up  on life support with covid19 and  how humans have reacted





it (my general political-philosophical set of beliefs) really did begin with ayn rand, first reading"capitalism, the unknown ideal " and then devouring atlas shrugged and fountainhead.by late adulthoodmy political-philosophical beliefs were fairly well settled in to be.1)strong belief in the importance of private property and rule of law and contract law and limited government and that central planning was for the most part a bad game plan2)support for the kindergarten lesson of "don't mess with other people or their stuff". 3)individual freedom was important and the libertarian non-aggression axiom seemed like a good maxim;4) the history of the 20th century made it quite clear that economic central planning as in communist ussr and china was a disastrous idea leading to the death of millions of people. i generally felt fairly comfortable in my self chosen set of reassuring voices in a my echo chamberconsisting of various blogs,books and podcasts and u tube sites until recently.  coincident with the covid pandemc,some of the web sties, and  blogs which over the year s have been reliable dispensers of austrian economic dogma  and general libertarian thought have with an alarming frequency published pseudo-scientific hogwash in regard to the covid 19 pandemic. one such posting denied the validity of current concept of viruses putting forth instead the bizarre notion that what are called viruses are actually waste products of cellular damage brought about by various type of  electromagnetic waves. all of the pseudoscientific is not quite as bat-sh**tcrazy as this denial of basic biologic knowledge but some are very close. for example, the claim that wearing a mask will lead to carbon dioxide retention and that mask wearing will lower your immune response , both claims lacking in scientific proof .the covid pandemic has spotlighted the conflict between the common good and individual freedom.  nicholas talib's comment seemed to an effort to  settle the apparent conflict when he said to remember that the principle underlying libertarian ,axiom , is the non aggression axiom. if you believe that there is asymptomatic transmission of   a potentially serious  and potentially fatal disease the transmission of which can be significantly  mitigated by wearing a mask, then you need to wear a mask to conform with libertarian basic axiom if  you cannot socially distance .to not wear a mask with those assumptions in mind is to disregard or dismiss the non aggression  moral imperative as you are taking an aggressive act against strangers and or friends. however, it seems that there a number of vocal libertarian and libertarian leaning conservatives who do not agree with some or all of the following assumptions1) there is a covid 19 pandemic2)covid 19 is spread by respiratory droplets and aerosols and fomites3) masks will mitigate the spread of covid 19 4)social distancing will mitigate the spread of covid 195) viral vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective and have provided a "herd immjnity" for a a number of viral illnesses there is are a number of vocal libertarians and libertarian leaning conservative who believe or at least espouse some or all of he following:1.the pandemic is a hoax2 covid vaccine is a means of population control

can recent innovations in health care delivery be explained in the context of baumol's disease 





note this blog post is the first of a joint authorship with chatgpt and me.

can recent innovations in health care delivery be explained in the context of baumol's disease?

the following is what chatgpt said in regard to the title question 

"while there is no single solution to address the cost disease in healthcare, several strategies have been proposed and implemented to mitigate its effects. here are a few examples:

technological innovation and telemedicine: advancements in technology, such as telemedicine and digital health solutions, can improve the efficiency and accessibility of healthcare services. telemedicine allows for remote consultations, reducing the need for physical visits and lowering costs associated with in-person care.

task-shifting and delegation: healthcare providers can optimize their workforce by delegating certain tasks to other healthcare professionals or utilizing non-physician personnel, such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants. this helps to improve productivity and reduce costs by efficiently utilizing the skills and capabilities of different healthcare professionals.

preventive care and chronic disease management: emphasizing preventive care and proactive management of chronic diseases can lead to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs in the long run. by focusing on early intervention and preventive measures, healthcare resources can be allocated more efficiently, potentially mitigating rising costs associated with advanced or emergency care.

health information technology (hit) adoption: widespread adoption of electronic health records (ehrs) and health information exchange systems can enhance coordination and reduce redundancies in healthcare services. efficient data sharing and interoperability can help healthcare providers make more informed decisions, reduce medical errors, and improve overall productivity.

payment reforms and value-based care models: shifting from fee-for-service reimbursement models to value-based care models incentivizes healthcare providers to focus on quality and outcomes rather than the volume of services provided. these models promote efficiency, care coordination, and cost containment while aiming to improve patient outcomes.

collaboration and integration: encouraging collaboration and integration among healthcare providers, such as forming accountable care organizations (acos) or healthcare networks, can improve coordination, reduce duplication of services, and streamline healthcare delivery. this integration can help optimize resource allocation and improve overall productivity.

.
note chatgpt's strategies  should be considered in most instances as aspiration.

covid 19 2022 101 -the basics





three  basics emerge as we enter year three of a pandemic that has claimed 900.000 lives in the united states" covid 19 is a respiratory virus that spreads by aerosols and there is asymptomatic spread as well as symptomatic spread and a significant amount oif the spread is from high spread events aa super spreader events 1) effective masks prevent infection (n 95 or equivalent )2)vaccines prevent serious disease and death to a large degree but vaccines do not prevent infection.3)vaccine effectiveness wanes over a period of months and booster are required as does immunity acquired by infection corollaries. vaccines do not prevent infection. to the extent masks prevent spread of infection they will naturally prevent death and serious illnesses. mask effectiveness does not wane.the protection afforded by vaccines and by contracting covid 19 wanes over time. boosters are necessary.unless and until a vaccine that prevents infection is developed the human experience with covid will depend on the mutations that occur with covid and the development and availability  of safe and effective treatments given promptly after a rapid diagnosis. if covid mutates to a gentler affliction no more than a bad cold or mild to moderate severe flu,,, great.  but if the mutation history of covid continues as it has so far , we are not through with covid no matter how much folks pretend that is the case. mutations will continue , infection and  surges will continue and boosters will be needed. mutations may arise as they have so far that have varying degrees of  vaccine escape and varying degrees of virulence. the polio vaccine prevented infection by blocking gi tract mucosal invasions and until humans develop a vaccine that protects against covid invading the nasal mucosa or develop a vaccine that is effective against all corona viruses we are not going to say that we are through with covid.

new data on angio invasive follicular thyroid cancer necessitates change in ata guidelines





with the publication of an article from japan involving study of 303 cases of
encapsulated angioinvasive ftc the current ata risk classification of
angioinvasive into those with four or more instance of angioinvasion ( deemed
high risk) and those with three or less (deemed low risk) needs to be revised.


the ata risk classification is low, intermediate and high and the
recommendations for each vary considerably.the current guidelines indicate that
a patient with 4 or more angio invasions is high risk and a patient with 3 0r less foci of angioinvasion 
is consdiered low risk and therfore not needing remant ablation.

yamazaki et (1) reviewed 290 cases of ftc with angioinvasion (ai).these patients were
free of metastasis at presentation and were seen at the
ito hosptial from 2005 to 2014.

disease free survival in those with one ai had a 94.9 % 10 year dfs while a patient with 4 or more had a 83% dfs,

those with ai of 1-3 had a dfs of 86.3 while patients with 4 or more had a dfs of 83.3 
this is not statistically significant. patients with angioinvasion of less than 4 are consdiered low risk by the ata criteria
yamazaki' data show there is not a prognostic  difference between a patient with three and 
a patient with four foci of ai .

thyrotrophin suppression to prevent thyroid cancer recurrence 





fron reading the amercan thyroid association;s thyroid cancer guidlines i had assumed that
the notion that tsh supression to reduce risk of cancer recurrence was both widely accepted and
clearly demonstrated by underlying mechanistic studies and by emperical clinical data. the notion
is widely accepted but a mechanistic rational is controversal with there being in vitro data
that both support and deny the role of tsh in cancer growth and emperical data are contradictory.

a 1998 report from the ntctcs (cooper ds,thyroid 1998)tsh suppresion  was independly associated with disease progression in high risk patients but only in univariate analysis and not in multivariant models.

a 2007 report from ntctcs (jonklass j, et al ) which was said  by the authors to be the first to show superior outocme with thst they reported improved outcomes in high risk patients ( stage 111 and iv)

the 2015 report (carhill, aa etd al ) from ntctcs 
 recomended "moderate" but not " aggresssive therapy"  moderate was defined as a tsh 
level 2 -2.9 with aggresssive 1.0 to 1.99,.they found no additional benefit with the aggessive therapy
and recommended at least three years of thst in high risk patients

kekebew et al have published data that challenged the  paradigm which indicates suppressive
therapy for thyroid cancer patients with either high or intermediate risk.

the issue becomes a more high leverage decision ( a currently popular basevball jaron term ) in elderly patients as 
.as the cardiac risks are of concern and in women the bone loss issue .basically tsh supression means the iatrogenic
generation of subclinical hyperthroidism,a condition that is not comletely benign.

klubo-gwiezdzinske et al studied retrospectively  1012 cases of dtc (41 with follicular) treated with near total thyroidectomy 
and remnant ablation and found no improvement in pfs ( authors state their study was under powered to detect a difference in os)
in intermediate and high risk dtc with tsh suppression.( association of thyrotropin suppression with survival outcomes in patients
with interemediate and high risk differentiated thyroid cancer. jama opoen network oncology 2019 2 (2) e 1187754

was the old time medical ethics just an artifact of economics?





this is a redo of an earlier essay with minimal editorial change. i repeat it now with a nagging thought that "that ship has sailed some time ago" the concern i espressed several years ago has increased as medicine has become corporatized and a target for private equity.
__________________


can the traditional, medical-ethical prime directive of placing the individual patient's interest first survive in a financial environment in which physician autonomy is greatly diminished and income for most physicians is controlled by third party payers. not to mention the heavy hand of venture capital buying medical practices. 

more broadly put, dr. edmund d. pellegrino asked in 1995 (jama,may 24/31,1995,vol 273,no 20,)

" is medical ethics a social, historical, or economic artifact? or are there some universal , enduring principles?"

in 1988, hall and berenson writing in the annals of internal medicine said that "the traditional [ethical ] ideal" was no longer compatible with the changed practice reality that "existing insurance contracts and manged care arrangements define for physicians."

we propose that devotion to the best interests of each individual be replaced with an ethic of devotion to the best interests of the group for which the physician is personally responsible."

incredibly, the authors claimed that this shift in ethical focus would actually increase patient trust, an attribute that even in the late 80's was in decline as patients tried to live (sometimes literally) with the hmo's restrictions to medical care. incredibly, they claimed that by not having the patient's interest as the prime directive there would be increased trust in their physician.

the expected wave of letters to the annals editors expressed the belief that advocacy for the individual patient was the prime directive and what it was all about and to replace it was to effectively do away with medical ethics as it had been known and practiced for a very long time. this is what would be expected from an audience of internists who had grown up medically inculcated with an ethic which was the polar opposite of what the authors proposed. practicing internists at that time were reared to believe that the physician was completely and ultimately responsible for their patients and that their primary duty was to the patient.

the average practicing internist if they read the article at all may have thought this was the contrived advocacy of someone who was attempting to make manged care appear ethical. all that was required was to turn medical ethics on its head.when i read that article i thought "you've gotta to be kidding me".

a few years later ,i saw no one was kidding as the acp, abim and the european federation of internal medicine joined forces to formulate what was called the new professionalism in which physicians were admonished to do more than maximize the health of all the patients in their hmo, which was as far as the annals authors went. now, physicians were told that they had an ethical obligation to strive for social justice. this joint effort by several medical organizations was said to be necessary as the "old ethic" needed to be revised to align itself with the new economic environment in which physicians now lived and "medicine's commitment to the patient was being challenged by external forces of change within our society".

while the 1988 article's authors stopped short of suggesting physicians should conserve resources for others in society at large and not just concern themselves with their own hmo's population, the new ethics or professionalism as it was now called, headlined social justice raising it to the level of the big three ethical precepts-patient welfare, patient autonomy and social justice.more than one observer has asked does precept three conflict with precept one?

the era from 1963 to about 1990 has been termed the time of "retail medical care". physicians and patients enjoyed the situation in which a patient's insurance followed the patient so that he could choose any physician and the physicians' fees were not set by the insurer but largely were set by what the physician considered and the payer agreed to be "reasonable,customary,and prevailing".

things were good for physicians in those days as not only was physician autonomy largely unchallenged,but also medicare had brought about a large influx of money to be spent largely at the discretion of the doctor and their patients and exciting new diagnostic and therapeutic tools were available. more could be done for your patients and more patients could afford medical care. referrals could be based on the physician's knowledge of the area consultants and prescriptions were written without concern for some third party's list of permissible choices. but soon things were to change as the era of "wholesale medicine" replaced the old ways with the hmo now being a middleman-a very powerful middleman- and medicare imposed wage and price controls on medical services.

a series of articles was published in 1995 in jama authored by dr. david eddy that discussed the metrics and merits of decision analysis which he hailed to be a mechanism that could perform magic. the magic was to increase quality of medical care while reducing cost. but it was all merely playing with words and defining words to suit the argument. eddy defined quality as the greatest medical good for the greatest number within the eco-medical collective (aka hmo). it did not go unnoticed to the skeptical reader that dr. eddy listed his affiliation as "kaiser permanente of southern california")

pellegrino in 1995 also asked ...can physicians change the ethics of the profession at will ( as proposed by berenson and hall) or is there a more fundamental and universal foundation for the ethics of medicine in the special nature of the physician-patient relationship? 

pellegrino's quotes are found in an article entitled "guarding the integrity of medical ethics-some lessons from soviet russia" . the subversion of medical ethics in russia suggested to pellegrino two lessons. 1) corruption will afflict any health system not designed with care of the patient as the its primary driving force. 2) medical ethics must be independent of political exigency. "... a morally responsive profession is an indispensable safeguard for the sick against the statistical morality of utilitarian politics, even in democracies."

the statistical morality of utilitarian analysis seems to be increasingly unopposed as the group outcome derived data plays an increasingly large role in the decisions regarding the individual patient exhibited in part as guidelines executed by mid level practitioners as well as physicians. in this new day, the physician has more to worry about that just her patient, she must be concerned for everyone (as allegiance to social justice would demand) but at least she has been removed from the impossible role of being responsible for every aspect of his patient's well being as she is now (merely) a member of a team or perhaps the host of a medical home and part of a system of health care. it takes a village now to treat a patient.
______________
with increasing pressure for a single payer health care system and talk about a federal health board to determine what should/shall be done, the statistical morality of utilitarianism seems more and more on the ascendancy. as much as i do not want to believe it, more and more i am afraid that the old medical ethics may well have been and is now the "artifact of economics" about which pelligrino speculated.
