water filters, water purifiers, and water softeners, 
since 1989 


providing "pure 
water at down-to-earth prices" for 21 years!








pureearth has been offering a complete line of hi-tech home water
filters, purifiers, and softeners since 1989 - on the internet since 1996. we're an established, profitable, debt-free company - not
an upstart "dot com / dot go" company. neither are we someone selling water 
filters as a "hobby" or as a "side-line" business to make a fast buck. we are 
truly committed to the water treatment industry, and are a member of 
the water quality association. 
we are committed to selling only the finest products while 
offering the most knowledgeable and professional advice. you can
buy your water filter with confidence from pureearth!
we purchase top-quality components from respected industry-leading suppliers to assemble our water filters.  this allows us to sell our products at down-to-earth factory-direct prices - 
up to 40% off list price. there are no "hidden" costs - shipping is free  
on orders of $99 or more (anywhere in 
continental u.s.), only $8.95 on orders less than $99!!

our water filter line uses the latest technologies (kdf ® and gac, 
ceramic, capillary membrane, extruded carbon block and more) 
to effectively and economically turn your tap water into pure, safe, delicious drinking water. 
	they remove chlorine, chloramines, heavy metals (including lead, mercury, 
chromium 6, cadmium), fluoride, chemicals, dbps (disinfection by-products), thms 
(trihalomethanes), haas ((haloacetic acids), vocs, and mtbe. our ceramic and capillary membrane technology removes bacteria and cysts from your water!
water filter configuration options include counter-top water filters, under-counter water filters, refrigerator/ice-maker water filters, shower water filters, and whole house water filters.

important notice: pharmaceuticals/personal care products (ppcps) found in our 
nation's drinking water has been in the
news lately. according to findings of the epa and european union's poseidon project, 
"activated carbon is a powerful process to remove ppcps. only a limited number 
of ppcps, such as iodinated contrast media and the antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole 
show insufficient affinity to activated carbon."  our filters and reverse 
osmosis systems use the highest grade coconut shell activated carbon which has 
the best chemical adsorption rates. 

we also offer reverse osmosis systems for areas that have a high
	mineral content in their water (very hard water). dissolved mineral
	concentrations above 300 mg/l (ppm) will give the water a bitter
	taste. water filters (ours included) will not improve this taste, because 
	they do not remove dissolved minerals. we can test your water if you
	are uncertain.
for areas with hard water, we offer  a complete line of water softeners!
	for bacteriological purification of well water (or "questionable" city water) we offer 
	capillary membrane, ceramic, and ultra-violet technologies.
	we also offer products for other well problems: acidic water, iron, sulphur,
	high sediment, tannins, nitrates, and more. 

not sure what your water problems are? our do-it-yourself water test kits let
you test your own water to see what water filter, purification or softening products you really need!
