about xandex


xandex inc. was incorporated august 22, 1980, by three 
fairchild semiconductor employees and their friends. the founders shared the 
classic silicon valley entrepreneurial spirit -- a desire to create and develop 
their own start-up.
the 
original company product -- the first of its type in the arena of semiconductor 
wafer testing -- was the diemark® disposable-cartridge inker. the diemark®  system enabled deposition of up to 150,000 uniform, round ink dots, as small as the width of a human hair, from a single pre-filled, pre-tuned cartridge. the cartridge itself was disposable, consistent, easy to install, use and replace. today, diemark®  products have worldwide distribution throughout north america, the eu and asia.
in january of 1982, kamran shamsavari joined xandex as president. the shamsavari family provided funding and leadership in bringing the first diemark products to market. leading semiconductor manufacturers immediately accepted the diemark concept. texas instruments became the first diemark customer and others soon followed. today xandex is the recognized industry leader for wafer marking solutions worldwide.
as semiconductor test technology evolved, xandex initiated multiple r&d projects to develop new test solutions and commercialize new technologies in the areas of probe card transport, test head to prober/handler docking and high fidelity electrical interconnects. the resulting products gained wide acceptance with oems and are in service around the world. for more information on xandex semiconductor products, visit www.xandexsemi.com.
always driven to discover and develop technology, the company has, over the years, made passive investments in promising tech start-ups as opportunities presented themselves. in 2005, the company formalized all investment activity by organizing a wholly owned subsidiary, xandex investments llc, which does business as xandex ventures. xandex ventures is now an active venture capital investor with a growing portfolio of companies. for more information visit  www.xandexventures.com.
from the company's origins as a tech startup in the early 1980's to its current expansion into new and exciting robotics and renewable energy products and services, xandex has based its success on integrity in our relationships, technological innovation, respect for the environment, and quality in everything we do. the xandex quality managment and environmental management systems are modeled after iso 9001:2015 and iso 14000:2015. xandex was one of the first companies of its size when it was  certified, in 1997, by the national standards authority of ireland. for more information on the xandex quality system,  click here

guiding principles
the guiding principles listed below are the core values that shape our corporate culture.







 
honesty, clarity, timeliness and mutual respect in all of our communications. (click / tap to expand)
                                




                                        xandex practices an "open door" management style that encourages the flow of communication through all levels of the organization. company meetings are held quarterly so that every employee is well informed of our annual and quarterly goals and progress. both formal and informal means are available to all employees in the organization for providing input on improving our processes and practices.  
                                
                            






 innovation, and creativity to provide new and improved products, practices and services. (click / tap to expand)  
                                




                                    xandex has built its reputation on developing and offering new and creative test solutions. by investigating and investing in the latest developments in electronics, materials science, business practices and computer/software technology, xandex continues to be a leader in the development of next generation test solutions. 
                                    
                                    
                                





 a commitment to quality in everything we do. (click / tap to expand)â 




                                in 1997, xandex was among the very few small companies who earned certification in iso 9001 quality standards. in 2018, xandex was certified in the revised iso 9001:2015 standard. in 2024, xandex was re-certified to the latest iso 9001-2015 standard. at our company, quality is not just the function of the quality department. it is ingrained in every aspect of our organization and is the responsibility of each and every employee.
                            






 teamwork among ourselves as well as with our customers and business partners. (click / tap to expand) 
                                




                                a spirit of cooperation exists at xandex. it is evident not only in our internal activities, but also in how we interact with our customers and suppliers. internally, cross-functional teams are the core of our manufacturing, product development and process improvement activities. externally, we partner with our customers and suppliers in finding unique and cost effective designs and test solutions. 
                            






 continuous development of our organization and its people in a healthy and enjoyable environment. (click / tap to expand)  
                                




                                in the competitive and volatile climate of any high tech industry, agility and accuracy (getting it right the first time) are necessities. our managers are routinely challenged to raise the bar for themselves as well as for their staff. we believe that continuous improvement of individuals in our team benefits the entire organization. we often provide opportunities for advancement and promotions from within, as well as encourage personal and professional development by offering financial and educational assistance to all employees. our commitment to providing a safe and healthy work environment is demonstrated by our progressive ergonomics program, which has been recognized in safety magazines. we have cpr and first aid trained safety teams who drive our safety practices, which include quarterly site inspections, emergency practice drills, and ergonomics workstation evaluations. our work environment and safety practices far exceed osha standards. 
                            






 recognizing and rewarding the people and organizations that contribute to our success. (click / tap to expand)  
                                




                                since the time when xandex was a small company, we have tried to provide competitive benefits and compensation for our employees. our salary structure is founded on comparisons with high technology surveys, which represent much larger companies (in revenue and employee level).  our benefits, like fully vested 401k, are considered quite generous for the size of our company. we have shared our profits, our savings from process and safety (workers' compensation cost) improvements, and have always matched or offered better annual merit adjustments than national averages. being a private, family-run business, we give extra care and consideration in looking out for the financial well being of our employees. 
                            






 fairness and ethical conduct in all of our interactions. (click / tap to expand)  
                                




                                we believe that integrity is key in building relationships. our management practices and policies consistently promote fair and ethical conduct. xandex has always been highly diverse and passionate about its zero tolerance policy towards any form of harassment. our policy and value system applies not only to our employees, but also extends to our customer and supplier interactions. 
                            






 caring for the well being of our environment and the community in which we live.
