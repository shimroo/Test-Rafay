ashley judd nails patriarchyher analysis may fall short when it comes to hip hop, but ashley judd just nailed an important part of how patriarchy functions. this comes from a column at the daily beast in which judd responds to criticism of her apparently “puffy” appearance. judd calls out the way the attacks come from women as well as men:that women are joining in the ongoing disassembling of my appearance is salient. patriarchy is not men. patriarchy is a system in which both women and men participate. it privileges, inter alia, the interests of boys and men over the bodily integrity, autonomy, and dignity of girls and women. it is subtle, insidious, and never more dangerous than when women passionately deny that they themselves are engaging in it. this abnormal obsession with women’s faces and bodies has become so normal that we (i include myself at times—i absolutely fall for it still) have internalized patriarchy almost seamlessly. we are unable at times to identify ourselves as our own denigrating abusers, or as abusing other girls and women.

who wants to buy sharon tate’s jewelry?an auction house offers a piece of notorious manson murder history -- but why would someone want it?it’s an oval opal ring, surrounded by garnets. four stones appear to be missing. its estimated value is somewhere between $25,000 and $50,000. and next week, is going up for auction with gotta have rock and roll with the opening bid of $10,000.what is it that makes this particular piece of jewelry so potentially valuable? is it the elegance of the piece? is it the fact that it was purchased by an internationally renowned, oscar-winning director? or is it because the ring was allegedly worn by his pretty, pregnant wife the night she was savagely murdered by the manson family?labels: celebrity sedu hairstyles

"twilight” actress kristen stewart has apologized for making a series of “stupid” and “insensitive” comments about rape – admitting she “made an enormous mistake.”the 20-year-old actress sparked a storm of controversy with her remarks in a recent interview with britain’s elle magazine, in which she likened the media intrusion in her life to sexual assault. she told the magazine, “i feel like i’m looking at someone being raped. a lot of the time i can’t handle it. i never expected that this would be my life.”her comments infuriated bosses at charity campaigners and rape victims support organizations, who accused the young star of belittling violence against women. and now stewart has been forced to apologize, calling her behavior “stupid.” she tells people, “i really made an enormous mistake – clearly and obviously. and i’m really sorry about my choice of words. i’ve made stupid remarks before, and i’ve always reasoned: ‘whatever. they can think what they want.’ people thinking that i’m insensitive about this subject rips my guts out. i made a big mistake.” (starpulse.com)labels: celebrity sedu hairstyles, sedu hair style
