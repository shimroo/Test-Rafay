welcome to my world, which i share with my wife and dogs. i grew up in the bronx, graduated west point, served in special operations and have written over 80 books across a variety of genres.







i’ve written quite a few books. need help figuring out where to start or what to read next? download my free readers guide from your favorite platform. click on the cover to the right to get links. 
my latest works are a trilogy in collaboration with jennifer crusie. check the cover for lavender’s blue.
also, there are continuations of the 3 million copy selling area 51 series. i have a new series that’s actually a prequel to my bestselling green beret series. the will kane books are set in new york city in the last 1970s. the series begins with new york minute, followed by lawyers, guns and money, then walk on the wild side, hell of a town and no quarter. shelter from the storm will be out later in 2023.
i’ve got several titles in the preparation and survival field. the green beret area study workbook is unique, laying out how you would do what we did in special forces prior to going into an area of operations: evaluating the locale, as well as ourselves, so that we would be prepared. one size does not fit all when it comes to preparation. then there is the green beret preparation and survival guide. i’ve designed these books for every day people, not hardcore preppers.
check out my freebies page where you can get started on a variety of genres. there are also free audio stories.
there are over 225 free powerpoint presentations on the free slideshows page– lots of useful stuff on writing, survival tips, history, etc. i’ve been shifting from slideshare to narrated youtube videos. my youtube channel is here and please subscribe to it!
i consult and present workshops on personalized area studies for individuals, neighborhoods, organizations and businesses. with everyone facing climate-related incidents and growing unrest, this is more important than ever. click on the window to the right for more information.

 survival and sustainment library: click on title to go to amazon page.
when technology fails: a manual for self-reliance, sustainability and surviving the long emergency by matthew stein. a great resource of information for long term skills.
sas survival handbook by john wiseman. redundant to some information in this book, i have it because of the images of plants and other matter.
peterson field guides put out a series of books about plants. two keys are:
edible wild plants
field guide to medicinal plants and herbs of eastern and central north america
unfortunately those two books aren’t available in ebook and having a plant guide on your cell phone you can easily bring up is very useful. i have:
wild edibles: a practical guide to foraging, with easy identification of 60 edible plants and 67 recipes by sergei boutenko
basic fishing: a beginner’s guide by wade bourne is very useful. remember, that the donner party never even attempted to fish in the nearby lake, even though it had trout in it.
the gift of fear: and other survival signs that protect us from violence by gavin de becker is a classic that applies to more than just survival situations.
my side of the mountain by jean craighead george is a classic story of survival that is great to read with your kids to introduce them to survival situations and information.
the ultimate survival medicine guide by amy alton. this is the premier book for survival medicine when a doctor or hospital is not available.
