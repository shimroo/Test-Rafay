featured adoptable pet















ernie is a big ball of fluff who can’t wait to meet his next best friend! this 8-year-old mixed breed pup would make a great companion for movie marathons on the couch in the winter and warm hikes in the summer. just be sure he gets his fair share of snacks during those netflix binges! ernie is certainly a pup that shines in the spotlight and prefers to keep his tennis balls to himself, so we recommend he join a home where he can be the only dog. stop by the cheyenne animal shelter and meet this big handsome boy today!
