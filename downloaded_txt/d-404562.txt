exogenous ketones: what are they and what you should know before taking them?

07/17/202109/08/2022 javier reynolds0 comment 



 
the exogenous ketones are external substances produced to achieve the same results and benefits of the ketogenic diet. they are ketone bodies that come from outside. these external substances are found in food supplements that should lead to rapid weight loss when consumed, as they bring the body into a state of ketosis.
ketosis is a metabolic condition that consists of an accumulation of ketones in the blood. it occurs when in the absence of blood sugar (glucose). the body starts to burn fat to derive energy. it occurs during a prolonged fast or a prolonged carbohydrate deprivation, the basic principle of the ketogenic diet. they are available in two different types: ketone salts and ketone esters.
what are exogenous ketones used for?
the goal of taking exogenous ketones is to cause an increase in ketone bodies in the blood, and if consumed, they should be beneficial and keep the user’s body in a state of ketosis.
a condition of ketosis achieved with the increase of ketones in the blood is not comparable to the state of ketosis that occurs with a reduction in carbohydrates provided for by the keto diet. therefore, it is not certain that the same situation can be recreated by taking ketones exogenously.
therefore, there are different aspects between the two conditions of ketosis, one physiological and one obtained with exogenous ketones, as presented below:

the physiological ketosis has as its results: a high concentration of ketones, a reduction in insulin production, and a high concentration of free fatty acids.
the ketosis with exogenous ketones has some characteristics: a high concentration of ketones, a production of slightly elevated insulin, and a reduced concentration of free fatty.

what are the effects of exogenous ketones?
the intake of these external substances does not give the same results that a ketogenic diet can bring. some of the main effects include:

reduction in blood sugar
reduction in the production of glucose by the liver
reduction of the activity of some enzymes essential for the oxidation of carbohydrates
reduction of the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue. this reduction occurs because the body senses a high increase in ketones in the blood and becomes alert, and to defend itself, it reduces the consumption of fatty acids.

as for effect on weight loss, following a normal diet and taking exogenous supplements does not lead to the desired results in two respects.
the first aspect is linked to consuming these external substances, which are used as energy sources mainly by the heart, muscles, and brain. consequently, there is a saving of sugars and fats that will accumulate at the adipose tissue level; another important aspect is that in exogenously induced ketosis, a situation is created that leads to a reduction in the use of fat reserves.
therefore, you will not have the same effects on weight loss that can be obtained with a low-calorie diet and with the exact condition of ketosis created and allows you to use the body’s fat reserves.
it is good to be very careful when deciding to take this type of supplement, which is a valid help to refuel energy, but if you ignore what you eat or do not follow a diet correctly, they do not give many results.

reasons to have dental implants

12/22/201707/23/2020 javier reynolds 



 
implant dentistry is a dental, medical procedure whereby implants and dental prosthetics are utilized to replace missing teeth. because of the quick development of technology and computer science these days a person can lose their teeth due to various reasons and still be able to acquire a replacement through implant dentistry centennial that appears so realistic and is functional. dentists who practice implant dentistry today have to go through rigorous training if they have a need to have more clients and last for long in business. earlier on missing teeth had to be fixed through dental bridges, full dentures, and partial dentures. implant dentistry has revolutionized everything. implants are also durable and have extra strength. they also allow the recommended dental habits like flossing and brushing. they are so far the only long term solution for teeth loss. below are some reasons one should consider getting dental implants in case of loss of teeth:
they save you from worrying
dental implants are reliable because they will not fall out of your mouth during an important event like a job interview or a presentation. because they don’t come off, you do not have to worry about knocking them onto a surface or breaking them. they are also easy to maintain like natural teeth.
they appear real
dental implants look just like real teeth compared to other options like dentures. you also don’t have to do things like taking your implants off each night to let them soak. they are also able to let you chew food like natural teeth because when they are being created they are designed to resemble real teeth, and they are implanted directly into the jaw.
they are good for oral health
an added advantage of dental implants is that bacteria does not accumulate that much on them as it is the case with dentures. this is because they are always in your mouth and you can brush them twice or three times in a day. so long as you take good care of your teeth and gums, you will have a small risk of contracting gingivitis or periodontitis than you will if you use dentures.
they make you look younger
dental implants have the capability to make you look younger. if you lose teeth, it means you are losing bone too because the bone mass in your jaw moves to occupy the space previously filled by the missing tooth. at the end of it, all the results experienced are a change in facial bone structure. on the other hand, implants fill the empty space, thus maintaining the shape of your face.

the different types of vaccines you should know

12/22/201707/23/2020 javier reynolds 



 
since the discovery of the first vaccine in 1796, thousands of lives have been saved. diseases such as smallpox which claimed millions of lives during the middle ages are no longer a threat to human beings. the following are the different types of vaccines you should know.
various types of vaccines
attenuated vaccines
this involves introducing weakened live bacteria or viruses in the body. even though these microbes are not capable of causing disease, they trigger a counter-reaction from the immune system. this will strengthen the body’s line of defense and will protect a person from contacting the disease in case of future attack. attenuated vaccines are closely interpreted as a natural infection and spur a strong antibody reaction guaranteeing lifelong immunity.

however, because they involve the use of live microbes, there is a chance albeit a slim one that they may mutate or change to become active again. if this was to happen, it could lead to a serious bout of the disease. for this reason, these vaccines are not suitable for people with a weakened immune system such as people carrying the aids virus or people who are undergoing chemotherapy. some of the common vaccines here include measles, smallpox, and yellow fever.
inactivated vaccine
instead of introducing live microbes into the body, these vaccines involve the use of inactivated or killed pathogens. just like with live bacteria or viruses, inactivated microbes can still spur a defense reaction from the immune system. however, this reaction is milder as the body does not recognize them as a serious threat. as a result, they do not offer protection for a long period. because the microbes used are inactive, they cannot become disease-causing making them safer for people with poor immune systems. the common types of this vaccine include the flu shot and polio vaccine.
toxoid vaccines
some bacteria cause diseases by releasing harmful chemicals or toxins. such bacteria include corynebacterium diphtheria and clostridium tetani that are responsible for diphtheria and tetanus. this vaccine involves introducing into the body inactivated toxins similar to those caused by the actual bacteria but lacking in potency. as in the case, with inactivated vaccine, toxoid vaccines trigger an antibody response that helps the body fight a future attack.
conjugate vaccines
these are made by combining an antigen to a bacteria coating to make it more discoverable by the body’s immune system. many harmful bacteria possess an outer coating made of complex sugars called polysaccharides. such coatings hide bacteria’s antigens and allow them to multiply in the body without being detected by the immune system. this is especially possible in infants and young children whose immune system is immature. conjugate vaccines link a discoverable antigen from a microbe to the polysaccharide triggering a counter reaction from the immune system which helps the body to be prepared for such disease-causing organisms in future.

subunit vaccines
this is a highly specific process that involves separation of antigens to include only the one that triggers the best counter reaction from the immune system. subunit vaccines, therefore, omit unnecessary molecules from the microbes reducing the chances of adverse reactions. these types of vaccines are used for protection against diseases such as meningitis and hepatitis b.

best spot to watch a game from within the red sox stadium

04/07/201707/23/2020 javier reynolds 



 
it can get abit confusing when you seek to buy red sox tickets to major league baseball games more especially if you don’t go to many games. the pricing might be straight forward, but you have to consider other factors including your view. sometimes great views come with a higher price.
we are going to focus on three factors that one should consider when choosing where to watch a red sox game from within the stadium. these factors include; comfortability, experience, and pricing. they might not be applicable to you but, they will get you thinking in the right direction.
comfort
most of these games tend to be played outside during the summer thus the environment is definitely hot. take for example; a game that is played in a month of july. this is a game that one can be advised to sit even if it means in the last row of the stadium than sit in the front in that sweltering sun. this should be mostly considered by mothers who are winning. for evening games one only needs to determine the direction the sun is going to set, based on this, they can select a comfortable seat to sit on.
it is paramount for a fan to ask around or inquire about a particular section of sitting that they can be comfortable with.
price
when somebody buys a ticket late, they can either get a good or bad deal, but in most cases, one is likely to get a good deal. this can be true more especially for those who use e-bay. during these times most of the sellers want to sell tickets close to the event which ends up reducing the price of the tickets because of competition. one can also get a ticket from scalpers.this usually happens in the first inning as they have developed more agency to sell so that they at least make something out of it.
most of the teams do provide for special tickets throughout the year although, very highly priced throughout, there are days within the week that the teams offer lower prices or coupons due to low demand. these dates are clearly given in the teams’site, take note of them and plan ahead since they can enable one save a significant amount of money especially when they take their families out.
experience
this is the feeling that comes with one being in the stadium. due to the influx of many new ballparks, it has led to the emergence of some pretty cool surroundings around the stadium. it is often recommended that one goes for a place that they have a view of something else other than the game.another very essential factor for one to consider is to make sure they sit in a place that they can have the perfect view of the jumbo screen. if one sits right in front of the screen, they will not be able to see any mid-inning entertainment and replace thus one should ensure they are in a position that they can view these screens properly because teams have become innovative in what they show, therefore you don’t want to be missing such information.

people suffering from depression always visit psychiatrists since they can make them relaxed while they talk to determine what the problem might be. this is, however, something you can always do on your own if you really want to overcome depression. multiple exercises are used for relaxation purposes such as yoga which are known for reducing stress and enhancing mood. for a situation where you do not have enough time for some exercises, taking deep breaths can just as well do the job.
