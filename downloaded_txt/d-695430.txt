there were sixteen propositions on the statewide ballot november 2nd, 
assigned proposition numbers 59 to 72, plus 60a and 1a. the 
peace and freedom party took positions on most of them. 


proposition 62 (voter pamphlet summary and arguments available as a
190 kb pdf,
full text as a
301 kb pdf): 
"no choice" initiative would put all candidates from all parties 
on a single blanket primary ballot for all partisan offices except president. 
only the top two primary-election candidates with most votes for an office, 
whether or not members of the same party, would go on to the general election. 
this is similar to the election systems used in france and louisiana, 
resulting in runoffs between open racists like jacques lepen and david duke 
and corrupt establishment politicians, with no progressive alternative 
allowed on that ballot. the proponents of this initiative think it will
guarantee that socially-moderate, pro-business candidates like democrats 
gray davis and dianne feinstein and republicans richard riordan and arnold 
schwarzenegger won't lose to labor oriented progressives or religious right 
conservatives in their party primaries.
peace and freedom recommended a no vote on this initiative.
with our opposition, proposition 62 failed by a statewide vote of 
5,136,010 (46.3%) yes to 5,954,969 (53.7%) no.

proposition 66: (voter pamphlet summary and arguments available as a
175 kb pdf,
full text as a
200 kb pdf): 
this initiative circulated by facts would modify three strikes law by 
requiring that second and third strikes be serious or violent felonies and 
narrowing definitions of what crimes are "serious or violent" and
when two convictions constitute separate strikes. applies retroactively to 
reduce the long sentences some prisoners received for petty crimes. also 
increases penalties for some sex crimes against children. 
peace and freedom recommended a yes vote on this initiative.
despite our support, proposition 66 failed by a statewide vote 
of 5,604,060 (47.3%) yes to 6,238,060 (52.7%) no.

proposition 72: (voter pamphlet summary and arguments available as a
197 kb pdf,
full text as a
187 kb pdf): referendum on john burton's
sb 2
(which requires some employers to provide health insurance plans for some 
employees). 
peace and freedom opposed the referendum and supported keeping the law, as a 
step forward even though we prefer a publicly funded health care system 
not tied to workers' jobs. this meant a yes vote on the ballot.
despite our support, proposition 72 failed by a statewide vote 
of 5,709,500 (49.2%) yes to 5,889,936 (50.8%) no.

of 9,334,852 (83.4%) yes to 1,870,146 (16.6%) no.

our recommendation.

peace and freedom recommended a no vote on this measure. the solution to local
government funding problems is not to lock into place reliance on regressive
taxes that distort land use decisions.

of 3,932,201 (37.8%) yes to 6,449,830 (62.2%) no.

proposition 67: telephone tax to pay for emergency medical services. 
peace and freedom recommended a no vote on this measure; emergency medical
services should be properly funded, but not by a regressive tax that costs
poor people more than the rich. peace and freedom advocates a single-payer 
health care system funded by progressive taxation, which would pay for
emergency medical services without the need for any special, dedicated
funding.
with our opposition, proposition 67 failed by a statewide vote 
of 3,243,132 (28.4%) yes to 8,165,809 (71.6%) no.

proposition 68: casino gambling for card-rooms and race tracks. if
indian tribes that run casinos don't accept new compacts within 90 days,
this measure would allow sixteen specific card-rooms and race tracks to
run casinos with slot machines.

with our opposition, proposition 68 failed by a statewide vote 
of 1,897,177 (16.2%) yes to 9,801,284 (83.8%) no.

proposition 69: dna samples from arrestees. this would allow police
to take dna samples from anyone they arrest for a felony, even if the
case is so weak the district attorney declines to prosecute it, and
enter it into a statewide database.

of 7,194,347 (62.1%) yes to 4,400,826 (37.9%) no.

proposition 70: "tribal gaming compacts. exclusive gaming rights.
contributions to state". this measure would recognize the sovereignty
of california indian tribes by giving tribal casinos on reservation lands
a monopoly on casino gambling in california, in exchange for financial 
contributions to the state government.
peace and freedom recommended a yes vote on this measure.
depite our support, proposition 70 failed by a statewide vote
