 with the vast amount of airport based travel engaged in by active,
      exercise conscious travelers, and the long delays, long layovers, and early
      arrival times that arise when traveling (along with the current need to
      be at the airport hours early) - finding gyms in an airport, an airport
      gym, or a workout club near an airport or airport exercise based club in
   or around your airport terminal maybe be possible. spend your time lifting
   weights, working out, using the elliptical trainer or treadmill or even taking
   a spin class and losing  weight while waiting for your flight.
      

      if you are an active, exercise
      conscious traveler that would rather spend an hour in the gym (versus an
      hour in the terminal watching television), or an active traveler who would
      rather take a yoga class (versus wandering through trinket shops), airportgyms.com
      can help you find a gym in, near or around select popular us and canadian
      international airports.

      want to workout and exercise on
      the fly? check and see if there is an airport gym, gym near an airport,
