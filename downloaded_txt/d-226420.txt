life in this girl's army



this was not a political blog, not an opinionated blog, not a blog intended to cause controversy.  this was my life's story, out there for all to see.












may 04, 2017








it's been nearly a decade





and i feel i should add an update to my life, as it has changed so much :) i've had now two surgeries on my wrist as referenced in the last blog, but neither one of them really gave me more functionality, much to my chagrin.
it has been even more of an uphill battle with my knee, i have now seen, at last count 8! different orthopedic surgeons. my current one is doing more than anyone else though, i'm actually scheduled for exploratory surgery in a few weeks. the pain is a constant, but i deal.
now for the biggest change in my life: i had kids!!!!!!!!!!! i have two wee munchkins, i often lovingly refer to them as the tiny demons. my oldest is four, my youngest two, and they are both boys. they keep me on my toes on the regular.
i've finished one degree, an aas as a paralegal, and i am on track to graduate in december with my bachelors.
as you can see, life has been full, wonderful, and amazing.
i don't know where everyone is coming from, but i hope you enjoy this update.

and now we come to the end





gentle readers (who was it that uses/used that?), after a year of sporadic blogging on my part i have come to think that it is time to cease.  i lead a wonderfully mundane life as compared to before.  my story comes to an end next month when i finally have the surgery on my wrist that will render my wrist usable again.before i start rambling, i will just say, adios, fare the well, auf weidersahn (probably badly misspelled) goodbye.ps, the blog will stay online for posterity.

i love halloween:-d





as we all prepare for this halloween season, please take a few minutes to read some simple rules to help keep everyone safe.1. - don't assume the telephone calls are coming from another house.2. - when it appears that you have killed the monster, never check to see if it's really dead.3. - never read a book of demon summoning aloud, even as a joke.4. - don't go into the basement to check the power when the lights go out.5. - if your children speak to you in latin or any other language which they should not know, shoot them immediately. it will save you a lot of grief in the long run. however, it will probably take several rounds to kill them, so be prepared. this also applies to kids who speak with somebody else's voice.6. - when you have the benefit of numbers, never split up and go it alone.7. - don't have sex. especially if you've noticed a few of your friends are missing!8. - as a general rule, don't solve puzzles that open a portal to hell.9. - never stand in, on, or above a grave, tomb, or crypt. this would apply to any other house of the dead as well.10. - if you're searching for something which caused a loud noise and find out that it's just the cat, don't stand there sighing with relief, get the fuck out!11. - if appliances start operating by themselves, don't check for short circuits; just get the fuck out!12. - do not take anything from the dead.13. - if you find a town which looks deserted, there's probably a good reason for it. don't stop and look around.14. - don't fool with recombinant dna technology unless you're sure you know what you're doing.15. - if you're running from the monster, expect to trip or fall down at least twice, more if you are of the female persuasion. also note that, despite the fact that you are running and the monster is merely ambling along, it's still moving fast enough to catch up with you.16. - if your companions suddenly begin to exhibit uncharacteristic behavior such as hissing, fascination for blood, glowing eyes, increasing hairiness, and so on, kill them immediately.17. - stay away from certain geographical locations, some of which are listed here: amityville, elm street, transylvania, nilbog (you're in trouble if you recognize this one), the bermuda triangle, or any small town in maine.18. - if your car runs out of gas at night on a lonely road, do not go to the nearby deserted-looking house to phone for help. if you think that it is strange because you thought you had a full tank of gas, shoot yourself instead. you are going to die anyway, and will most likely be eaten.19. - beware of strangers bearing strange tools. for example: chainsaws, staple guns, hedge trimmers, electric carving knives, combines, lawnmowers, butane torches, soldering irons, band saws, or any devices made from deceased companions.20. - if you find that your house is built upon a cemetery, now is the time to move in with the in-laws. this also applies to houses that had previous inhabitants who went mad or committed suicide or died in some horrible fashion, or had inhabitants who performed satanic practices in your house.

not quite the stupidest thing i have done, but close.





as most of you know, i am not fond of the fact that i have limitations to what i can do.  most of the time i do try to stay within the bounds, but every now and again i have to push the envelope and that is what i did monday.  i climbed the entire 291 steps to the top of the bunker hill monument.  it was painful, and i am paying for it now, but it was worth it:-dpostcard of bunker hill. me, probably about halfway up. the very top stepthe view from one side daniel and me at the tippy top:-d we did that early in the morning, and then spent the rest of the day exploring boston.  we went to the science museum, then off to my favorite spot in boston, fanueil hall and quincy market where we spent the afternoon.  we even ate at the "replica" of cheers:-d  good food.i am back at work today, and thinking i should not ever take vacations lol.  i hit the ground running this morning and really haven't stopped yet:)

what i did on vacation (well, one day of it at least)





daniel and i decided that since we were going to be in boston for the last red sox regular season game, we had to get tickets. ticket prices were outrageous, but i scored pavilion box tickets, for a "reasonable" (read not $500+a ticket) price. the views were amazing, even if we were both a little cold, and we saw everything on the field.at the ballparkpretty good shot daniel tookthe big screen

just a whole lot of nothing





or not.  one of my favorite online reading places is slate magazine.  i enjoy reading in particular the explainer, which recently featured this story on iraq tempatures: http://www.slate.com/id/2173818/nav/navoa/ his point was it really isn't 130 degrees there.  naturally, this led to much commenting on how, while it may not be that hot, it sure as hell feels like it.this week, a compilation by one of the authors (here) states this " we're in sorry shape, indeed, if our troops are depending upon a lie of six degrees. it's sad to see so many troops (plus their friends and family) opposed to a mere statement of truth" if you read most of the comments, we aren't objecting to a "mere statement of truth"  we just want our side of the issue, and how we feel heard on it as well.  it may not be that hot in reality, but don't dismiss the heat.

grrrr





i am somewhat perturbed, as i am sure many other people are out there after apple's announcements yesterday.  i recently purchased a lovely 80gb video ipod for about $325 (i got it on a really great sale after much research).  now what happens: they cut the price by $100!!! i could have had my 80gb with twice as much power for less:(  wah, what am i going to do? nothing to be done but enjoy the one i have:)in other gadget news, still want an iphone, but still not going to pay $400 plus the $200 disconnect fee from tmobile i would have to pay if i wanted one:-dall is well here, dh comes home soon, then it's off to boston in the fall;)
