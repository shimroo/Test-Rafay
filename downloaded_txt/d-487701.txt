high asset estate probate or heirship 
whether there is a valid will or not, when there are significant assets, including real property owned by the deceased, financial accounts, insurance policies, you need a qualified probate lawyer to
assist in the process. it is critical to handle everything according to the
texas estates code when considering payment of debts, the decedent’s final tax return, the estate inventory and appraisement, settling of estate claims and distribution of assets from the estate. as a highly regarded businessman and skilled fort worth probate attorney, bob leonard is qualified to offer sound advice. high conflict probate or heirship
ongoing family issues and tensions can produce significant conflict and animosity between beneficiaries or heirs of an estate. our seasoned probate attorneys are equipped to handle will contests, missing heirs, hidden assets, fraud on the estate, breach of fiduciary duty and other contentious issues. we are prepared litigate in court and do battle to protect your inheritance when required. we are also trained in negotiation and mediation if either are possible. as a tested and experienced litigator, bob leonard is ready to handle your most difficult probate court battle. probate of a will
if your loved one or family member left a valid will, depending on the nature of the estate assets and whether there is any debt, we will help you determine
the simplest way to handle the estate. our probate attorneys will help you apply to admit the will to probate and represent you throughout the process. once the will has been admitted to probate, the executor will receive letters testamentary and can take steps to secure the estate assets including financial accounts and real estate, pay outstanding debts or claims against the estate and then dispense the funds and property to the beneficiaries according to the last wishes of the deceased as stated in their last will and testament.   determining the heirs of the deceased
when someone dies without a valid will in texas, the estate passes according to texas law on intestacy. the system for establishing who the heirs are involves providing information to a court appointed attorney ad litem to search for any unknown or missing heirs. there is a very specific manner in which the assets of the estate are divided depending on the family situation of the deceased. our probate lawyers and legal team will walk you through the probate court proceedings from the application for determination of heirship through the administration of the estate. the person appointed administrator of the estate will receive letters of administration which can be used to access bank accounts and other financial assets and to secure other assets, review and pay appropriate claims against the estate and then distribute to the heirs. probate court appeals
if you or your probate attorney believe the trial court judge committed an error in the final disposition of your probate case or heirship case, you may wish to appeal the ruling. contact bob leonard, jr. today to discuss your options. there are strict deadlines for appeals, so be sure to act quickly. guardianship results
when you need to step in to take care of a family member or 
loved one who can no longer care for himself/herself, we will ask the probate court to appoint you as guardian of the person, guardian of the estate or both. to apply for
guardianship, you must be represented by a guardianship attorney who is certified by the state of texas. our guardianship lawyers hold the certification. you can trust our team of qualified guardianship legal professionals to support you in your quest to protect your parent with dementia,
child with disabilities who is turning 18, or other incapacitated person. we handle agreed guardianships and those cases where the guardianship is contested. wills, trusts and powers of attorney
estate planning documents allow you to plan today for what can happen in the future. your will provides instructions for the distribution of your assets upon your death. with a
statutory durable power of attorney, you can appoint an agent to handle some or all of your financial affairs in the event you are incapacitated. a
medical power of attorney gives you peace of mind knowing that a person of your choice will be able to make most medical decisions if you are unable to do so. while having all these documents in place does not automatically mean you do not have to probate or will never need a guardianship, it makes it far more likely that your wishes will be followed. if you truly wish to
avoid probate, proper creation and management of a revocable living trust is a good choice for you. plan for tomorrow, today, with our highly qualified estate planning attorneys. solid solutions from knowledgeable probate attorneys
contact our office to discuss your probate needs today. our legal team will review all of the facts and recommend the simplest and most cost-effective solution for your particular situation. if you are a beneficiary or heir and believe the executor or administrator of the estate is not handling things properly, we are here to protect your rights. if you are seeking to be named executor in a will or administrator if there was no will, we will make sure everything is handled properly to protect your fiduciary responsibility. the loss of a loved one or family member is a stressful time for all concerned. let our probate lawyers help relieve the stress by providing you with our very best legal representation.
