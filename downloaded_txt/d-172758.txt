the mississippi delta national heritage area (mdnha) is the land where the blues began, where rock and roll was created and where gospel remains a vibrant art. it is an agricultural region where cotton was once king, and where ‘precision-ag’ rules today. it is a place that saw the struggles of the civil war and the cultural revolution of the civil rights movement. it is the home of the great migration, and a land of rich culinary, religious, artistic and literary heritage.
