what is the average cost to have rain gutters installed?by rangerfopapril 19, 2022
gutters are very important to a house, aside from improving its aesthetics. except for well-informed homeowners, most don’t realize the layers of protection that gutters give to a house. technically, gutters are not part of the roof, but if homeowners neglect to maintain the gutters, it can lead to serious issues, including compromised foundations and moldy walls.


average cost of installing rain gutters


replacing gutters and downspouts costs a lot, depending on your material. an average 2400 sq ft house with a 150 linear foot gutter and 4 downspouts will cost roughly $3000 (materials and labor costs) if the installers use aluminum for the materials (forbes). here is the average cost of gutters and downspouts according to materials using the same dimensions of the sample house above.

labor costs for installing a gutter range from $1-$7 per linear foot. factors affecting labor costs are:


height of the housenumber of cornerstype of gutterextra reinforcementssteepness of the roofsubcontracting laborlocation of the house


for example, gutter installation on two-story houses with a very steep roof costs more than on a single-story house with a slightly sloping roof. installing gutters in cities is also pricier compared to the suburbs and rural areas.

materials used for rain gutters


there are 6 commonly used materials for rain gutters; each has its pros and cons.


aluminum


aluminum gutters are the most commonly used because they don’t rust, are lightweight, and are very affordable. they can last up to 20 years if installed properly. seamless gutters are more resistant to mid-run leaks. however, they are also more expensive. sectional gutters are prone to leaks but are easy for diy installations. 


vinyl


vinyl is the least expensive but also the least durable of gutter materials. however, vinyl gutters are also heavier and can cause an added strain on your roof. they are also prone to sagging, especially when heavy with debris and water. this gutter material is best for small, one-story houses.


copper


copper gutter material and installation are very expensive. when copper oxidizes, it develops a green patina that protects the gutter. this material is best for older houses. however, they don’t last as long as aluminum gutters. 


galvanized steel


galvanized steel gutters are superior to aluminum in terms of strength and sturdiness. they can withstand extreme weather conditions and are best installed in hurricane-prone and heavily snowed areas. the downside of these gutters is the price, but they can last up to 30 years.  


galvalume


galvalume uses steel coated with aluminum and zinc to improve its strength and resistance to rust. they cost roughly the same as aluminum gutters but are heavier and sturdier. galvalume gutters are the most durable of gutter materials.


zinc


zinc gutters use zinc alloy mixed with titanium and copper. they are more expensive than aluminum gutters and last up to 40 years if properly installed. zinc gutters are best used on older houses because they don’t need a painting job. instead, it develops a slightly green patina because of the copper in its structure.


importance of gutters


homeowners install gutters because it improves the overall look of the house. however, there are more important reasons why gutters are necessary for any house. maintaining gutters is a must to keep a house in good shape.


protects the foundation


gutters protect the house’s foundation by directing water away from the house through the downspouts. when water pools around the house, it can cause leaks to the foundation, thus compromising the house’s structural integrity.


keeps water out of the basement


pooling water may also leak into the basement, potentially damaging your hvac and electrical installations and leading to electrocution. watermarks in the basement may mean leaks on the foundation.


prevents excessive moisture on the walls


excessive moisture in the house promotes mold and mildew growth, which is a health threat, especially if you have babies or an asthmatic person.


affects insurance cost


damaged gutters may affect the insurance cost of a house and in some situations, insurance claims get denied because of sagging or mangled gutters.


gutter replacement costs


gutter replacement costs $2-$3 per linear foot, costlier than the original installation because replacement entails the removal of damaged gutters and disposal of waste. however, replacing damaged fascia boards will cost you an additional $6-$20 per linear foot, depending on the extent of damage and height of the gutter placement. the downspout is also part of the gutter system, so homeowners should not neglect their upkeep.


replacement entails the removal of damaged gutters and disposal of waste.


before installing the gutters


another helpful tip from spout gutters, a trustworthy company specializing in gutter installation, focuses more on functionality rather than form when considering rain gutters installation. ask the contractor what works best for the house design so that the gutter won’t clash with the roof. also, it is best to hire a single contractor for the installation of the roof and gutters rather than hiring them separately.
