i’m begging, begging you…to fall in love with these tile shapes!

rosewood is a one of a kind marble quarried in mexico. 

the stone is defined by an off-white background with eye-catching veining unique in every piece. the colors in this stone are several but notably burgundy, rose and soft blues.

the stone offers the possibility for custom sizes, finishes, and fabrication.

which one steals your heart?
