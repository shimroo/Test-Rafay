who we are!



organizational background















for 29 years, latino health access (lha) has engaged latinx and other people of color in high-impact disease prevention and management. among lha’s adult participants, 46% are uninsured. these uninsured individuals often do not have a medical home, are subject to high rates of diabetes and other chronic disease risk, and face significant challenges to receiving appropriate care due to a range of social determinants of health present in the communities in which they live.

our missionlatino health access partners with communities to bring health, equity, and sustainable change through education, services, consciousness-raising, and civic participation.our mission has two areas of focus:to deliver culturally appropriate health-related services and programming to address urgent health concerns; and to engage individuals in low-income, low-opportunity areas in transforming their environments and creating positive, concrete changes in their homes and communities by providing tools, training, and mechanisms for civic engagement and participation.
















we believe true transformation happens through face-to-face interactions.


























read about true life change happening now in our community.



“thank you. i am thankful and happy for everything and all the services you brought. especially the interest a staff member took in helping us, he is a good kid that helps serve the community.  i would love to put him on the front page of the newspaper so people could know how much he helped the community and us.”— family resource center participant



“the more we as parents get involved, the better families we will have. that's why i always invite others to participate in the classes. when i leave here, i walk home, and i call my husband, and while i walk, i tell him everything that i learned in the mother to mother class. this has helped me deal with my family's emotions and control my own.” — sra. joselin, emotional wellness participant
















help us improve the health of our community in orange county for generations to come.we invite you to co-invest with the families of our communities in ways that keep them at the center of the conversation.
