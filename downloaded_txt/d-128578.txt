trump eyes privatizing usps, citing financial 
losses 
12.15.2024 -

the guardian reports: "donald trump in recent weeks has expressed a keen interest in privatizing the us postal service (usps) because of its financial losses, the 
washington post reported on saturday, citing three people with knowledge of the matter. trump, who begins his second us presidency on 20 january, has discussed his desire to privatize the usps with howard lutnick, his pick for commerce secretary, at his mar-a-lago 
home, the report said. as the post noted, the move could disrupt consumer 
shipping and business supply chains while pushing hundreds of thousands of 
federal workers out of government." -
