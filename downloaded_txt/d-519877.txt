artist quotes








                                                “ i think the biggest thing about organizations like millay arts is that you don’t really understand what a big deal it is to have someone give you one month to do nothing but what you want to do. and they ask nothing of you, they don’t expect any kind of product, or painting, or work of art or play to come out it… and it so inspires you to make something great from the experience you had, and you don’t have to worry about paying the rent, or go to a job, but it also makes you want to give back.  i am so grateful.”

                                                “at millay, i was mesmerized by the quiet charm of the woods, meadows, hills, and valleys that surrounded the property. i would take long walks in the mornings and bring my canvasses out during the day to paint.”
