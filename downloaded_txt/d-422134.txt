philadelphia trolley tracks




 
philadelphia trolley tracks is a collection of photos, 
maps, and rosters showing philadelphia's extensive streetcar system as it was

lately enjoyed a resurgence, with new construction and plans being laid in no 
less than 40 cities across the united states, from el paso texas to washington dc. only a handful of north american cities held onto their streetcar lines; 
san francisco and toronto are expanding theirs. despite a diesel-bus-oriented 
city transit division, parts of philadelphia's trolley system survive
