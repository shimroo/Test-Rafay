about us 

                        alberta’s outfitters were some of the earliest pioneers of the tourism industry in our province, with the
                        first guided hunts taking clients into the alberta wilderness in the late 1800s. today our society
                        represents 500 professional outfitters and nearly 1,600 hunting guides, generating a $327 million
                        contribution to alberta's gross domestic product, and supporting rural jobs and economies throughout
                        the province.
                        
                        in 1997, the alberta professional outfitters society (apos) was established as a delegated administrative
                        organization (dao) for the government of alberta. apos’ delegated responsibilities include licensing the
                        province’s guides and professional outfitters, managing the distribution of big game allocations and
                        waterfowl privileges, and holding members accountable to a code of ethics. 
                        we provide members with access to liability insurance, a voice within government, and advocacy on key issues.
