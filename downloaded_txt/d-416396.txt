you can benefit from our alternative to buying your own 
dedicated server and internet connection. our virtual server cloud system was created by partitioning 
a physical server into independent virtual servers. we maintain the digital foundation 
while you control your web site.


    
the truth 
our cloud system resources are never oversubscribed for performance you can count on.  yours can be hosted in one or more of five 
data centers in the us, europe, and asia. 
for sales, customer service or engineering, call toll free 1-866-gsp-4400 or 
send an e-mail and we will respond promptly.
 
 
controls 
all of our virtual servers can be accessed by using ssh to a unix shell or sftp; cpanel web based server management with full backend administrative 
access is available on most linux products.
unix vps comes with root access, the ability to create multiple secure shell, pop/imap, ftp accounts, and 
root access to the package collections for managed installation of many applicatons.
 
    
reliability 
24x7 monitoring.  each physical
cloud server is built with up to four octadeca core intel xeon processors – 72 cores to easily process 144 intensive threads concurrently. 
all servers and networking equipment are supported by backup ups power 
and power generators. we also make geographically diverse encrypted backups of each server to keep your data safe for business continuity.
 
 
connectivity 
having an online business is about being online! we use
redundant connectivity to host our customers
internet presence. while our virtual servers do not offer
unlimited bandwidth, we do offer you capacity in excess of most web site requirements.  ipv4 and ipv6 addresses are available.
 
 
disk space 
unix vps preferred comes with 500 gb of disk space (more than enough
for most businesses) to store your web site and e-mail. designed for large corporations, our
managed private servers come with up to 100 tb along with nfs4 volumes up to 1 pb.  all primarily storage uses redundant enterprise grade solid state drives (ssds) for fast disk access.
 
 
cost 
flat rate and your first month is prorated! your company
can use a virtual server at an affordable price. see our
pricing faq for more information.
