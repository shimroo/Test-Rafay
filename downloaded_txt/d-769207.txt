,we have a new mini rc helicopter that is way cool!yes, the name is odd, but that is what's on the box, etc. so, in order to not confuse people as to what helicopter it really is, we kept the name the same.it's even smaller than previous helicopters, it measures only 5 inches long.full details on the aircraft here: mini helocopter .labels: fairy, helicopter video, mini hughes

we met up with g4tv --> g4tv.com (spoke to wil) while in las vegas at the ces show. we hooked them up with some of our airsoft guns and you can see what they had to say about the guns on attack of the show. http://www.g4tv.com/pile_player.aspx?video_key=15131you'll see our classic army mp5, classic army m15a4 w/grenade launcher (add-on).wil also has a lovely hostess, or she's the host and he's the guest... however you want to look at it. enjoy the video...
