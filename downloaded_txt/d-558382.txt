vancouver island sea kayaking tours with british columbia’s original kayaking lodge.
in 1987 we built our kayaking lodge in the discovery islands, british columbia with a dream: to craft life-changing multi-day sea kayaking experiences with a few simple ingredients: salt-water, forested islands, soaring mountains, kayaks, and delicious, wholesome food. 
our passion for exploring our remote corner of british columbia by kayak has only grown stronger. we live where we paddle, and offer sea kayaking tours with industry leading professionalism and kayaking equipment. our guided trips combine skills instruction, wilderness adventure, and abundant meals prepared from our own garden produce, fresh eggs, local sea foods, and home baking – both at the lodge and around the campfire.
our sea kayaking tours explore sheltered routes amid marine parks, wildlife in nature, and rainforest islands – all with spectacular views of the highest peaks of british columbia’s rugged coast mountains. we can’t wait to welcome you to our island home and share with you the best sea kayaking vancouver island has to offer!
