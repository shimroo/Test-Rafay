timeless voices of aviation
aviation’s history is made up of many remarkable people, from the best-known aviation personalities to thousands of unheralded people who contributed to the development of aviation in their local communities. 
over the past several years, eaa has been dedicated to collecting their stories in its unmatched aviation oral history project, "timeless voices of aviation."
under the banner "let no story go untold," timeless voices of aviation ensures that the first person oral histories of aviation’s development are preserved for future generations of family members, teachers, students, historians and others.

imagine the scholars, professors, designers, and students who will lead us in the future being able to hear first-hand how the great leaders and problem-solvers of aviation’s past accomplished their work.
imagine a great-grandson being able to see the face, hear the voice, and understand the importance of the accomplishments of the ancestor he never met, just by turning on his computer or tablet.
imagine a middle school teacher years from now being able to access, on behalf of her students, a first-person account of world war ii aviation from a veteran who came from the same town.

military aviators, mechanics, air traffic controllers, aircraft designers, builders and restorers, flight instructors, writers, air show performers, administrators, airport and fbo operators, airline employees, and so many more all have unique stories to tell of their aviation lives.
