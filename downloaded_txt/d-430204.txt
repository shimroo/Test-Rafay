“we have worked with tta for a few years now and they are a key partner for contract talent – for example, on one of our contracts, we were looking for an instructional designer but got much more regarding instructional strategy, project management, change management, and design thinking, and this project won a brandon hall award. they are very responsive and seek to understand the business and project objectives before offering candidates, and, once placed, ensure the strong partnership with timely check ins. we will certainly continue working with tta for future needs.”

we have been working with tta for over a year on lms module creation for our new e-learning system, with a “turnkey” process that has kept us on schedule, with continuous two-way communication. their professionalism and 100% deadline success rate for us has been nothing short of impressive and why we continue to want to work with the tta team.

“partnering with tta to deliver rapid7 certification courses has enabled significant growth in our service offerings. their excellent recruiting team has access to a talent pool that we would not be able to reach on our own. with tta, we have a deep bench of highly talented instructors; this allows us to scale delivery across the globe and respond quickly to our customer’s needs. our csat scores increased significantly after transitioning to tta delivery resources, and our profit margins grew by 10% by outsourcing. the tta folks that we work with are an extension of our team, and we are grateful every day for the peace of mind we enjoy. we know the instructors are taking care of our customers in our classrooms, and we know our account and project managers are advocating for our shared success. tta brings years of knowledge and experience to the relationship; every ounce of trust and confidence we have in their excellence has been rewarded with great outcomes for rapid7 customers. we will continue to partner with tta as long as we have a need to deliver instructor-led training. additionally, i look forward to expanding our scope of work together as we explore additional instructional design projects that we need auxiliary talent to complete.”
