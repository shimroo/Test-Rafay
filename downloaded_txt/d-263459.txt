find your perfect slip!
don't rent...invest!  fairfax yacht club is a condominium marina where you have the unique opportunity to invest in your own slip.  a condominium slip is similar to an apartment condominium in that the owner receives a deed which is recorded in the county land records and on which title insurance is obtainable. ownership carries with it the exclusive right to the use of the slip (the slip is owned by the owner and not rented or leased from the marina). further, the owner receives an undivided interest in all condominium property (referred to as the common elements) as specified in the condominium documents which, in this case, includes the piers, clubhouse, parking lots, and other facilities. the owner may sell a slip to other persons without limitation. fairfax yacht club is subject to virginia’s condominium laws.  for additional information regarding slip ownership, please click the about tab at the top of the home page.
some slip owners choose to lease to persons seeking to moor their vessels in a beautiful environment without actually purchasing a slip. for more information, please click the slip listings tab at the top of the home page and scroll to the slips for lease section.



about us

fairfax yacht club is a first-class, year-round, recreational yachting facility with 170 open and covered slips accommodating boats up to 50 feet in length. the facility is designed and operated with the active boating family in mind.  fyc offers a beautifully landscaped, park-like setting on a five acre lot with several picnic/grilling stations, a firepit area, pavilion, well kept restrooms, and a no-cost boat pump-out station. slip owners and renters have access to the meticulously maintained clubhouse that features a full kitchen with granite countertops, skylights, and is adjacent to an indoor comfortable gathering area suitable for get-togethers.  for peace of mind, fairfax yacht club allows limited access to the private parking lot and clubhouse through a gated secured card entry system. 
being near the mouth of the occoquan river allows easy access to the potomac river and points beyond with only a short ride through the no wake zone.  if you'd prefer to stay local, you can head up-river to the quaint town of occoquan.  there are many boat-friendly restaurants along the occoquan and, once in town, there are numerous shops and restaurants to enjoy!
