donating your chrysler 300c





did you ever think of donating your chrysler 300c ?  here are some thoughts to think about.

many people believe that it is better to give than receive. when  you donate a car through a card donation service, you can have the  opportunity to give and receive. when you choose to sell you car through  a reputable car donation service, they will not use your money for  advertising. your donation will be maximized to help many people, as  well as contribute to many world issues.
so what exactly will your  donation support? the possibilities are endless. you may be helping the  medical world find cures for cancers, feed the hungry, give homes to  families, provide children with food, clothing, and education, etc.  there really is no limit to what causes you can contribute to.
car  donation is often done for many reasons. no matter why you donate your  car, it is fully tax deductible. just give a car donation service a  call. they will pick up the vehicle at no cost to you almost anywhere in  the united states. at that time, you will be given all the paperwork  that you need to claim your very generous donation on your tax return.
a  car can turn into virtually anything when it comes to donations. it can  go to help children in need as far as clothing, food, school supplies,  shelter, and more. it can go to a cause such as curing cancer, aids, and  world hunger. donating food, clothes and anything that we can is always  a benefit. a car can go towards multiple forms of aid. the money that  is used or the car itself will have a lasting impact on whatever cause  and charity has the privilege of receiving it.
car donations can  help with causes here in the usa and internationally. one car can do so  much as far as going a long way to spread aid and goods. you also have  control over your vehicle donation. you may have a cause or charity in  mind, or just want to know what your vehicle gift will do for those who  receive it. when choosing an online donation company, you can choose a  company that will donate exactly to the cause or charity you choose, or  you will at least know exactly what your donation will be contributing  to.
many people want to know that their contributions really will  make a difference. donations need to make a lasting impact. when  donating a car, you will be giving a gift that will have very positive  lasting benefits. just imagine the happiness that you can give to  others. you will also find happiness and contentment within yourself for  making a difference in the lives of people in need. the world will be a  better place because you gave such a wonderful contribution. car  donation is making such a large impact, that more vehicle donations are  needed. the more cars that get donated the more widespread the  charitable gifts and aid will be.the american relief foundation invites you to help us provide  poor children around america with support they need. if you lost your  car title and cannot donate we have an excellent resource to link you  directly to your dmv page to order a duplicate car title. we are looking  for a wyoming car  donation to help our cause. if you have an unwanted car consider the  options and donate  your car.

chrysler ad fail





the use of a chrysler 300c in advertising is a fantastic idea, but i am old school i guess.  the title of this  ad at beautifullife.info  was  "paper city for crysler"  more and more i see misspelling in advertisement and in the newspaper.  people are so dependent on computers, don't use spell check or evaluate how a word is used.  it's sad.

chrysler 300c cars autographed by stars to be auctioned for haiti victims





now this is pretty cool, curious as to how it turns out.
at the recent golden globe awards ceremony, all stars present (300 to be precise) autographed a special edition "eco style" chrysler 300c. the chrysler group llc exhibited this car at the entrance of the beverly hilton hotel and will soon auction it to raise money for the haitian people. the company estimates the autographed car will fetch $1million!  via luxurylaunches.com
cool!! on top of that !!

furthermore, chrysler brand together with the dick clark productions company has also partnered with 'stars for a cause' to donate six eco-friendly cars to be auctioned to selected charities proposed by the stars. the stars, meryl streep, christina aguilera, leonardo dicaprio, tom hanks, felicity huffman and colin firth arrived at the golden globe ceremony in the 6 limited edition chrysler 300c cars.
the eco friendly car is made of environmentally friendly materials including cork, bamboo, jute, recycled carpet etc. each star will auction and donate the 300c that accompanied him/her at the event to an organization of their choice.
damm good idea
