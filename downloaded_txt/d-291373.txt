the caledonian society of arizona (csa)
during a recent caledonian society of arizona board of directors meeting, the board voted unanimously to postpone the previously scheduled 60th anniversary phoenix scottish games until 2026. the games were tentatively to be held in february of 2025.
the board did not arrive at this decision lightly. current financial obligations, increasing overall costs to host the games, as well as significant increase in funds due prior to opening the games all contributed to the decision. additionally, decreased ticket sales in all areas and lessening member resources were considered by the board.
the board of directors remains extremely optimistic for 2026. the csa is soliciting ideas for and is committed to fundraising, sponsorship, and membership drives this coming year.
many volunteers spend countless hours at the games, and the board and phoenix scottish games committee are extremely grateful for their time and support! 2025 will be a rebuilding year and members help and commitment is a great opportunity to help the csa grow!
the 60th phoenix scottish games can be an amazing event and a fitting tribute to its longevity. the board and trustees are confident in the future and know it will take all of us to make it a success.
thank you for your understanding and support.
