don omar gets marrierd





last friday, don omar went from urban artist to classic artist in his first ever unplugged performance in puerto rico. does reggaeton mix well with orchestra music? well in this case it did with all his hits remixed with violins and cellos minus the dj.the next day was his super sweet wedding with jackie guerrido at san juan’s ritz carlton and from what we hear things went smoothly (guess no jackie haters crashed the party).as promised, ivy queen was at the wedding along with tito el bambino but unfortunately calle 13 and wisin y yandel were a no show. it looks like this wedding coverage is officially over. we can now call the lovely couple mr. and mrs. omar landrón. ¡felicidades!

jackie a big fake





ok, i know its been a long time i haven't posted in this blog, i have been doing some other projects. anyway, i'm going to start blogging more often from now on. now lets start with something that i need to express. like all of you know, don omar will be marrying jakie guerrdo on april 19th, but lets be real, this women is a gold digger, everybody knows this, 99% of don omar's fans can agree with me. when you see jakie guerrido with don omar, you can tell she is not happy and not in love, she is only using him to secure her financial future. don omar is deeply in love with her, thats why he doesn't realize jakie is a fake. the other day, don omar and jakie guierrdo were in a tv show (don fransisco) and don omar was talking on how in love he was with jakie and mentioning the huge mansion he bought for her over at new york, etc, etc, and while all this was going on, jakie had a face that she wanted to leave the show (bitchy kind of face). not even once did jakie say she loved him, but omar said it over 5 times, its pretty incredible.i feel bad for don omar becuase he doesn't deserve this, but i guess we all have warned him. let him realize his mistake, at the end he will learn from the experience. well, what do you guys think about all this?

breacking news - jackie guerrido having a baby





yes, you read the title right. the are rumors that jackie guerrido is going to have a baby and the father is don omar. i don't know how don omar let this happen if its true. its obvious jackie guerrido wanted this for the money. now probably jackie has don omar fucked for 18 years. my guess is that the pension that don omar is going give is between $20,000 to $25,000 a month (if they separate). wow, what can i say, jackie guerrido played the game right and now her future is secure, money wise. what do you guys think about this?update - the rumor turned out to be false, im dam glad.

don omar and jackie guerrido





whats up people, well, as you may have heard, don omar has a new girlfriend called jackie guerrido. she is boricua just liek don omar and very beautiful with an excellent body. what many people don't know is that jackie guerrido is more then 40 years old, i was stunned when i found out, to me she looks like 29.by the looks of it, don omar likes older women. in my opnion, by the way i see her in televison with don omar, she is only afther his money. she doesn't seem in love with don omar, but don omar does seem very in love with her, thats why he is blind and can't see that she is only afther the big bucks.i hope don omar doesn't have any children with jackie becuase if he does, then he is pretty much jodio with the pension.what do you guys think?

don omar and menudo





menudo fans. i damn sure wasn’t but my uncle and cousin sure were. and if you a ’70s person you probably were too. this past saturday in the q-boro’s queens mall in ny hundreds of teenagers lined up to have the chance to get thongs thrown at their face and form menudo 2007.and when he isn’t winning billboard awards for best reggaeton album of ‘06, don omar, alongside artist manager johnny wright (dude from making the band) were picking some menudo people. the finalists will participate in mtv tr3s’ road to menudo show that will begin airing may 12.don omar said "i enjoyed the process. seeing so many young people full of talent and desire to become the new members of menudo was fun. without a doubt, menudo is a staple of the entertainment industry in general, and more so i am more than proud that its beginnings are from my native island of puerto rico,".

don omar was in danger





don omar like i mention earlier was doing a worldwide tour, but in one of its flights, don omar was just a few minutes away from landing and a mechanical failure to the airplane caused some trouble. according to some rumors, the plane didn't want to land. this is some scary stuff if you ask me, but the good news is that the pilots got everything taking care of and were able to pull the landing gear down. don omar is alright, and lets just say it was a terrible experiences for him. in other news, don omar yesterday was in puerto rico in a show called objetivo fama, were he sang one of his new songs from kings of kings special edition. his performance was great, and best of all he didn't lip sing like other artist that tend to do this all the time. it was all done live. very good show.

don omar has a new multi-million dollar house





the famous, rich, talented, boricua don omar has just told the press that he bought a new luxury house which cost him a heavy 4 million dollars. if you thought don omar didn't have money, then you were wrong. he told the press that he works very hard for for what he has, and that he deserves these luxuries. currently don omar doesn't have a wife, therefore he only lives with his brother. it's estimated that don omar is worth more then 25 million dollars and it will keep on growing as time goes by.ladies and gentlemen, this is what happens when you are hit by success.
