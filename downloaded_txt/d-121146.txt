become a member now!


	lsp is a great place to view amazing builds and learn more about building models, and you don't have to be a member to receive those benefits. but another great aspect of the community is, well, the community: exchanging ideas with fellow modellers, posting your own builds, or asking questions of others. so why not become a member and join in the fun?
