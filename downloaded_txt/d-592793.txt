 faqs

 
     how do you commission a bespoke piece of jewellery?

   




  if you want to have a hand in the design of your own piece of unique jewellery you need to deal with a bespoke jeweller.    there are different types of jeweller.retail jewellers buy in factory-made products which they then retail to the general public, a bespoke jeweller will create a unique piece to your exact requirements. it is important to choose a jeweller that designs and makes unique items from scratch. unfortunately, some jewellers advertising a bespoke service simply assemble mass-produced components.in reality, this is not bespoke jewellery. it is customised design which constitutes a half-way-house between mass-produced and bespoke, allowing only limited possibilities.  aurum designer-jewellers specialises in truly bespoke jewellery. we start from scratch with every commission, which means you have control over every aspect of the design. even if you don’t know exactly what you are looking for you can design your own jewellery! you’ll meet a highly-skilled craftsman who will guide you through the design process. it is our job to find out what you really want.by asking the right questions we’ll draw out of you the information we need about your taste and lifestyle. we’ll generally produce pencil sketches, and might show items if stock or photographs of previous commissions. once we have arrived at design that fulfils your requirements we’ll have the specifications we need to calculate a price for you.
