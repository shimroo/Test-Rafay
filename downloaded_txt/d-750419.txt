									the perfect ballooning experience								



welcome to first flight 



with first flight you can buy your balloon ride knowing you are flying with the very best.the company is owned and operated by nick and tash, who together with nigel and our great support team, have been providing champagne balloon flights in the local area for over 30 years.we only ever fly with a maximum of 8 passengers in the balloon, ensuring you get the best experience possible, rather than squeezing in 16-20 passengers as many others do.our tickets are valid, mornings, evenings and weekends no matter which voucher you buy.we pride ourselves on our exceptional customer service and attention to detail both before, during and after what we promise will be a memorable adventure (see our tripadvisor reviews!!). it will be nick or nigel that will always fly the balloon, so you can rest assured you will be flying with one of the most experienced pilots in the country.as it is our business, we take immense satisfaction from personally taking you through the whole process, right from the first phone call to the celebratory glass of bubbles after we have landed. no call centre, no automated check-in line, you can call us direct and speak with your pilot if you have any questions.we schedule flights all year round with excellent availability, ensuring you get your preferred date without waiting months to fly.nick dunnington.

we booked our flight for early october and after a couple of weather cancellations managed to get our flight in late october. beautiful views and great fun getting involved with set up and pack away. one party member was a nervous flyer but the professionalism and care of the team put them at ease and they enjoyed the flight.

  a great special birthday celebration  – finally we took off after a couple of weather cancellations. a clear safety briefing, the balloon was filled, we cimbed into the basket and off we flew. a clear bright… read more morning with light winds. nick was a fun pilot with a great sense of humour.   trains tooted at us, dogs barked at us and car drivers waved at us. finally we landed in a paddock avoiding a field with a bull. a great morning completed with a glass of sparkling wine.  i would thoroughly recommend first flight.

  magical and moving  – our balloon trip was a wonderful and joyful experience. nick and steve were brilliant, friendly and fun, but also very capable and we felt safe all the time. we flew… read more over the iconic bristol suspension bridge and spotted lots of familiar places. it was moving to see everyone going about their lives from high above, especially when they looked up and waved to us. children cheered, dogs barked and tennis players waved their rackets ! we met so many friendly people at take off and landing. all the world, it seems, loves a balloon!
