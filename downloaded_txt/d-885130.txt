empowering individuals with disabilities: a guide to resources and support


understanding disability and its impact
disability is a natural part of human diversity, yet it often remains misunderstood or stigmatized. it's essential to recognize that individuals with disabilities are not defined by their condition, but rather by their abilities, strengths, and potential.
