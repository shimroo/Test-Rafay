 âthe book [a new science of heaven] is an important contribution, and i hope it will open many minds. what is particularly important in it are the discussions of david bohm, of bioplasma, biophotons, and bioelectronics.â

    professor robert temple is author of a dozen challenging and provocative books, commencing with the international best-seller, the sirius mystery. his books have been translated into a total of 44 foreign languages. he combines solid academic scholarship with an ability to communicate with the mass public.
 he is visiting professor of the history and philosophy of science at
     tsinghua university in beijing, and previously held a similar position at an
     american university. for many years he was a science writer for the sunday times,
     the guardian, and a science reporter for time-life, as well as a frequent reviewer
     for nature and profile writer for the new scientist. he is a fellow of the royal
     astronomical society, and has been a member of the egypt exploration society
     since the 1970s, as well as a member of numerous other academic societies.  he has
     produced, written and presented a documentary for channel four and national
     geographic channels on his archaeological discoveries in greece and italy, and he
     was at one time an arts reviewer on bbc radio 4’s ‘kaleidoscope’. in 1993, his
     translation of the babylonian epic of gilgamesh was performed at the royal

     the first complete english version of aesop’s fables, which attracted a great deal of
     international press attention at the time of its release, as the earlier translations had
     suppressed some of the fables because of victorian prudery.

    
     temple was a
     colleague of the late dr. joseph needham of cambridge, in association with whom
     he wrote the genius of china, which has been approved as an official reference
     book (in chinese) for the chinese secondary school system, and which won five
     national awards in the usa. he has done archaeometric dating work and intensive
     exploration of closed sites in egypt with the permission of the egyptian supreme
     council of antiquities. his research into historical accounts of the sphinx is the
     first comprehensive survey ever undertaken.

a new science of heaven
hodder & stoughton, london. 24 march 2022.

a new, explosive study of plasma and its revolutionary implications for how we
              understand the universe and our place in it.
most scientific histories of the 20th century have focused on relativity and quantum mechanics. but, quietly in the background, there has been a third area of exploration which has equally important implications for our understanding of the universe.

               it is mostly unknown to the general public despite myriad nobel prize winners, senior academics and major research centres around the world devoting their lives and research to it - it is the study of plasma.

               plasma is the fourth state of matter and the other three - gas, liquid and solids - emerge from plasma. a new science of heaven reveals how over 99% of the universe is made of plasma and how there are two gigantic clouds of plasma, called the kordylewski clouds, hovering between the earth and the moon, only recently discovered by astronomers in hungary.

               other revelations not previously known include evidence that, in certain circumstances, plasma exhibits sentience, a sense that it may be alive. clouds of plasma have evolved double helixes, banks of cells and crystals, filaments and junctions which could control the flow of electric currents, thus generating an intelligence similar to a super-computer. we may, in fact, have been looking for signs of extra-terrestrial life in the wrong place - temple believes that intelligent entities can be inorganic and non-biological, and thus do not have to live on planets.

professor robert temple is an independent scholar and author of a dozen challenging and provocative books, commencing with the international best-seller, the sirius mystery. his books have been translated into a total of 44 foreign languages. he is visiting professor of the history and philosophy of science at tsinghua university in beijing, and previously held a similar position at an american university.

               robert has followed the study of plasma for decades and was personally acquainted with several of the senior scientists - including nobel laureates - at its forefront, including paul dirac, david bohm, peter mitchell and chandra wickramasinghe (who has co-written an academic paper with temple).

               he has written for the sunday times, the guardian, and was science reporter for time-life, as well as a frequent reviewer for nature and profile writer for the new scientist. he is available for interview, feature and events throughout 2022.

‘just looking over this book i knew it was a book i needed to read. â¦ it is essential for me to edit a scrap of this knowledge for a final autobiography which is to be itself in the form of a scrapbook “who is vivienne?” it connects with everything i care about.’

egyptian dawn
century, london, 2010.
                 a fascinating look into the real history of the ancient civilisations, including revelatory new evidence which challenges accepted truths about the history of egypt.
                 the mysteries of ancient egypt have proved an endless source of fascination to the world. here, for the first time, international bestselling author robert temple seeks to expose the real history of this ancient civilisation. in this fascinating study, temple unearths revelatory new evidence which challenges accepted truths about the history of egypt and questions the evidence which most egyptologists have relied on since 1910. in so doing he has sought to answer the two big questions which have until now been taken for granted: 
                 

where did egyptian civilisation come from? 

                   and who built the pyramids, and why? 

                 with unprecedented access to lost portions of the valley temple which have long been closed to archaeologists, temple presents a sensational, reconstructed story of egypt which exposes a magnitude of previously unseen evidence, including:


pinpointing exact locations of unopened royal tombs

                 presenting re-datings of key monuments using a revolutionary new dating technique

                 exposing faked evidence which has been credulously accepted by the
                 egyptological communityâ¨

                 revealing who really built the pyramids

                 the great pyramid could not have been built by king cheops, nor was it his tomb. but robert temple has discovered the precise location of the real tomb of cheops, which has never been opened since his burial, and is elsewhere at giza

the sphinx mystery
with olivia temple, inner traditions, rochester, 2009.
             revealing that the sphinx was originally a monumental anubis, the egyptian jackal god, and that its face is that of a middle kingdom pharaoh, amenemhet ii, which was a later re-carving. in addition,  photographic evidence of ancient sluice gate traces to demonstrate that, during the old kingdom, the sphinx as anubis sat surrounded by a moat filled with water--called jackal lake in the ancient pyramid texts--where religious ceremonies were held. robert temple provides evidence that the exact size and position of the sphinx were geometrically determined in relation to the pyramids of cheops and chephren and that it was part of a pharaonic resurrection cult.
