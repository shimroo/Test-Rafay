member's showcase invitation
org&hps features members’ 20 minute presentations at most meetings in the members showcase. in this part of our monthly meetings we would like to hear about your insights and experiences from your garden or gardens you have visited. it can be on a wide range of horticultural subjects, from the local flora that hold a fascination for you, to the exotic.  • perhaps you have experience with native plants? or starting seeds, or bulbs, spring or fall, or everything in between? have you been taking pictures of your garden over the summer and are interested showing these gardening highlights at our meetings? • many of our members have visited noteworthy gardens, remote locations to see special plants, or attended horticultural events.   all of these, and more, would be fine presentations to org&hps member showcase segments.  please consider putting together a 20 minute showcase presentation. for more information, contact the co-ordinator, beatrice beaubien at this email address is being protected from spambots. you need javascript enabled to view it..
