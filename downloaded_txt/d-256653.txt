hello..i just want to say your food has made a huuugeeee difference in my eldest german shepherd dog, bear.

                    bear is going on 12 years old.. he was our "geriatric " dog .. the   reason we purchased our now 1 year and 3 month old gsd "einstein" â ..   all bear did was sleep and limp (front legs ) when he walked... he was   getting old really fast... 

                    since feeding him your food, this dog now actually runs!! 

                    he also tried to chase quads again (this used to be a huge â problem in   his younger years), and just this morning he was laying on my couch!!!   this dog hasn't laid on my couch in yeaaarrss!

                    i am sooo very grateful for your food and would have never imagined what a huge difference it would make!! 

                    thank you!!!


 chrissy s.

                            hello.â we are in day 7 of the food change over and it is nothing short   of amazing. prior to buying gentle giants, we had to sprinkle some meat   or pour some gravy on his food to get our dog, dewy, to eat. 







now, when he hears it hit the bowl, he actually runs to eat, and eats it all, every time.â  

                              tomorrow, we go 100% gentle giants and are excited about it.

                              his energy level us up 100%, too. he's wearing me out playing with him, but it's fantastic.

                              many thanks for all of the information.

                              great on the brochures.â just like when we were pregnant suddenly we,   saw pregnant women everywhere, now we are seeing large dogs everywhere.

                              i have been handing out a business card with your website on it, we are so impressed with our results. your brochure is just so nice.

                              is it a good idea to approach our vet to see if they would carry gentle giants? 

thanks, have a great day.

                              i spoke with you on the phone a few days before thanksgiving.

                              thank you for all of the great information.â after just over a month on your food, our dog has actually started leaving food in his bowl.

                              fantastic!

                              i had asked for some of your brochures and you said you would send me information on how to approach our walmart manager, and what to say to help get your food in our local store.

                              i have not received this information yet. i know how busy you are and hope to get it soon.

                              thanks, have a very merry christmas!

hi david:

                            thankâ  you for your correspondence.

                            i am thrilled to hear that your dog is doing great on gentle          giants.â  

                            since your dog has now been on gentle giants for over a month,          the next thing that you should look for is a noticeable increase          in your dog's overall health since our dog food should be          helping remove the fat content from your dog's arteries that has          built up from the years of eating other dog foods.â please let          me know if you notice a difference.

                            lastly, you are correct.â i have been extraordinarily busy          filling orders to stores of our gentle giants dog food.

                            i will overnight you several packages of our brochures on monday          for arrival at your home on tuesday.â i still have to look for          the information to send you to contact your local walmart store          manager.â i'll find it soon.

                            thank you for your help in spreading the word about gentle          giants.

                            i hope you and your family and your dog have a wonderful          christmas and a terrific new year.

                            best regards,

                            thanks, our dog dewy, has lost a noticeable amount of weight.â we are going to get him weighed this week.

                            several people have commented on the softness of his fur and he has walked away from finishing several meals.

                            we believed, but were skeptical.â it works!

                            today, just about 6 weeks into it we put food in a big tool box, hoping he would self-regulate, but still a little skeptical.

                            in his first 3 feedings today, he only ate for about a minute then walked away.

                            my wife was amazed. we should have the control he has eating.

                            thanks.

                              dear gentle giants:

                              i just wanted to let you know that i bought a large bag   ofâ gentle giants dogâ foodâ today for my one-year-old male chocolate   labrador retriever! 

                              he is very picky about his kibble.â 

                              as soon as i put   the gentle giants kibble in his bowl, he gobbled it up! i wasâ feeding   him science diet large breed adult food and he would not eat it unless   iâ mixed inâ cooked chicken or ground beef. 

                              todayâ i mixed the science diet   with the gentle giants kibble and he did not eat the science diet! he   leftâ all of theâ science diet kibbleâ on the floor! 

                              i will send you   another email in the next couple of weeks to let you know how he is   doing on his new food. 

                              sincerely,

                    burt ward â who played robin the boy wonder on the beloved ’60s tv  show “batman” â has gone from caped crusader to canine crusader! 
the former sidekick to actor adam west now operates a rescue shelter with  his wife tracy for dogs in norco, calif. they also sell an all-natural dog food that ward claims gives pooches an 14- to 21-year lifespan.
“my dog food is a special comâ­bination that’s dry and low-fat,” ward, 67,  told the enquirer. “we go through 600 pounds a day to feed our dogs, and they  only have to go to the vet once every three years, just for their regular  shots!”
ward added that he doesn’t make any money from his dog food or the shelter,  saying: “this is a charity. we’re simply giving back to society.”
at least 50 tail-waggers live with the couple at any given time. that  includes 45 different breeds, ranging from tiny lap dogs to 295-pound giants.
his gentle giants dog food â touted as “specially formulated all-natural  world-class canine cuisine” â is sold in walmart, and ward is now touring to promote the product â  and himself.
fans who cough up the cash for a bag of gentle giants get a free autographed  photo of ward as robin, plus the chance to have their picture taken in the  famed batmobile.
“the main purpose is to inâ­troduce people to gentle giants dog food,” said  ward, who also peddles the product at www. gentlegiantsrescue.com.
and he’s prepping to return to tv â but without his red, yellow and green  robin costume.
“i’m getting ready to do a pilot for a series about our dog rescue,” ward  said. “we’ll show how we save dogs and find them loving homes.”

recent letters to gentle giants 




 wow!â  thanks so much for a   great product!â  our dog, benji, is excited to eat it like no other   food!â  we are impressed with the whole cause.â  keep up the good work!

my wife and i have two “kids” - a yellow lab   (maverick) and a golden retriever (molly).â  maverick has a sensitive   stomach and molly has skin allergies.â  a friend of mine has been telling   me about your food so we decided to give it a try to see if it helps.
we’ve   been feeding the dogs iams.â  the first thing we noticed when we opened   the bag of gentle giants food was the aroma.â  your food smelled fresh   and sweet, where the iams smells like grease.â  next, we mixed the food   for acclimation and even with such a small amount of your food in the   mix, the dogs went nuts.â  molly even took the time to chew it.â  this   morning was only their second time eating the mix and when they were   finished they had to switch bowls to see if the other had any food left   in it, something they haven’t done before. 
we’re hoping that the food will help with their issues, and i’m confident it will. â â â  
we   “rescued” both our dogs from petworks, and i mean rescued.â  (just   because a dog isn’t in a shelter doesn’t mean it doesn’t need a loving   family and a healthy life).â  maybe when the lord takes molly or maverick   back, we can be blessed by working with you. 
thanks for all you do for these magnificent animals.â

hello mr. ward,

                  i will continue to inform and sell your product proudly. my dog hasn't been the same since i started feeding him gentle giants. he is acting younger everyday. thank you for giving us back our puppy. talk to you soon.

                  until he began eating all natural gentle giants dog food)



 


gentle giants:

                  first id like to say that your dog food has changed the quality of our dogs' lives!  we have a merliquin great dane 
                  (gracie) who is two, and a   four year old english mastiff (zoe.) my husband is in the army, and we   have moved a lot! with each move, the dogs developed a more sensitive   system, the end result being severe stressâ colitis. out of desperation   we tried your food (having it shipped to texas was costly), but much to   our surprise, all the symptoms went away!

                  the reason i am writing is because about 4 months ago, the biggest   and most drastic moveâ occurred; we were sent to germany. we left the   dogs with friendsâ untilâ we could secure a good home with us here in   europe. now that we have done that, and are ready to have our dogs, i am   wondering if you could ship to our apo address? our family misses our   dogs, but,â without your food, i am sure the dogs will go back to the sickly state they were in before. do you have any suggestions for us?

                  thank you in advance.

                  sincerely,

                  suzanne l.


 


 hi~

                  my name is jennifer and i have three babies at home (pugs) eating gentle giants. i was looking for a good quality dog food but couldn't seem to find anything without going to a specialty store and i came across gentle giants in my local stater bros. so, i brought it home and they have been on it for about two weeks now. they already seem perkier and to have more energy. one of my pug's has a sensitive stomach and he always had problems on other brands that i tried except for one, and it was just too expensive for me to continue to buy for three dogs. so, thank you for a high quality dog food that is convenient to get and at an an affordable price!

 hello burt:
this may sound strange but your rescue changed my sister’s  life. her and her father adopted many great danes from you, and i believe one  of them is the harlequin living with my mom and me. 
sadly, we lost my sister yesterday morning, and we will be  asking people to donate to your rescue in lieu of flowers. 
at the wizards world convention last year, she wanted so  badly to tell you exactly how appreciative she was and what your rescue meant  to her, but she chickened out at the last minute. so, i wanted to take a moment  and tell you myself that the dogs she adopted from you were such a huge part of  her life and helped her so much in her battle with depression. 
thank you so very much!

hi tracy and burt:

                              wagner continues to do very well on your gentle giants dog food and has just about regained all the weight he lost.

                              hard to believe just a short while ago when he was eating another dog food, he was under 100 lbs., down from 146 lbs.

                              hope you all are well.

                              love you both!
