this is the home page of mpeg, the group that develops standards for coded representation of digital audio, video, 3d graphics and genomic data. since its establishment in 1988, the group has produced standards that help industry offer end users an ever more enjoyable digital media experience.
in its 30 years of activity mpeg has developed an impressive portfolio of standards and technologies that have created an industry worth several hundreds billion usd.
in a world where information technology, consumer electronics, entertainment and telecommunication products and content variously converge by incorporating increasingly sophisticated technologies and the need for timely available standards is as strong as ever, mpeg provides a proven mechanism to bring research results into standards that promote innovation for the benefit of all.
