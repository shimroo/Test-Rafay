the boston art dealers association supports human rights, dignities and equality. the organization condemns hatred of any kind; violence, both physical and psychological; and discrimination against race, nationality, religious beliefs, gender, gender expression, age and physical abilities. we hope that through the arts, education and justice, we can bring about change.
