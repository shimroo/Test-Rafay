pre-kindergarten 2025-2026
pre-kindergarten is for children with severe needs who are between the ages of 2 years and 8 months and 4 years and 8 months old by september 1 of the year they are attending, as per alberta education criteria.
for the 2025/26 school year, the pre-kindergarten program requires that children qualify for the program before we can register them. to qualify for pre-kindergarten your child:

must be born in 2021 or 2022
must qualify based on alberta education criteria for severe needs (i.e. severe speech language delay, autism spectrum disorder, down syndrome, behaviour disorder, or other medical disorders)

the pre-kindergarten program will run from september 2025 to june 2026 (5 days per week for 2.5 hours each day). daily attendance in the program is a requirement to meet alberta education criteria. bus transportation is available for those who qualify (based on address and assigned school placement).
if you want your child to be considered for enrolment in september 2025, please click on the link below. this is a central intake list for all of the pre-kindergarten sites in edmonton public schools, therefore you only need to enter your child’s information once.

principal's message
 
at hillview school we believe in growing together, connecting community and inspiring minds! 
it is my privilege to welcome you to the hillview school community. we are a small school with a huge heart. hillview school builds strong citizenship through working collectively with all members of both our area and school community and our amazing school staff work as a collaborative team to accommodate all learning needs. 
programming in our elementary classrooms target growth and achievement in the areas of literacy and numeracy through authentic and diverse learning opportunities. all grades are supported with a range of technology and digital learning tools. strong citizenship and collaborative work related to anti-racism and reconciliation is a priority in our school. in addition, hillview school offers a comprehensive health and wellness program through the apple school project and a focus on mental health capacity building. hillview staff work hard to ensure that our students leave with the skills they need to be successful in their future learning. 
hillview is also home to a pre-kindergarten program. the pre-kindergarten program provides intervention and support to pre-school children with severe developmental delays and is directly funded through alberta education program unit funding. the children we serve range in age from 2.8 to 5 years and have a severe delay in their development. each class has a team of professionals who work with children on speech, mobility and everyday tasks such as communicating and exploring through play. children attend five half days of programming each week and most are bussed to the school. 
a strong connection with our parent community is an integral aspect of student success in school. we encourage parents to be active in their child’s learning and to work in partnership with the school to support their child's academic and social/emotional growth. the hillview edmonton parents association (h.e.p.a.) supports student learning by providing funds for field trips and experiences that reach beyond the classroom walls. their support ensures all students benefit from our healthy, vibrant school community. 
as partners in your child’s education i look forward to working together to keep hillview school a special place for children to learn and grow.
here's to a rewarding and productive school year,
karen steinhauer
principal
