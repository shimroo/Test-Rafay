it's all about us…..















posted on october 5, 2010october 5, 2010spring is here 

lovely day and a bike - nicewith spring here in full force (at least for a few days) we went out and bought a towbar mounted bike rack.  now that max is in an almost full size bike it’s really the only way to transport their bikes around.
before we went shopping for the rack i took some photos of the boys in front of their bikes so that we’d have an idea of sizes.  we took one of max then one of elliot.  max than asks if i could take one of elliot with “me being an idiot in the background” -the shot here is the result…… 🙂

it was movie night in the cramer household tonight and the boys had been on about ghostbusters for a while.  given that max is a bit sensitive when it come to scary movies i thought this choice would be somewhat interesting.
after moving from his position in front of the tv to be on the couch with me after the very first ghost scene (to be fair they both did) i really didn’t think we’d get through it but he manned up and rode it out. he was really waiting to see the stay puft man and as it was at the end i guess he had to watch until the end 🙂
a couple of things i noticed about the movie:

everyone always seemed to have a cigarette in their mouth
sigourney weaver, bill murray and dan ackroyd looked so young! 🙂
the special effects were pretty crap.  were they any good even in their day?

anyway, it’ll be interesting to see how the boys go tonight. they seemed to have gone of to sleep ok………..

i have decided to make this blog the center of our information sharing again.  i miss having a stream of what’s going on in our lives that is under my control so here we go.  i’m not sure how it will link in with facebook yet but will be working on it.

elliot lost his first tooth this morning! he wandered through and told us that he’d lost it and woke up with it sitting just inside his lower lip. luckily he didn’t swallow it – unlike the kid over the road who swallowed his first three! 🙂

busy day today!
first of all i ripped max’s wiggly tooth out of his mouth!  it was an accident, honest!  i was getting max dressed for his birthday party and we had put a t-shirt on that was too small.  in the process of taking it off it must have caught on his tooth and all of a sudden he was screaming and blood was pouring out of his mouth!  we looked around for his tooth for five seconds or so only to discover the tooth stuck up his nose!

we then had max’s birthday party at a local swimming pool with 9 of his friends.  he really enjoyed it and it was a very stress free way for us to throw a party!

one of max’s front teeth has been slightly wiggly for a while. naturally he can’t leave it alone and today it took a turn for the wiggly worst 🙂 i reckon tomorrow……
