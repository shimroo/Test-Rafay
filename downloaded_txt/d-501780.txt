after the critical success of their acclaimed 2012 album the road gets darker from here, gallon drunk have returned to their producer johann scheerer’s clouds hill studio.

				together with new bassist leo kurunis, gallon drunk have created their most exciting, passionate and groundbreaking work to date – the soul of the hour.
				a howling celebration of survival and creative drive against the crushing weight of day-to-day existence, the soul of the hour finds gallon drunk pushing ever further into previously uncharted musical territory for the band. with an emphasis firmly upon hypnotic, locked down grooves, free flowing instrumental passages and all manner of european inspirational music that courses through the band’s collective bloodstream gallon drunk have stretched out their music into thrilling and unfamiliar shapes. an emphasis upon a more focused, disciplined attack has fashioned a compelling musical wall of sound of considerable power, melancholy and fury. the soul of the hour offers heartfelt songs of dread, sadness, love and anguish, ever reaching for the transcendent moment within the incessant race against the passage of time.
