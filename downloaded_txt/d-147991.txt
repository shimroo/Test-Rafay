model



a contingent firm is paid only when a placement is made. the firm receives either a fixed fee or a percentage of the hire's salary.
a retained firm receives a retainer, usually based on a percentage of the potential hire's salary, regardless of whether or not a hire is made.
an outplacement  firm helps displaced employees find new jobs. they also provide counseling and support services. often, this service is paid for by the employer.
an interim staffing  firm hires its own employees and assigns them to clients on a temporary basis. the firm specifies the pay and benefits for the employee.
recruitment process outsourcing (rpo) is when an hr department transfers part of its recruitment activities to an external firm.
