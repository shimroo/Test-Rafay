developing film


30/11/2017defaultfrancis carlson 


prepare chemical substances

1. buy a photographic development kit. there are some development kits that can be used to develop c-41 in color and black and white. the c-41 is a common consumption film used in 35mm machines, so these development kits are the most practical solution for the average consumer.
· note, however, that if you are not using c-41 compatible film, you should look for a specific kit for your film type. instructions for different development kits and used chemicals may differ from those contained herein.
2. shakes powder for hot water development. pour 1600 ml of hot water into a clean glass or plastic container. mix the developing powder until it dissolves. add enough water to get to 2 liters.
· the water temperature should be about 43.5 � c. since it is cooled for use, it should not fall below 37.8 � c.
· use distilled water rather than tap water whenever possible.
· do not mix chemicals in metal containers.
3. mix blix packages with water. pour another 1600 ml of hot water into a second clean glass or plastic container. mix the “blix” or “bleach-fix” into the water and add enough water to 2000 ml.
· the blix is ​​also known as “bleach-fix”. [1] if there are more blix packages, add them in alphabetical order: “a” and then “b”.
· the water temperature should be about 43.5 � c. it will cool down while remaining in position, but you should not allow it to drop below 37.8 � c.
· use distilled water and do not mix chemicals in metal containers.
4. shakes the stabilizer pack with water. shakes the contents of the powder that makes “stabilizer” in 2 liters of fresh water and mixes it carefully.
· use distilled water at room temperature. there is no need for a precise temperature.
prepare the tank
1. wash your tank with hot water. separate the roll in its various parts: the body, the center column, the spiral, the lid and the hood. wash the body with warm water and dry thoroughly with a clean cloth.
· if there are chemical stains, smudge with hot water and a clean cloth.
· reposition the central column when you’re done. the column is what makes it possible for the tank to remain dark or “light-proof” even when adding chemicals.
2. adjust the spiral to accommodate the film. [2] the standard size setting should be fine for the 35mm film, but if so, you cannot change the size until it is compatible with the film.
· separate the spiral into two separate pieces. a piece has a long channel while the other has a tongue that engages in this channel at various points.
· the first engagement should be for the 35 mm film. the second is usually for 127 and the last for 120. attach the tab in the first channel, making it snap in place.
load the film
1. turn off the lights. holding the spiral, turn off the lights of the room you are in. give your eyes time to adjust to darkness before continuing.
· exposing the film to light will ruin it, so you have to keep the lights off while loading the film in the tank.
2. remove the film from the roll. use a bottle opener to open the roller, imagine that the bottom of the roll is the cap.
· after removing the film, always handle the edges instead of the center.
· cut away the guide portion at the beginning of the film with clean scissors and set aside.
3. load the film on the spiral. load the end of the film so cut into the guides inside the spiral. make sure the first 3-5 cm film is inserted into the spiral.
· turn the coil back and forth to insert the rest of the film. the rolls below the guides will take on the film and pull it in. continue until the film is completely wound on the spiral.
· cut the last portion of film attached to the roll.

4. place the coil in the center column of the tank. insert the spiral into the center column and firmly screw the cover.
· once done, you can turn on the lights again. the central column should provide adequate protection against light.
develop the film

1. pre-wet the film. [3] pour pure distilled water into the tank and leave to stand for 60 seconds before emptying it.
· the water coming out will probably be turbid green.
· the water temperature should be about 38.9 � c.
2. develop the film. pour the growth solution into the tank and leave for 3 minutes and half before emptying it. the film should be completely submerged, and you should shake the tank for 10 seconds every 30 seconds during this phase.
· make sure the development solution has a temperature of about 38.9 � c.
3. use the blix. pour the blix solution into the tank and leave for 6 minutes and half. shake the tank for 10 seconds every 30 seconds. get it out when you’re done.
· the temperature of the blix should fluctuate between 35 and 40.6 � c.
· the stage of light-sensitive development ends with the end of this phase. you can work without lid as soon as you finish.
4. wash the film. remove the spiral from the tank and wash under running water for 3 minutes to wash off the chemicals.
· the water temperature should fluctuate between 35 and 40.6 � c.
5. use the stabilizer. reposition the spiral in the tank. pour the stabilizer and shake the tank for 15 seconds. leave the film in the stabilizer for a time between 30 and 60 seconds.
· the solution should be at room temperature.
6. dry the film. the film should develop for a time between 4 and 8 hours.
· remove the spiral from the tank again and separate it to open it.
· pinch one end of the roll and remove the film, leaving it unrolled.
· apply the film in a dry, dust-free place, like a shower cubicle. use clips for film.

is film better than digital?


25/11/2017defaultfrancis carlson 


digital cameras have been developing day by day since their invention. the advent of digital photography has almost replaced the conventional film photography in the consumer market. the production of new film cameras has come down considerably. while digital cameras offer a lot of benefits, there still are some benefits to using film photography.
these benefits include:
resolution
digital camera sensors are made from pixels or grid of photo elements. so, the image sensor resolution is based on the number of pixels on the sensor. this is called the resolution, which is expressed in megapixels. therefore, the digital sensors are prone to distortion due to the moiré effects. on the other hand, film media is not affected by this issue.
sensor size
the size of the image sensor in a digital camera is limited. these sensors are smaller than the regular 35mm film frame. this may result in a lot of issues, such as pixel noise and light sensitivity, to name a few. you can’t find many user-oriented cameras that have full frame sensors. so, their sensors are not as good as those found in film cameras.
on the other hand, you can find film media in many sizes ranging from 35mm to 135mm. it’s important to keep in mind that even the smallest size of the film doesn’t match the 24x36m film. in simple words, film cameras offer higher “resolution” than digital cameras.
dust problems
as far as film photography goes, dust and dirt is a common problem; however, digital photography is affected more by the dust and dirt. if dust gets into the camera and reaches the sensor, you won’t be able to take clear shots.
integrity
negatives have higher integrity than digital photos. in other words, negatives are taken as an evidence of the image authenticity. there are a lot of programs out there that allow you to modify digital images. so, the scope for falsification of digital photos is wider, which is not true for film photography.
storage, backups, and other costs
you don’t need a storage medium in case of a film camera. all you need is a film reel. moreover, the film reels are not as prone to damage as digital cameras. even if you mishandle the reel, you may end up damaging a frame or two. the rest of frames will be intact.
on the other hand, you need large memory cards and hard drives to store digital pictures. if the storage medium is damaged, you will find it extremely hard to recover the photos you shot. all of the data will be gone forever.
aside from this, there are compatibility issues as well. you have to have the right os, data drivers, motherboards and other components for the system to work. moreover, you also have to have large hard drives to store the images for backups. this adds to the effort and cost. in case of film cameras, you don’t have any of these problems.
the takeaway
although the film photography will be no more in the future, professionals still believe that film photography has a lot of advantages and offers better quality photos than digital.

how to capture the best photo on your phone


20/11/2017defaultfrancis carlson 


almost everyone these days has a mobile phone. mobile phones with inbuilt cameras have taken off in recent years. some camera phones have quite amazing cameras with high specifications. why not use your phone to take beautiful photos? this doesn’t mean that you replace your camera with a camera phone but, phones are incredibly handy and perfect for when you have left your camera at home and see that perfect photo opportunity.
here are 5 simple steps on how you can take beautiful photos with your mobile phone.
1. keep that lens clean.
the lens on your camera will be lucky enough to have a protective cover, the lens on your camera phone may not be so lucky! your phone is often in your hand, in the bottom of a bag or left about where the lens is just collecting dust and grime. to get beautiful photographs from your camera phone, you need to first look after the lens. here are two ways in which to keep that lens squeaky clean: get your camera phone a cover, it’s good if you can take it off when taking a photo. this will minimise dirt getting to the lens when your phone is in your bag or not in use. clean the lens. the ideal solution is not to get it dirty in the first place, but let’s face it, may be quite difficult. if you have a dusty lens take an earbud and gently clean the lens in a twisting motion.
2. avoid digital zoom.
using digital zoom on your camera phone is a bad idea. digital zoom works by cropping the image and then enlarging it, thus decreasing the quality of your photograph making the image much more pixelated. some camera phones are now being sold that have optical zoom. optical zoom works by enlarging the pixels meaning that the zoom will produce a crisper image to that of digital zoom.
use ‘natural’ zoom, your feet and get close to what your photographing. fill the frame. camera phones tend to have low resolution making the subject seem very tiny and sometimes unrecognizable, so get close.
3. hold still.
in low light the camera phone will set a slower shutter speed, this will increase camera shake, so it’s important to hold still. to help you hold the phone still, grip the phone tightly and lean your wrist or arm on something stable like a table or wall. this will help you keep the camera phone from moving when you’re taking a photograph.
remember that when you take a photo using your camera phone, there is usually a time delay from your pressing the shutter to the photograph being taken. this delay is called shutter lag. you will need to hold still for a few extra seconds until the photo has been taken.
4. give your photos a chance!
remember the screen on your phone is smaller and not as good as the screen on your computer. if your memory allows, keep all your photos and look at them more carefully when you look at them on the computer. shoot hundreds of photographs!
5. light your subject well.
make the most of natural light as not all camera phones have an inbuilt flash. if possible shoot outside. when shooting indoors, turn lights on to add more light.
if your phone doesn’t have a flash learn to use it when shooting in a bit bright light too as this can act as a flash.
