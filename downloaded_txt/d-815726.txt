this is no official website. it is a private initiative.
you, too, are given the opportunity to display your olympic souvenirs in the olympic museum
    and to present them worldwide. please send us a picture with a short description. we would at this point like to thank all the friends of the olympic museum, who, through their commitment and support, have greatly contributed to the diversity of the information now available at the museum. your opinions, comments and ideas to improve this web site are always welcome.
