scca road racing:the experience of a lifetime racing wheel to wheel with your friends at over 120+ mph! get your competition racing license and go racing with oregon region scca. it‚Äôs easier than most would think. once you have a race car or have one to rent, the process is simple. join the scca, apply for a novice permit, and than attend the pro drive racing school at portland international raceway to obtain your license. after that, it‚Äôs time for your first green flag!

push the limits of your street car!



scca solo: autocross seems very simple ‚Äì use traffic cones to make a mini-road course in a parking lot or airport and see who can get the lowest time without hitting any cones or going off course.despite the low overall speeds attained during competition, it‚Äôs one of the most intense, rapid-fire forms of motorsports you can enter, with barriers to entry low enough that many drivers are able to be quite competitive at it. autocross is a fun, easy, and safe way to learn the limits of your car. it is also a social event. it is part race and part car show. come for the competition and stay for the camaraderie. 
















    go driving!
  





























the best seat in the house!



race volunteeringbecome a part of the action at our races! work as an event volunteer in our corner stations, on pre-grid, in the timing & scoring tower, or become a part of our safety crew. it‚Äôs the best seat in the house with exceptional views of the action on track, while helping to keep our racers safe. we couldn‚Äôt host our events without the amazing volunteer core that we have here in oregon! our community welcomes anyone that wants to join, no experience required!

what a great way to end our season! outside of a few sprinkles we had mostly good weather, a solid turnout of drivers, and some close competitive racing! the track was fast with lots of indycar rubber down and good temperatures. we saw some fast laps in all of the groups. the paddock was lively and lots of smiles were made! 

shoutout to @motor_otter for the great photos from the weekend!
