what to expect  



our sunday service @ 9am & 10:45am our weekly sunday service is the heart of our congregation and a time of renewal.  regularly shared time together in worship and fellowship unites us in purpose and encourages our shared vision. each sunday features a diverse crowd of kids, adults, infants, seniors, and teens dressed in everything from jeans and graphic tees to sunday best. fun-filled, biblically-based children’s programming, dynamic worship and a rotation of speakers stimulates learning, fosters community and reflects the diversity we value.
