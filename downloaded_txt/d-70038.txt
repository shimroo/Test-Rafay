 501c
        classifications 



 view all 






there are over two dozen different 501c classifications that the united states internal revenue code uses to categorize organizations qualifying for federal income tax exemption. the largest and what most think of as a charitable entity is the 501c3. 
              this classification includes organizations whose primary activities are either charitable, educational, sports and recreation, religious, literary, animal and children cruelty prevention, scientific, or public safety testing.
charitable trusts under the 501(c)(90) classification are also quite common with 127,000+ organizations and over $100 billion in assets. many wealthy families and corporations have entities under this category. other large classifications include 501(c)(6) business leagues, 501(c)(5) labor organizations, and 501(c)(4) civic and social welfare organizations.
