christine by van thomas hair care review!








i recently had the privilege to review the christine by van thomas "complete package" set.  the "complete package" set includes christine shampoo, reconstructive conditioner, protective glaze and body wash.

during pregnancy (or any other time in a mom's life), taking a few moments for yourself can be extremely rejuvenating.  these hair and body products are luxurious and will make your shower feel like a spa.  my favorite thing about this line is that it is sulfate and paraben free (which is really important for expecting moms.)  also, the light citrusy floral scent is pretty without being overpowering to a pregnant woman's sensitive sense of smell.  

the christine shampoo provided excellent lather.  the manufacturer states that is was created with "micro-lather technology to provide a rich luxurious lather made up of extremely tiny bubbles" to provide a thorough cleaning of the hair and scalp. i found this to be true and my hair felt very clean without feeling stripped.

my favorite product was the reconstructive conditioner.  it left my hair soft and shiny, which isn't easy considering my hair is much coarser and frizzier since my two pregnancies!  the manufacturer states that the reconstructive conditioner helps prevent split ends and breakage by passing through the protective cuticle tiles and delivering essential proteins and nutrients deep inside the hair (where other products can't reach.)   it definitely made my hair look much healthier.

the protective hair glaze was also an awesome product.  i usually flat iron my normally wavy/frizzy hair and this glaze helped to protect it from heat damage.  my hair looked much shinier and i was able to go 3 whole days between shampooing!  i found the glaze to really help lock-in my hair style.  yeah!  with two young boys, anything that saves me a few minutes is great!

i also really enjoyed the christine body wash.  the light pleasing scent and the luxurious lather made showering a more relaxing experience.  the manufacturer also states that the body wash is gentle enough to use as a face cleanser.  i didn't use it on my face, but i think that it probably would work well.

all in all i was very pleased with the results these products provided.  they cost more than the usual products i buy, but if you can afford it, they really do work well!

for our readers, they are generously offering a 30% discount.  use code "haircare15" at checkout,  http://www.vanthomasconcepts.com/.

the "complete package" retails for $70.  the "shampoo and conditioner duo" retails for $45.  the "body wash" and "hair glaze" are $15 each.  all of these products can be found on their website: christine by van thomas concepts.  also, check out their about van thomas page, which gives some background into the man who created this line.  the faqs page, includes interesting question and answers with van thomas.

note:  press sample.  all of the reviews and opinions are my own.

to be or not to be...a stay at home parent.







it is a hard decision for some and an easy one for others.  there are many factors that come in to play when deciding whether you will become a stay at home parent.  for some it all comes down to finances.  for others, it is about maintaining and furthering their career.  and still for some, they just couldn't imagine going back to work after the baby is born.  there is no right or wrong choice.  we found some great articles about this very personal decision.

- being a stay-at-home parent is a luxury … for your spouse

- 10 things you should never say to a stay-at-home parent
-  hard choice for moms: work or stay home?

-  what moms choose: stay at home or work?  

-  mom vs. mom



let us know your thoughts and know that whatever you decide is the right thing for you!

nursing in style and comfort!







nursing covers don't have to be ugly or frumpy stiff pieces of fabric. 
 consider wearing a simple nursing wrap or a nursing scarf.  these look 
just like your regular clothes but are big enough to help you breastfeed
 discreetly.   the nursing wrap shown features a cool "one lucky mother"
 tattoo inspired design on the back.  see...not frumpy at all!

fall maternity clothing trends








 

fall is in the air!  the top trends in maternity clothing this fall are fun and easy to wear.  we are loving classic fall colors, such as plum in this maternity wrap top, bright orange like this trendy maternity top, and bright sunny yellow in this ruffle front maternity top.  bohemian prints are also trending this fall.  try pairing this bohemian maternity top with jeans and cowboy boots for a totally chic look!  another trend for fall are jeans with a slight boot cut.  while skinny jeans are still hot, a slight boot cut pair of maternity jeans will help to flatter and balance out a pregnant figure.  try these mama black celebrity stylish maternity jeans in a flattering and versatile dark wash.  

enjoy the cooler weather in style!

get rid of "pregnancy mask" with ageless derma's skin brightener





after having my two sons, i ended up with light brown marks on the top of my cheeks.  these brown patches are caused by changes in skin pigmentation during pregnancy (also known as pregnancy mask, melasma or chloasma).  they aren't too dark, but definitely can be seen.  i had been looking for something to fade these patches and recently got the chance to try out ageless derma's anti-aging intensive skin brightener.   

i used the skin brightener until the jar was empty.  i did find the product to be effective.  while it didn't completely erase my brown spots, it did fade them significantly.  i loved the pump on the jar.  you just press down on the flat top and the perfect amount of cream comes out!  it also was very effective at moisturizing my skin.  after using the skin brightener and achieving results, you do have to be diligent about protecting your skin from the sun or the spots will return.  ageless derma's anti-aging intensive skin brightener also works on freckles, age spots, liver spots or spots caused by using oral contraceptives.  

according to ageless derma's website, the ingredients in the skin brightener are:

- net-dg-licorice root, a natural anti-inflammatory agent that is extracted from the licorice root. 

- bv-ocs, a form of natural vitamin c that is a skin whitener, anti-oxidant and collagen protector. - biowhite – mulberry grape juice, a plant complex, a stable, all natural substance, that is made up of mulberry, grape extract, saxifrage,  and scutellaria.  it inhibits tyrosinase activity, the body’s producer of melanin which makes up the skin’s pigmentation.  

- belides, taken from the daisy flower, a skin-whitening agent found in nature that is an inhibitor of tyrosinase, much as biowhite is.  belides contains no chemical preservatives; it is naturally stable as a cosmetic ingredient. - alpha arbutin.  this tyrosinase inhibitor can also reduce excess tanning accidents and lighten skin, thus minimizing the dangerous effects of excess uv exposure.  

 

all in all, i felt that the ageless derma anti-aging intensive skin brightener worked well and my brown patches required less makeup coverage after a few weeks.  visit their website, http://www.agelessderma.com/, to find more information and to check out their other skin care products.

 

*disclaimer: as with all our product reviews, we were not paid by the company to review/promote their products.   all the opinions expressed in this article are our own.  this product was sent to us for consideration.
