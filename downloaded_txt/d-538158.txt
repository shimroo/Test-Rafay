about this project






learn more about about this project




many of us have begun to think of religion as confined to certain texts or spaces. but our faith can be so much more — from guiding the broadest sense of our lives’ purpose to enriching the seeming minutiae of our daily routines.
christianity offers timeless traditions of personal actions and community interactions that help both christians — and the world — to flourish.
practices are those shared activities that address fundamental needs of humankind and creation and that, woven together, form an entire way of life. exploring these practices as they have been shaped in the context of our faith lets us encounter the possibility of this way of life that is both attuned to present-day needs and taught by ancient wisdom.
the following pages offer a fresh way of thinking about our beliefs through the framing of twelve christian practices.
