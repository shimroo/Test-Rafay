what physicians have to say





mr. jayes lampkins has proven to have great market knowledge, patience and went above and beyond in assisting. curare physician recruiting is very fortunate to have such a competent recruiter!

- d. purpora







kim [gary] was extremely pleasant and positive. she was encouraging me through the process. i really appreciated her help as i had not been involved in a job search for 20 years.

- i. struk







the most notable quality i noticed about dave witte was that he was an advocate for me and my interests. he has done a remarkable job to help me negotiate through my job contract once he found the right job for me. he showed me a lot of positions, but then recommended to me only the right ones that matched my requirements. unlike a lot of recruiters, he let me think carefully before i accepted a position and even encouraged me to be patient.

- a. kandra







i never felt pestered or ignored which other recruiters have done in the past.

- dr. d. potti







i am very satisfied with the end result and the service. i would recommend [them] to anyone.
