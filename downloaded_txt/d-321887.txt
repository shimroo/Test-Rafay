soup bowls for hunger



wednesday, april 9 at the cape cod regional technical high school in harwich. 100% of the profits from this event benefit the family pantry of cape cod, which serves the entire cape. last year we donated over $12,000. lets beat that this year! we will begin soliciting soup bowls from area potters soon, and tickets for the event will go on sale at the beginning of march.if you would like to pledge bowls that would be wonderful. it takes a lot of stress off of us knowing how many to expect. we are currently roughly 300 bowls towards our 600 bowl goal.email ccpotters2017@gmail.com to pledge.

board message november/december 2024hi all,thank you to all who volunteered time and pots to our seconds sale. we blew past last year’s total and raised $2,680. $1340 of this will be sent to cerf+(craft emergency relief fund) to aid with hurricane helene relief in north carolina, and the remainder will go into cape cod potters coffers to be used for our ongoing mission of supporting area potters through workshops, scholarships and direct support.it is time for members who renewed in october and november of 2023 to renew. the reminder email has not been working, so please renew or reach out if you are unsure when your membership expires.our next member meeting is scheduled for december 3 from 5-6:30 via zoom. please email ccpotters2017@gmail.com for the link. january’s meeting will be on january 14th via zoom. we are working to schedule an annual meeting at the end of february or the beginning of march at the cultural center of cape cod. we will let you know when details and time are finalized.this organization is at a crossroads. we’ve worked very hard to learn the ropes, update communications, and are beginning to build committees and other infrastructure to add value to our membership. we are working on expanding our benefits. this year cotuit center for the arts offered a discount on ceramic workshops taught by members. this is in addition to the discounts offered by castle hill and meetinghouse clay. we are actively seeking members to present workshops across the cape that we can support financially.we need new board members. as of now, we are actively seeking a treasurer and a vice president and president for 2025 into 2026. voting will occur in february with a 3+ month shadow period, and roles would be handed over in june. sarah would remain active on the board as immediate past president.. if we do not fill these roles, the organization will be disbanded.below are the descriptions of the board roles.the bylaws specify the legal responsibilities, which are fairly standard.  each president and board shapes ccp according to circumstances, but these are the roles they play.president: within the framework of the mission statement and expressed wishes of members, the president sets priorities, sets agendas, schedules and chairs meetings, defines tasks, and consults closely with other officers to accomplish the priorities.  the president also heads communications between ccp and other organizations. vice president: in close cooperation with the president, helps with the president’s duties. secretary: records board decisions and annual meeting decisions, collaborates with the board, communicates decisions and information to members by newsletters, and files pro-forma reports to the massachusetts secretary of state. treasurer: handles all receipts and expenses, maintains careful and thorough financial records, reports current financial status and prospects at each meeting, and prepares a budget for the annual meeting.  collaborates closely with the board.  files the very simple tax return with the irs.  works with a finance committee to identify ideas and best practices. past president: provides institutional memory to her/his successors to insure smooth transitions.in current practice, there are several major responsibilities that aren’t specified as officer duties, but which make or break ccp yet would make an incoming board member’s responsibility and time commitment lighter:organizing soup bowls and seconds sale– val has found she enjoys organizing soup bowls and seconds sale, and would be glad to help one or more other people learn the ropes and share the fun at whatever level the new board would like.maintaining the website – sarah is willing to work on it, and we have some funds for data entry time to help out.serving on the member benefits committee - sarah and carol plan on continuing.
