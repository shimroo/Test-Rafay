more about dakka






dakkadakka - warhammer, 40k, warmachine and flames of war community.
dakkadakka is a large, independent wargaming community that features discussion, tutorials and images for many games.
warhammer 40,000
our warhammer 40k forums are among our most popular. they have been operating the longest and contain discussion about every facet of warhammer 40k from tactics and army lists to background and upcoming releases.

warhammer fantasy
the warhammer fantasy battle forums are consistently increasing in popularity and are almost on a par with our 40k forums covering the same large range of content with advice from some of the best tacticians the world has to offer.

warmachine and hordes
dakka now has one of the largest warmachine and hordes forums on the web, and has a huge range of warmachine pictures in our gallery.

flames of war
flames of war and other historical games are growing in popularity here on dakka and we invite anyone to join in and discuss them in detail. as flames of war grows more popular, dakka's coverage will only increase. be sure to check out the flames of war gallery to see some inspiring stuff.

dakka features
dakka is a big site with a lot to explore. here we highlight some of our more interesting features:
wargaming gallery
the dakka gallery is one of the largest wargaming galleries in the world and has a huge range of tagged miniatures from many game systems. from flames of war to maelstrom's edge, and of course 40k. you can vote on images (like using hot-or-not), and use our advanced gallery search engine to find exactly what you are looking for, be it space marines, orks, cryx or dark elves!

forums
the dakka forums are growing faster and faster and are the bread and butter of the website. they still maintain quality and a fair level of freedom compared to many other forums. our most popular forum is news and rumours, but dakka discussions and 40k army lists are very popular too. there are some important rules to consider (no spam, no swearing, no piracy) but everybody gets on well enough thanks to our great moderation team.

articles
the dakka wargaming articles are run on a wiki (like wikipedia). we have a huge range of wargaming articles covering everything from tactica to modeling and painting and even some great funny stuff. if you are bored and want to have the equivalent of dozens of magazines to read then head over to the main articles page and start clicking around. because it is a wiki, anybody can hop in and click the 'edit' tab at the top of the page, so if you have anything to add or just see some typos or bad grammar then you can help make it better for everyone.

army profiles
dakka's army profiles are a throwback to the very earliest version of dakka from the late 1990s, where various armies were highlighted in detail. our army profiles section now contains many armies from different game systems with in depth photographs, army lists and explanations of their signifigance from their owners.
