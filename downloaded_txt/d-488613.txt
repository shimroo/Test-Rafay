at scuba center we've 
						been teaching scuba diving classes since 1973. we were 
						minnesota's first padi 5 star training facility 
						and have grown to become minnesota's largest 
						scuba diving school (and one of the largest in 
			the midwest). scuba center offers a 
						complete range of padi scuba diving training classes 
						from beginning 
						(open water diver) to advanced 
						open water, rescue 
						diver, specialty 
						diving courses, emergency 
						first response (efr), nitrox, divemaster, 
						and the padi 
						instructor development course (idc). to keep your 
						scuba diving skills sharp we offer 
			reactivate 
			and 
						diamond reef buoyancy classes for certified divers.
join scuba center on one of our group dive trips. dive 
			travel is a great way to gain diving experience, meet other 
			divers, learn about the marine environment, and see the world. many 
			people begin diving to experience the beauty they have seen on 
			television, online or in books. dive travel includes more than 
			underwater exploration; its also about delving into the sights, 
			sounds, tastes, and even shopping of different cultures. scuba 
			center group dive trips are always led by one of our staff of padi 
			instructors.
