the jeep story
the jeep legend began in the early days of world war ii. the us army needed a reliable quarter-ton reconnaissance vehicle that was custom-tailored to their specifications. the auto manufacturer, bantam car company, answered the call and delivered a prototype vehicle to the army in just 75 days. the willys-mb was used extensively across every division of the american military and even found its way into the hands of other members of the allied forces.
the willys, which came to be widely known by their nickname, “jeep,” was crafted to such a high level of reliability that they withstood nearly anything that was thrown at them. beginning in the 1970’s, clubs such as the military vehicle collector club formed to support enthusiasts who collected and restored jeeps and other military vehicles. this movement was key in helping to preserve these pieces of history and share their stories, and that passion is reflected in our selection of authentic vintage jeep restoration parts. the team at army jeep parts helps these enthusiasts by providing them with high quality vintage jeep parts. that way, they can restore and rebuild these vehicles to continue sharing them for decades to come. browse the vintage parts for sale at army jeep parts to find authentic components for your restoration.
