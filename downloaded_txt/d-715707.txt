access controls
designed with the installer in mind

									as a staple of the industry, we have been designing,
									manufacturing, and supporting a full range of access control
									sensors for over 30 years. specifically designed with
									installers in mind, our vehicle detectors, photo eyes, and
									access controls have become the industry standard due to their
									reliability and ease of use.
								


industrial sensors
powering automation

									sensors that provide reliable, extremely fast, and accurate
									feedback on the factory floor are crucial to moving process
									automation forward. we design and manufacture sensors that
									allow our customers to maintain high quality control
									standards. emx sensors continue to power automation in some of
									the most demanding manufacturing facilities on the planet.
