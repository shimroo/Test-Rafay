cã©ad mã­le fã¡ilte

				originally the premises was called the pine lodge, noted for the pine trees in front of the building. purchased by richard and carol lillis in 1966 who worked in the tavern, a popular night spot for many years.

				their son, sean lillis, became involved in 1975 and completely renovated the building in 1991, renaming the business sean patrickâs restaurant. having received many requests from loyal customers for larger facilities, in 2000, he constructed a new bar area with seating and a beautiful banquet room named the emerald isle, serving up to 230 people.

				hard work, long hours, and a quality staff have made sean patrickâs and the emerald isle successful. we hope your visit with us will be a pleasurable dining experience. weâre here to fulfill all of your dining needs, from breakfast, lunch, dinner, weddings, showers, birthday parties and all special occasions. we plan to serve you, our customers, for many years to come.
