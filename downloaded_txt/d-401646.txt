 life is better in a north river













“i chose north river because after looking at different models over the years the quality and style of the boat convinced me to buy the north river. i have been waiting years to make this purchase and am glad i finally have the boat.” -rick

“i’ve owned 5 north rivers and they are simply the best boats in both the way they look and the way they perform.” -lance

“they are the best boat in my opinion. i have always wanted one. it is a symbol of the point i’m at in my life. i have two boys aged 5 and 2. i need to turn them into fishermen. my dad always had marginal equipment because he was afraid to spend a couple of bucks. the greatest memories of my childhood fishing trips are of when the equipment failed, and or was not up to the task at hand. i won’t make that mistake, hence the north river.” -andrew
