who we are, what we do....

by definition, a chamber of commerce is “a local organization of businesses whose goal is to further the interests of businesses; to advocate on behalf of the business community.” behind the definition, the metronorth chamber of commerce is a foundation of passionate people working together to strengthen relationships and our shared community. we do that by facilitating programming and events to build connections; advocating on key legislative issues; and supporting leadership and business recovery efforts in order for you to build your business.
 
if you are looking for an organization where hundreds of other business professionals want to support you and this community, then look no further! we’d be happy to connect with you and discuss your goals and how the metronorth chamber can help you achieve them.
 
be our guest! if you would like to visit our working with women or sunrise program and see if we are a good fit for your business, we welcome your visit. our staff and our ambassadors will be there to greet you and provide you with the information you need to have a successful visit, including introducing you to other attendees and even making sure you have a place to sit. our hospitality is second to none! we can't wait to meet you. while pre-registration is not required for either program, feel free to contact us in advance so we can answer any questions you have have, be on the lookout for you, and ensure you have the best possible experience. 
 


contact us for more information on how to get connected to our award-winning, dynamic organization!
 

















seeking high school students & employers!
through a grant from the united way’s future ready workforce fund, which seeks to expand the number of high-quality work experiences for young people, the metronorth chamber is actively seeking high school students from anoka-hennepin school district #11 and employers in the north metro who want to work together for a rewarding internship experience.
how does it work? students review internship options and connect with the employer to ensure it’s a good fit. the employer provides a 40-hour internship-like experience, especially in the medical, manufacturing, and automotive industries (but all are welcome to participate).  students receive $15 per hour, with wages paid for through the grant, not the employer.
“the internship program through the metronorth chamber has been an invaluable asset to our organization. our intern’s skills, creativity, and dedication have made a profound impact on our work over the past few months.  she has played a key role in advancing our marketing and business development initiatives, strengthened our branding, enhanced partnerships, and added measurable value to our mission in the youth sports and education industry. we will also likely hire her after she graduates to work with us part time!
the metronorth chamber's support structure has ensured a seamless integration of interns into our team, making the experience mutually rewarding. we are grateful for this partnership and look forward to continuing to collaborate with the chamber to nurture future talent while advancing our organization's goals.” melissa walton, akasport, employer

"the intangible it"
business professionals looking to stand out and elevate their careers won’t want to miss the intangible it from our keynote speaker, jack stahlmann. this engaging session breaks down the mysterious “it” factor that makes hollywood’s biggest stars so magnetic—and how you can apply those same principles to thrive in your own profession.

economic development updates
there is a lot of exciting things happening in the development world in the north metro. ground breakings for new businesses, expansions, and even some major, much needed transportation projects. for all things expansion-related, the anoka county regional economic development (acred) initiative, of which metronorth was a founding partner and current executive committee member, is your go-to resource. for an overview of main road projects, visit the anoka county highway department page and/or mndot’s twin cities regional projects page. 
we know that one pending transportation project, the reconstruction of hwy 65 (slated to begin in 2025), will bring a lot of questions. we have developed a specific page on our website to host updates as they become available. please check back frequently.
