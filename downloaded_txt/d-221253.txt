it really is all about me, isn't it????





so i have debated and debated and debated and debated and even debated some more about whether to continue this blog or not... i even started this post on march 20th and here it is april 12th and i think i'm ready to post this... i started my blog way back when to talk about neil's pre-kidney transplant issues because it was extremely stressful and it was a quick/easy way to keep everyone up to date on the transplant status.... not everyone has facebook so it was better than updating fb... well now that neil is doing really well... really, really well with his new kidney (thanks again to the wonderful candy, who donated her kidney to him!!!) i wish i had a reason to not blog... but i do and is it ironic that it has to do with the very same concept that i started this blog, ...in sickness and in health... ????? sadly, it is me that is going through some rough sickness/health issues.... the hardest part is this has been going on since the fall... i think... i don't even really know when the symptoms truly started and 'they' don't know what's wrong with me... :(in a nutshell:since october, i've had all over muscle twitching and muscle weakness in my hands/arms/legs and it's getting worse. the neurologist is not convinced that it's als nor is he convinced that it's not als... have had an emg and having a repeat one on friday to see if there's change. my 2nd opinion neuro doc blood tested me for celiac disease and it came back 'elevated' so i've been following a gluten free diet for a month and have digestively been a lot better. i had a repeat blood test yesterday so i'm waiting for the results and i can't get into a gi doc until the end of june. i'm also awaiting an appointment with a neuro doc at osu. my 1st neuro told me on tuesday that he recently read an article where someone was diagnosed with als but it was wrong and was actually celiac!!!soooooooooooooo, i'm very frustrated and am getting weaker and i'm hoping there's someone out there that can relate........?????

2 years already!!!!!!!





i'm so terrible for not updating my blog sooner.. life has been awesome with neil's new kidney! he has never felt or looked better! it's really been a whole new life for us! i just wrote this and posted it on my fb page but decided i should keep a good record and update the blog as well!jennifer branson so, 2 years ago tonight i was sitting in osu hospital with neil s branson trying not to worry about what lie ahead of us. we were scared, nervous, and happy all at the same time! tomorrow is the 2 year anniversary of neil's kidney transplant and i'm glad to say all that stress & worry were worth it because he's incredibly happy and healthy today! of course, none of it would be possible without the wonderful and selfless act of candy sue clark! thank you a million times over for giving neil a new birthday, me a new husband and the boys a new daddy! you know we love you with everything we have! a special thanks to neil's now retired sgt art coval for making this beautiful picture to help celebrate this special time!!! ♥ much love and thanks to all our friends and family who held us up in prayer as we went through this process! ♥

there's no place like home...





 neil made it home today!!!  it's sooo nice to be home and resting and not running back and forth to the hospital!!!  i did have to go back out and get some of his meds filled but it wasn't that bad... especially considering ice cream was on sale! lol..my in-laws have had the boys since friday after school and they brought them home a little bit ago.  it's so nice to see them and to start getting back in the swing of things.  i'm really glad i have another week off work though.. i have to take neil for his first blood draw tomorrow and then i can start going thru the mail, do taxes, catch up on my classes i'm taking at ashland and whatever else comes my way... sleep.. that's def one thing i need to catch up on! thank you everyone for all the prayers, good thoughts, support and love shown this past week!  it's amazing how many people were praying for us that don't even know us!  i'm glad this week is over and we're on our way to a new life!!!!!

update





sorry for not updating sooner!  neil was moved to his regular room yesterday... he got up and walked with little problems.  he had a few visitors last night and some tonight.his creatinine was 3.7 yesterday and 2.8 this morning.. it's so hard to grasp all this good news!  his bp was 139/77 about an hour ago!!!!!  i'm soooo happy and soooo thankful for candy giving us this new life for neil!  candy has been sleeping a lot and still feeling sick to her stomach.  she is slowly getting better.  it stinks to see her not recovering as quick as neil since she's the one to sacrifice so much.  but i know it's harder on them and she'll come around and be back to her 'ol self again soon!keep the prayers for recovery comin!!!!!!

yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!





neil is back in the special care unit... sleeping on and off with the help of some morphine!!! he's eating some ice chips and is begging for ice water but they won't let him have any 'til tomorrow!  he's in good spirits when he comes around... joking for a minute or so and being silly then passes back out!  he's producing urine and it's not super bloody, which  is awesome!!!! thanks for all the prayers!  i couldn't have survived without all of you supporting me and having my back when i needed it most! xoxoxo  jennifer

settled in..





we're here and settled in the hospital.  neil got his central line put in his neck and that was ok.. i actually had to leave the room for it.. i was more nervous than he was so i decided i would be no help freaking out so i went down to candy's room to visit her.   she was getting about a million tubes of blood drawn.  she worked last night and is really tired so i think she's in her room resting now.  neil's room doesn't have a tv so we're going over to her room to watch the news since our story is supposed to air tonight!!! thanks to everyone who has sent emails, text messages and commented on fb.  knowing you're all behind us is awesome!!!!  also thank you to the parents at school who are sending home food with the boys... while i'm not there to enjoy it, i know it's good food!!!!  i'll be home later so hopefully they leave me some!!!!i'll update if anything else changes tonight!jenn
