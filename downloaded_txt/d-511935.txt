our company
driving in the dark on a rain swept road, not able to see the lane stripes or the edge line of the pavement, can be a very dangerous and treacherous experience. it is also a common experience that millions of motorists worldwide endure every night. 
roadvision has developed, tested, and is ready to commercialize a critical breakthrough for highway and public safety â the patented highway beaconâ® - the first functional snowplowable reflective raised pavement marker (rrpm). rrpms provide drivers greatly enhanced visual delineation of roadway lane and edge lines, even during wet-night conditions where painted lane striping becomes invisible. the spring-loaded reflector assembly depresses upon snowplow or vehicle tire impact, then recoils back into position.
poor rain/wet-night driver visibility in snow climates continues to be an unsolved, deadly driving hazard. painted reflective lane stripes are not visible during rainstorms because they are covered by water. only rrpms can be seen during dark rain conditions because they protrude above the water layer â millions are installed on sunbelt roads.
in areas that receive snow, sandstorms, or rock/landslides, snowplows must clear the pavement for traffic. previous rrpms are destroyed by snowplows and truck traffic. over 75% of u.s. roads are in snow regions. road vision technologies has proven spring-loaded/depressible technology that will bring a dramatic increase in driver safety and guidance during dark, wet conditions to tens of millions of motorists worldwide, and provide a far superior light source for self-driving vehicle guidance systems.
a vast, untapped, well-funded, motivated, and recession-proof market exists for a reflective pavement marker that can provide wet/night and fog visibility to motorists, and can also withstand plowing, extreme weather, and heavy traffic. the highway beaconâ® is the first and only marker that can meet those criteria.
the highway beaconâ® will be manufactured and assembled in the u.s. many high-wage industrial and road construction/installation jobs will be created.
