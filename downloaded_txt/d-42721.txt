xlear nasal spray's secret is natural saline with xylitol


normal saline nasal sprays can dry out the nasal passage, actually leaving it more irritated and susceptible to external contaminants. but with the addition of xylitol, xlear saline nasal spray with xylitol will moisturize and soothe your sinus and nasal passages.

xlear cough drops are different. they're naturally sweetened with xylitol


don’t coat your throat with sucrose, a food bacteria love. choose naturally sweetened xlear cough drops—the sugar-free option that gives you fast relief when you need it most.

science-backed results


cleanses the nose of bacteria


this study found that xylitol blocked adhesion of bacteria to epithelial cells, showing that xylitol inhibits bacteria from sticking to tissue, which allows the body to wash them away. 

kontiokari, t., uhari, m., & koskela, m. (1998). antiadhesive effects of xylitol on otopathogenic bacteria. the journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy, 41(5), 563–565. 



cleanses the nose of viruses


researchers at utah state university performed research to show that xylitol blocked viral adhesion on human airway tissue. though a similar study was performed previously using industry standards (performed on vero kidney tissue), the ftc required a higher-standard study to show efficacy. this study using that higher standard, shows that xylitol and other sugar alcohols block adhesion of different viruses to different degrees. 

jung, kie hoon. (2021). antiviral efficacy against virus infections in human-derived tracheal/bronchial epithelial cells. utah state university. 



opens the airway


in a 2015 presentation, dr. nsouli shared his findings of a study which showed that a nasal spray with xylitol increased peak airflow 35% more than saline alone and measurably increased participants’ quality of life. 

nsouli, t. m.; et al., (2015) oral abstract #46. 



just a gentle spray


researchers wanted to see if using a nozzle that sprayed a gentler mist for nasal sprays would improve the user experience and thus compliance. they found that a specific nozzle, the one used on xlear nasal spray, provided an “unequivocally favorable experience.”

basu, s., khawaja, u., rizvi, s., sanchez-gonzalez, m., & ferrer, g. (2022). evaluation of patient experience for a computationally-guided intranasal spray protocol to augment therapeutic penetration: implications for effective treatments for covid-19, rhinitis, and sinusitis. medical research archives, 10(4).



reduce your "snot" score


in this pilot study, researchers wanted to find out if irrigating the sinuses with a water-xylitol solution would improve symptoms of people suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis. they concluded, “xylitol irrigations result in greater improvement of symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis as compared to saline irrigation.” and “…a significant reduction in snot-20 score.”



weissman, j. d., et al. (2011). xylitol nasal irrigation in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis: a pilot study. the laryngoscope, 121(11), 2468–2472.














the nose is where bacteria and viruses enter the body.  nearly 75% of the visits to primary care physicians in the u.s. are related to upper respiratory issues. we can bring that number down significantly if we start washing our nose.


wouldn’t it make sense to wash our nose with something that blocks viral and bacterial adhesion?
xlear, inc. relies on scientific research to provide innovative, effective paths towards health that are less expensive and more accessible.
the link below will take you to a list of studies for medical and dental professionals to study. they cover a host of areas around upper respiratory and oral health and provide a buttress for why xylitol and xlear and spry products should be recommended and used.

what is xylitol?




xylitol is a natural sweetener derived from natural sources. it is also produced in the human body as a by-product of a normal metabolism.





  





how does xylitol differ from other sweetners?




chemically speaking, xylitol is not actually a sugar, but a sugar alcohol. it differs from other sweeteners such as sorbitol, fructose and glucose because its molecule has five, instead of six, carbon atoms.





  





is xylitol safe?




yes, it is. in 1983, jecfa, a joint expert committee of who and fao, confirmed the fact, already known by scientists, that it is a safe sweetener for foods. the fda also confirmed this fact in 1986.





  





is xylitol safe for sugar-controlled diets?




yes. classified on labels as a carbohydrate, it has been used in foods since the 1960’s and is approved in the u.s. as a food additive in unlimited quantity for foods with special dietary purposes. it is safe for use in any sugar-controlled diet.





  





can i give my dog xyltiol?




no.- we do not recommend that xylitol products be fed to pets. xylitol brings extraordinary health benefits to people, but it is not intended for animals. our products are for human consumption only. xylitol may be harmful to dogs, cats, and other household pets.





  





what do i do if i think my pet has eaten some of my xylitol products?




if you are concerned for the health of your pet, we recommend you contact your veterinarian. be prepared to provide your veterinarian with a description of the products your pet consumed and any symptoms your pet has experienced.
