engineered for easy loading


performance at the ramp
all you want to do is get in and get out… and look like a pro doing it. that’s precisely why shoreland’r trailers have an innovative support system, engineered to take the hassle out of launching and loading.
what is best for you? 




roller models feature our patented roller design. specially designed rollers combined with our patented equiload system make your time at the ramp stress-free. during launching and loading, they self-adjust for maximum hull support and easier centering, even in strong currents and rough winds.



if you prefer bunks, the patented equiload system uses self-adjusting bunks that pivot to evenly distribute the weight.






superior finish options
whether you choose our beautiful powder-coat finish or rugged galvanized, you’ll appreciate the extra care we put into making sure your trailer looks good for the long haul.
view all options! 










finishes perfect for saltwater and fresh water
no other trailer stands up to the rigors and corrosive destruction of saltwater better than shoreland’r. heavy-duty i-beam aluminum frames resist corrosion, with strong, galvanized steel crossmembers and a long list of shoreland’r features.
