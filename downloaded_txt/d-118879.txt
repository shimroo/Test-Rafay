	if you would like to upgrade the speakers in your truck, this might interest 
	you.  i have designed and fabricate cab corner 6x9 speaker 
	brackets for all 73-87 gm trucks, 88-91 crew cabs, and even 67-72, 55-59 & 47-54 
	and new for 2020 we now have 60-66 brackets!  all brackets 
	are made of heavy duty 16 gauge steel, and fit perfectly in the cab 
	corners...even with the bench seat all the way back.  i have sold 
	thousands of these brackets so far, 
	and have had zero negative feedback on them.  they have 
	also been featured in custom classic trucks magazine.  i have 
	spent a lot of time developing and making these, and take a great deal of 
	pride in them.  if you are interested, or just want to learn more and 
	see some pictures and customer feedback, head on over to
	
	67-72chevytrucks.com and take a look.  
	i also have pictures of them installed in my '73 right here on the 'site, 
	click 
	here to see them.  
if you are still reading this and are 
	interested in purchasing a set, scroll to your left or use the links 
	provided below.  you can also send an e-mail to

	some of 
	you may recall the autometer gauge brackets i had for sale on here, these 
	are the brackets that would mount the gauges behind the bezel at the correct 
	angle.  i no longer sell due to the fact that there are too many 
	different gauges and sizes on the market, it was impossible to design and 
	fabricate the brackets because i didn't physically have all the gauges to 
	take measurements from or the cooperation of autometer to supply them.  
	i do have good news however, i am now offering to build the complete 
	assembly for anyone who is interested in this upgrade.  you will need 
	to send me the gauges (any brand), dash bezel, cluster housing and cluster 
	lens, i will do the rest.  the price is $250 and that includes the 
	brackets obviously.  if you have gauges for brackets i do not have 
	designed, there will be an additional charge of $75 for the design and 
	fabrication of them.  if you are interested or have any questions, 
	please send me an
	
	e-mail.  pictures below are some of the clusters i have recently built, or 
	had a hand in the creation of, along with some feedback i have received.












	perfect...that is how this bezel came out, jeff's quality and workmanship 
	are 
	second to none.  if anyone is looking to have their gauges done the 
	same way, i would not hesitate to recommend jeff.  he is very 
	passionate about his work and it shows.  ~bill from pittsburgh
