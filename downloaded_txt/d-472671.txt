meet jason pridmore
jason pridmore is one of the most recognized names in motorcycle training.
we are very excited about our partnership with kawasaki. jason started his ama career on kawasaki in 1992 and won his first nationals on the brand. he also watched his dad win 2 ama superbike championships in the late 70’s on kawasaki’s. the word “ninja” is what started the sport bike craze in 1984 and jason is looking forward to taking that name into the future.
star motorcycle school is setting the standard with “next generation motorcycle training™”.
this is a whole new level for star and our new private days, jp43 training. we have taken a very successful program and taken it where motorcycle training should be. there is more interaction with our students, during and after our events and more training tools have been added to our 2-day program. our objective is to help you improve your riding skills so you are comfortable at whatever level you would like to attain.
our no gimmick, straightforward approach is something that jason has spent his life working on.
to say that jason has a passion for our sport is a true understatement. he has been around motorcycles since he was 2 years old and still wakes up everyday thinking about improvement.

i recently attended the jason pridmore star school thru the u.s. marine corps motorcycle program. i was surprised how organized everything was. i noticed a couple of famous faces. the school was awesome and i don’t think that there was one person that left without learning something. for me the school got me to fine tune a couple of things and the most important the star team got me to ride in a relaxed body position on my bike. the experience was amazing, true professionals who care and i’ll leave at that. thanks.

jason is the “obi-wan kenobi” of motorcycle racing. after seeing hearing and reading pretty much every motorcycle coach available to the general public, nobody has the ability to communicate riding skills and distinctions to make you a safer, faster, & better rider than jason pridmore! thank you to jason and your team for an amazing weekend school and i look forward to attending every one of them this coming year!
