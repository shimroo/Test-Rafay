now

                                available! - we combined all of our material on one pc-dvd.  international and domestic shipping is included in price. 





what

                                  you are about to encounter is the most

                                  in-depth compilation of interviews with

                                  survivors of the philadelphia experiment

                                  and montauk project to date. to round out your experience, we included many hours of content from phil schenider (underground bases and the alien agenda), mind control topics, and testimony from victims of the ritualistic sex slave practices. 
the

                                  information comes from the memories of

                                  those who were interviewed. 

                                  because these projects are so secretive,

                                  gaining hard evidence is nearly

                                  impossible. however, that doesn't mean

                                  the projects never happened.
this

                                  information is for those who want

                                  to pursue and know the truth.

                                  sometimes, finding the truth

                                  becomes elusive.  there are

                                  many out there who do not want you

                                  to know the truth about these

                                  projects. use your own judgment as

                                  you hear the words of these

                                  survivors.
as you follow this

                                  story, use this information as the

                                  beginning resource to

                                  hopefully, get you on the right

                                  track.

                                the five people featured on this cd

                                  all testify that they worked with al at

                                  the montauk project and some even

                                  remember him as  ed cameron during the

                                  philadelphia experiment.
so,

                                  keep an open yet discerning mind, and

                                  get ready to change your paradigm.

what's

                                new
october 2011 - i 
								received an email from an associate informing me 
								that al bielek had passed on.  



								http://educate-yourself.org/ab/albielekpasses14oct11.shtml
feb 2009 
- thank you for 

								all of the emails i got from al's many fans 

								letting me know he was on coast to coast.  

								he sounded pretty good for making it through 5 

								strokes. i wish him the best.  
jan 2009 
- i'm getting 

								lots of emails from people all around the world 

								asking if al bielek is still alive.  i 

								haven't been in contact with him for many years.  

								if anyone knows for sure, please send me an 

								email and i will post on this website.
may 2007 - we combined all of our material on one pc-dvd disc. you still need a pc to watch the movies, but we are offering the convenience of having all of the material on one disc. 
august 2005 - al has 

								  suffered another stroke and is in the hospital.  

								  he is in the lee county memorial hospital in 

								  florida.  i don't have any further contact 

								  information.  let's all hope for the best.
february 2005 - al bielek 

								will be interviewed by george noory on

								

								coast to coast am thursday february 24th. -

								click here 

								for show recap
december 2003 - i 

								(producer - michael houtzager) 
publish my 

								statement on what happened between al bielek and 

								myself, and i share my thoughts on 

								bielek-debunked.com.
august 2003 - the bbc is 

								currently producing a program on time travel.  

								they asked al bielek to go to new york and 

								conduct an interview where it all started - the 

								brooklyn navy yard.  due to al's poor 

								health, he couldn't go. after a lot of begging 

								on their part, i agreed to go to new york and 

								subject myself to their interview.  it was 

								a lot of fun and i posted 

								some pictures of the trip here.
august 2003 - i 

								(producer) spoke with al bielek today (aug 23).  

								he is out of the hospital and doing fairly well.  

								he seems to have not lost any of his memory.  

								i spoke briefly with him about the massive power 

								outage we had on august 15th.  (so many of 

								you emailed me about that).
al said he predicted on the air 

								two months ago that around august 12th there 

								would be a massive power outage because of all 

								of the energies surrounding the date. 
al bielek press 

										release 8-15-03.

al bielek was in a minor car 

										accident and later discovered that he 

										had suffered a minor stroke. he has been 

										hospitalized for the last few days. he 

										is a bit woozy at times and suffers from 

										occasional double vision, but it alert 

										and in good spirits. he is receiving 

										therapy and says very good things about 

										the hospital staff, but gives bad 

										reviews about the coffee there.

you can send a card or 

								letter to:
al bielek

								po box 50045

								fort myers fl 33994
please also consider helping al 

								out financially.  he didn't ask me (web 

								site developer) to put 

								that request on the site - i just know his 

								financial state.  any amount will help.
july 2003 - al bielek to 

								be on coast to coast am with george noory monday 

								july 21.  (www.coasttocoastam.com) 
camp hero investigative reports 

								-

								

								click here.
i (producer) have received many 

								emails asking for a rebuttal on the issues 

								brought up from the bielek-debunked.com website.  

								i am trying to put together my own statement and 

								give al his opportunity to make his.  i 

								should have something together by the last week 

								of august.  it's a fairly complicated 

								undertaking.
here is a pretty interesting 

								website that puts into question marshall barns 

								intentions.

april 2003 - check this 

								out!  jonathan lippe sent me this link to 

								the following news article:


								'time-traveler' busted for insider trading

								wednesday march 19, 2003

by chad kultgen 

new york --

								

								federal investigators have arrested an enigmatic 

								wall street wiz on insider-trading charges -- 

								and incredibly, he claims to be a time-traveler 

								from the year 2256! 
note: considering the source 

								- "weekly world news" - this is probably just a 

								hoax.  read for your entertainment.

january 2003 - we 

                                celebrate our third year of this website!

february 2002 - al will 

                                be at the ufo conference in phoenix march 1-3

                                the website for a while - isp went chapter 11.

may 2001 - we just 
posted some comments 

                                we received from people who have reviewed the 

                                site and the cd.  feel free to send your 

                                comments to 

                                zager@webhoster.com.

april 2001 - al bielek 

                                just completed a video interview with grizzly 

                                adams productions.  on may 25th and june 

                                17th, tune into pax tv to see al, preston, 

                                steward, and others featured on the program 

                                "encounters with the unexplained - time 

                                travelers".

march 2001 - yes, the 

                                history channel's "true story of the 

                                philadelphia experiment" did air march 12th. 

                                what a disappointment!

                                (realaudio) 

we just completed the 
phil schneider cd.  

                                phil was a good friend of al bielek and had a 

                                lot to say about the alien agenda and 

                                underground bases.

february 2001 - we just

                                completed a rare interview with duncan

                                cameron - one of the central figures at

                                montauk.  all new cd's will contain the one hour interview.
duncan's memories of montauk are

                                slowly returning.  while he doesn't have

                                the recall that al bielek enjoys, this interview

                                offers an interesting perspective of the events

                                surrounding montauk.

december 7, 2000 - al's memories

                                of the current presidential election.
december 2, 2000 - al

                                bielek just finishes his video interview with

                                the history channel's "history's

                                mysteries" one hour program.  we'll



                                keep you updated on the scheduled airing of the

                                program.
