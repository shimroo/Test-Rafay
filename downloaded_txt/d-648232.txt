the archive page was created to preserve all of the appeal and bid protest 
  decisions issued between october 1, 1992, when the board started publishing 
  its decisions on a bulletin board system (bbs), and september 30, 1996, when 
  the gsbca home page was initiated.  the archive page does not contain any 
  travel, relocation, or transportation rate cases.
