the updated pcusa website

as pcusa.org undergoes a major update (still in progress!) you may find that pages you frequent are no longer operable and a referring link is not available.  
the "story-telling" feature on the "home" page (scroll down to whe bottom of this page to "featured news" includes over 100 panels of 2024  presbyterian news articles, displayed in a 5-at-a-time panel; at this time the first panel includes a los angeles wildfire entry.    
a suggestion:! try the "search" feature as  there's considerable improvement in how this feature is organized.  also, in the three-circle row on the home page the mid-council resources may prove the most useful.
