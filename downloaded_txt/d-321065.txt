docksiders competitive teamsour nationally renowned team program continues to shine! since 1975 we have had numerous state, regional, and national champions. we have had over 70 gymnasts go on to compete in college. we offer competitive programs in girls junior olympic or xcel, and boys junior olympic.docksiders has a very strong competitive team program for both boys and girls. we currently have over 110 girls and boys on our teams. docksiders gymnasts have won numerous state, regional, and national championships. many of our alumnae have gone on to receive college scholarships at schools such as nc state, florida and west virginia. many of our team members began their gymnastics careers as class gymnasts, and were then invited to try out for our team program. being on a team requires a very high level of commitment. team members work out from 6 to 20+ hours a week depending upon their level. competitions are what we train for! our team girls compete 6-10 competitions per year.  click on one of the links below for more information about a specific level.



girls developmental program​the developmental program (formerly known as the junior olympic program) for girls is designed for competitive gymnasts who wish to advance and potentially compete in the highest levels of the sport. the training at docksiders is structured so that gymnasts can safely and successfully advance from level 3 up to level 10. 



girls xcel​as an alternative to the junior olympic program, docksiders offers the xcel program for those gymnasts who wish to participate in competitive gymnastics at a more recreational level, without the high time constraints required in the junior olympic program.



boys​our competitive boys team is an opportunity for those young men who wish to enter into competitive gymnastics. they also compete in the junior olympic program, competing at docksiders from level 4 through to level 10.
