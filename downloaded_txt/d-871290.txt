"skysong soundworks" dc-3 sound set for microsoft 
							flight simulator


 





together we fly: "voices 
							from 
								the dc-3″ -- is the story of an aircraft like none other  a true legend, the icon of an industry, and one of the most recognized aircraft in history, according to company officials. today, crowds still gather to watch a dc-3 land, technicians revel in the sound of her rumbling radial engines, cargo haulers appreciate her ability to stretch to meet impossible demands, and pilots still dream of flying the greatest airplane ever built.
author julie boatman filucci recounts fascinating stories, introducing the reader to the people that helped make the dc-3 seem larger than life and greater than the sum of its parts. from the dc-3s early development, through its many historic roles, and into the present, voices is a human journey of visionaries, engineers, pilots, mechanics, hostesses, and passengers alike.

the world's 
									first certified dc-3 simulator!
the mps dc-3 
									simulator has recently been certified as an 
									fnpt-ii (equivalent to faa level 5) by the 
									dutch caa. in addition, mps was granted 
									operator status. it is now possible for dc-3 
									pilots to strengthen their knowledge and 
									skills by flying the dc-3 simulator. amongst 
									others it is a great opportunity to cover 
									starts, landings, engine failures directly 
									after rotation, propeller feathering, ifr 
									procedures and cockpit re-familiarization.
you can 
									watch this excellent mps dc-3 simulator movie

axel ebermann - is a documentary filmmaker
                and he spent the last four years travelling the worldwith the dutch dakota aficionado hans wiesman (pictured
                above). hans, scours the world for derelict dc-3 parts that he
                donates to museums or turns into dc-3 designer furniture. axel says, "and what a journey it was:  hans talked
                malagasy air force commanders into selling him their
                dakota scrap yards,argued with thai officials why they should remove wingtips for
                him before they sink the planes to build artificial reefsand lit up with joy when he found the rare forgotten storage
                room full of dakota parts in the jungle of colombia". the result of these adventures is the feature documentary the
                dakota hunter.for a trailer, pictures, stories and lots of other free
