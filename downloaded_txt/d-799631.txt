patient testimonials



i have had left shoulder pain for 2 years and dr. karas has performed arthroscopy on my right shoulder 7 years ago. i have had a great outcome and the procedure was quick and pain management was excellent. i am now going in for the same procedure for the left shoulder. i met with him yesterday and he remembered me and was very thorough in his explanation of how the surgery should go.
                  i have no cons to report, only pros about my overall experience with dr. karas and his staff.

 i had extreme pain when walking and eventually even at rest. i had an arthroscopy which showed bone on bone and knee replacement was recommended.
                  i researched thoroughly since i am an r.n. the first one done in 2007 and the next one in 2009.  i am very pleased. most important aids to recovery are attitude and physical therapy and you need to work very hard. it was well worth it. i'm very happy with my new knees. fabulous results 2 years later and rarely have any discomfort. great care. would highly recommend dr. lehman.

 dr. mcdonald repaired a hammertoe after much conservative therapy. very pleased.  minimal surgical pain, which was well controlled.  a day-stay operation and the baystate ortho surgery center staff was marvelous.  i hope i don't have to have it done on another toe in the future, but i'm very pleased three months out with the outcome.
