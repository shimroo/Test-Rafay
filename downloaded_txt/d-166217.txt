the future of bracketology 101





for the past six years, we have spent more hours than we can count breaking down the "bubble."it’s only fitting then, that the future of bracketology 101 rests squarely on it.last november, chris’s wife gave birth to their family’s first child, ryan, and in late october, craig’s wife gave birth to their first child, jaren. those new additions to the b101 family, coupled with the time commitments of our day jobs, have unfortunately left us with little to no time to devote to the world of bracketology. we still watch our fair share of games and we’ve kept up as much as we can on the college basketball landscape, but not nearly enough to analyze nightly games or put together and debate a weekly bracket.(at this point, even lunardi could probably come up with a better field of 68 than we could.)(ok…maybe not.)in the last week or so, we’ve read several comments and received several e-mails wondering where we’ve been, and wondering if last year’s less-than-stellar final bracket had driven us into early retirement. the truth is we have two very important reasons why we haven’t posted anything yet this season. we can’t believe we are saying this, but bracketology – and the hours each week it takes to do it right – just don’t fit into our schedules right now. we’re not ruling out a late-season return, but in the near future, we won’t be adding any new content to b101.to all of our fans and die-hard commenters, we already miss and will continue to miss all of the daily banter. we feel that over the last six years, no site has been better at debating all things bracketology than b101, and that’s because of the knowledgeable and passionate college basketball fans that visit every day. don’t forget about us – we’ll let you know about the short and long-term future of the site just as soon as we figure it out.in the meantime, enjoy the games...chris & craig

b101's bracket reaction





wow. what a baffling job by the selection committee. our heads are still spinning, and we have a ton of questions.here's 10 of them:1. is it possible that we could have done any worse? four wrong? seriously?2. how do uab and clemson make the field with one top 50 win combined, and colorado get left out with six top 50 wins (six!), including three wins over a 5 seed?3. how does vcu, who finished in fourth place in the colonial and went 3-5 down the stretch, get a bid, and st. mary's, who was co-champ of the wcc and beat st. john's and gonzaga, get left out? how is that consistent?4. how in the world did utah state and richmond get 12s?5. how does georgia get a 10 and alabama, who beat them twice in the last week, get left out?6. how does george mason get a higher seed than old dominion?7. how do any of the big ten bubble seeds make sense? michigan's a 8?? illinois a 9? penn state a 10?8. how is butler an 8? how are they three seed lines better than gonzaga?9. how is missouri an 11? how is kansas state two seed lines ahead of a&m?10. why did the sec title game not even matter? why is florida a 2 and kentucky a 4?

bracketology 101


bracketology 101 has been featured in the new york times, the washington post, the san francisco chronicle, the wall street journal and on espn radio affiliates across the country. the site is designed to serve as a more reliable, more accurate alternative to the bracketology selections of other major sports websites. 
rather than predict teams based on the season ending today, or make wild predictions of the future, bracketology 101 uses a unique "projection-prediction" method of selecting teams, giving fans a much more realistic idea of where their favorite teams stand in the eyes of the selection committee. 
while other bracketologists favor conferences or teams or rely entirely on rpi rankings in making their picks, we factor in a team's resume as a whole - big wins, bad losses, in and out-of-conference wins, upcoming schedules, conference tournament sites, and each team's overall strengths and weaknesses compared to other teams on the bubble. our "field of 68" is updated every monday throughout the season, with daily updates coming during championship week.

how b101 stacks up





the numbers speak for themselves: over the last five years, bracketology 101 is the most accurate bracketology site on the internet. we produced the best bracket in 2006, the second best in 2007 and 2008, and the fifth best in 2009. we are the only bracketologists to produce a top 5 bracket four of the last five years. no other bracketologist has placed in the top 5 more than twice. for a complete breakdown of our bracket stats from the last four years, click on the “we’re #1!” logo above.



the 40-60 club



on top of correctly predicting 64 of the 65 tournament teams in 2008, bracketology 101 also became the first bracketology site to ever seed 40 teams exactly and 60 teams within one seed line of their actual seed. through 2010, we are the only bracketology site to earn this distinction.
