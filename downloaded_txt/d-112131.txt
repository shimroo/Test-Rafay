where it all started!



big blue planet was a website we created in 2005. it was designed to let divers leave reviews about scuba diving locations around the planet, and help other divers find great places to dive next.
it was the very start of our online dive map that has now become a full featured dive log system.
in 2017, the big blue planet website was put into an archive state as all the content was transferred into the online dive log, and it has continued to grow in its new home.
more features, beautiful wall to wall maps, but the same goal: divers helping other divers find their next diving holiday location!
