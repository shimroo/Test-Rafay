with
              signs following
by: pastor max
              solbrekken, d.d.
"what
              then, shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under
              grace.  know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves
              servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether to sin unto death, or of
              obedience unto righteousness? (romans 6:15,16)
for
              we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
              feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as
              we are, yet without sin.  let us therefore come boldly unto
              the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to
              help in time of need." (hebrews 4:15,16)
christ
              crucified, risen & coming
our
              agenda is to spread the gospel of jesus christ to as many as
              possible, as quickly as possible and in every way possible. 
              we believe that christ is not only the hope of the world, but his
              gospel is the remedy for the many problems, fears, addictions and
              diseases that are plaguing mankind!  and we know that we have
              a limited time to get the job done, because surely our lord will
              soon return!
it
              is therefore essential that we utilize every possible means
              available to make christ's name known, loved and trusted, while we
              have the opportunity.  by means of the internet we can reach
              behind the communist walls, iron curtains, islamic torture regimes
              and capitalist nations!

in
              the april 2002 issue of the "cry of his coming"
              magazine, page 16, now on the internet, is the wonderful testimony
              of healing and deliverance in the life of svein erik aasmul of
              lyngdal, norway:
"when
              i was about 15 or 16 years of age, i got hooked on heroin and for
              10 long years, i was in and out of institutions and prisons
              because of my addiction to drugs.  nothing helped and my
              addition grew worse and i would use any drug i could get my hands
              on - heroin, amphetamine as well as alcohol.
max
              solbekken crusade!
one
              day in march 1998 i heard about a max solbrekken crusade in
              bergen, norway, and somehow in my stupor of drugs and alcohol i
              got to this meeting.  a group of canadian indians called the
              'resurrection band' led by len laboucan, were singing and playing
              their instruments.
pastor
              max preached about jesus christ and his power to save, heal and
              deliver.  he told in graphic detail how jesus had suffered
              for our sins.  i went forward to receive jesus as my saviour,
              and to be healed of my terrible addictions!  after the
              meeting i went outside to take a fix, but the needle didn't work. 
              then, i realized that i was free from all drug addiction.
later,
              i checked myself into the evangelistic rehab centre.  after a
              year there, i loved to tonsberg and began to work, something i had
              hadly ever done in my life.  there i met a lovely young lady
              named gunhild and we got married.  we are now living in
              lyndal and are awaiting the arrival of a baby this summer.
i
              have been drug and alcohol free since march 1998 (4 1/2 years) and
              all the glory and honour goes to jesus!  and i have a good
              job as a welder.  it's good to have a new foundation in life,
              one that you can trust in all situations.  all honour and
              glory to jesus!
god
              anointed jesus of nazareth
the
              bible says: "how god anointed jesus of nazareth who went
              about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of devil; for
              god was with him.  and we are witnesses of all things which
              he did both in the land of the jews, and in jerusalem; whom they
              slew and hanged on a tree:
:him
              god raised up the third day and showed him openly; not to all the
              people, but unto witnesses chosen before of god, even to us, who
              did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  and
              he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it
              is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead."
"to
              him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins."
              (acts 10: 38-43)
st.
              peter declared: "forasmuch as ye know that ye were not
              redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your
              vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers: 
              but with the precious blood of christ, as of a lamb without
              blemish or spot:
"who
              verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,
              but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him do
              believe in god, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him
              glory: that your faith and hope & might be in god." (1
              peter 1:18-21)
st.
              paul unveiled for us, that in the council of heaven, before the
              world was created, the triune god (father,
              son and holy spirit) made the
              "blood of the everlasting covenant" for the redemption
              of mankind!
he
              declared: "now the god of peace, that brought again from the
              dead our lord jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the
              blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good
              work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in
              his sight, through jesus christ; to him be glory for ever and
              ever." (hebrew 13: 20, 21)
in
              his great wisdom to redeem adam's fallen race, almighty god
              entered human history through incarnation of his only begotten son
              jesus christ.  his
death for the sins of the
              entire world, past, present and future!
for
              this purpose!
st.
john declared: âhe that
              committeth sin is of devil: for the devil sinneth from the
              beginning. for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he
              might destroy the works of the devil.â (1 john 3:8)\the very
              purpose of his incarnation
was to save us all from spiritual death and
deliver us from the wicked one.
              our saviour said:
              âthe thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill and to
              destroy: i am come that they may have life, and that they may have
              it more abundantly.â (john 10:10)
jesus
              christ, god the son was manifested to destroy satan and his works
              of sin, fear, disease, death, poverty, and demon possession.
st.
              paul declared: "forasmuch then as the children are partakers
              of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the
              same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power
              over death, that is the devil.  and deliver them who through
              fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage."
              (hebrews 2:14-15)
jesus
              not only preached repentance and healed the sick and cast out
              devils, but he commanded his disciples, apostles, and followers to
              do the same.  he is his great commission: "and he said
              unto them, go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every
              creature.  he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;
              but he that believeth not shall be damned.
and
              these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they
              cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall
              take up serpents (like paul in malta); and if they drink any
              deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the
              sick, and they shall recover." (mark 16:15-18)
"and
              being assembled together with them, commanded them that they
              should not depart from jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the
              father, which sayeth he ye have heard of me.  for john truly
              baptized with water, but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
              not many days hence.
"but
              ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you:
              and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem, and in all
              judaea, and in samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the
              earth." (acts 1:8)
"so
              then after the lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into
              heaven, and sat on the right hand of god."
and
              they went forth, and preached everywhere, the lord working with
              them, and confirming the word with signs following." (mark
              16:19-20)
god
              showed up in power
did
              jesus keep his word?  the answer is a resounding 'yes'! 
              he kept his word to them, and he still fulfills his word today. 
              he cannot make a mistake.  he cannot fail.  he cannot
              lie.  "jesus christ the same, yesterday, today and
              forever." (hebrews 13:8)  he said, "i am the way,
              the truth and the life.  no man cometh unto the father, but
              by me." (john 14:6);
the
              bible says: "and when the day of pentecost had fully come,
              they were all of one accord in one place.  and suddenly there
              came a sound from heaven of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled
              all the house where they were sitting  and there appeared
              unto them cloven tongues as of fire, and it sat upon each of
              them."
"and
              they were all filled with the holy ghost, and began to speak in
              tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance.  and they were
              all amazed and marveled, saying one to another, behold, are al
              lthese galileans in our own tongues, wherein we were born?...we do
              hear them speak the wonderful work of god...?
three
              thousand souls believed and were  born again after hearing
              st. peter's great pentecostal message, on jesus of nazareth's
              scrificial death and glorious resurrection from the dead 3 days
              later, according to the holy scriptures!
then
              peter said unto them, repent, and be baptized everyone of you in
              the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall
              receive the gift of the holy ghost.  then they that gladly
              received his words were baptized and the same day they were added
              unto them about three thousand souls." (acts 1:4-8; 2:1-44)
with
              signs following
"now
              peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of
              prayer,  being the ninth hour.  and a certain man lame
              from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the
              gate of the temple which is called beautiful, to ask alms of them
              that entered in the temple; who seeing peter and john about to go
              into the temple asked an alms:
"and
              peter, fastening his eyes upon him with john, said, look on us. 
              and he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from
              them.  then peter said, silver and gold have i none; but
              such as i have give i thee; in the name of jesus christ of
              nazareth, rise up and walk."
"and
              he took him by the right hand and lifted him up: and immediately
              his feet and ankle bones received strength.  and he leaping
              up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple,
              walking, and leaping and praising god: and all the people saw
              walking and leaping, and praising god."
"and
              they  knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful
              gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement
              at that which had happened unto him.  and as the lame man
              which was healed held peter and john, all the people ran together
              unto them in the porch called solomon's, greatly wondering.
god
              hath glorified his son
"and
              when peter saw it, he answered unto the people.  ye men of
              israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us,
              as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to
              walk?
"the
              god of abraham, and of isaac, and of jacob, the god of our father,
              hath glorified his son jesus: whom ye delivered up, and denied him
              in the presence of pilate, when he was determined to let him
              go."
"but
              ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murdered to be
              granted unto you.  and killed the prince of life, whom god
              hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses, and his name
              through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see
              and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this
              perfect soundness in the presence of you all." (acts 3:1-16)
what
              had happened there?
the
              church which jesus christ established when he poured out the holy
              spirit was functioning as it was designed to do!  the
              birth of the church of the day of pentecost had set a great
              revival in motion!  it was functioning in perfect harmony
              with the promise jesus christ.
he
              said: "repent ye therefore, and be ye converted, that your
              sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come
              from the presence of the lord; and he shall send jesus christ
              which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive
              until the times of restitution of all things, which god hath
              spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world
              began.
"unto
              the first god, having raised up his son jesus, sent him to bless
              you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities."
              (acts 3:19-21,26)
justified
              by jesus' blood!
the
              bible states: "but god commendeth his love toward us, in
              that, which we were yet sinners, christ died for us.  much
              more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved
              from wrath through him.  for if, when we were enemies, we
              were reconciled to god by the death of his son, much more, being
              reconciled, we shall be reconciled by his life." (romans
              5:8-10)
we
              are forgiven, pardoned, cleansed, liberated, delivered, and born
              again through the shed blood of jesus christ.  he graciously
              bestows upon us total freedom and liberty in the holy spirit, and
              through his stripes were are divinely healed from all sickness and
              diseases!
"he
              (abraham) staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief:
              but was strong in faith, giving glory to god; and being fully
              persuaded that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. 
              and therefore, it was imputed to him for righteousness."
"now
              it was not written for his sake along, that it was imputed to him;
              but for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him
              that raised up jesus christ from the dead: who was delivered for
              our offences, and was raised again for our justification."
              (romans 4:20-25)
do
              we believe jesus christ was god who was incarnated?
herein
              lies the key!  do we totally believe that jesus christ
              was fully god was was incarnated (god in human flesh) and became
              fully man so that he could suffer,  bleed and die to redeem
              us by meeting the righteous demands of divine justice to satisfy
              the wrath of god against the sins of adam and the human race?
if
              we by god's grace and through divine faith reach that threshold of
              fellowship with the father through his son, the holy spirit will
              lead un into a place  where the impossible becomes possible. 
              i believe that is when the faith of jesus supplants our imperfect
              faith!
i
              didn't have the faith
during
              our crusades in eastern europe in the early 1990's, a ukrainian
              team and i were ministering in several towns and villages. 
              the norwegian pentecostals had donated a large tour bus to a group
              of young preached in truskevets which we used on several occasions
              while ministering across ukraine.  the authorities were very
              helpful as we were able to set up our pa equipment and conduct
              services in desirable locations.
man
              people happily made decisions to follow jesus christ and there
              were some notable answers to prayer among the sick and suffering. on
              one occasion we experienced an amazing miracle.  the town
              had a population of 2,000 and a large crowd attended, seated on
              the grass or on chairs they brought with them.  during my
              message, a young lady jumped to her feet and rushed forward with
              her 3 year old son in her arms, followed by her husband and about
              16 other people.  she blurted out, "my son has just
              died."
i
              asked my interpreter if he knew those people, and he replied,
              "yes, they are the only protestants here and their church
              has 22 members and is called 'the believers'.
the
              parents had attended several of our crusades, begging us to have a
              service in their town because their little son was incurably sick. 
              he was born with a congenital heart disease and they have been
              told by the doctors to stop rushing him into the hospital, because
              he is beyond hope!  they would say, "he will die
              tomorrow.  don't bother us!"
i
              asked the mother if everyone there knew them, and she replied that
              they did.  then i asked the large congregation if they knew
              that couple, and they shouted back that they knew them.  i
              asked, "do you believe the boy is dead and did they
              believe that god would bring him back to life?"
they
              said that little boy should have died before and that they
              believed god would raise him up.  they stated that the
              parents told them that their son would be healed and that is why
              they came to the meeting!
i
              asked everyone to stand to their feet, lift their hands toward god
              and pray after me.  we prayed a lengthy prayer asking god for
              forgiveness and inviting christ to come into their hearts. 
              we prayed the lord's prayer.  after that, we made the
              confession of faith and the prayer of thanksgiving!
then
              i prayed for mercy and grace and for faith to believe that god
              would grant a miracle.  i was overwhelmed by the great
              challenge as i had never been in such a situation before.  they
              had come to see god heal the boy and now it was too late! 
              up to this point, i did not have the faith to command the
              little boy to come back to life.
in
              desperation, i began to praise god for his faithfulness while
              confessing my weakness and lack of power. suddenly something
              happened to me and i felt god's power moving in me.  i
              reached over and touched the little boy, commanding the spirit of
              death to leave and his spirit to come back into him.
              i asked god for a miracle of healing in his body, in
              jesus' mighty name.
at
              that moment, his left leg moved out and so did his right arm. 
              i asked for a cup of water and in the name of jesus christ i threw
              it into his face.  his eyes opened and almost immediately he
              was on the floor walking about.
the
              whole crowd came alive and were excitedly rejoicing and
              worshipping god. jesus had performed a mighty miracle and proved
              to them that he is alive!  to god be all the honor, power
              and glory! amen.

blessed
              assurance
              jesus is mine!

              pastor max solbrekken, d.d.
fanny
              crosbie (1820 - 1915), 'the queen of gospel writers' wrote 8,000
              hymns, even though she was blind, that have brought hope, peace
              and joy to multitudes.  blessed assurance jesus is mine is
              one of those great hymns!
blessed
              assurance, jesus is mine, o what a foretaste of glory divine.
              heir of salvation, purchase of god, born of his spirit, washed in
              his blood.
this
              is my story, this is my song, praising my saviour, all the day
              long.
              this is my story, this is my song, praising my saviour, all the
              day long.
we
              are heirs of god!
the
              bible says: "but when the fulness of the time was come, god
              sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem
              them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption
              of sons.  and because ye are sons, god hath sent forth the
              spirit of his son into your hearts, crying abba, father. 
              wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son: and if a son,
              then an heir of god through christ." (galatians 4:4-7)
st.
              paul wrote: "for as many as are led by the spirit of god,
              they are the sons of god.  for ye have not received the
              spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the spirit
              of adoption, whereby we cry, abba father.
"the
              spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the
              children of god: and if children, then heirs, heirs of god, and
              joint heirs with christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we
              may be also glorified together." (romans 8:14-17)
the
              greek word 'heirs' (kleromomeo), means a receiver of an
              inheritance, a beneficiary.  how did all this happen? 
              by the grace of god and faith in the finished work of christ for
              us on the cross, we receive jesus christ as savior and lord. 
              there is even more - we are joint heirs with him and will reign
              with him.  this is too much for our mortal brains to
              assimilate.  it is beyond our understanding, but so is
              everything else about god!
trying
              to understand god is a 'fool's task'. take off the mask of pride
              and get on your knees and have a talk with jesus!  i like the
              way verner von braun, the father of america's moon project put it. 
              "the father we probe into space, the more i believe in
              god!"  and concerning a man knowing god, john wesley
              stated: "you might as well ask, "can a worm understand a
              man?"  if a worm can understand a man, then a man can
              understand his creator!
scientist:
              jesus' tomb is emtpy!
g.
              b. hardy, a canadian scientist said: "when i looked at
              religion i said, i have two questions.  one, has anybody
              every conquered death, and two, if they have, did they make a way
              for me to conquer death?"
"i
              checked the tomb of buddha, and it was occupied, and i checked the
              tomb of confucius and it was occupied, and i checked the tomb of
              mohammed and it wa occupied, and i came to the tomb of jesus and
              it was empty.  and i said, there is one who conquered death. 
              and i asked the second question.  did he make a way for me to
              do it?  and i opened the bible and discovered that he said,
              'because i live ye shall live also." (john 14:19)  -
              john macarthur
"friends,
              at this very hour, the cremated body of siddhartha guatama (now
              known as the buddha) lies in a grave at the foot of the himalayan
              mountains.  muhammad, the founder of islam, is buried in
              medina, saudia arabia.  joseph smith is buried in nauvoo,
              illinois.  charles darwin is buried at westminster abbey in
              london.  they are all dead and their graves are occupied. 
              only jesus christ proved that what he said was true by rising from
              the dead."  - charlie h. campbell
"i
              have been used for many years to study the histories of other
              times and to examine and weigh the evidence of those who have
              written about them, and i know of no one fact in the history of
              mankind which is proved by better and fuller evidence of every
              sort, to the understanding of a fair inquirer, than the great sign
              which god hath given us that christ died and rose again from the
              dead." - thomas arnold, historian and oxford professor
"if
              all the evidence is weighed carefully and fairly, it is indeed
              justifiable, according to the canons of historical research, to
              conclude that the sepulcher of joseph of arimathea, in which jesus
              was buried, was actually empty on the morning of the first easter. 
              and no shred of evidence has yet been discovered in literary
              sources, epigraphy, or archaeology that would disprove this
              statement."  - paul maier
great
              historians believe gospel!
"i
              claim to be an historian.  my approach to classics is
              historical.  and i tell you that the evidence for the life,
              the death, and the resurrection of christ is better authenticated
              than most of the facts of ancient history..." = e.m.
              blaiklock, professor of classics at auckland university
"one
              of the most amazing facts about the early christian belief in
              jesus' resurrection was that it originated in the very city where
              jesus was crucified.  the christian faith did not come to
              exist in some distant city, far from eyewitnesses who knew of
              jesus' death and burial.  no, it came into being in the very
              city where jesus had been publicly crucified, under the very eyes
              of its enemies."  - william lane craig
"all
              the power of rome and of the religious establishment in jerusalem
              was geared to stop the christian faith.  all they had to do
              was to dig up the grave and to present the corpse.  they
              didn't."  - henry schaefer iii
"in
              56 a.d. [the apostle] paul wrote that over 500 people had seen the
              risen jesus and that most of them were still alive (1 corinthians
              15:6).  it passes the bounds of credibility that the early
              christians could have manufactured such a tale and then preached
              it among those who might easily have refuted it simply by
              producing the body of jesus" - john warwick montgomery
"the
              resurrection of jesus christ is the single greatest event in the
              history of the world.  it is so foundational to christianity
              that no one wno denies it can be a true christian.  without
              resurrection there is no christian faith, no salvation, and no
              hope.  "if there is no resurrection of the dead,"
              paul explains, "but if there be no resurrection of the dead,
              than is christ not risen:  and if christ be not risen, then
              our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain." (1
              corinthians 15:13-14)
"a
              person who believes in a christ who was not raised believes in a
              powerless christ, a dead christ.  if christ did not rise from
              the dead, then no redemption was accomplished at the cross and
              "your faith is worthless."  paul goes on to say:
              "you are still in your sins" (verse 17).  - john
              macarthur
the
              holy spirit reveals christ
how
              are we able to believe this amazing gospel, the good news that we
              can be transformed from sinners to saints, from enemies of god to
              being adopted into his kingdom?  the greatest example is saul
              of tarsus who was a fierce enemy of jesus christ and his church,
              ravaging, imprisoning and killing christians.
when
              the lord jesus appeared to him in a blinding light, he was
              converted and became the most powerful preacher of the gospel. 
              saul of tarsus took the name of paul, the little one, wrote more
              than one-half of the new testament, founded the church in the
              gentile world and sealed his testimony for jesus christ as a
              martyr!
he
              said: "for when we were yet without strength, in due time
              christ died for the ungodly.  but god commendeth his love
              toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, christ died for
              us."
"much
              more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved
              from wrath through him.  for if when we were enemies, we were
              reconciled to god by the death of his soon, much more being
              reconciled, we shall be saved by his life." (romans 5:6,8-10)
"therefore,
              it any man be in christ, he is a new creature: old things are
              passed away, behold all things are become new.  and all
              things are of god, who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus
              christ, and hath given to us the word of reconciliation:  to
              wit (that is), that god was in christ reconciling the world unto
              himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
              committed unto us the word of reconciliation." (2 corinthians
              5:17-19)
jesus
              unfolds the mystery!
jesus
              asked: "but whom saith thou that i am?  simon
              peter....said, thou art the christ the son of the living god. 
              jesus said...for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
              but my father in heaven." (matthew 16:13-17)
the
              holy spirit alone has the divine ability to reveal to a human
              being that jesus christ is indeed the messiah, the anointed one
              and son of the living god!   and only the holy bible,
              the written word of god can confirm that revelation!
the
              vicarious death of the incarnated son of god and his glorious
              resurrection has purchased forgiveness of sins, full pardon and
              eternal life.  jesus, when he had by himself purged our sins,
              sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.  being so
              much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a
              more excellent name than they." (hebrews 1:3-4)

to
              believers, the baptism of the holy spirit is the deposit or
              guarantee of our inheritance: "in whom also we have obtained
              an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of
              him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. 
              that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in
              christ.
"in
              whom also ye trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the
              gospel of your salvation: in whom after that ye believed, ye were
              sealed with that holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest of
              our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession,
              unto the praise of his glory." (ephesians 1:13-14)

so
              long i had searched for life's meaning.  enslaved by the
              world and my greed.  then the door of the prison was opened
              by love.  for the ransom was paid - i was free.
i'm
              free from the fear of tomorrow.  i'm free from the guilt of
              the past, for i've traded by shackles for a glorious song. 
              i'm free!  praise the lord!  free at last!
i'm
              free from the guilt that i carried.  from that dull empty
              life i'm set free.  for when i met jesus, he made me
              complete. he forgot how foolish i used to be.

              i'm free!  praise the lord!  free at last!
why
              the gospel is so powerful
st.
              paul wrote: "i am debtor both to the greeks, and to the
              barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.  so as much
              as in me is, i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at
              rome also.  for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for
              it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone that believeth:
              to the jew first and also to the greek." (romans 1:14-16)
here
              is st. paul's mission statement.  i am a debtor to the
              gentiles.  i must pay that debt by giving them the gospel. 
              i am ready to preach the gospel in pagan rome.  later, he
              stated: "what mean ye to weep and break my heart?  for i
              am ready not only to be bound only, but also to die at jerusalem
              for the name of the lord jesus." (acts 21:13)
"i
              am not ashamed of the gospel of christ, even though it was
              despised and hated by the jews and ridiculed by the gentiles!
the
              apostle to the gentiles had a divine call from god to preach the
              gospel of christ to the pagan and the un-reached masses of
              humanity.  he understood the plan of god to dispense the glad
              tidings of the vicarious death and the glorious resurrection of
              jesus of nazaet to the whole world.
he
              had a mandate to go where others had not gone.  he was a
              trailblazer on a mission for god and nothing would stop him until
              his work was finished.  after the unsuccessful coup in
              damascus to kill him, saul of tarsus was led to arabia, where i
              believe, he was tutored by jesus himself.  almighty god had a
              hidden secret that was made in the council of heaven, in the
              godhead.
mystery
              of god given to paul
it
              was probably there that the great 'mystery of god' was revealed to
              him: "even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and
              generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: 'to whom god
              would make known what is the glory of this mystery among the
              gentiles: which is christ in you, the hope of glory."
              (colossians 1:26, 27)
jews
              were forbidden to have dealings with gentiles.  a canaanite
              woman came to jesus for the healing of her demon possessed
              daughter.  he made it clear that his mission was to reach the
              jewish people, but her faith brought her a miracle.
he
              said: "i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of
              israel.  then came she and worshipped him, saying, lord, help
              me.  but he answered and said, it is not meet to give the
              children's bread to dogs.
"and
              she said, truth, lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
              from their masters' table.  then jesus answered and said unto
              her, o woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee as thou wilt. 
              and her daughter was made whole from that very hour." (matthew
              15:24-28)
jesus
              of nazareth came to his own!
his
              ministry was to the lost sheep of the house of israel and to offer
              his life on the cross for all people everywhere.  the job
              description to his apostles, disciples and all believers, however,
              is to carry his gospel to all people everywhere!
"and
              he said unto them, go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel
              to every creature.  he that believeth and is baptized shall
              be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.  and
              these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they
              cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
"they
              shall take up serpents (paul in malta); and if they drink any
              deadly thing (some preachers in soviet prisons) it shall not hurt
              them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall
              recover." (mark 16:15-19)
the
              great persecution by saul led to evangelism among the gentiles:
              "therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
              preaching the word.  then philip went down to the city of
              samaria, and preached christ unto them.  and the people with
              one accord gave heed unto these things which philip spake, hearing
              and seeing the miracles which he did.
"for
              unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that
              were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that
              were lame, were healed." (acts 9:4-7)
jesus
              is the great i am
jesus
              christ said: "but the hour cometh, and now is, when the true
              worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth: for
              the father seeketh such to worship him.  god is a spirit and
              they that worship him must worship him in spirit and of truth.
"the
              woman saith unto him, i know that messiah cometh, which is called
              chriast: when he is come.  he will tell us all things. 
              jesus saith unto her, i that speak to thee is he.  the woman
              left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and saith to
              the men, come see a man who, which told me all things that ever i
              did: is not this the christ?" (john 4:23-26, 28)
jesus
              said: "verily, verily, i say unto you, he that believeth on
              me hath everlasting life.  i am the bread of life.  i am
              the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of
              this bread, he shall live  forever: and the bread that i will
              give is my flesh, which i will give for the life of the
              world...except ye eat the flesh of the son of man, and drink his
              blood, ye have no life in you:
"whoso
              eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and i
              will raise him at the last day.  for my flesh is meat indeed,
              and my blood is drink indeed." (john 6a;47-55)
"....i
              am the light of the world, he that followeth me shall not walk in
              darkness, but shall have the light of life.  and he said unto
              them, ye are from beneath; i am from above: ye are of this world. 
              i am not of this world.  i said therefore unto you, that ye
              shall die in your sins if ye believe not that i am he." (john
              8:12, 23, 24)
"i
              am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and go
              in and out and find pasture.  the thief cometh not but for to
              steal, and to kill, and to destroy:  i am come that they
              might have life and that they might have it more abundantly."
              (john 10:9,10)
"i
              am the way, the truth, and the life.  no man cometh unto the
              father except by me." (john 14:6), "i am the good
              shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine." (john
              10:1-4); "i am the resurrection and the life: he that
              believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live."
              (john 11:25):
"i
              am the true vine, and my father is the husbandman.  every
              branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every
              branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that i may bring forth
              more fruit." (john 15:1,2)
when
              all else fails: come back to jesus!
if
              you have drifted away from the saviour, run back to him and cast
              yourself into his loving, caring and healing arms!  he is
              constantly waiting for you.  that is why he told the parable
              about the prodigal son who returned to his father after ruining
              his life through careless, wicked and riotous living!
"and
              he arose and came to his father.  but when he was yet a great
              way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran, and fell
              on his neck, and kissed him.  and the son said unto him,
              father, i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and am no
              more worthy to be called thy son.  but the father said to his
              servants, bring forth the best robe and put it on him, and put a
              ring on his hand and shoes on his feet:
"and
              bring hither the fatted calf and kill it; and let us eat and be
              merry: for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost
              and is found..." (luke 15:20-23).  the most important
              prayer anyone can pray is: "father i have sinned."
he
              knows about every one of us and he understands us because he was
              himself tested and tempted just like all of us, yet without sin! 
              "god the father hath according to abundant mercy begotten us
              again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from
              the dead." (hebrews 10:3)
"for
              we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling
              of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are,
              yet without sin.  let us therefore come boldly unto the
              throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in
              time of need." (hebrews 4:15,16)
let
              the healing begin
there
              is divine healing for all human hurts, pains, torments and
              sorrows.  there is a balm in gilead for all sin sick souls,
              wounded spirits and diseased bodies.  there is a peace,
              assurance and tranquility for confused, tormented and bewildered
              minds!
the
              healer from nazareth is still passing by the blind man sitting by
              the side of the road, begging for bread.  the miracle worker
              that stopped on the jericho road to administer divine healing and
              wholeness, has not gotten old, tired or helpless, but is the same
              yesterday, today and forever.
he
              still heals the blind and infirm who wait for a touch from the
              master's hands.  the sea walker still comes to us when our
              boat is about to sink.  he comes walking on the waves of our
              tempestuous lives, often at the height of our problems.  as
              happened to the disciples, he often comes to us in the third hour
              of the night as we struggle to quieten our spirits, dispel our
              fears and calm our nerves!
he
              says, "peace be still.  don't be concerned.  be of
              good cheer.  i know all about you and i have come to help
              you!"  there is still hope, faith and agape love for the
              sin hardened soul and fear plagued 'rebel called man'.
when
              it seems that all hope is gone, we hear his voice saying,
              "peace be still and know that i am god.  i will never
              leave thee nor forsake thee.  i will be with you all the way,
              until the journey's end."  he will not dessert us nor
              abandon us til we reach the 'golden shore' and meet jesus face to
              face in our heavenly home!
there
              will be no disappointments there, and all will be peace and
              glorious harmony in the 'radiant place' that our saviour, jesus
              christ has gone to prepare for us!  there will be no more
              sorrow, sickness, pain or death in that 'land of endless day',
              where truth reigns supreme and fear and falsehood is unknown and
              the prince of peace is king!
we
              sing with gusto that great gospel song, 'what
              a day that will be, when my jesus i shall see!  just to look
              upon his face, the one who saved me by his grace!  when he
              takes me by the hand, and leads me through the promised land, what
              a day, glorious day that will be!'
however,
              before we go there, there is much to explore, enjoy and envision
              here on this 'terrestrial ball' we call earth; which our heavenly
              father created by, through and for his son, our lord jesus christ.
christ's
              high priestly prayer!
the
              17th chapter of st. john's gospel is an extraordinary theological
              sermon!  the heart of our saviour is exposed to humanity as
              he literally sweeps away the mystery of his incarnation and allows
              us to understand a little of the love between god the son and his
              father, and the yarning heart of jesus to please his father.
and
              the great cost to jesus in laying aside his godhood, in order to
              fulfill the great act of love and sacrifice, found in the plan of
              redemption!
we
              see and hear the father's heart of warmth and pleasure as he spoke
              at his son's baptism and again at his transfiguration: "this
              is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased, hear him"!
he
              was saying: "take your eyes off elijah and moses.  look
              at my son!"  amen.

understanding the times
               & what to do 
by: pastor max solbrekken
"and
              the children of issachar, which were men who had understanding
              of the times, to know what israel ought to do; the heads of
              them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their
              commandment." (1 chronicles 12:32)
where
              are the men among us today?
where
              are the men among us today who understand the times and who know
              what we ought to do?  the ability to understand 'the
              times', is undoubtedly a rare ability.  and to know
              how to be proactive or reactive in each situation is equally
              important.  there is a natural ability which comes
              from genetic inheritance, experience or observation!
god
              has given to his body, which is the church, 
              nine supernatural gifts
there
              is also the  spiritual gifting  which comes
              directly from the holy spirit!  god has given to his body,
              the church, nine supernatural spiritual gifts which include the
              unique 'gift of the word of knowledge' and the 'gift of the word
              of wisdom'.
"for
              to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom; to another the
              word of knowledge by the same spirit." (1 corinthians
              12:8)  the 'gift of the word of knowledge' is the
              supernatural ability to know things that are not naturally known
              and the  'gift of the word of wisdom' is the
              supernatural ability to know how to act or react to that
              knowledge!
god
              has so equipped his church with these safeguards and tools to not
              only protect it but to thrust it forward in its task of building
              his kingdom!  whether the ability to "understand the
              times" and to "know what to do" come to
              us through natural ability or supernatural gifts is immaterial. 
              the important thing is that we are apprised of the situation, our
              eyes are wide open and our minds are alert to know, see and do the
              right things!
i
              pray for each one reading these lines that our dear lord will
              grant unto all the ability to "know him who to know is
              life eternal" and the desire to walk with him in truth,
              sincerity and humility, trusting only in his merits for time and
              eternity!
and
              that we may understand the times and know what to do in order to
              keep our families safe from the filth and gutter slime so
              prevalent in our disintegrating society.  to keep our
              children safe from this corrupt, wicked and perverted world?
              (2 john 1:1-9)
awake
              thou that sleepest!
the
              bible admonishes: "wherefore he saith, awake thou that
              sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light. 
              see then that ye walk
              circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise;
"redeeming
              the time, because the days are evil.  wherefore be ye not
              unwise, but  understanding  what the will of god
              is.  and be not drunk with wine wherein in excess, but be
              filled with the spirit." (ephesians 5:14-18)
you
              may ask:  "where are the men?"  we have
              a real problem because we live in a society where many younger men
              have had no role model due to broken homes and absent dads!  the
              rage these young men have developed, because of the ache in their
              hearts for a father, often surfaces against their wives and
              children!
and
              it is even worse in common-law arrangements, hopping from one
              relationship to another, leaving behind  bruised and
              hurting women and children, as well as  heart broken
              men!
large
              numbers of families are hurting because of  stubborn
              foolish pride, self-centeredness, and demons of lust  let
              loose through immoral movies, alcohol, drug abuse and pornography!
i
              blame the devil!
i
              blame the devil who has blinded the eyes of religious leaders
              who have been asleep at the switch and didn't see the approaching
              train filled with worldly pleasure, compromise and lethargy! 
              some blame must also go to parents who have allowed their children
              to change the rules and call the shots!
st.
              paul stated: "but if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them
              that are lost.  in whom the god of this world hath blinded
              the minds of them which believed not, lest the light of the
              glorious gospel of christ, who is the image of god, should shine
              unto them." (2 corinthians 4:3,4)
i
              blame our politicians who have listened to the voices of the crowd
              crying: "give us the murdered barabbas"
              and "crucify jesus the christ: we won't have him to
              rule over us." (matthew 27:20-26)
amazingly,
              politicians are often allowed to pass laws that are unhealthy,
              immoral and ungodly and believe that they can go scot-free, that
              there are no further consequences!
a
              good example of this is the 'same-sex marriage' or as it has been
              aptly called 'man-on-man' marriage, which our former corrupt
              government pushed through against the wishes of the majority of
              canadians.  do they think that they had the last word on
              that?  do they think that they can get away with it?
well,
              they won't!  it will come back to bite them in this life and
              the next!  one day
              every lawmaker, politician and judge that has contributed to the
              breakdown of society, destruction of marriages through perverted
              laws, knowingly releasing pedophiles and murderers into society to
              molest rape and kill, will stand before the greatest judge of all
              to hear his verdict.
god's
              word states: "for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven
              against all  ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold
              the truth in unrighteousness." (romans 1:18)
what
              does that mean?
it
              means to suppress the truth and hide it from the people, to cover
              it up or water it down.  it means to lie about the truth and
              promote the very opposite.  it means to substitute another
              agenda that is carnal, fleshly and untruthful.
st.
              paul warned: "because that when they knew god, they glorified
              him not as god....but became vain in their imaginations, and
              their foolish heart was darkened.  professing themselves
              to be wise,  they became fools.  wherefore god
              gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts,
              to dishonour their own bodies between themselves.  who
              changed the truth of god into a lie...
"for
              this cause god gave them up unto vile affections: for even their
              women did change the natural use into that which is against
              nature.  and likewise also the men, leaving the natural 
              use of the woman, burned in their lust, one toward another...
"and
              even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge, god
              gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are
              not convenient." (romans 1:21-28)
strong
              warning: 
              "marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled:
              but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge." (hebrews
              13:4)
the
              bible warns perverts:  and jesus called a  little
              child  unto him and set him in the midst of them. 
              and said, "verily i say unto you, except ye be converted and
              become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
              heaven.
but
              whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me,
              it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck
              and he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
              (matthew 18:2, 3, 6)
the
              great day of judgment!
every
              philosopher, theologian and preacher 
              who suppresses the truth and perverts the teachings of jesus
              christ will have to stand before the eternal judge on the 'day of
              judgment'.  unbelievers
              will appear at the great white throne presided over by our lord
              jesus christ:
"and
              i saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose
              face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no
              place for them.
and
              i saw the dead, small and great, stand before god; and the book
              were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of
              life: and the dead were
              judged out of those things which were written in the books,
              according to their works.
and
              the sea gave up the dead that were in it; and death and hell
              delivered up the dead which were in them; and they were judged
              every man according to their works.  and death and hell were
              cast into the lake of fire.  this is the second death. 
              and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
              into the lake of fire." (revelation 20:11-15)
believers
              at  the bema seat judgment
believers
              in christ will all appear at the  bema seat judgment. 
              it is where followers of jesus christ will be judged for rewards
              or lack thereof depending on their works: here are the words of
              holy scripture on this matter:
"wherefore
              we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of
              him.    for
              we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ, that every
              one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he
              hath done, whether it be good of bad." (2 corinthians
              5:10)
the
              bible commands believers to turn from sins that war against the
              soul and flee from the wrath to come, by abiding in christ the
              sure rock of our salvation!  st. paul admonishes the church
              thus: "if so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught
              by him, as the truth is in jesus:
that
              ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which
              is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the
              spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man which after
              god is created in righteousness and true holiness."
"wherefore
              putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for
              ye are members one of another.  neither give place to the
              devil." (ephesians 4:21-27)
giving
              heed to god's word!
"i
              beseech ye therefore, brethren, by the mercies of god,  that
              ye present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy acceptable unto
              god, which is your reasonable service;.  and be not conformed
              to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,
              that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable and perfect
              will of god." (romans 12:1, 2)
"wherefore,
              seeing we also are compassed with so great a cloud of witnesses, 
              let us lay aside every
              weight, and the sin which both so easily beset us, and let us run
              with patience the race that is set before us.  looking unto
              jesus, the author and finisher of our faith;
"who
              for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising
              the shame, and is set down at the right hand at the throne of
              god." (hebrews 12:1,2)
there
              are three things we must do: consider jesus: "wherefore,
              holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the
              apostle and high priest (hebrews 3:1):  there is no-one like
              him;  saviour, redeemer, healer, friend, god!  look
              unto jesus: "looking unto jesus the author and finisher
              of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the
              cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of
              god (hebrews 12:2):  don't
              just look at him but look unto him for forgiveness, counsel,
              comfort and healing.  go to him with your needs and watch him
              work in your life.
we
              must follow jesus!
we
              must follow jesus:
              "let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing
              his reproach.."(hebrews 13:13).  take up your cross and
              become his disciple.  serve him and live for him.  look
              for his return! (matthew 11:28)
you
              will then become like the sons of issachar who understood the
              times and knew what israel had to do.
may
              god richly bless you as you draw near unto him, for he has
              promised to draw near unto you! (james 4:8)  he will accept
              you when you call upon his name in sincerity and faith. (john 6:7) 
              amen.

              rev. terry and shelly severson to take the reigns of
              leadership and build on what we started in saskatoon on september

              precious name of our saviour jesus christ.
this
              move will give me the opportunity to pour myself into our
              missionary work, publishing a number of books i have written and
              do more radio and tv work in order to reach a larger audience with
              christ's gospel.
on
              october 26, 1991 (after 22 years) donna and i turned over the
              large, beautiful faith cathedral church and property, located on
              2.5 acres in edmonton, alberta, to peoples church, giving me the
              opportunity to reach multitudes for christ all across the soviet
              union (russia, ukraine, poland, bulgaria, romania, estonia,
              latvia), sudan, egypt, uganda, tanzania, europe, norway, brazil
              and the philippine islands.

              paulina, sp, brazil.
today,
              people's church, edmonton is a strong church with people from

a
              legendary evangelistic - dr. max solbrekken
this
              week we have had the privilege of talking with a legendary
              evangelist dr. max solbrekken.  he held a series of meetings
              for the whole week in one of our meeting halls in hokksund,
              norway, and has prayed for people to be healed and delivered.
max
              is 79 years old, he looks healthy and strong and is still
              traveling all over the world with the gospel
              of jesus christ just a she has done it for the last 50 years.
we
              asked max to tell us how he got saved.
"i
              was born in canada from a norwegian parents who love the lord and
              were christians."  they were not pentecostals and had
              never heard of the work of the holy spirit.  one time my dad
              got very sick, and his sickness was identified to be an illness in
              his gall bladder.  he was admitted in a hospital and was
              waiting for a surgery.  while he was there, he heard a voice
              speaking to him in norwegian that said to him, "go home and
              listen to oral roberts on the radio."
my
              dad did not know that god could speak to him in that way, but
              still he decided to obey the voice as it was very convincing. 
              while he listened to the radio program he was completely healed
              and some time later while he was praying alone he got baptized in
              the spirit.

why
              we need 
 a revival
by
              pastor max solbrekken, d.d.
the
              bible clearly outlines the sins of israel, which at one time held
              a special relationship with god. in this article i compare
              israel's backsliding to the church of jesus christ's seemingly
              constant drift from our amazing spiritual beginning until the
              present!
in
              the same manner, i parallel the fall of adam and eve in the garden
              of eden from purity, honesty and worship of their creator to the
              corrupt, jaded and perverted world system of today!
god's
              word states:
              "righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a
              reproach to any people." (proverbs 14:34 );
              "blessed is the nation whose god is the
              lord." (psalms 33:12) 
 according to these scriptures, canada is in a fallen
              state!
the
              church is in desperate need of a genuine holy ghost, heaven-sent,
              apostolic revival of mammoth proportions! without a visitation
              from god, the church will not be able survive the awful onslaught
              of satanic invention and intrigue!
the
              evil one is working overtime to minimize, decimate and destroy the
              effectiveness of the body of christ around the world! he has
              employed many and varied agencies and emissaries to do his bidding
              ever since 'the fall', which has caused great confusion and
              suffering to the church.
the
              greatest problem suffered by the body of christ down though
              the centuries,  however, has been self - inflicted!
              discord among brethren, jealousy, envy, backbiting, lust, greed,
              pride and control, have been some of the sins that have seriously
              hampered the sanctity and the growth of the church!
other
              major problems have been that of deception, laziness and
              indifference! power hungry men have often been willing to
              compromise the word of god, to maintain their position of
              prominence in society and authority in the church.
what
              has been the result of these actions? a loss of real
              spiritual power, a vacuum of moral leadership in the church and
              community, and a blurred   vision of the
              purpose and goals of  the ministry. it has also generated a luke
              warmness
              toward the needs of the people, a lack of compassion to reach
              a lost world and a loss of  the holy spirit's fire
              in praise and worship.
here
              are some key scriptures that relate to our situation today and
              their ramifications as it applies to our individual lives and the
              church body as a whole. in this message i seek to show the
              similarities that existed in various times in israel's history of
              backsliding to what is happening in the church presently.
1. nehemiah
              1:1-5
"the
              words of nehemiah the son of hach-a-liah. and it came to pass in
              the month chisleu, in the twentieth year, as i was in the palace,
              that ha-na-ni, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
              judah; and i asked them concerning jerusalem. and they said unto
              me, the
              remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are
              in great affliction and reproach:
the
              wall of jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates
              thereof are burned with fire.
"and
              it came to pass, when i heard these words, that i sat down
              and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before
              the god of heaven,  and said, i beseech thee, o' lord god of
              heaven, the great and terrible god, that keepeth covenant and
              mercy for them that love him and observe his
              commandments."
it seems
              clear to me that the report given to hezekiah about the
              awful condition of jerusalem - the city of god -
              and the sad plight of the inhabitants therein, closely resemble
              the plight of the christian church in many parts of the
              world today.
jesus
              said: "i
              will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
              against it." (matthew
              16: 18). it is true that  jesus is building his church and it is
              also true that the gates of hell cannot and will not prevail
              against it. during the time of christ, city hall (as we call
              it), where plans of war were hammered out,  was directly
              behind the gate, and consequently was referred to as the gates of
              the city!  the words, 'the
              gates of hell',
              refer to the opinions, plans,  strategy and agenda of satan.
              they cannot succeed in the long term! they will be defeated.
our
              lord gave us the great commission, which stated in part: "go
              ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. he
              that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that
              believeth not shall be damned. and these signs shall follow them
              that believe: in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall
              speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they
              drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall
              lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover." (mark
              16:15, 18)
is
              the church a reproach today?
we
              must ask ourselves the questions: "are we fulfilling the
              great commission of our lord, or are we just playing church? are
              we casting out devils, healing the sick, setting the captives
              free, and preaching the good news to those who haven't yet heard?
even
              a casual reading of the epistles teaches us how
              graciously, unselfishly and righteously god desires us to live,
              after receiving jesus christ as lord. do we love the lord
               with all our heart, soul and mind, and our neighbour as
              ourselves? do we love others, as christ loved us or do we hold
              onto grudges and un-forgiveness? it is difficult  to
              believe that we are not "missing the mark" in
              these areas.
the
              lord's prayer, which our master taught his disciples to pray,
              states in part: "thy
              kingdom come. thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven."
              have our lives helped to cause that to happen? is his will
              being done in our earth (body) as well as on the earth? are
              we a part of the solution or a part of the problem?
hezekiah
              was confronted with a pitiful sight! the walls of jerusalem were
              broken down and the gates had been burned with fire! and the
              remnant that were left in god's holy city were in great
              affliction (poverty, despair, sickness) and reproach (persecuted,
              maligned, ridiculed). if
              we are honest with ourselves and god, we must admit that this is a
              picture of the church world-wide.
never
              before, has the roman catholic church
been
              so publicly disgraced and sued in the courts, because of the sick
              homosexual practices of their pervert pedophile priests! and when
              you see protestant denominations
              in the western world caving in to the demands of homosexuals and
              lesbians for ordination and same-sex marriages for their
              clergy, doesn't it make you sick?
the
              first time i saw two men kissing on tv, i felt nauseated! 
              what a reproach. what an unnatural, disgusting image for
              little children to absorb!
the
              disastrous fall into almost comatose formalism, and a rejection of
              the virgin birth of christ, the born again experience and the
              doctrine of hell of many protestant churches makes one wonder how
              bad it can get. the only answer is a red-hot, holy spirit led
              revival of righteousness.
2.  joel  1:9-14,  joel 2:15
"the
              field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the
              new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. be ye ashamed, o ye
              husbandmen; howl, o ye wine dressers, for the wheat and for
              the barley; because
              the harvest of the field is perished.
"the
              vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the
              pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even
              all the trees of the field, are withered: 
              because
              joy is withered away from the sons of men. gird
              yourselves and lament ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar:
              come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my god: for
              the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the
              house of your god.
"sanctify
              ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the
              inhabitants of the land into the house of the lord your god, and
              cry unto the lord. alas for the day! for the day of the lord is at
              hand, and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come."
i
              believe that there is a parallel  between the crises in
              the church today, and the vision that the prophet joel had of israel facing
              the day of judgment, called in the old testament, 'the day of the
              lord'! using this scripture as a pre-picture of the church in
              the time of the end, allow me to share some pertinent and very
              important truths:
why was israel to
              asked to call a solemn assembly? why must the priests lie all
              night in sackcloth, crying unto god? why must all the inhabitants
              of the land fast, mourn, weep and repent? judgment was coming! the
              terrible 'day of the lord' was about to take place, when the
              almighty's wrath will fall upon the world at the very end of time.
the
              bible issues a warning!
st.
              peter wrote about it with great solemnity and warning: "but
              the day of the lord shall come as  a thief in the night; in
              the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the
              elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the
              works that are therein shall be burned up. seeing then that all
              these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye
              to be in all holy conversation and godliness?
"looking
              for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god, wherein the
              heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements
              shall melt with fervent heat? nevertheless, according to his
              promise,  look for  new heavens and a new earth,
              wherein dwelleth righteousness."
"wherefore,
              beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye
              may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
              blameless." (2 peter 3: 10, 14). why should we
              call a solemn assembly and sanctify a fast? why should the church
              spend much, much more time in prayer?  here are three
              reasons:
1.
              we have lost the harvest -  verse 11
for the
              church,  the harvest is the youth of our nation! our
              young people who have drifted away from the faith of their fathers
              and mothers! young people who smoke marijuana, fornicate, drink
              alcoholic beverages and gamble at the casinos and video lottery
              terminals! young people who are carnally minded and live only for
              pleasure, instead of being consecrated and dedicated to god and
              his program.
2.
              we have lost the joy - verse 12
the
              reason that there is so little joy in the hearts of christians is
              because we have lost the harvest. it is because we are not winning
              souls to christ! the bible says: "they
              that sow in tears shall reap in joy. he that goeth forth and
              weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with
              rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him." (psalm 126: 5, 6).
i
              have never met an unhappy soul winner!
              people who witness for christ and are engaged in church and
              missionary work are the happiest people that i have been
              privileged to meet, because they are involved with eternal souls.
              a soul winner's joy is sweet and his reward is great.
the
              bible says: "and they that be wise shall shine as the
              brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to
              righteousness as the stars for ever and ever." (daniel
              12: 2, 3)
3.  there
              is no meat & drink offering - verse 13
the
              priests and their families lived off  some of the offerings
              that were brought to the temple. people had stopped bringing in
              their offerings, so therefore there was very little for the
              ministering priests to live on. how can the church survive when
              people lose interest, backslide, stop paying their tithes?
how
              can the work of god grow if people stop serving him, and discontinue
              giving missionary offerings? only a revival, an awakening, a
              visitation from god almighty will shake us into action, so that
              our hearts will be right with him and open to the call of god upon
              our lives. let us call a solemn assembly and get people involved
              in fasting and praying for a genuine revival from heaven.
3. habakkuk
              3: 1, 2
"a
              prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth. o lord, i have
              heard thy speech, and was afraid: o lord, revive thy work in the
              midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath
              remember mercy."
this
              is one of the most powerful scriptures in the bible, to
              convince the church to call upon god for mercy, forgiveness and
              help! the prophet had  apparently been in prayer and god had
              spoken to him.  prayer is a two-way street. it is important
              to let god speak to us during our times of seeking him!  what
              god told the prophet shook him to the core, and made him afraid.
what
              did god tell habakkuk? it
              seems that god must have given him a message, that
              impending  judgment was about to fall. gripped by a holy
              reverence andr godly fear, the prophet cried out: 
"instead
              of judgment, send a revival.  revive thy work o lord, in the
              midst of the years. don't let your cup of judgment get filled up!
              rather make yourself known unto us now by forgiving our sins and
              showing mercy. and if you must judge us, in your great wrath
              remember to be merciful!
4.
              jeremiah 2: 13 ;  6: 16
"for
              my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the
              fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken
              cisterns, that can hold no water. thus saith the lord, stand ye in
              the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good
              way, and walk therein, and ye shall rest for your souls. but they
              said, we will not walk therein."
there
              are some sad stories in the bible of hardhearted people who
              refused to turn to the lord, even after he called them repeatedly! 
              here he speaks to jeremiah - the weeping prophet - about his
              feelings regarding israel , his chosen people! he asks: "hath
              a nation changed their gods, which are no gods? but my people have
              changed their glory for that which doth not profit." (v.
              11).
he
              indicts israel on two counts:  forsaking him, the
              fountain of living water and exchanging him for counterfeits -
              broken cisterns which can hold no water.
then,
              he challenges them to take a good hard look at all the
              alternatives: "stand at the crossroads of life and have a
              good look at the alternatives. then, return to the good ways and
              walk in them." what does he offer? peace and rest for our
              souls! yet, there are many who enter the wide gate and take the
               broad road which leads to death and destruction.
the
              bible gives the key to revival
here
              is the key to revival: "if my people, which are called by my
              name, shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, then
              will i hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal
              their land." (2 chron. 7: 14).
there
              are four things that god's people must do in order for the
              almighty to rend the heavens and come down in revival power
              in our midst!
first,
              we must humble ourselves, getting rid of the sin of pride. second,
              we must begin to pray earnestly for his intervention. third,
              we must seek his face in protracted times of intimate fellowship
              with our heavenly father! we must get close enough so that we can
              walk with him like enoch, abraham and moses! and four,
              we must "lay aside every weight and the sin which doth
              so easily besets us" (heb.12: 1, 2),  and turn
              from every wicked way.
5. malachi
              1: 6 - 9; 3: 8 - 10
"a
              son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then i be a
              father, where is mine honour? and if i be a master, where is my
              fear? saith the lord of hosts unto you. o priests, that despise my
              name. and ye say, wherein have we despised thy name? ye offer
              polluted bread upon mine altar, and ye say, wherein have we
              polluted thee? in that ye say, the table of the lord is
              contemptible.
"and
              if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil" and if
              ye offer the lame and the blind, is it not evil? offer it now to
              thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?
              saith the lord of hosts. and now, i pray you, beseech god that he
              will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he
              regard your person saith the lord of hosts.
god
              was displeased with the priests who were indifferent to their holy
              tasks in the temple. they were only going through the motions
              instead of  reverently ministering to the lord! are we also
              guilty of only going through the motions without real conviction
              and love for our lord?
may
              god help us to give him our very best, instead of the cull, the
              left - overs in our life. he is not content to play second
              fiddle or be the fifth wheel. he wants to be number one in
              our heart and life! let us give jesus christ centre stage.
in
              verse 11 through 14, we read: "for from the rising of
              the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be
              great among the gentiles; and in every place incense  shall
              be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be
              great among the heathen, saith the lord of hosts."
what
              were they doing? they were offering animals that were blind and
              lame and sick unto the eternal god! he asks: "should i
              accept this of your hand? saith the lord. but cursed be the
              deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and
              sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing: for i am a great king,
              saith the lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the
              heathen."
a
              sin and a shame!
it
              is scandalous when you consider the very little we give to god and
              his cause in the so-called christian nations, relative
              to what we spend on cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, pornography,
              gambling and amusement. it
              is a sin and a shame! we spend more money on chewing gum in
              our respective countries than we give to almighty god. that
              has to change.
in
              chapter 3, we read: "will
              a man rob god? yet
              ye have robbed me.  but
              ye say, wherein have we robbed thee. in tithes and offerings.
              ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole
              nation.
"bring
              ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in
              mine house, and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts, if
              i will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a
              blessing, that there will not be room enough to receive it.
and
              i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not
              destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast
              her fruit before the time in the field, saith the lord of
              hosts."
upon
              the authority of god's word, i declare that you will never sorry
              if you give god his share in tithes and offerings. he is no man's
              debtor and he will prosper and bless you as he has promised. his
              word cannot fail and he will not fail you.
isaiah's
              life was changed when he had a vision of god in the temple. he
              became one of the greatest prophets of all times! he cried out: "behold,
              the lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his
              ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated
              between you and your god, and your sins have hid his face from
              you, that he will not hear." (isaiah
              59: 1,2)
here
              he gives us the key to forgiveness and peace: "seek ye
              the lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near: let
              the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts:
              and let him return unto the lord, and he will have mercy upon him;
              and to our god, for he will abundantly pardon." (isaiah
              55: 6, 7)
6.
              revelation 3: 14 - 20
"and
              unto the angel of the church of the la-od-i-ce'ans write; these
              things saith the amen, the faithful and true witness, the
              beginning of the creation of god; i know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; i
              would that thou wert cold or hot. so then because thou art
              lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, i will spue thee out of my
              mouth.
 "because
              thou sayest, i am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of
              nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable,
              and poor, and blind, and naked. i counsel thee to buy of me gold
              tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment,
              that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness
              do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou
              mayest see. as many as i love, i rebuke and chasten: be 
              zealous therefore, and repent. behold, i stand at the door and
              knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, i will
              come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."
the
              la-od-i-ce'an church had drifted  so far from the truth
              that jesus is standing on the outside seeking entrance to his own
              church. how very, very sad! he wants us to be red hot for him and
              his gospel. please make room for jesus christ in your heart and
              life today! only then, do we really begin living. in his great
              love and mercy, jesus will wash away every sin and fill our hearts
              with contentment and contagious joy!
what
              a reproach in that day, to be left on the outside, because you
              have left him on the outside of your life! he urges, "behold, i
              stand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open
              the door, i will come in to him, 
              and will sup with him and he with me.
"to
              him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne, even
              as i also overcame, ans am set down with my father in his
              throne." (revelation 3: 20,21)

              jonah 1:1-6
"arise,
              go to ninevah, that great city, and cry against it; for their
              wickedness is come up before me. but jonah rose up to flee from
              the presence of the lord; and went down to joppa; and he found a
              ship going to tarshish; so he paid the fare thereof, and went down
              into it, to go with them to tarshish from the presence of the
              lord.
but
              the lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a
              mighty tempest  in the
              sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. then the mariners
              were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the
              wares  that were in the
              ship into the sea, to lighten it of them.. but jonah was gone down
              into the sides of the ship, and he lay, and was fast asleep.
so
              the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him. what meanest thou o
              sleeper? arise, call upon thy god, if so be it that god will think
              upon us, that we perish not. and they said everyone to his fellow,
              come, and let us cast  lots,
              that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. so they
              cast lots, and the lot fell upon jonah.
then
              said they unto him, tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this
              evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou?
              what is thy country? and of what people art thou? 
              and he said unto them, i am an hebrew; and i fear the lord,
              the god of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.
then,
              were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, why hast thou
              done this? for the men knew that he had fled from the presence of
              god, because he had told them. then said they unto him, what shall
              we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us: for the sea
              wrought and was tempestuous unto them.
then
              said he, take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the
              sea be calm unto you: for i know that for my sake this great
              tempest is upon you. nevertheless, the men rowed hard to bring it
              to land.; but they could not; for the sea wrought and was
              tempestuous unto against them.
wherefore
              they cried unto the lord, and said, we beseech thee o lord, we
              beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not
              upon us innocent blood: for thou 
              o lord, hast done as it pleased thee. so they took up
              jonah, and cast him forth into the sea, and the sea ceased from
              her raging.
then
              the men feared exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the lord,
              and made vows. now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow
              up jonah. and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and
              three nights."
what
              a wake-up call jonah received from almighty god and what
              tremendous measures he takes, so that a heathen city could hear
              god's voice and be saved. it was an unusual and awesome way to
              reach that entire city for him.
when
              god became a man!
it
              pales, however, when one considers the salvation plan that jesus
              of nazareth fulfilled through his virgin birth, pure and righteous
              life, vicarious death and glorious resurrection. the sovereignty
              of god demanded  punishment
              for sin and the cross provided the final solution!
for
              a time, god overlooked or winked at our sins in his great mercy
              and kindness by allowing the sacrificing of innocent lambs, goats
              and bullocks (occasionally a red heifer) to suffice.
when
              the fullness of time had come, however, almighty god our heavenly
              father, gave himself in his son to be the propitiation for our
              sins and those of the whole world. the word propitiation means the
              covering, satisfaction and the expiation. jesus of nazareth, true
              god from eternity and true man by his virgin birth, had to die so
              that he could cover us and remove our sins to satisfy the
              righteous demands of divine justice.
while
              in the belly of the great fish, jonah repented of his rebellion
              and disobedience. god forgave him and gave him another opportunity
              to reach the wicked city of nineveh with god's message of
              repentance and judgment. praise the lord!
"and
              the lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out jonah upon the
              dry ground. and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second
              time, saying, arise, go unto nineveh that great city, and preach
              unto it the preaching that i bid thee. so jonah arose, and went
              unto nineveh, according to the word of the lord. now nineveh was
              an exceeding great city of three days journey.
so
              the people of nineveh believed god, and proclaimed a fast, and put
              on sackcloth, from the greatest one even to the least of them. for
              word came unto the king of nineveh, and he arose from his throne,
              and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and
              sat in ashes...
when
              god saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and god
              repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them,
              and he did did it not." (job 2:10; job 3:1-10)
the
              total repentance of the entire city of nineveh moved almighty god
              to change his mind about his judgment toward them. he freely
              forgave them all by extending his mercy toward them. jonah's
              change of heart in obeying god's directive after a long and hard
              lesson, brought our heavenly father's great love into focus for
              all to see and experience.
these
              are important
              lessons for us all!
there
              are a number of lessons for us to learn from this ancient
              happening: first, god loves the heathen and will use every
              possible means to rescue them. secondly, the work of a true 'man
              of god' isn't a soft touch. it may involve tough times and very
              hard work. the importance is to be obedient to the holy spirit and
              answer 'yes' when he calls!
my
              prayer is that everyone of us will be willing to carry the message
              of christ's salvation to our relatives, friends, neighbours and
              others as often as possible whenever possible to as many as
              possible, for as long as possible!
william
              booth and his wife catherine founded the salvation army in 1865. 
              they chose as their slogan, 'blood and fire', referring to jesus
              christ's blood shed for the remission of sins and the fire
              referring to the fire of the holy spirit.  he stated, "the
              tendency of fire is to go out; watch the fire on the altar of your
              heart.  anyone who has tended a fireplace, knows that it
              needs to be stirred up occasionally.
in
              1892, william booth wrote the well-known hymn, 'send the
              fire'.  it is filled with gospel truth,
              biblical doctrine and great commission admonition. 
              you can sense the presence of god by reading the words, and the
              holy spirit burns when it is sung.
there
              is no-one as unhappy as a person who has been called of god to
              preach christ's gospel, but has stifled that call. for some people
              it will be too late to answer that call, but for others the holy
              spirit may still be calling for you to do his bidding. may he help
              you to answer that call. amen.

              friend:  please write with your prayer requests.  we
              will pray for you and i will write you back!  when you write,

what must
              i do to 
 be saved?
jesus
              said, "come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
              and i will give you rest." (matthew 11:28)
yes,
              my dear friend, god is still in the business of setting men and
              women free from their sins, sorrows, heartbreaks, fears and
              troubles.  in this age of frustrations, nervous tensions and
              mental collapses, jesus christ is still granting peace to the
              troubled, joy to the discouraged, strength to the weary and
              healing to the sick!
1
              - you must admit that you are a sinner
the
              bible says, "for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of
              god". (rom. 3:23) "all we like sheep have gone astray; we have
              turned every one to his own way; and the lord hath laid on him the
              iniquity of us all." (isaiah 53:6)
2
              - you must believe that jesus christ is the son of god
you
              must believe that jesus christ is the son of god, that jesus died
              on the cross, was buried and rose again from the dead.
"that
              whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal
              life. he that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
              believeth not is condemned already." (john 3:15,18) "verily,
              verily, i say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on
              him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into
              condemnation; but is passed from death unto life." (john 5:24)
3
              - you
              must repent of your sins
the
              bible says, "except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
              perish." (lu.13:3) "let the wicked forsake his way and the
              unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the lord,
              and he will have mercy upon him; and to our god, for he will
              abundantly pardon". (isaiah 55:7)
4
              - you must receive jesus christ as your saviour
the
              bible says: "for god so loved the world, that he gave his only
              begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
              but have everlasting life". (john 3:16)
"behold,
              i stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open
              the door, i will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he
              with me." (rev. 3:20) "he that hath the son hath life: and he
              that hath not the son of god hath not life." (1 john 5:12)
5
              - you must confess jesus christ as your lord
the
              bible says: "that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord
              jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him
              from the dead, thou shalt be saved. for with the heart man
              believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is
              made unto salvation". (romans  10:9-10)
"whosoever
              shall confess me before men, him shall the son of man confess
              before the angels of god: but he that denieth me before men shall
              be denied before the angels of god." (luke 12:8, 9)

how
              do i invite 
 jesus christ into my life?
pray
              to god, a prayer - from your heart.  
tell him that you
              are a sinner and that you need forgiveness.  tell him that
              you believe jesus christ died for your sins.  tell him that
              you are willing to change, to turn away from sin.  ask jesus
              christ to come into your heart and life and be your personal
              saviour.
"but
              as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
              of god, even to them that believe on his name." (john 1:12)
"therefore
              if any man be in christ, he is a new creature: old things are
              passed away; behold, all things are become new." (2
              corinthians 5:17)
if
              you prayed and ask jesus christ into your heart - you have now
              received the gift of salvation - you have become a child of god. 
              god bless you.

bible
              scriptures on:
satan,

revelation
              20:1-3 - (kjv)
              - "behold,
              i give unto you power over all the power of the enemy, and nothing
              shall by any means hurt you." 
              the scripture says that 'one day' an angel will come from heaven
              and bind satan, casting him into the bottomless pit for a thousand
              years.  it won't take ten thousand angels; it won't take a

              the power of his might.  put
              on the whole armour of god, that ye may be able to stand against
              the wiles of the devil.  for
              we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
              principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness
              of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
"wherefore
              take unto you the whole armour of god, that ye may be able to
              withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
              stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and
              having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod
              with the preparation of the gospel of peace;"
"above
              all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
              quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  and take the
              helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is he word
              of god;  praying always with al prayer and supplication in
              the spirit, and watching
              thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
              saints."
