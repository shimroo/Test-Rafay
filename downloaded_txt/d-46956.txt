“the purchase of our new home in the ponds at bayberry was a positive experience, from beginning to end. we love our open floor plan—over 50 percent of dedicated open space—and are looking forward to utilizing our community clubhouse with all its amenities.”
 

“the minute we drove [through bayberry], our two young boys’ eyes lit up. we went through the model and immediately knew we could make this our home. brittany made the process seamless. now … our boys get to play outside with their friends, ride bikes and enjoy being kids. we are happy to call bayberry […]”
 

“who [knew] there is a difference between a round and square drawer knob, because one will drive you nuts if it spins? brittany did. and she shared her thoughts when we were choosing all of the details for our future [bayberry] home.”
 

“the professionalism of the sales staff was amazing. they recognized that i was spending my hard-earned money and… wanted to make sure that i was satisfied. i am truly overwhelmed by the quality of the construction, and would highly recommend blenheim to anyone in the market for a new home.”
