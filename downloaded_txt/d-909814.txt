longing for patterns that fit your body right out of the envelope?seeking guidance and sewing help when you need it? hi! i'm christine jonson and i’ll be there when you need me! i personally design, draft and engineer all my patterns by hand. working with real women as models. all my patterns are designed for real bodies and provide an excellent fit for all ages, and figures. my basic tools are a pencil, paper, scissors, tape, and 40 years of experience. this is how the magic begins!



my ready-to-wear collection of clothing patterns are a mix of classic and contemporary. and don't worry, my patterns won't leave you scratching your head in frustration. every pattern i create is simple to sew with minimal pieces. these patterns are sure to become favorites that you will sew again and again.
