light weight tear drop camp trailers
from a traditional teardrop trailer to something a bit different. 
a custom designed trailer for you or your business. you design the teardrop 
trailer of your dreams and we build it. whether you are looking for a shell 
of a teardrop, a bare bones version or a completely decked out luxury cabin  
cu campers can do it. we use only the finest materials and craftsmanship to 
custom create our light weight camp trailers. often under 700 pounds with a 
tongue weight under 100 pounds these lightweight trailers can be towed by almost 
any car on the market including most compacts.
custom teardrop trailers made for you. we even have teardrop 
trailer parts if you decide to build it yourself. what better to pull behind 
your custom classic car than a custom trailer built just for you. whether you 
want to buy just a teardrop shell or you want us to completely build the trailer 
for you, cu campers specializes in lightweight camper trailer manufacturing. our 
rear kitchens have pull out shelves for your storage needs including high 
capacity slides so you can even pullout your fully loaded cooler
we hope 
to see you camping
