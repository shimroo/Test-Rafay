welcome to koehler & dramm
for over 60 years, we've been the nation's premier provider of high quality fresh cuts, arrangements, bouquets, plants, and hard goods to retail florists just like you. local orders are delivered the same day, and we cover a 6-state delivery area (minnesota, wisconsin, iowa, the dakotas, and nebraska) with frequent out-of-state runs to deliver your product as soon and as safely as possible. our ordering process makes it easy to shop every department, get what you need quickly and easily, and pay only one delivery fee, all while speaking to one of our friendly and knowledgeable sales representatives, not an automated phone system. we're open seven days a week for your convenience, and we do not sell to the general public; instead, we support your local economy by directing end consumers to purchase from you, the retail florist.
