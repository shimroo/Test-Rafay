cruising



a "hover-in" or cruise is an informal gathering of hovercraft enthusiasts. there may or may not be planned activities or meals. there may also be courtesy safety inspections. just show up and have fun with your hovercraft! if you don't have a craft, just show up and learn about hovercraft in a casual atmosphere. spectators are always free to visit any of our events. hoverally is the club’s official annual event and is the largest gathering of the year. check out our events page to find an event near you.

racing



the only officially sanctioned ambitious racing in the world, hovercraft races are run on a land/water track which typically includes a mix of tight turns and fast straight sections. with eight different classes ranging from junior level to unlimited f1 class, it is an action-packed racing event for participants and spectators of all ages. the hoverclub of america and the world hovercraft federation have had a long history of safe racing events. for more information, check out our racing page.
