            jim justice says he turned west virginia's budget from cow dung to gold. gov. morrisey disagrees


feb 12, 2025


when he ended his term as governor to head to the u.s. senate, jim justice assured west virginians he was leaving the state in glowing financial condition. new gov. patrick morrisey announced a week into his first term that he had “inherited” from the justice administration a projected $400 million budget deficit for the fiscal year starting in july. contradicting justice, he said the former governor didn’t find the money to pay for his record $1 billion-a-year cuts to the personal income tax. justice has dismissed the concerns as “crazy talk," saying the state has $400 million in a special fund to help make up for any shortfalls.
