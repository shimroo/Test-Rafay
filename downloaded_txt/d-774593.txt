english language news channel to be launched 





an english-language news channel will be launched in morocco, where the public channel al aoula within the national radio and television company (snrt) is working on the project, revealed mohamed mehdi bensaïd, minister of youth, culture and communication. during a parliamentary session, the official reacted regarding the language policy in the country , indicating that this decision follows a growing interest in english as an international language. in this context, moroccan public channels are indeed called upon to adopt english and spanish, in addition to french as a foreign language.the channel's project includes coverage of national and international events taking place in morocco and beyond. in this regard, minister bensaïd underlined that the introduction of the dissemination of information in spanish in morocco, almost 34 years ago, had contributed significantly to the country's appeal to spanish-speaking tourists. by extending this practice to english-speakers, the country should experience additional growing interest from a wider international audience, he said.the announcement comes as last year a study commissioned by the british council found that 40% of young people in morocco considered english the most important foreign language to learn, compared to only 10% for french.interestingly algeria is also moving to english but in less than diplomatic language! algeria takes 'french is a waste of time' to heart with a shift towards englishshare this!

water under the bridge?





a lot has happened since we last posted a story. some things are quite strange, while others are what we expected. the expat numbers in the fez medina have shrunk with the "old guard" diminished and the new arrivals, from a younger generation, learning for themselves how to navigate the cultural and bureaucratic landscape.
the most talked about subject at the moment is the conflicting stories that surround the future of the fez festival of sacred music. the most trusted narrative is that it will not take place in 2023. meanwhile a search of the web shows many travel and tourist companies are promoting the festival, but without any date or run down on possible performers. if you believe one site, the festival is to be part of a festival in casablanca! 

there is a certain nostalgic longing for a return to the era when faouzi skali ran the festival and the important focus was on promoting tolerance and understanding between peoples of different faiths. yes, there was a welcome injection of money into the local economy, but music was the most important factor. some people think that the primary motivation of subsequent festivals has been financial. if true it means, sadly, that the original vision for the festival has gone.hopefully, the future of the sufi festival remains untouched by any background problems.  
in happier news, australian artist bryan dawe has been showing his latest body of work in tangier. you can listen to the latest interview with bryan, here

new review of dead north!





sandy mccutcheon has been absent from the australian thriller scene for several years now, while he has been pursuing other interests in morocco, but in the late 1990s and early 2000s he wrote some exceptionally good, and slightly quirky, spy thrillers.


dead north (beacon books) is his first thriller in some years and is an impressive spy story that moved confidently between britain and finland, with a clever and very up to date plot that took a persistent british police detective inspector into the wilds of finland. facing opposition from mi6 and the cia, she teams up with a finnish intelligence officer to put a stop to a fiendishly dangerous plot.

peopled with a rich cast of characters, it grabbed attention from the opening pages and held it all the way to the exciting conclusion. fast paced, original and very evocative it was a really good contemporary spy thriller.

unfortunately, it received little publicity, or even promotion, by its publisher and hardly made a splash on the thriller scene. it wasn’t released locally in australia, but is available on amazon and is well worth seeking out. highly recommended.

a fire erupted yesterday in the ceilings of the shops located in the rcif vegetables marketeyewitness on the scene said that the fire consumed a number  of shops and their equipment. the expensive wooden decorations that furnish the market space contributed to the fires’ swelling to spread on a large scale.the  market, which had just been repaired, suffered significant material damage  as a result of the fire.according to the same source, fez's authorities and civil protection agency dispatched first respondents and firefighters to extinguish the blaze.civil protection teams are working to keep the fire from spreading to other parts of the market and from affecting the nearby bab al-awwad market's shops.the fire's primary cause is still unknown. local authorities launched an investigation into the cause of the fire.bab rcif is one of the historical monuments in the old medina of fez.  located in a key location in the city, the centuries-old gate represents a fundamental element in fez's history and architecture.share this!
