rebecca spears, parent, summit academy transition high school - columbus







	“

summit academy has literally been a life changer for collan and our family …when we found summit right before his freshman year, we found an environment of acceptance and accommodation, along with sincerity and love from the teachers and staff.  collan not only improved … he soared, experienced success, and came out at the top as salutatorian. he also gained true friendships … we are eternally grateful for our time with summit, which completely changed the trajectory for collan's future.

	“

this school has truly been god sent! this school/staff has helped my son find his love and passion for learning and going to school again. he’s excited to see his classmates and to go into school because he doesn’t have to worry about being picked on or bullied. he knows that he’s cared for and that his feelings matter ...  now i can’t keep him away from school. he’s even asked me to call on the weekend.  thank you, summit academy, for being our well-kept secret and always having a heart for the little people.
