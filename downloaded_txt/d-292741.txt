a 
picture is worth 15 million words


by jonny cline, executive director, 
4.09.2015







the syrian civil war has been raging since 2011, as has the libyan. since then 
isis has been beheading and displacing people, especially christians and 
yazidis, across northern iraq and its surroundings. more recently, civil war in 
yemen has created a similarly disturbing impact. 


nearly 15,000,000 children  not people, there are many millions more people, 
just the number of children reaches 15 million  are moving around the world, 
having no home left of their own, to try and find a place to pitch their tent, 
literally 
in many cases. 

15 
million 
children, and yet nothing made me stop in my tracks, made my stomach churn, like 
the picture i saw yesterday. 


that picture, of a small child in a red t-shirt, he could not have been more 
than 4 or 5 judging by his size, washed up, dead, on the beach. 


i 
see pictures, numbers, infographics, reports, every single day  that is my job 
 but nothing has hit me like this. 


my first reaction was to call the editor, share with him my view that this 
picture is just too harsh, and to demand that it is removed. my second reaction 
was to realise just how shocking the reality is that leads to children, just 
babies, living in such desperation, that having their lifeless body washed up on 
the beach is a risk worth taking over the reality into which they were born. my 
third thought was that now, finally, enough people must be moved, to care, to 
do, something. 


i feel guilty  not that my reality is that in which i take my own children each 
morning from our comfortable home, with plenty of food in their bellies and 
bags, to their schools and playgrounds, whilst i go off into the city to work 
then return home  but that i 
manage 
to live that life, day-to-day, without stopping to care enough about those who 
have never lived in such a reality, but are 

willing to die trying. 


in 1946 unicef was founded as tens of millions of refugees were looking for a 
place to be in post-war europe. yesterday i was sent a picture of 210 jewish 
orphans in greece who were helped by unicef to come to pre-state israel for 
adoption  i also saw picture of war orphans who are sitting in parks and train 
stations in macedonia today, not knowing when or where they will be allowed to 
end their past and perhaps to begin their future. 


stalin is quoted as saying, one death is a tragedy, one million deaths is a 
statistic. 


fifteen million children is a statistic, an overwhelming one, but that one death 
that i saw yesterday is a tragedy that i cannot stand by and let pass me by. 


i am lucky enough to be working for an organisation that is in the field, in 
macedonia just as we are in zaatari, saving the lives and the futures of those 
that survive the journey. 



you can help too.
