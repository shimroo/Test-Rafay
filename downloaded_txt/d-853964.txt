land acknowledgement
“this public acknowledgment serves to honor and respect indigenous peoples and their land on which our campus resides. uc san diego was built upon the territory of the kumeyaay nation. from time immemorial, the kumeyaay people have been a part of this land. today, the kumeyaay people continue to maintain their political sovereignty and cultural traditions as vital members of the san diego community.”

minors hosted by erc 






human rights and migration minor
the purpose of the human rights and migration minor is to encourage students to treat human rights and migration as both intellectual and practical questions. students address critical questions: what sorts of rights do citizens, migrants, and refugees deserve? where do rights come from—from political communities like the nation-state or from universal understandings of humanity? who counts as a human deserving of rights? how are human rights different from citizenship rights? this program helps to prepare students for a career in research and teaching, public policy, working in ngos that advocate for and monitor human rights compliance, immigrant service-providing organizations, government agencies, or law. the unique research and writing opportunities offered by this minor also make it an excellent preparation for graduate school. the mexican migration field research program and aip 197 are options for track b of the minor.

about the minor







erc special minor
the erc special minor is intended to allow erc students with a particular interest in one geographic region to gain a familiarity with a language and academic topics relevant to the region. this minor overlaps with the regional specialization general education requirement at erc. 

about the minor







south asian studies minor
the south asian studies minor is an interdisciplinary minor that incorporates courses from various departments that center around the cultural, economic, and political processes occurring in and out of south asia. by approaching this region—which includes the countries of afghanistan, bangladesh, bhutan, india, maldives, nepal, pakistan, and sri lanka—from diverse perspectives, the south asian studies minor allows students to integrate a regional specialization into their program of study. the purpose of this minor is to understand the interconnectedness of the world and the position of south asia in multiple nodes of connection. although it is administered by eleanor roosevelt college, it is available to all uc san diego undergraduate students considering careers related to south asia or those with a general interest in south asia. students should consult an academic adviser at their college to determine how the south asian studies minor can best meet their college graduation requirements. minor declarations must be made online using the tritonlink major and minor application. a number of extracurricular events and programs are also available to students interested in south asia.
