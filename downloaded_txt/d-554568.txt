playin’ with crayons for 38 years . . .











welcome


38 years ago a love of signmaking and an aptitude for pinstriping came together – and autographics was born. and while the early days weren’t computer driven, we realized, way back then, that our energy, creativity, fairness and true passion for our craft was what was bringing customers to our door – as well as what was bringing them back!


times changed, and we have been able to implement computer technology and automation into our work, opening up infinite possibilities. but our core values have never changed. we’re still dynamic, creative, fair… and passionate about the work we do.
