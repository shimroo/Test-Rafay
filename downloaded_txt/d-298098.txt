about us
hopkins youth hockey association (hyha) was founded in 1977 to promote the growth and development of players in an environment that maximizes player participation and skill development, while emphasizing the value of sportsmanship and teamwork.  with the same objectives and in cooperation with st louis park youth hockey, hyha formed the hopkins-park (hp) girls hockey program for girls 6u - 15u.
