federal executive boards 
the federal executive boards (febs) are the cornerstone of federal presence across the united states of america and its territories. currently organized into 26 boards, spanning across four regions, and with plans for expansion, febs form a bridge between washington dc and local communities. focused on streamlining government functions, the febs support the majority of federal employees—over 85%—who live and work beyond the nation's capital.








our regions
the federal executive boards (febs) are divided into four distinct regions, central, eastern, southern, and western, covering the united states. each serving as a strategic hub, linking federal agencies to one another and to communities, supporting federal initiatives and collaboration. each region is positioned to address the specific challenges and opportunities within its geographic area, ensuring that the febs' collaborative efforts are both effective and responsive to the needs of the federal workforce and local communities. each board within the regions is led by and comprised of the highest-ranking officials in that geographical area.
