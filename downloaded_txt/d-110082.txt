from al.com: parrot heads, rejoice! mobile planning jimmy buffett-themed museum experiencelong before jimmy buffett strummed a guitar, his family’s story was intertwined with mobile bay.now, decades later, those roots are drifting back home. the national maritime museum of the gulf of mexico, docked on the mobile river, is developing an immersive, 5,000-square-foot exhibit celebrating buffett’s seafaring heritage and legendary island sound. slated to open in september 2026, the exhibit will bring buffett’s story full circle, back to the waters where his grandfather once sailed and where his parents built a life on the waterfront.www.buffettnews.com/2025/02/05/32487/

from buzzfeed: jimmy buffett's tweet about renaming the gulf of mexico is going viraldonald trump has gone all-in on renaming the gulf of mexico to the "gulf of america."google has already said it would comply with the president's executive order and label its maps "gulf of america."and now, a certain person has chimed in.yes, jimmy buffett post-humously went on x and said it should be renamed "gulf of margaritaville."has a good ring to it don't you think? www.buffettnews.com/2025/02/03/32483/

from garden & gun: remembering the gentle giant who kept jimmy buffett safe (by chris dixon)equal parts bodyguard and friend, charleston miles became an irreplaceable member of the late singer’s inner circleon january 14, surrounded by friends, family, and the carolinas medical center staff who came to love him, the man who protected jimmy buffett for three-plus decades was taken by cancer at age sixty-six. charleston miles had a booming voice (one that was pretty soulful when buffett called on him to sing), a basso profundo laugh, and a smile wider than his last name. miles mostly operated backstage or at stage right, but the six-foot-nine north carolinian was an outsize and remarkable presence in the life of a southern bard whose fame and resulting safety needs grew as the decades rolled on.www.buffettnews.com/2025/01/25/32479/

from american songwriter: mac mcanally reflects on his journey and his bond with jimmy buffettfor singer, songwriter, and longtime member of jimmy buffett’s coral reefer band, mac mcanally, life is a symphony. “i hear music in everything,” he shares with american songwriter. “i hear melody in nature. it’s always sounded like music to me.” mcanally co-wrote several songs with buffett, including “oysters and pearls,” the closing track to buffett’s 1999 album, beach house on the moon, which mcanally released a cover of in april 2024.the song has taken on new meaning in the wake of buffett’s passing from cancer with such lyrics as, it’s something more than dna that tells us who we are / it’s method and it’s magic, we are of the stars. “he had a more celebratory aspect to  and he didn’t mind starting blank or with just a line. i saw a whole other world of how it was possible from how he went about it and learned so much from him,” mcanally says of his friend. “he was fearless about everything all his life. jimmy had that love for life. to get to stand to the right of that one-man nebula of talent and positive energy for almost four decades was one of the big blessings of my life.”
