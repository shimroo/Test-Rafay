sins of the temple, an investigative report



originally published by phoenix new times in december, 1994
the report reproduced here, by lisa davis, is a well-researched analysis of abuses that occur within the mainstream morman church. although the descriptions of abuse it contains are hard to read, they serve to illustrate how the patriarchal structure of a church that holds itself aloof from outside influence sets up women and children for abuse, denies that there is a problem, and then forgives and protects the abusers. the points raised are as valid today as they were in 1994.  -cpp
