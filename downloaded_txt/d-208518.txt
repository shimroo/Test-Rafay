welcome 





we offer the ultimate camping experience at the grand canyon north rim. we’re the only north rim campground with full rv hookups, and we accommodate big rigs over 40 feet.  we also have individual and group tent sites.
it’s quiet and secluded here, off the beaten path. the canyon rim is only 45 miles away on the beautiful north rim parkway.
our campground is nestled in tall pines, surrounded by the kaibab national forest, next to a beautiful meadow and jacob lake (no swimming or fishing allowed).
the area has great hiking, nature trails, and horseback riding.
