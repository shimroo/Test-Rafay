amga spi course and exam and preparation courses
the single pitch instructor (spi) program teaches climbing instructors to proficiently facilitate and instruct the sport of rock climbing in a single pitch setting. the spi is the only internationally recognized single pitch climbing instructor certification program in the united states. it was developed to fit in the amga rock program.
benefits:

it significantly improves the instructor’s skill sets and integrates into the next level of training, the amga rock instructor course.
the program is for current, active rock climbers who have a real desire to teach rock climbing to novices in a single pitch setting.
the spi course is a 27-hour training course that normally runs as three consecutive nine-hour days or day classes with evening sessions.
the spi assessment is a minimum of 16 hours run over a two-day period.
our spi private review and exam preparation (spi-prep) days are a great way to prepare for the spi course or exam.  instruction is customized to your needs and is often used to assess your skill-set and improve weak areas.
certification lasts for three years as long as the candidate keeps current amga membership and first aid certification.
