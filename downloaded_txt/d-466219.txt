maximizing impact by co-investing in regional community wealth building
ubri recently led the development of the regional revitalization partnership (rrp), a $300 million comprehensive, community-driven economic development strategy that takes a public-private investment approach that will maximize impact and leverage additional investment.
this strategy, first implemented in buffalo, niagara falls, and rochester, will serve as a pilot program that could be rolled out to the rest of new york state and has the potential to become an innovative national model for community and economic revitalization.
