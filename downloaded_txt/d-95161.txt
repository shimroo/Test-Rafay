visible, load bearing posts and beams define the open interior.
you will love living inside a strong, solid timber frame home built to last for generations.
take a look at some of our past projects in our portfolio. you’ll find full timber frames, partial or hybrid timber frames, timber frame additions and outdoor structures.
if you just want a touch of timber, consider adding a few posts and beams to your existing house.
as well as houses, we build timber frame cottages, churches, barns, studios and other buildings.
we will raise your timber frame in nova scotia, new brunswick, prince edward island, newfoundland & labrador, or elsewhere in canada. we can ship a frame anywhere.
