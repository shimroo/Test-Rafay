11  all pop art is hot!


reason 1
designs
photo wow offers forty unique, beautiful, fun and colorful designs from your photos. from warhol-style pop art, to comic designs, to a multitude of collage choices, photo wow can create anything you can imagine, including photo canvas. and if you don't see it, choose the last design in our "shop" section, the "custom design" to describe your own photo into art idea and the photo wow artists will create that photo design for you.


reason 2
quality
hire ten designers to create your photo art or photos on canvas, and you could receive ten very different artistic looks. most of our designers have been with photo wow for over five years turning thousands of photos into great pieces of art and pop art. all of these photo art and pop art designs are custom-created in house in our la art studio. every photo wow designer has had years of experience studying classical to pop art designs.


reason 3
proofs
photo wow wants you to be the art director! during the checkout process, you will see a page that allows you to customize your photo art piece by answering questions specific to the design you will choose. then, within three working days, you will receive a proof of the photo art design for your approval or requested changes. there is no additional charge for changes to your photo art design.


reason 4
speed
photo wow can have your photo art piece to you in as fast as three days. just click on the "click here for tax and shipping" link in the "shop" section, and you can see all of the shipping options. for normal delivery, we place a cushion of time in. however, the way our process works is normally within five working days of your approval of your photo wow art piece, it will be sitting on your doorstep. we're fast!


reason 5
value
in our twelve years of turning photos into art and pop art, we have yet to raise our prices. every piece of photo wow photo art and photo canvas placed on a wall is an advertisement for us. so, we not only make sure each art piece looks great, but we keep our pricing very reasonable to have as many photo art and photos on canvas advertisements as possible. that's why you can fill up your wall with a big 42" x 42" piece of photo art for less than $500!


reason 6
protection
photo wow protects all of the photos on canvas with a unique process that allows the art pieces to get wet without any damage. each photo canvas piece also has enough uv protection for the art piece to last a lifetime under normal conditions with no signs of fading. our twelve years in the photo canvas art business has taught us these unique processes rarely performed by other photo art companies.


reason 7
customer service
we pride ourselves on our customer service. the best form of advertisement is word of mouth. that's why we will bend over backwards to assist you in creating the perfect art piece and photos on canvas from your favorite photo or photos in the hopes you will assist us in spreading the photo wow word. please take a minute to read some of our testimonials we've been so fortunate to receive on a regular basis.


reason 8
retail store
according to our research, photo wow has not only been in business longer than any other digital photo art business, it is also the only photo art business that has a location that you can visit to view all the artistic designs, and meet and work directly with the designers. on the billing and shipping page, you can click to pick up your photo art piece at our los angeles location. free parking in back! 


reason 9
satisfaction
we know it can be scary to buy art that hasn't already been created - especially on-line. that’s why we don't charge the print, frame or product portion until we design your photo art to exactly as you want it. that gives us extra incentive to create that one-of-a-kind unique photo art or pop art design for you or as photo gifts. we promise to keep working with you until we get it as you envisioned - from your proof to your doorstep.


reason 10
perfect gift
there is nothing more unique and personalized than photo gifts you can give to a friend (or yourself) than a photowow piece of photo art or pop art. it is the perfect gift that can be cherished and enjoyed for a lifetime. and if you don't have your friend's photo, you can easily order a photo wow gift certificate. after you order it, you will see directions on how to easily print it so you can give photo gifts to the recipient immediately.


reason 11
all pop art is hot!
from the first day we opened in our small los angeles pop art retail studio, we had all the top hollywood celebrities wanting to pop art themselves a la andy warhol and roy lichtenstein. all were created large, fun and the more pop in all this art, the better! andy warhol may have left us, but now all these top celebrities had the chance to see what they may have looked like if they were "pop"ed by the greatest. see "our clients".
