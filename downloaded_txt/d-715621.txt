land acknowledgementdetroit roller derby acknowledges that we stand on the lands of the traditional territory of the anishinaabe, the “three fires” people, including the odawa, ojibwe, and bodewadmi. we make this acknowledgment to honor the legacy of those who have been stewards to this land since time immemorial. in honor and celebration of the present, past, and future descendants of these indigenous people, we acknowledge that the original name of this region is waawiyatanong. prior to european colonization, waawiyatanong was a rich and nurturing landscape that served as a meeting place for many great lakes’ indigenous peoples. the process of change that led to our current landscape has been unkind to the history and culture of indigenous people. it is our responsibility to learn about this history, to seek to understand its impact on communities of indigenous people, and to engage in practices that foster the preservation of the language, culture, and land of the anishinaabe. we encourage our community to learn more about the anishinaabe at: https://www.anishinabek.ca/
