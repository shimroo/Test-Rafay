the nude benefits of being bare in the air.





the nude benefits of being bare in the air.naked passengers on the flight cause no harmsword-bearing ones doremember the ruckus a few years ago when akali dal politician simranjit singh mann insisted on carrying his kirpan to parliament? things have come a long way since then, as the indian government has decided to allow sikh passengers to carry kirpans on board domestic flights—as long as they less than 9 inches long. this, in an age where half-inch nail clippers are confiscated at the security gate. the rational fool condemns the succumbing to the tyranny of minorities, and asks where it will all end.what if muslim women should demand the right to wear a burqua in photo id’s? less risky to sensitive installations, but more risky to the sensibilities of the clothed majority, what if the digambara jains were to demand the right to travel in the nude?

would flying nude foil the terrorists





the transportation security administration, eager to fit everyone with an ever-tighter security belt, promises to ease the hassle at the airports.    the agency wants to eliminate the ban on razor blades and small knives and restrict intimate pat-downs. some airport pat-down agents could teach honeymooners about up close and personal. federal judges, congressmen, cabinet ministers and governors -- just the people the rest of us are suspicious of -- would get aboard without a search.    inspectors will continue to harass innocent passengers to avoid inconveniencing actual terrorism prospects. the bush administration won't use profiling because it doesn't want to hurt the feelings of the fanatics who are determined to kill the rest of us. government officials who ride to the airport in motorcades behind security agents armed with enough artillery to stop a panzer division will continue not to be inconvenienced, of course.    this is infuriating, but one version of a multiple-choice questionnaire circulating on the internet demonstrates just how difficult it is to find a common characteristic among terrorists. the next terrorist will no doubt be named mohammed, but he might be your mother, your pastor or even the little girl from down the street peddling girl scout cookies.    the questionnaire reveals the government's dilemma:     1. in 1968, robert f. kennedy was assassinated in los angeles by (a) superman, (b) jay leno, (c) harry potter, or (d) a muslim man between 17 and 40 years old.    2. in 1972, 11 israeli athletes were kidnapped and killed at the munich olympics by (a) olga corbett, (b) sitting bull, (c) arnold schwarzenegger, or (d) muslims between 17 and 40.    3. in 1979, the u.s. embassy in tehran was taken over and 90 americans were held for 444 days by (a) sen. strom thurmond, (b) elvis, (c) a tour group of minnesota grandmothers, or (d) muslims between 17 and 40.    4. during the 1980s, several americans were kidnapped in beirut by (a) john dillinger, (b) the king of sweden, (c) the pope and a gang of cardinals, or (d) muslims between 17 and 40.    5. in 1983, the u.s. marine barracks in lebanon was blown up, killing 220 marines, by (a) a domino's pizza delivery man, (b) the president of the southern baptist convention, (c) catherine zeta-jones, or (d) muslims between 17 and 40.    6. in 1985, the cruise ship achille lauro was hijacked and a 70-year-old american passenger thrown overboard in his wheelchair by (a) davy jones, (b) brooks robinson, (c) the little mermaid, or (d) muslims between 17 and 40.    7. in 1985, twa flight 847 was hijacked at athens and a u.s. navy diver trying to rescue passengers was murdered by (a) captain kangaroo, (b) william jennings bryan, (c) mother teresa, or (d) muslims between 17 and 40.

beneath his overcoat, he is wearing a bomb





the young man boards the bus as it leaves the terminal. he wears an overcoat. beneath his overcoat, he is wearing a bomb. his pockets are filled with nails,ball bearings,and rat poison. the bus is crowded and headed for the heart of the city. the young man takes his seat beside a middle-aged couple.he will wait for the bus to reach its next stop.the couple at his side appears to be shopping for a new refrigerator.the woman has decided on a model, but her husband worries that it will be too expensive. he indicates another one in a brochure that lies open on her lap. the next stop comes into view.the bus doors swing.the woman observes that the model her husband has selected will not fit in the space underneath their cabinets. new passengers have taken the last remaining seats and begun gathering in the aisle. the bus is now full. the young man smiles.with the press of a button he destroys himself,the couple at his side,and twenty others on the bus.the nails,ball bearings, and rat poison ensure further casualties on the street and in the surrounding cars.all has gone according to plan. the young man’s parents soon learn of his fate. although saddened to have lost a son, they feel tremendous pride at his accomplishment.they know that he has gone to heaven and prepared the way for them to follow.he has also sent his victims to hell for eternity.it is a double victory.the neighbors find the event a great cause for celebration and honor the young man’s parents by giving them gifts of food and money. these are the facts. this is all we know for certain about the young man. is there anything else that we can infer about him on the basis of his behavior? was he popular in school? was he rich  or was he poor? was he of low or high intelligence? his actions  leave no clue at all. did he have a college education? did he have  a bright future as a mechanical engineer? his behavior is simply mute on questions of this sort, and hundreds like them.1why is it so easy,then,so trivially easy—you-could-almost-bet-your-life-onit easy—to guess the young man’s religion? a beliefis a lever that, once pulled, moves almost everything else in a person’s life.are you a scientist? a liberal? a racist? these are merely species of belief in action.your beliefs define your vision of the world; they dictate your behavior; they determine your emotional responses to other human beings. if you doubt this, consider how your experience would suddenly change if you came to believe one of the following propositions: 1.you have only two weeks to live 2.you wake up to different ethnic beliefs or religion 3.you’ve just won a lottery prize of one hundred million dollars.

where every seat is a cockpit





 we love to fly in chilly cabins -- and it shows!    header.jpg   originally uploaded by banamine. requiring airline passengers to travel naked would make flights safer because no nutbar asshole religious fundamentalist of any types would be caught dead flying nude..?the murderous quartet has so far claimed 53 lives in what became the biggest terrorist attack on british soil.london, england (cnn) -- a string of bombs that ripped through three london underground trains went off within seconds, authorities said, adding that the blasts were so strong none of the victims have been identified.technical data and witness accounts suggest the bombs contained synchronized timing devices and were probably not triggered by suicide bombers, deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick told reporters saturday."a slightly different picture is emerging around the timing of these bomb incidents," paddick said, revising original accounts that the train blasts occurred over a 26-minute span thursday morning.

nude terror or world peace





there's a case to be made for it, in this era of security fears. if passengers and crew got naked when they stepped on a plane, we wouldn't ever have to worry about armed hijackers.i don't seem to be alone in thinking about nude flights. a couple of episodes in the past two weeks have called new attention to nudity on planes — and, in my opinion, the possible benefits of being bare in the air. /

naked lara flynn boyle terrorizes airline passengers





    nude_on_motorbike   originally uploaded by banamine. the always-reliable british tabloids are reporting that a nude, pill-popping lara flynn boyle recently terrorized fellow passengers on a flight from l.a. to london, roaming the first-class cabin halfway through the trip, waking a man, and trying to get into bed with him as she told him to prepare for landing. as much as we would love to believe these tales of airborne, drug-addled celebrity antics, there is usually a logical explanation. in this case, the accosted man was not ready to get nude.

qantas crew stabbed in mid-air incident





    qantas crew stabbed in mid-air incident   originally uploaded by banamine.  a man armed with sharpened wooden stakes stabbed two attendants on a qantas flight from melbourne to launceston this afternoon raising security concerns on flying more nude domestic flights.it's believed the man was trying to enter the cockpit shortly after the boeing 717 took off from tullamarine airport when passengers and crew tried to subdue him.the man slashed two flight attendants in the scuffle and a passenger was also hurt.transport minister john anderson said later that had the man been nude .we could have prevented this near disasterauthorities say the attack appears to have been premeditated but they don't believe it's linked to terrorism. the two qantas staff suffered lacerations to the face and head.they'd been working on flight 1737 from melbourne to launceston in northern tasmania when a passenger tried to enter the cockpit, apparently threatening to crash the plane.he was armed with two 15cm sharpened wooden stakes.and you see him as a hero?passenger's: oh, very much so.the flight attendants were stabbed with the wooden implements, one in the back of the neck, the other suffered cuts to the face.passenger: there were some very brave people on that flight.they saved our lives full stop.passenger: it took about six or seven of us, for the size of the man that was there. was it over in a few seconds? passenger: yes, it seemed like a second, actually. passengers were also injured when they stepped in to help restrain the man in his 40s, who had been sitting in the seventh row. australian federal police: we believe he was trying to take over the plane.that's all i can say at this stage. the plane turned back to melbourne immediately after the incident -- where staff and passengers are now being counselled.the injured flight attendants -- a 38-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman -- are now in a serious but stable condition in the royal melbourne hospital.two passengers were treated at the scene.this particular aircraft did not have enhanced security doors but it did have a lock. ..but is refusing to rule out that this was an attempted hijacking. i think i'll leave that to the authorities, but obviously it's a very, very serious incident for us. the federal government says it will wait for further details before reviewing more about implementing more pressure on nude air security. transport minister: although it looks as though it was premeditated, it doesn't appear to have been an act of terrorism. a man in his 40s fully clothed is in police custody tonight.police say charges will be laid.

fantastic way to enjoy yourself





    fantastic way to enjoy yourself   originally uploaded by banamine. being naked is easy - you do it in the bathroom every time you shower. all you have to do is take off your outer garments, closely followed by your undergarments, and you're there. being naked with that special other is also quite easy (and often, quite appropriate). it is accomplished in much the same method as showering, except it usually takes place in the bedroom (or on the kitchen table, or even an aeroplane toilet, if you're adventurous). but taking your clothes off in front of a dozen strangers.now there's the trick. you see, this fantastically advanced society we live in says that it is shameful to remove our clothing in front of anyone who is not your spouse, your doctor or your masseuse.

free willy





    naked-air-006   originally uploaded by banamine.  the single most annoying thing about taking a plane to a resort? it's not the security hassles. not the packed coaches and late flights. it's the clothes.you know the feeling: you're sitting in the middle of a row, knees banging into the seat in front of you, a fat guy smashing his elbow into your arm -- and the one thing you're thinking is "christ, i wish we were all naked."at least you do if you're a client of castaways travel in spring, which has carved out a niche in the tourist industry by chartering nude flights to clothing-optional resorts. once the plane hits cruising altitude, the clothes come off.donna daniels, co-founder of the agency, says her clients include "fbi agents, cia agents, school superintendents, fire chiefs, police chiefs, your lawyers, your doctors, political people, djs." (what are djs doing on that list? and does a cia agent really give his job description when he's booking a nude flight?)the first flight was in 2003, to mexico. most of the travelers are in their fifties, and many are new to the experience. daniels counsels the males to wrap themselves in a towel if they get too thrilled with their surroundings."for the guys who have never experienced public nudity -- and guys are very visual -- the idea of a woody is very possible," daniels says. "you know, okay, so the first time you see a bunch of nude ladies, you're like, 'holy cow!' but you know what? after a day or two, no biggie."no biggie indeed. another question daniels gets all the time: is she nude when she's working in the office? no."there is an etiquette about doing business, where you have the fedex guy coming in and the postal service guy," she says. "but i can tell you, when we're working our hearts out at home, we're stark naked."so remember: the next time you're crammed into a southwest airlines flight, and you take a look around at your fellow well-fed americans and wish everyone were nude, call castaways travel in spring to make all your dreams come true.

getting naked in the air





    naked-air-022   originally uploaded by banamine. is flying better in the buff?there's a case to be made for it, in this era of security fears. if passengers and crew got naked when they stepped on a plane, we wouldn't ever have to worry about armed hijackers.i don't seem to be alone in thinking about nude flights. a couple of episodes in the past two weeks have called new attention to nudity on planes ” and, in my opinion, the possible benefits of being bare in the air.castaway travel in spring, texas sold more than 80 seats on a charter jet that flew saturday from miami to cancun. the agency dubbed the charter "naked-air." their slogan: "fly nakedã–fly nudeã–.fly in the buff."talk about traveling light!  passengers were allowed to take off all their clothes. the pilots& flight attendants nude. for safety's sake, no coffee, tea or any other flesh-destroying hot beverages were served. thankfully, passengers followed proper nude etiquette by sitting on towels when undressed.the nude flight comes only a week after usa today disclosed that a southwest airlines pilot and co-pilot, embracing the naked-air credo long before the saturday's flight, were fired in april for "inappropriate behavior." they're accused of doffing their uniforms in the cockpit and flying fully or nearly nude.like, where were they going to pin their little gold wings? on a thick mat of chest hair? it's no wonder passengers are told not to congregate near the cockpit door. they might try to peek in.but what if they did? those pilots have nothing to be ashamed of. some suggest that nudity on planes is an idea whose time has come."if i were a passenger on a flight, and they said the pilots were flying nude, i would say ã«go for it!'," says carolyn hawkins, spokeswoman for the american association for nude recreation. "it would tell me they want to be very free and relaxed when they are flying the plane."southwest is, after all, the airline that advertises that it wants people to feel "free to move about the country."naked passengers and crew would make terrorist fears a thing of the past. who would ever take a nude hijacker seriously? there's no place to conceal a concealed weapon anyway. and airport security lines would evaporate, as passengers skipped through metal detectors in their birthday suits.air rage? when people literally let down their pants, they figuratively let down their hair. suddenly, the aircraft cabin becomes a more relaxed place. about the only complaint passengers might have is keeping those restrictive seat belts fastened."one good thing about being with a bunch of nude people is you know the person from within," hawkins says. "you wouldn't be able to tell whether your fellow passenger is rich or is poor. you would, however, be able to tell if they had their gall bladder removed."getting naked on planes isn't a new thing. the mile high club, the fraternity of airborne lovemakers, still gets a steady stream of new recruits, judging from the tales recounted on the milehighclub.com web site. whether it's the backseat of a cessna 172 or the lavatory of a boeing 757, these swingers have never had any inhibitions about shedding their togs for a few moments of unbridled lust.sure, i recognize that the more inhibited might take some time to get used to the idea of flying nude. until then, airlines can help people relax by screening comedies in flight. i'd recommend the naked gun.

art classes were exempt from the law





bush signs law curbing, erotic city stripmoreboise, idaho  a strip club in boise, idaho has found an artful way to prance past a city law that prohibits full nudity.on what it calls art club nights, the erotic city strip club charges customers $15 for a sketch pad, pencil, and a chance to see completely naked women dancers.in 2001 the boise city council passed an ordinance banning total nudity in public unless it had "serious artistic merit" -- an exemption meant to apply to plays, dance performances and art classes."we have a lot of people drawing some very good pictures," said erotic city owner chris teague, who has posted many of the drawings around the club.teague said he got the idea when a customer asked if he could get in for free to sketch the dancers. realizing that "art classes" were exempt from the law, teague decided to bill mondays and tuesdays as art nights, and let the dancers go without their g-strings and pasties.in the two months since they began, art club nights have drawn full crowds of 60 people but no police citations, he said.

after a four-hour flight from turkey





    after a four-hour flight from turkey   originally uploaded by banamine. after a four-hour flight from turkey, my partner and iwere tired and disoriented after collecting baggagefrom the carousel, then rechecking it in for aconnecting flight. as we made our way through thedoorway that led towards the metal detectors andconveyor belts and the boarding area, the uniformed airport official said we had beenselected to trial a new security system. we felt wehad no choice, so we followed, then were separated.she smiled and led me towards a curtained area, whereshe took my handbag and told me to stand on whitemarkers. she stood in the corner and directed myposes: hands in the air, to the left, to the right.i felt silly doing this and, ominously, there was noclick, no flash, just a sinking feeling.at the completion of the last mug shot - hands down bymy side with my back to the screen - and feeling asthough this woman and i had just made a silentpersonal agreement, i made a feeble attempt at humour."am i a terrorist or convict?" i said."oh, no. do you want to have a look?" she said."no, thanks," i said, sensing disaster ahead."come on," she said, luring me behind the screen.here, another woman sat behind a computer terminalstaring. i walked behind her shoulder and saw theobject of her gaze, although it took a few moments tocomprehend the full horror.on her 30-centimetre computer screen was ablack-and-white ultrasonic image of me. nude from behindwith no hair. nude. from behind. no hair.i stood, slack-jawed, surveying myself from naked heelto denuded cranium. ten kilos heavier (or was that atrue reflection? - my mind was racing), weirdlydistorted bulges made by the impression of my jeans;15 centimetres shorter and flat-footed, resembling acavewoman. i had only about 30 seconds to view thisimage, but it has been stuck permanently in my brain.as we stood there with my two cheeks staring the threeof us in the face, i could hear them saying comfortingyet clearly false things like, "everybody looks thesame" and "don't worry, everybody has rolls where theydon't have rolls."and that was it. mortified that two strangers weretalking about my  naked rolls, i was led away like someonewho had just undergone shock treatment, given myhandbag, a piece of paper explaining how the lightultrasonic image x-ray works and pointed towards the front of theconveyor belt queue.welcome to nude terror

bare in the air





there's a case to be made for it, in this era of security fears. if passengers and crew got naked when they stepped on a plane, we wouldn't ever have to worry about armed hijackers.i don't seem to be alone in thinking about nude flights. a couple of episodes in the past two weeks have called new attention to nudity on planes — and, in my opinion, the possible benefits of being bare in the air.despite continued warnings to passengers, tsa screeners say travelers continue to bring banned items in their carry-on luggage. knives, guns, and other weapons are found and confiscated daily.fines issued for knives and other sharp objects range from $250 to $1,500. fines issued for firearms discovered in carry-on luggage range from $1,500 to $7,500.the tsa web site also indicates firearms violations will be referred for potential criminal prosecution. the same site does not propose the same criminal referral for knives like the one cecilia beaman was carrying."this is not the way my country should be treating me," she said. my concern is that if that's the way they're treating american citizens i would hate to think how they're treating other people. it's crazy."the tsa reminds travelers that is has the authority to impose civil penalties up to $10,000 per violation.

melbourne public nudity code,so no bum cheeks in public





    thongs   originally uploaded by banamine. melbourne -- wearing thongs to melbourne's beach, local parks or out on the street could cost you $500 and perhaps jail time. tuesday night, the melbourne city council unanimously outlawed super-skimpy swimwear amid a series of new adult entertainment regulations.the legislation established the "melbourne public nudity code" and added sweeping restrictions on adult establishments, such as exotic clubs and bookstores.during the meeting, a small contingent from the american association for nude recreation in kissimmee unsuccessfully lobbied council members to delay any nudity decisions. patricia orner, a grandmother of eight, said the code unfairly punishes those who enjoy nude sunbathing and "an occasional innocent skinny-dipping in remote areas."michael kahn, the lawyer who drafted melbourne's revised adult laws, said the city has no areas zoned for social nakedness. he said the city council could create such an area if it chooses, regardless of tuesday's vote.mayor harry goode said the thong regulations conform with brevard county law,so no bum cheeks in public, but it's ok to wear thongs on your private property. the city's adult entertainment zone was also slashed, from 937 acres to about 40 acres. melbourne's new adult district lies along north drive. councilwoman cheryl palmer welcomed the change. "there are even daycare centers in our present adult entertainment area," palmer said. contact neale at 242-3638 or rneale@flatoday.net
