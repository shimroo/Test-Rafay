we are a four-season, non-profit club based out of grand rapids, mi. the west michigan ski club unites adults in our region who share a 
common passion for outdoor adventure and lively social connection. while
 it all started in 1969 with an enthusiastic appreciation of skiing, our
 club has since expanded to include a variety of activities and planned 
excursions that take place during every season. over 300 members strong,
 we welcome anyone seeking a community focused on fun, friendship, and 
staying active in the great outdoors.
