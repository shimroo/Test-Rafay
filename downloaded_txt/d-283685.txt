beginnersfor true beginners (newbies) , you should begin with the the introductory bookkeeping course - so, you want to learn bookkeeping!. i also recommend that after completing the introductory bookkeeping lessons, that you add to and reinforce the accounting and bookkeeping knowledge that you've acquired by taking the - so, you want to learn bookkeeping! - chart of accounts and special journals tutorials. these three tutorials should provide you with a good basic understanding of bookkeeping and accounting and the records used. if you're using bookkeeping or accounting software (which i hope most businesses are) , it will also enlighten you as to what is actually taking place behind the scenes when you are entering data.the other four accounting courses, financial statements analysis, inventory, payroll, and cash can be taken in any order that you want and depend on you. if you work with or need to know about financial statements - take the financial statements analysis course. if you work with or need to know about inventories - take the inventory course. if you work with payroll or need to learn about the government's laws and regulations - take the payroll course. lastly, i do recommend that everyone take the cash course since cash along with profits are major keys to the success or failure of a business. the cash course also provides you with a free cash forecasting template.

hi, davei wanted to personally thank you for putting together this excellent resource on the introduction to accounting and bookkeeping. clearly youâve invested a tremendous amount of time thinking about and developing the content.  i really liked your cartoons (they make fantastic top-level bullet points). as a start-up business owner i feel itâs absolutely critical to understand the basics of accounting and bookkeeping in order to build a sustainable business; i did not go to business school, but having spent the time to review and understand your material will help me build a better business. your site has given me some excellent insight into the accrual method and how it is superior to the cash method, in terms of detailing the actual current financial state of the business; excellent example between cash method and accrual method (false income/expense reporting with cash method).i will be supporting your efforts!sincerely,jonathan yaffesee what more users have to say !



 


davei am a tired and retired small business consultant. the biggest problem i faced was that business owners didn't understand anything about their accounting. the worst part is they were too embarrassed to admit it. your work is some of the best i have seen to explain it simply and comprehensively. even a professional could learn a thing or two by studying your work. congratulations and continue the terrific work.dick medvedzdaveyour website is quite incredible!  i've spent about 10 years in publishing, developing accounting content.  i truly appreciate the time that you've put into it!  peggy instructor, accounting
