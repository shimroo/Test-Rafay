talk to temping 247 (tm) about temping







relationship,
  l.l.c. (a delaware limited liability company) publishes a number of websites
dedicated to temping, consulting and self-employment.
in general, our hot temp jobs (tm)
sites (http://htj.rllc.net,
http://www.hottempjobs.com
and http://www.hottempjobs.net)
will primarily be interactive directories of temporary help agencies and
consulting firms that hire temps and consultants/freelancers.
our tempcity (tm) websites (http://tempcity.rllc.net, http://www.tempcity.com, http://www.tempcity.net)
will serve as a resource center for people who create their own llcs to
market their labor and on self-employment in general. the tempcity (tm)
websites will, in general, list employers and indicate contact info for
getting contracts with those companies.
some sites have a local message board
for discussion only, while  other sites have interactive directories
of temp agencies and other temp/consulting resources.  we have interactive
directories for new york city, nyc, district of columbia (dc), philadelphia
(philly), boston, detroit, chicago, los angeles, san francisco and the
rest of the nation.
the limited
liability company (llc) is an exciting new business structure that has
the pass-through tax benefit of a partnership and the "limited liability"
protection of a corporation.  we believe that the llc will revolutionize
relationships (see relationship
llc) and the workplace.
limited liability companies are
not taxed when classified as a partnership, rather the members pay tax,
at the personal income rate, on the money which they receive from the limited
liability company. an llc can be viewed as a partnership which has the
advantage of a corporation in that the members/partners are not liable
for the debts of the llc, nor are they liable to each other.
employers have many labor options
available to them.  employers may hire employees directly as "permanent"
at-will employees, use employee-leasing firms, use temporary and contract
labor and outsource functions entirely.  we believe that outsourcing
work to an in-house independent employee-owned support
llc (tm) is the best possible labor solution.  in addition,
by way of an equity stake in the support llc, your company can have a shared
investment in the success of this support llc and achieve additional cost
savings.

at
this web site we will present (1) information and resources that will enable
temps to create their own llcs to market their labor;  (2) we will
provide the service to employers of forming support llcs and recruiting
and training the workers needed to manage and operate these support llcs;
and (3) we will provide a forum through which contracts for support services
may be posted for competitive bidding in compliance with equal opportunity
employment and contracting
temps agencies
and member owned support llcs will be able to find and bid on contracts
