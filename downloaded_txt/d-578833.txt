stephen wiltshire
british architectural artist

stephen wiltshire is a prodigious cityscape artist, known for capturing intricate details of global skylines after mere glimpses. honoured as a member of the order of the british empire for services to art, his artworks grace prestigious museums worldwide. at just five, he began drawing lifelike, accurate impressions of cities, skylines and street scenes after having only observed them briefly. at only eight years old, the uk prime minister owned one of his pieces.

dubbed "britain's best child artist" by the royal academy of art's president, sir hugh casson, stephen has since showcased his talent globally with record-breaking exhibits. living by his mantra, 'do the best you can and never stop', he sketches daily.
