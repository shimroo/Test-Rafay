what is thalassemia?








thalassemia: a basic description






        hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying component of the red blood cells. it consists of two different proteins, an alpha and a beta. if the body doesn’t produce enough of either of these two
        proteins, the red blood cells do not form properly and cannot carry sufficient oxygen. the result is anemia that begins in early childhood and lasts throughout life.










beta thalassemia






        beta thalassemia occurs when hemoglobin lacks enough beta protein, primarily affecting individuals of mediterranean, middle eastern, african, and southeast asian descent. it ranges from
        thalassemia minor, which typically causes no symptoms, to thalassemia major (cooley's anemia), the most severe form that requires regular blood transfusions and lifelong medical care to
        manage life-threatening anemia and iron overload.










alpha thalassemia






        alpha thalassemia occurs when the body doesn’t produce enough alpha protein in hemoglobin, commonly affecting people in africa, asia, and the mediterranean. the condition ranges
        from the mild silent carrier state, with no symptoms, to the severe alpha thalassemia major, which can cause life-threatening anemia and requires lifelong treatment.
