the internet patrol 12/4/2024 leave a comment

how crazy is it that it is so hard to figure out how and where to cancel a tinyurl account? why bury how to deactivate your tinyurl account? they used to be one of the good guys, right? and maybe they still are, in general, but between the “no-reply@tinyurl.email” email address on their email marketing (never a good thing), their “support@tinyurl.com” not working, and the where and how to cancel your tinyurl account being completely inobvious, well, we have to wonder.
