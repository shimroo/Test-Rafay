the savvy traveller
                                            began in 1985  in chicago as a real live one-stop
                                            shop for travellers.  it was filled with guidebooks
                                            and all manner of other reading matter about places around
                                            the world, along with maps, globes and travel gear for
                                            actual travellers, armchair travellers...and dreamers.
                                            the aim of the store was to provide everything a traveller
                                            needs to plan and take a trip, except tickets.                                      the savvy traveller
                                            closed its bricks and mortar store in 2007.  





"the
                                                        world is a book, and those who do not travel read only
                                                        a page."
                                                        ~st. augustine






"travel
                                                        is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness,
                                                        and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts.
                                                        broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things
                                                        cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner
                                                        of the earth all one's lifetime."
                                                        ~mark twain








"if you reject the food, ignore the customs,
                                                        fear the religion and avoid the people, you might better
                                                        stay home."
