statement on governor tim walz's nomination as vice president






statement from minnesota family council ceo, jeff evans: vice president harris has chosen minnesota governor tim walz as her running mate. while some in minnesota are cheering this news, in fact this is a troubling decision and pulls the democratic ticket even further towards the progressive left. while others today are discussing governor walz’s tenure, including the 2020 riots, covid vaccine mandates, and the largest covid-relief fund fraud in the nation, it’s also important to look at what governor walz lists as his actual accomplishments. 


























god's faithfulness: 2024 session recap






friends, below i’m sharing our final legislative update for the 2024 legislative session. because of god’s faithfulness, i’m humbled to say it was full of wins for life, family, and religious freedom. stopping the so-called “equal rights amendment” was our top priority this session because of what a clear and present danger it presented to people of faith, children and the unborn.if enacted, it would have added constitutional protections for abortion up to birth and for individuals to self-identify their “gender identity and expression.” and there was no protection for religious freedom, meaning individuals and organizations who could not comply with these constitutional protections because of their faith could be punished for it.passing this was a top priority of the radical left, and with dfl control of the house, senate and governor’s office, it was a reasonable expectation. nevertheless, by the grace of god, the legislation failed!


























holding the line: minnesota family council at the capitol






this week was a busy one for our policy and legal team at the minnesota state capitol. rebecca delahunt, our director of public policy, and renee carlson, general counsel of our true north legal initiative, testified in several committee hearings, submitted written testimony, and brought expert testifiers to still more hearings!why such a busy week? unfortunately, it’s because the pace of bad bills we’re seeing at the capitol is increasing. here’s everything that we engaged in at the capitol this week.


























i'm an ivf baby. this is my story.






you may have seen news stories in the last few days in reaction to an alabama supreme court ruling in a case involving in vitro fertilization (ivf). it’s an issue that impacts a lot of sensitivities and brings up significant ethical questions. and, it is something that i, as an ivf baby, am deeply invested in. but my opinions may surprise you. first, before we can talk about ivf, a quick word on what it actually is. simply put, ivf harvests a mature egg and artificially fertilizes it in a lab with sperm. that fertilized egg, now an embryo, is transferred to the uterus of the mother or a surrogate. now, back to my story. i am incredibly thankful to be alive. i grew up with wonderful, loving parents and never doubted for a second that i was wanted and loved.
