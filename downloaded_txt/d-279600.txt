creekvue toy poodles & german shepherd dogs



















 

located
in alva, florida, we selectively breed  akc toy poodles only.
starting in
1985 with german shepherd dogs we have gradually moved to breed toy
poodles exclusively. we have bred many beautiful
dogs with
championship and obedience titles. our german shepherd page remains as
a tribute to the many wonderful dogs we owned and bred over the years.

concentrating on our toy poodles all of our dogs
are fully health tested and cleared for genetic defects before being
bred. our poodles are all dna optigen tested
clear of the gene for pra, all eyes are cerf and patellas ofa.
we breed to the akc standard focusing on correct breed type, health and
temperament a dog that you can be proud to have as a family member.

on occasion we
have puppies and young adults available.

as of august 2015, we have no puppies or young adults available. we may
be having a litter soon, sept-oct 2015, call 239-848-6696 and i'd be
