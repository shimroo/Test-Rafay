					flow monitoring - don't wait for an engine overheat alarm					 

ssa raw water monitoring system is a system that alerts the vessel operator visually and audibly to the significant reduction of raw water flow to any connected device. 
you are alerted faster than traditional gauges or sensors (about 7 seconds) – fast enough to allow you to react and investigate – fast enough to prevent damage before it occurs.

					self cleaning strainer- never get clogged again!					 

as raw water strainers do their job, filter baskets become clogged with debris and flow to the connected device is reduced, resulting in the need for system shut-down for cleaning and maintenance.hydromatic strainers eliminate untimely shut-downs and maintenance by conducting a periodic self-cleaning cycle (the user selects the cleaning interval) with its powerful internal macerator.
