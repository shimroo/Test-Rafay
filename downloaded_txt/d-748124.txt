ai engine licensing and contract gamedevelopment:




we have licensed go and chess playing engines.
    

other ai engines we have developed include bridge, othello, 
checkers, arimaa, domineering, world war chess, and a real time, multiplayer space battle game with intelligent
aliens.

we do contract software development for artifical intelligence game
engines.
since we already have working code for many games, developing new
engines
can be fast and inexpensive.
