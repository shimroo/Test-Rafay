here at murphy’s bar & grill we have always prided ourselves on our closeness with our local community. a neighborhood restaurant, or “local” to us irish folk, is more than just a place to knock back a pint and grind some corned beef, it is a place to gather, see our neighbors and share in one another’s triumphs and sorrows. mahalo, slainte and stay safe!don and marion murphy
