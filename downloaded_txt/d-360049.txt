                                    finally bit the bullet and did it. she'd 
                                    been wanting to paint her own style of abstract 
                                    art and she finally picked up a paint 
                                    brush and created some really unique pieces 
                                    of art! you'll want to check this out.

a new normalso 
                                    what ever happened to the dickson gallery 
                                    of fine art?  well, we are embracing 
                                    a new normal. it's about time right? after 
                                    all, it's been nearly five years. yes, five! 
                                    (if you want to know the details of "what 
                                    happened" five years ago to close the 
                                    gallery, scroll below. but while the brick 
                                    and mortar version of the dickson gallery 
                                    is no more, rachel dickson has now begun 
                                    to paint and create herself. so yes, 
                                    indirectly, the dickson gallery lives on.

dickson gallery

                                    no more
yes, 
                                    it's true.  the dickson gallery 
                                    of fine art is closed. 
                                     due to  renovation 
                                    of the building next door, we closed our 
                                    doors on may 21, 2008 so that the structural issues to our 
                                    building that surfaced could be addressed 
                                    in a timely manner.  unfortunately, 
                                    this did not occur and there was no end 
                                    in site.  soooo, due to loss of 
                                    income and the no-end-in-site, imminent-threat 
                                    of-construction we were forced to close 
                                    the doors of our storefront gallery forever. 
                                                 however,  
                                    we chose to go out with a bang, by 
                                    hosting a "final hurrah" of sorts 
                                    on friday, june 27, 2008 where we celebrated all that 
                                    was, all that is and all that will be.  (besides 
                                    we all needed closure due to this horrible 
                                    development). special 
                                                thanks to all of you who joined 
                                                with us as we celebrated in dickson gallery
