					the tom medley project
								

					hr&cs was very proud to help the late great tom medley restore his car after a tragic fire. click below to take a look at what was accomplished. 				



 







				
					since 1989
								

					hr&cs has been in our current location since 1989, but randy clark the owner has been building cool cars and motorcycles long before that. we have built numerous award winning builds over the years, and are very proud of our work. 				


 







				
					service
								

					no job is too small here at hr&cs. need a simple oil change and service? how about a safety inspection to make sure your classic will be safe with your family and friends? you have come to the right place for all your hot rod needs. 				


 







				
					parts
								

					are you the do-it-yourself'er but having a hard time finding that part that seems to be no longer made? let our qualified parts department know as we have new and used part options and are glad to assist.

this is the greatest hot rod shop i've ever been to!! the staff and techs were extremely helpful and definitely know what they're doing!! it was a pleasure working with them and i will always go there for any repairs and tuneups that i will need!! i highly recommend hot rods and custom stuff

had hot rods and custom stuff tune up my 1927 ford  t bucket last week. the t-bucket was running really bad. they did an excellent job. it runs great now. thanks for the help!!

i took a 2 hour drive from my house to pick up some parts i ordered that came in. the staff there were great. they gave me a tour of their facility, which was like going to disneyland for me, and explained some of the details and procedures they were using on customers cars. the workmanship on these vehicles was outstanding. seeing pre and post work performed made me a customer. definitely worth the 4 hour round trip visit.
