rochester ny radio stations 2015 update
written by ron morales on june 1st, 2015 rochester, ny


i am addicted to the radio. i have been a radio addict since first grade, when i tore the transistor radio out of the belly of my sister's toy stuffed dog. 50 years later, i still own a pocket am/fm radio that i use daily. but, thanks to the internet, i often have a major league baseball game, talk radio, and jazz music, playing as a mashup. rochester, ny is a great radio town, with a long history with ties to george eastman, a topic i will post more about in the future. a taste of that rochester radio history is found on this page, in the photo on the right and videos [read more...]

northeast funk at lovin' cup rochester, ny
written by ron morales on august 9th, 2014 rochester, ny



as a fan of the local roc music scene, i am becoming more fond of the lovin' cup . it's a fantastic club / restaurant brimming with visual art and live music. i work 3rd shift and weekends starting 11pm, so i shoot most of my bands at daytime festivals, or clubs close to downtown rochester, ny where i work. 

i get lots of invites to shoot bands at the lovin' cup, every now and then the planets line up and i'll shoot a show and go to work a little bit late. such was the case saturday, july 19th, 2014. having been invited to shoot the band   northeast funk (nef), and being quite familiar with band members drew gansz and doug egling from seeing them at the open mic super sunday soul jam, the time seemed ripe to add another band to the list of bands i have shot after meeting them at some other happy event.

i had seen all of the band members - lady shayla brooks, lawrence alan, charles davis, drew gansz, doug egling, glenn beard at the super sunday soul jam, but drew and doug are at the jam almost every week, so i was most familiar with them and their playing styles. 

i think it's worth mentioning that guitar player drew gansz is only 16 years old, and often shares a stage with joe beard, and yes, glenn beard is related to joe. also, sax is my favorite instrument, so i'm pretty motivated to shoot a band that has a sax-man such as doug egling.

the show on monroe - spokes & ink
written by ron morales on august 8th, 2014 rochester, ny



i often tell people, "you would have to set yourself on fire to get noticed on monroe avenue" so usual is the unusual on monroe ave., where everything that is different converges and becomes the norm. on saturday, june 7th of 2014, at least four separate events were held simultaneously on monroe avenue. 1. the show on monroe 2. spokes & ink 3. the scavenue hunt  4. an unidentified scavenger hunt featuring joggers in costumes.  this flood of activities rendered the usual freak show a tourist attraction with too much fun and not enough time to take it all in.

while at the show on monroe, i shot pictures and video, mainly focusing on the street musicians, as is my norm. you will also see a good sampling in photos of the other activities mixed in with musicians (buskers) on every street corner. there are 160 photos, and about a dozen videos (videos exclusively seen on rocpic.com), that will give you a good look at some of the sights and sounds i was able to take in that day [read more...]

new look on rocpic.com? "responsive web design"
written by ron morales on august 8th, 2014  rochester, ny


"something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue..." would be a good way to describe the changes happening at rocpic.com . still home of the "good roc" here in rochester, ny  aka the 585. i have been publishing photos, videos, and webcam images on this website  for over 10 years, and it is taking a bit of compromise to marry the old format of web design with the new. while the new design utilizes responsive web design (rwd), allowing the webpage to fit on any device, be it a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer, i had to retain elements of the old format to display the webcams on various pages of this site.

if you are on a desktop computer, you should see the roc-media twitter feed (compiled by rachel barnhart) in a column on the right side of this screen, if not, make your web browser wider, you should have a similar view on a  tablet. if you are using a smartphone, or if you make the page narrow, every item on this page will line up in a single column for you to scroll through.
