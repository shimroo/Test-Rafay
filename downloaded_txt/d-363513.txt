                the real john            


though rumors persist, john dillinger never murdered anyone. he was accused of shooting and killing patrolman patrick o'malley in january 1934 during a robbery of the first national bank of east chicago, indiana, but he was never convicted of murder in this or any other case. dillinger was being chased by daytona beach, fl police at approximately the same time, so it is not certain that he was involved in the robbery in chicago at all.
in 1934, felony murder statute was different than it is today. in other words, individuals were solely accountable for their own actions. it's true that some associates of dillinger killed individuals, such as baby face nelson and handsome harry pierpont. john dillinger never initialized gun fire, and was adamant he never killed anyone.
