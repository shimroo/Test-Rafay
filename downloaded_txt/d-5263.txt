real new orleans voodoo

new orleans and louisiana voodoo


new orleans and louisiana voodoo is a set of spiritual folkways that originated from the traditions of the african diaspora. it is a cultural and religious practice deeply rooted in west african, haitian, and catholic traditions, which were brought to the area by enslaved africans in the 18th century. despite its rather horrible beginnings, it has been embraced by many people worldwide as their preferred spiritual practice. mambo samantha corfield, born and raised in new orleans, is one of the most respected voodoo and vodou mambos today. she happily shares her knowledge and help with all. 
origins and influences
voodoo in louisiana can be traced back to the african slaves brought to the region by french colonists. these slaves came primarily from the west african regions of benin, togo, and nigeria, where vodun was a dominant religion. as they were forced into slavery, they brought with them their spiritual practices and beliefs.
the practice of voodoo in new orleans was further influenced by the arrival of haitian immigrants in the early 19th century. after the haitian revolution (1791-1804), many haitians, including free people of color and slaves, fled to louisiana, bringing with them their own versions of vodou. the blend of african, haitian, and catholic practices gave rise to what we now recognize as new orleans voodoo. on mambo sam's multiple visits to haiti, she was thrilled to hear of all the similarities between her new orleans voodoo upbringing and her haitian mambo asogwe initiation. 
marie laveau: the voodoo queen
one of the most famous figures in new orleans voodoo history is marie laveau, often referred to as the "voodoo queen" of new orleans. born in 1801, marie laveau was a free woman of color who became a prominent voodoo priestess in the city. she was known for her charisma, healing abilities, and spiritual leadership, which earned her a large following.
marie laveau's influence extended beyond her lifetime, and she remains a central figure in the folklore and spiritual practices of new orleans. her legacy is celebrated every year on st. john's eve, with rituals and ceremonies held in her honor. famous witch, oneida toups once told mambo sam that her family had always told her that marie laveau wanted to remember for her good deeds in helping the poor and prisoners much more than she wanted to be remembered as a voodoo queen. whenever working with her, you will gain much favor by also acknowledging that side of her life.
voodoo practices and beliefs
new orleans voodoo incorporates a variety of practices and beliefs, including the worship of spirits known as "loas" or "lwa," ancestor veneration, and the use of gris-gris (protective charms or amulets). rituals often involve music, dance, and offerings to the spirits. drumming and chanting are common, as they are believed to help invoke the loas.
voodoo also emphasizes the interconnectedness of the spiritual and physical worlds, with practitioners seeking guidance and intervention from the spirits in matters of health, love, and fortune. healing and protection are central aspects of voodoo practice, with voodoo priests and priestesses serving as spiritual leaders and healers within their communities.
modern day voodoo
today, new orleans voodoo is a recognized and respected spiritual tradition that continues to thrive in the city. it is often practiced alongside other religious and spiritual traditions, reflecting the diverse cultural heritage of new orleans. voodoo shops, temples, and tours are popular attractions in the french quarter, where visitors can learn about the history and practices of this unique spiritual tradition.
despite facing historical persecution and misconceptions, new orleans voodoo remains an integral part of the cultural and spiritual landscape of louisiana. it is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of african spiritual traditions in the face of adversity.
