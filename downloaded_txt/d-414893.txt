who we are
sheds online is a family owned and operated business – a husband and wife team – and not a franchise.
                    although our name suggests it, we are more than an online business.
                    sheds online was established in 2001 as a unique way for customers to purchase shed kits online, however our business has evolved from being an online shed business to one that specialises in one-on-one customer service.
