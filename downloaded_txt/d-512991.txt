teaching only the most successful and long lasting feng shui techniques, we attract students from all over the world, many of whom are professional architects, interior designers and health practitioners. many of our students have gone on to become feng shui consultants and feng shui teachers in their own right, with busy consultancies of their own. as our reputation for feng shui excellence has spread, so has respect for our graduates. if you have received feng shui or chinese astrology training at a feng shui school, you will probably at some point, make your way to the feng shui school of excellence to enhance your education and deepen your knowledge of feng shui and chinese astrology. we are happy to accept practicing feng shui consultants and teachers to the school. please contact us if you wish to attend a specific class, or series of classes, as a guest student.




a note about feng shui software
we know there are online calculators and feng shui software programmes out there. some are okay, some are plainly incorrect, others charge extra for the "latest" information or are used to promote completely unnecessary products. if just pushing a button isn't enough, and you're serious about learning feng shui, you want more than just general advice, and prefer to understand the reasoning behind it, software really isn't for you. in fact, software can never be a substitute for proper feng shui education. most importantly, every space, and every person is different and computer generated charts cannot replace real-life feng shui and chinese astrology analysis. we will personally teach you everything you need to know, so that you can use feng shui for life, not just as long as you pay for software.




student support and advice
enrol as a student with the international feng shui school of excellence and we will guide you through every aspect of feng shui and chinese astrology. we provide extensive face-to-face teaching, free student support, free online webinars, access to our online forum, and the opportunity to attend master classes and live feng shui consultations. you will learn alongside students from around the world, sharing your experiences and gaining practical skills. we are on hand to provided answers to your questions and to fully support you through your learning process. weâre passionate about reaching people who most want to learn feng shui, which is why youâll always feel like part of a family when you learn with us. weâre here to help you grow, overcome challenges, and follow your passions.

evangelia
johannesburg, south africa

having taken several on-line courses, as well as other classroom studies, i find the course rich in theory (which other courses lack), well-composed, and well-worth the cost.












pj dix
usa

i've read books and practiced with my own home for the last 12 years and i learned more in the first 15 pages of this course than in that entire time! thank you.












jo ellen
usa

i read a couple books on "western" feng shui, and there was something that did not sit right with me. i couldn't help but wonder why they had to come up with a "new" way. i am so excited! i needed this course, and again, i thank you for your time and kindness.












manila
 malta

i had other courses with other teachers, but they cannot compare to you. you have passion in explaining and you do it from your heart. had been trying to take this course for over 5 years, but maybe now is the right time for me. i don't regret it, i feel i found a pot of gold!












le feng shui consultant
uk

the more i study feng shui the more i realise how little i know and how much there is to learn. it's disheartening to realise just how little i did learn from other schools, but i suppose i had to start somewhere.












gk
usa

the amount of material presented to date is really incredible. what a fascinating journey!  thank you for leading the way!












antony
malta

now i have a good path to follow because i was previously very confused, one book saying this, another thatâ¦ thank you for so much knowledge!












lk
feng shui consultant - finland

a triumph of personal growth, wisdom and insight, and proved exactly what it means to be at the right place at the right time.












sherry
usa

i am pleased that i found your school and instruction as when i say that i am studying traditional feng shui based upon physics, not the westernized version, people are quite impressed. i am very grateful for the quality of both your course and instruction.












geraldine
uk

i have always loved the philosophy behind chinese medicine (iâm an acupuncturist) and this takes me several steps on and also widens my appreciation. iâm finding the course is well structured and simple to follow but also challenging.












sachelle
uk

i came to this course simply to add another layer to my bow as an interior designer, yet after being exposed to the vast dynamics of feng shui, i leave this course with the intention of making it my sole speciality. what i have learnt has profoundly changed not only the direction of my life, but also the very way in which i view it.












camila de leã³n
spain

trying something new is exciting! thanks for the amazing course and the great teacher who made it so interesting.












krisz
china

i would just like to say a big thank you for being my feng shui teacher. i have found your class informative, constructive, interesting and lots of fun. magic!!!












le
feng shui consultant - uk

 i'm so glad i did my course at a time when our school had links with yourself, otherwise i'd still be blindly ignorant of traditional feng shui teachings.












mc
usa

your course gives the clearest, most intelligent explanation of feng shui i have ever read. i am completely thrilled, thank you.












ylf
singapore

a pleasure to be studying under the guidance of a real professional. one simply couldn't learn more about authentic feng shui anywhere else.












vs
feng shui consultant/executive committee member - feng shui society uk

i've put into practice some of the things you've taught me over the past few months and it's amazing!
