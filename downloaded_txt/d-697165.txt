community ecology & biogeography lab
our lab investigates the forces enabling the maintenance, and governing the distribution, of biological diversity contemporarily and historically. some of our work aims to use such information to better predict how biodiversity will change in the face of global changes. we are inclusive and diverse, we work on a variety of systems, but we have a slight preference for ants.











 
global change ecology



 
global change ecology

        we study how global change drivers such as climate change, habitat modification and biological invasions affect the biological diversity of plant, animals and microbes, as well as the functioning of ecosystems   relevant references: eckert imk*, de bellis t, muñoz g*,    

 



 
the geographic distribution of biological diversity



 
the geographic distribution of biological diversity

        we study how historical, evolutionary and ecological processes interact to govern the geographic distribution of biodiversity. we are interested in how such processes influence spatiotemporal variation in species richness and composition, phylogenetic diversity and functional traits.   relevant references usui t,    

 



 
the maintenance of biological diversity



 
the maintenance of biological diversity

        we study the processes that enable species to persist through time, which are those responsible for the maintenance of biological diversity. specifically, we investigate how historical, evolutionary and ecological process interact to govern community assembly and species coexistence. we pay    

 



 
causes and consequences of ant diversity



 
causes and consequences of ant diversity

        we study what causes ants to be so diverse in some parts of the world and practically absent from others. we study ants because they are fascinating, but also because they represent a huge fraction of animal biomass and play crucial roles in ecosystem
