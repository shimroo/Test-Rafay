overview:
evan shares the strategy at montauk to invest in
the intersection of energy, balancing cleantech with other energy sources and
solutions.  he says the first time the
history of modern history that there is an intersection with new energy
technologies like solar and wind, batteries, the electrification of vehicles
and the big one, energy and a!.  “
 
 he talks
about the direction of the new trump administration and a more pragmatic
approach with energy and that instead of mandates for zero emissions it will
seek innovation that is cost effective..
 
he says retail investors can follow
their model by investing in etf’s and companies that provide more than one
solution and have fuel mixed portfolios around the energy transition.
 
he closes with two things to always
remember, “don’t fight the fed and don’t fight a trend where hundreds of billions
of dollars will be deployed; follow the money. we are still very much in the
early innings,”
 
evan was previously head of venture investments at riverstone
private equity, a $40 billion+ energy investment and infrastructure firm.
 
he co-founded montauk along with philp krim (ex-casper ceo) and sharo atmeh (ex-alyeska investment group).
 
host dawn van zant is a female pioneer in the
financial markets sitting in every seat as a trader, a broker, ir and pr before

ev and battery stocks to watch-the ev battery story; stocks mentioned: (tsxv: $nbm.v; otc: $nbmff) @neo_battery , (nasdaq: $tsla), (nasdaq: $lcid), (nasdaq: $rivn), (nasdaq: $sldp)





ev and battery stocks to watch-the ev battery story;
stocks mentioned: (tsxv: $nbm.v; otc: $nbmff) @neo_battery , (nasdaq: $tsla),
(nasdaq: $lcid), (nasdaq: $rivn), (nasdaq: $sldp)
 

 
february 13,
2025 -  investorideas.com, a global investor news source covering ev and
battery stocks releases a snapshot looking at news and developments in the race
for the battery market for ev’s, featuring neo battery materials ltd.
(tsxv: nbm) (otc: nbmff), a low-cost silicon anode materials developer
that enables longer-running, rapid-charging lithium-ion batteries.
 
ev and battery stocks included in this
article: tesla (nasdaq: tsla), lucid group (nasdaq: lcid), rivian automotive, inc. (nasdaq: rivn), solid power, inc. (nasdaq: sldp).
 
despite the current bump in the road from president
trump’s narrative on ev’s in the us, the ev market continues to show big growth
prospects. the global
electric vehicle (ev) market  size
is estimated to grow by usd 446.4 billion from 2025-2029, according to
technavio. the market is estimated to grow at a cagr of 16.4% during the
forecast period.
 
the silicon anode market, an integral
component for batteries, is projected to grow from 946 million usd in 2024 to
28.7 billion usd in 2032, representing a cagr of 54%, according to south korean
financial institution, hana securities. the silicon anode and electric vehicle
(ev) battery market are set for significant growth, driven by increasing ev
adoption, advancements in battery technologies and supportive government
policies.
 
the growth
story continues for neo battery materials ltd.
(tsxv: nbm) (otc: nbmff) as they advance towards commercial production. this week, neo announced
its collaboration with milwaukee, wisconsin-based rockwell automation inc. (nyse: rok),
the world’s largest company dedicated to industrial automation and digital
transformation. through this collaboration, neo aims to integrate advanced
automation solutions that will improve production efficiency, quality control
and scalability at neo’s planned silicon anode manufacturing facility in
windsor, ontario.
 
with neo battery’s development of its
silicon anode technology, rockwell automation intends to aid the company
achieving operational readiness for large-scale, commercial production. by
implementing rockwell’s advanced automation and digitalization solutions, neo
will streamline its manufacturing capabilities, optimize resource use, and
support a more robust, cost-effective production process. digital tools will
also enable real-time monitoring and data-driven insights, supporting enhanced
decision-making and reducing leadtime to workflows.

this article, featuring nbm in full at https://www.investorideas.com/news/2025/renewable-energy/02131ev-battery-stocks.asp

 
“we are excited to grow the auto and ev
battery category in our industry,” said brian holte, regional vice president,
north america, of sales strategy and transformation at rockwell automation.
“supporting neo’s growth is a strategic imperative for us as we continue to
establish our products and solutions to scale the company’s output with higher
efficiencies and ultimately growth to both company’s bottom lines.”
 
as neo battery materials commercializes
its facilities in windsor, the company envisions expanding operations in the
united states to pursue silicon anode manufacturing activities and value-added
projects. rockwell automation will be engaged to help launch further
facilities, such as in ohio, in the future.
 
“teaming up with rockwell automation was
a strategic step to help us scale our battery materials commercialization and
production,” said spencer huh, president and ceo of neo battery materials. “the
value proposition provided by utilizing solutions from rockwell will help grow
and streamline production, delivering the highest quality products to our
customers.”
 
rockwell automation, inc. is a global
leader in industrial automation and digital transformation. we connect the
imaginations of people with the potential of technology to expand what is
humanly possible, making the world more productive and more sustainable.
headquartered in milwaukee, wisconsin, rockwell automation employs
approximately 27,000 problem solvers dedicated to our customers in more than
100 countries. to learn more about how we are bringing the connected
enterprise® to life across industrial enterprises, visit www.rockwellautomation.com.
 
on february 6th, neo announced
the production scale-up to 20 tons per year to accommodate the increasing
demand for neo’s high-performance silicon anode products and to initiate
mass-producibility testing to prepare factory-level production.
 
marketsandmarkets reports, “the anode is responsible for storing lithium
ions during charging and releasing them during discharge, making its energy
density a key factor in determining the overall energy capacity of the battery.
innovations in anode materials, such as silicon-carbon composites and
nanocomposite tin/carbon/cobalt alloys, are enhancing energy storage
capabilities and cycle life, which are essential for meeting consumer
expectations for longer driving ranges and faster charging times.”
 
according to an article in lanoticiadigital.com, lucid group’s (nasdaq: lcid) innovation
is anchored in its groundbreaking ev battery technology which offers extended
range and quick charging capabilities. this has positioned the company as a
leader in the quest for next-generation vehicles. with the push for
sustainability and the global transition to green energy, ev tech innovations
are pivotal. lucid is not just capitalizing on this trend but is setting
benchmarks with its superior battery efficiency and design.
 
in a  review and rating of ev
battery stocks at insider monkey, “tesla (nasdaq: tsla), is involved in the ev battery business throughout multiple areas – from
in-house battery production to raw material sourcing, recycling and energy storage
solutions. the company’s vertical integration goes over and above
manufacturing, and includes r&d, allowing it to maintain a competitive
advantage. its intangible assets and cost advantage are expected to act as key
competitive advantages. tesla, inc. (nasdaq:tsla) is facing constraints in
battery production and it continues to actively work to increase total gigawatt
hours of battery production in 2025.”
 
continued: “the outlook for the company’s battery
business is optimistic, courtesy of its focus on innovation, production
scaling, and expanding demand for evs and energy storage solutions.”
an article this week on rivian automotive, inc. (nasdaq: rivn) at mi valle showcases how battery innovation could be a
game changer for this ev company, highlighting - 
“rivian automotive is poised for a
technological revolution with a potential breakthrough in battery technology.
the company plans to introduce a proprietary
solid-state battery, advancing beyond lithium-ion technology.
this new battery type promises increased
energy density, addressing range anxiety with longer ranges and faster
charging.
solid-state batteries also offer enhanced
safety, reducing risks of overheating and fires.
successful integration of this technology
could secure rivian a larger market share and drive global ev adoption.
industry watchers consider rivian’s innovation
a potential catalyst for a new era of electric vehicle development.”
 
solid power, inc. (nasdaq: sldp), is developing solid-state battery technology to enable the next
generation of batteries for the fast-growing ev and other markets. solid
power’s core technology is its electrolyte material, which solid power believes
can enable extended driving range, longer battery life, improved safety, and
lower cost compared to traditional lithium-ion. solid power’s business model –
selling its electrolyte to cell manufacturers and licensing its cell designs
and manufacturing processes – distinguishes the company from many of its
competitors who plan to be commercial battery manufacturers.
 
breaking news in the ev battery sector reported by reuters and other major news outlets says, “chinese
battery giant catl has started the process to list in hong kong by lodging its
filings with regulators in a deal that is expected to raise at least $5
billion, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.”
 
continued: “the biggest battery maker in the world filed
an application to list on the hong kong stock exchange on tuesday, saying part
of the funds raised will be used to build its 7.3 billion-euro ($7.53 billion)
battery plant in hungary.”
 
this new listing shows the ev battery race is still one for investors to
watch.
