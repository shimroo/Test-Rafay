““joe has cared for our twelve year old puggle, royalston, for the last ten years.  he’s like a father to our little monkey, and nothing is too much trouble.  if we’re caught late at work it’s never been a problem and we’d trust him in a heartbeat to put our dog first.  can’t recommend him enough””
