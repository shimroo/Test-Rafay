    event photography
  


last week's event photography was to capture the launch of the new offices and a new car release for aston martin. the crowd was full of exclusive guests to celebrate the brand and enjoy the evening's entertainment. the secret to good event photography is to blend in, not be noticed as much as possible and find those moments that happen and people remember.if you have an event whatever the kind, drop me a line for a quote.my event photography services include - network events, charity events, award ceremonies, team building days, product launches, trade shows and conferences.

    executive corporate photography - leeds
  


executive corporate portrait photographycreating portraits that are as strong as your business.your time as an executive is short, so i will assess from previous communication what is available regarding space and where we need to work. on the day of the shoot, i will bring enough equipment and the kitchen sink if need be to make sure all eventualities are taken care of. then after a quick 30 minutes to set up a space, with lights and photography backgrounds unless the office space works better, you arrive at a designated time and we create powerful corporate photography in moments. showing you and your brand at its best. if you have a little more time available, we can work around your office space and create multiple scenes and looks. nothing is accidental, everything is created and crafted with precision. you will never look better!advice on what to wear if needed can be given freely. i know what looks visually good and if you need a quick tie straighten, makeup refresh, my attention to detail is constant. there will be no loose hairs appearing on any shot you receive from me.give me a call, or email from my contact page to discuss your corporate executive portrait requirements. i look forward to hearing from you.

event photographysuch a great event to photograph in the highlands of scotland for ocean energy europe just before the christmas break. fascinating to listen and learn while capturing the leaders in this exciting industry as they presented their tech in the various rooms and swapped ideas between each other. nice also to see the conference facilitate out of hours entertainment for all the participants during the four day event. i had a lot of fun if not a lot of hard work, racing between the rooms to capture people being inspired, hard at work or just having fun.

    choir photography
  


i had the best time photographing for the tallis consort in barnsley last week. a request by the chap in charge of the group to create some new imagery for their upcoming new website. i've photographed a few different types of music performers now but never a choir. at these gigs you have an added bonus of listening to some very talented people as you work.beforehand, after a quick chat with the leader of the group, i checked out the location on the website to see if i could scope out the place and put together a list of shot ideas. on the day, these really help with keeping a focus. it's easy to get swept up by something looking cool and blitzing it as time runs away with you. a list to keep looking at that sits in your back pocket, keeps the day organised for me. the main concern with the shoot was light, or the potential lack of it. it was a large church without a lot of window light and hoped for the best with the weather, to illuminate as much as possible. luckily on the day, we found moments where the sun shone through the clouds forming wonderful light pockets. i'm sure it was a little annoying to some in the group but i kept the group moving around the place to follow the light as and when it shone through. you work with what you have on the day as a photographer, some compromises here, some luck there but when wonderful rays of light shine down on your subject, click, click, click...

    band / music video
  


i’ve been a photographer for over 10 years now and within that time at various events, i always had my eye on the guys with video rigs with a little envy. as time has gone by, my interest has grown to the point where i thought to myself, its time to splash the cash and buy some equipment and give this thing that has been haunting me for years to finally begin to create and make some videos.videography is a very different skill indeed with lots to learn technically but i love the ability to capture constant imagery rather than stills. it's completely immersive as you move around framing every moment. i really, really enjoy the discipline.as my skills have elevated with the technical side of things along with editing, i'm really confident now to go and create videos for anything. my love is still the sports side of things for brands but i really enjoy working with musicians and making videos that, like the way i create my photography, has a little more going on within than just recording what's happening.if you are an artist of any kind and would like to create something like the video above, give me a shout and let's discuss what's possible...

    corporate headshots, leeds
  


improve your corporate imageyour corporate image, your brand, is an integral part of how you project your business. how others on the outside of your business see you and make judgements, good or bad. so investing in a professional photoshoot is a must to get it looking not just right, but perfect! as a photographer i have spent years crafting my skills to be able now to speak to a new client, find out what they need pronto, set up a date in the diary and then complete the shoot. your corporate photography shoot will have virtually no interruption to your busy day.i have my own small studio if needed but more than happy to come visit you at your office, a location of your choice or if relevant, to your home. the high quality corporate headshot you will receive will be a bold statement showing who you are and how you go about your business. your competitors will be envious.

    musician portrait
  


i had a great time creating these actor headshots with phoebe last week in my garden studio. a fairly routine request for some headshots to use to send to casting agents. we successfully created those along with a few little more creative looks i wanted to add to the session.when creating actor headshots there are some fundamentals regarding the photography. first one of course, the photograph must look like you the actor. i'm sure there's a whole lot of disappointment when it comes to meeting an agent and the shot submitted doesn't quite fit with the person sitting on the chair. it needs to give a clear idea of who this person is, their face shape from multiple angles, showing any piercings, tattoos etc. also to show what your hair is like, tied up and down (if you have any) along with a longer shot so they can see your body shape.

    classical music photography
  


as a photographer, you can have a good range of subjects to photograph from one day to the next. in and amongst there are jobs that are a delight to be part of and create. my latest work with airedale symphony orchestra is such a pleasure to make photography and coming soon, some video work. my love for classical music has been with me all my life and being around at practice time with these lovely bunch of people is an amazing experience and place to work. i tend to hunt for images, finding those special moments within the space. i can be in the far corner of the room capturing the whole atmosphere of the place or shuffling on my bottom to get a close up of someone really playing and feeling the music. the sound from the orchestra at this distance you feel in your chest. it's so powerful. i have to admit at times, i just sat and listened.i'm looking forward to finishing up with the photography part of the project to then move onto creating a promo video, to help show the essence of the orchestra and what they do. for anyone who loves classical music in and around bradford, see them at their next concert. you wont be dissapointed.

    brand photography yorkshire
  


really enjoyed this session with casey, creating some fresh portraits for her to use on her website and help her project her brand as a film producer.the process began with a friendly chat on the phone. she explained what she wanted and we both came up with keywords that would be useful to keep at the forefront of our minds as we worked together on the day of the shoot. it's easy at times to let things run away with you in the creative process unless you keep focused.as these portraits needed to be a little more involved and moody than say a standard corporate headshot, i created a lighting set up on track with the brief. helped also with some inspirational cello music to resonate the tone of the shots.as a collection, casey can project to her industry colleagues a set of photographs she's now proud of.

brand documentaryi was asked by a brand to produce photography and video for their new range of running gear. i spent 2 days with harriot, the first shooting photos, the second capturing the video content. this was my first video project, created in october 2022. i was a complete newbie to video but wanted be involved in creating video for a long time. i was stopped by not having expensive video equipment and more so time to get into video work. but in time, i purchased the gear, learned the craft in my own time and made this video. its spring 2024 now and i can see some rookie work in the video but still, not a bad one for a first go.

composite photography - the art of illusionwhatever the sporting fantasy you have ever imagined, now is the time to make it happen. hit off the tee with a florida landscape behind you. push forward through the mud with the ball in your hands at a packed rugby stadium or ride at the front of the peloton, climbing up the french alps. all we need to do is photograph you with some strategic lighting, perhaps at your local area, or inside with a bit of space, then leave the photoshop magic to me.it could be for just you individually or a series of shots of your team, showing off your new sponsored kit. call me to discuss what you want and let's create something to make you smile...

had a wonderful 2hr session with kirsty. kirsty is an up and coming chef, food expert and blogger who wanted to move her brand forward. i helped identify her needs, direction and tone for her brand. the following week in my new studio, i created the look of a warm, homely kitchen with a strategic lighting set up to look like natural light and added few pots and pans, fairy lights in the background to finish the styling of the set.

corporate headshots. should you get a new one? and the reasons why to ask a professional to help…the shoot is an investment. if you get the right person to help it should be a fun experience helping you to feel even better about yourself and maybe a step in the right direction to help you move towards where you want to be.

    composite photography - making dreams come true…
  


composite photography - making dreams come true…i've been very lucky to have a background where design and photography have partnered up in varying amounts since i first sat at a computer way back when. design was a large part of my life until the love of photography returned to the surface again. as a photographer i tend to use adobe lightroom in the main but sometimes use photoshop to edit more if needed. this new batch of composite photography work however pretty much means both skills, photography and design work together as one to create the imagery.so as the year moves towards the festive side of things in the coming weeks, i will be creating portraits with a slight slant with all those warm and glowing feelings we hold in our memories associated with christmas. to create composite photographs that have a real festive feel in whatever shape or form. perhaps a child will be standing next to a polar bear in a snowy landscape, or another in front of an infinite field of candy canes. the list is endless...alongside those i'm working to create photography taken from the imaginations of a child. to create some composite imagery of whatever myself and the client can imagine. i can't wait!this first piece captures the imagination of two children taking to the sea, not on a boat but a suitcase for the adventure. the studio photography was taken with the appropriate light sources positioned in the right place. then placed on top of the background image, adding the foreground assets to create a fun composite image. the balance of photographing the subject and then matching it up to a relevant scene is a real challenge, to try make it look as real as possible.if you would like to create your child's magical adventures or even your own, drop me a line to discuss what's possible. perhaps your child wants to stand on the moon with a homemade flag and a cardboard spaceship in the background, or your daughter wants to fliy through the air with her flapping cape behind? or perhaps making a sporty dream come true for you? where you are photographed saving a shot on goal, jumping full reach across the pitch and in the background a packed stadium cheers. all done with a little help from a green screen and a little imagination...

good brand photography not only shows the product looking its best but gives potential customers viewing them the vision they can also wear the kit and look as great as the athlete in the shot. i help to create inspirational imagery that sells a lifestyle. showing athletes who are training, pushing their limits, using the kit and the kit being just what the athlete needs to be a better athlete. i like to create photographs that tell stories. stories that hopefully inspire a customer to pick up a garment or two and go out and exercise.

here's a few shots from a recent portrait shoot with jon. he contacted me to ask if i could help and thought why not explain a little for other future clients about what's involved in getting a portrait shoot.first off, why not ask the question, 'why do you need a portrait shoot?' whatever the need for the photograph of yourself, it can simply be just a great way to record who you are and what you look like right now. something to have and look at fondly in the future or to send on to your gran for her mantlepiece.

    pizza video promo
  


your video is created to be completely bespoke to you and fit perfectly with the right tone for your clients. communicating all the important details about you and what you do and not forgetting how awesome your product is.the video should be no longer than 1-1.30mins long. it needs to move quickly so your audience stays gripped and tells everything you need to say. it's amazing what can be illustrated in that time. the video needs to have some personality too. to say something about you if you think it's relevant or just be a highly polished piece that builds upon the quality product you produce.packages range of course in prices but i'm always happy to speak on the phone to assess what you need and help build together a well laid out, informative and engaging video.call me and lets discuss how i can help?

    band gig photography leeds
  


i love my music, always have, and to photograph at a gig is pretty much a pleasure doing so... as long as it's not a rick astley gig that is. sorry rick! :)along with a backstage video shoot, i photographed danny while he performed at his first large venue gig. he wanted some video and photography for upcoming tracks and promos he's going to release and it was great to speak with him and understand his new path as a pro musician. to help him create the right tone for the photography and video, aligning with his vision and brand.it doesn't matter to me if you are a thrash metal band or a dance dj. i can come up with creative imagery to suit the mood. i look at every project with new eyes, seeing what each client requires then work sympathetically ensuring the work fits its purpose. its experience i guess, being able to assess what a client wants and being able to just get on and get the job done. but that's what people pay me to do and do it well.let me know if you are a musician, band or artist of any kind and require some photography or video that tells your story. it always begins with a call and bash out ideas to find out what you want. i then put my thinking cap on and add to your ideas to create something that you are then proud to post on socials or as a video on youtube.drop me a line for a chat...
