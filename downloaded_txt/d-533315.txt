for your best in heating and air call belair


 



 



belair engineering is a woman-owned heating and air conditioning company located in upper marlboro. but our service area is far wider than that. we provide emergency and non-emergency hvac service to communities all over prince george's county including bowie, crofton, annapolis, odenton, gambrills, laurel, severna park, white plain, davidsonville, edgewater, shadyside, mayo, lanham, arnold, woodlawn, silver spring, waldorf, millersville, glenn dale, and fort washington.
        

 
            people in the above communities benefit from our wide array of hvac, fireplace, generator, and plumbing services. though we’re capable of a lot more, we’re often called on to handle ac and furnace repairs, backup generator installations, water heater installations, and new furnace or ac installations. you’ll find the plumbers and hvac technicians we send to perform these tasks are professional, clean-cut, and customer-focused.
        


 











 


question#1


 


what do i need to know if i'm installing a new air conditioner heat pump, ac, gas fireplace or water heater?


                    it actually takes a lot of time, money, staff, expertise, and licensing to get through the permitting process. unfortunately, things do not get easier when you move on to roughing in and final inspections. this is why it's important that you hire a professional hvac contractor or licensed expert to handle these installations. this will cost you more upfront but save you stress in the long run.
                





 


question#2


 


do i need a permit to install a new heat pump, ac, furnace, gas log, generator or water heater?


                    in most cases, the answer is a resounding yes.
buyer beware! many "reputable" contractors are not pulling required permits or getting the mandatory inspections completed on the equipment they install. make sure to verify that yours is doing things right before you authorize the work!
•  anne arundel county permits office
                        •  prince george's county permits office.






 


question#3


 


what happens if your contractor does not pull the required permits and, even more importantly, chooses not to have the work inspected?


                    if problems with your your heat pump, ac, gas fireplace, generator, or water heater should arise, your home owner's insurance likely won't cover the claim.
                    also, if you have to sell your home in the future, you'll probably have to pay to get the illegal work inspected and update it to ensure it passes current codes.
                














we offer factory-authorized repair for the following brands of furnaces, humidifiers, thermostats, and water heaters: carrier, trane, york, rheem, ruud, bryant, payne, duchane, ge, american standard, goodman, armstrong, heil, janitrol, aprilaire, fedders, lennox, luxaire, whirlpool, skuttle, honeywell, white rodgers, a.o. smith, and kenmore. though chances are, if you have it in your home, belair engineering and service company, inc. probably services it. the same goes for any preexisting water heaters, gas fireplaces, or standby generators.
                    
                    so, when you're looking for a good heating and air conditioning company near you, you can rest easy knowing you’ve come to the right place.
