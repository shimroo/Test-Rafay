silver dabblerthe silver dabbler is traditionally a top of the water loch style fly but when used on our big reservoirs it can be deadly when fished on a sinking line.

pearly daddythe pearly daddy is one of our most popular deadly fishing patterns, used equally throughout the season. 

the gold head of the pearly daddy helps it to sink deeper into the water column, where larger trout tend to swim, providing a highly effective presentation for anglers targeting these predatory fish. to maximize its effectiveness, the pearly daddy should be fished with twitches, which cause the back legs to pulsate and grab the attention of nearby trout. the legs of this fly are tied with small knots halfway down, mimicking the movement of a lifelike crane fly, making the pearly daddy a highly effective and realistic option for anglers.

it's a great choice for anglers fishing in clear and bright conditions, as the gold head and lifelike representation of a crane fly or daddy long-legs provides a highly visible and attractive presentation in the water. whether fishing in rivers, streams, or still waters, the pearly daddy is a versatile and productive pattern that is sure to bring success to anglers targeting a variety of fish species.

green snailsnails can make a great fly fishing pattern, either in the mid-summer heat or at the heart of winter, as they are a staple food source for fish; ever noticed any snails in the stomach of a fish that you have caught? why only fish flies and ignore a fish's staple diet?

in the summer months, if you notice snails floating on the surface use a floating line and a long leader and watch the line for the take, usually a gentle draw.

during the colder months when vegetation is scarce and trout are foraging for any available food source, the green snail becomes particularly effective.

if nothing is working, try attaching a snail to a weighted sinking line to force the foam snail to sink down to the depths where the fish are also sitting.

snails can varying from lentil up to large pea in size.

gold ribbed hare's earthe gold ribbed hare's ear is arguably  the  most effective fly of all time. it is not an imitation of any particular insect but instead a general representation pattern that is hugely successful in taking fish. 

whether tumbling down a feeding channel or gently retrieved in a still water this is a real killer. 

the scruffy, shaggy appearance of the hare's ear certainly appeals to both fly fishers and fish alike, so much so that if ever limited to one fly for the rest of their lives many anglers would choose the grhe.  

it is an excellent grayling pattern that is without doubt a must have pattern in any fly box.

apache blackthe apache black is probably the most exciting and devastatingly successful pattern to hit lakes, ponds and reservoirs.

its dark colour profile makes it an excellent imitation of natural insects, particularly in clear water conditions. the fly features a sleek, streamlined design with a hint of sparkle or flash to subtly catch the light.

the pulsing movement of the black mink body plus the stimulating flowing and eye catching movement of the marabou and flashabou tail make it a serious killer.

two to three short jerks followed by a steady retrieve, repeat and be ready for savage takes.

grey wulffthe grey wulff is a classic dry fly pattern that was first developed by american fly-fisherman lee wulff in the 1930s. the fly is designed to imitate the adult stage of the grey caddis, which is a type of caddisfly that is commonly found in the rivers and streams of north america.

it is usually tied with grey or dark gray coloured deer hair for the body, which mimics the natural colour of the grey caddis. the fly is tied to be bushy, high floating and to remain visible into the evening twilight, to mimic the natural appearance of the grey caddis.

the versatility and effectiveness of the grey wulff fly means it can be fished in a variety of water conditions, including rough water. it's also known for its ability to ride well on the surface of the water, which makes it an effective fly for targeting rising fish in fast water.

apache whitethe apache white is probably the most exciting and devastatingly successful fishing pattern to hit lakes, ponds and reservoirs.

the pulsing movement of the white mink body plus the stimulating flowing and eye catching movement of the marabou and flashabou tail make it a serious killer.

two to three short jerks followed by a steady retrieve then pause, repeat and be ready for savage takes.

griffith's gnatthe griffith's gnat is an extremely versatile fishing fly. this pattern gives a good working impression of an emerging midge fighting for its freedom, and therefore is best fished during sunny spells when midges are hatching.

the key to this patterns success lies in how it stands high on the surface film of the water. the tips of the hackle barbs leave tiny footprints on the surface of the water which mimic those created by the legs of a real insect. 

it can also makes an excellent grayling pattern.

sparkle pheasant tailthe sparkle pheasant tail is a real killing pattern that represents a highly desirable bug for trout and grayling in both england and america.

the added tinsel and flashback are genuine trigger points adding extra attraction to the fish, while the golden beadhead helps the fly sink quickly and maintain a consistent depth, making it ideal for fishing in still waters and fast-moving rivers. 

this can make a highly effective fly fishing pattern, especially during the colder months when fishing conditions can be challenging, as those big trout and grayling that sit quietly hugging the bottom are often tempted by this tasty looking morsel.

as the days start to get longer and the water begins to warm up, the activity of trout and grayling starts to increase, and the sparkle pheasant tail can be especially effective. its lifelike appearance and natural movement in the water can trigger predatory instincts in fish, making them more likely to strike. whether you're fishing in a rivers or lakes, the sparkle pheasant tail is a versatile and dependable fly that should be in every angler's fly box.

black midge klinkhammerthe black midge klinkhammer is one of the very successful and popular klinkhammer series of flies that represent many emerging insect forms.

the body penetrating the surface film is an exceptional trigger point as it gets seen by trout long before they see the surface footprint.

this fly is ideal whenever midges or gnats are on the water.
