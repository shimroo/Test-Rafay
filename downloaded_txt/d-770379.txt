alix olson is an internationally touring spoken word artist-activist. 
one part peace vigil, one part protest rally, and one part joyful raucous concert, alix ignites audiences everywhere she performs. howard zinn (historian/activist) calls alix âan ingenious poet, a brilliant performer, a funny person, a serious thinker. quite simply, extraordinary.â








 



âa red-hot, fire-bellied, feminismo-spewinâ volcano.plus she rhymes. listen to her now!â ~alison bechdel

about alix olsonâs word warriors
âitâs difficult to find role models whoâve stood up to the system and lived to tell the tale. each and every one of the writers in this collection is a role model for anyone who wants to change the world. and if iâm feeling scared, powerless, sad, or less than, this is the book i intend to read to get my courage up.â
âkate bornstein, author of hello, cruel world and gender outlaw
