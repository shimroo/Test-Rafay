this is fresno county
california with a different view, and a hell of a lot more.
this is the real and raw side of california. home to a diverse community with a deep pride in our area. once you're here, it's easy to see why. from thrilling outdoor adventures to the heartland of farm-to-fork dining. three national parks—yosemite, kings canyon, sequoia—stand within a 90-minute drive from fresno or clovis. here, the sun shines for more than 300 days of the year, making us a great stop in every season.
