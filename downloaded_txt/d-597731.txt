                      	 happy mother's day!
	                       
                          

hello moms,

what is the best worst job in the world? being a mother. it starts with what women give up to be a mother. first of all, your  pregnancy becomes everyone's business.  everyone gets to scrutinize what you eat drink, wear or do, and when you are your most exhausted state, you bring home a newborn that needs you more than anything in this world.

more than doctors, more than pretty clothes or a really cool nursery; more than money, hired help or the cutest booties, rattle, or stuffed animal that money can buy, your child depends upon you to be their everything. in the mean time, your boobs are now lower than they've ever been before. or maybe they are larger and more tender than you've ever known. they get squishy, stretch marks appear everywhere. you even smell differently than at any other time in your life. if you are nursing, these boob changes are not obvious right away, but any woman who's just given birth knows their body will never be the same.

as my mother told me, you'll never sleep the same way again. you'll always have an ear out for the baby monitor, phone, back door opening, door bell...never can a woman sleep tight and not let the bed bugs bite, when the bed bugs biting are nothing compared to the deep, committed, loving and protective feelings she has for her child. these feelings commit you to a lifetime of light sleep where you are always half alert to what your child might need or want. birth mothers or adopted mothers are totally the same when it comes to the overwhelming, paralyzing, incredible love you have for your children.

so to all mothers, keep in mind you are not alone. all other mothers know what you're going through. some of us wear the battle scars of being birth mothers; others have scars from not being a birth mother. we all are identical in the long run. we all adore our children and hope for the best for them. to all mothers on the eve of mother's day, i hope our children grow strong and healthy and end up to be good, kind, happy adults. at some point we have to say, we've done our part, now the rest is up to them. but i haven't found that magic age yet. 

happy mother's day!

                      	 this and that
	                       
                          

hello blogworld,

i've been having a lot of fun on pinterest.  tierneyo'hara is my screen name. it's the most seductive of all social media to me because it's so visual. i do have to become unaddicted and get some writing done though. 

i'd love to have a job creating pinterest pages.  i don't think there's a huge market for it though. sure is fun. just finished the first book in the hunger games trilogy. i wanted to be culturally literate and it's free on amazon lending library so i got it on my kindle fire. i enjoyed it; not a challenging read nor should it be as it's actually young adult fiction. i'm bummed though as i found out you can only borrow one book a month.

i guess i should have borrowed war and peace and gotten my no money's worth!

when i can tear myself away from pinterest, i'm still working for private clients and mostly textbroker clients. other than that i've been perfecting my fudge recipe...very good if i say so myself.

tomorrow i get some teeth crowned. i've come a long way in my fear of the dentist. of course if you have a fabulous dentist like mine, dr. ed kozinn, you'd see why i've gone from scaredy cat to brave as a lion.  well i'm a bit nervous -- but as soon as you get in the office the staff and the doc make you feel so safe and welcomed.

i left the garlic out of the rice pilaf i'm making just because i love my dentist so much! ;-)

ttfn

molasses candy from the rumford complete cook book 1930  (for my twitter buddies)2 cups molasses2 cups brown sugar2 tablespoons butter1/2 cup water2 tablespoons vinegar1 teaspoon soda (i assume baking soda)put all the ingredients, ecept the soda, into a large saucepan, and cook fast, till a little of the mixture dropped into cold water feels brittle (256 degrees f.) beat in the soda and turn onto a greased slab or agate tray to cool. as soon as it can be easily handled, pull with the fingers till white. cut into pieces before it is too hard.that's the whole recipe!
