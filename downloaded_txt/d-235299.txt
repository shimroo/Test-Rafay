about
 





after an epic dive trip leading to one of bill cleary's many deep water certifications, bill's instructor bob wilson suggested they celebrate at red's. bill fell in love with the bucolic new england style of the place and of course the fresh seafood. in 2014 after years of negotiating and other successful restaurant ventures, bill and his partner marisa tanner bought red's. with bill's attention to detail and marisa's outstanding management and customer service skills, red's has grown in popularity! positive changes are always being made without impacting the traditions that long time red's customers love. among these traditions is red's commitment to serving only the freshest seafood and providing unparalleled service.  the result is consistently excellent quality that fulfills our customers high expectations. we hope to welcome you to red’s soon!red’s is no longer a byob! we are now happy to offer a full selection of beer, wine, and cocktails!
