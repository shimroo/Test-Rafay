native spirit


thursday, february 27, 2025 | 6:30 to 9:00 p.m.
the scottsdale gallery association (sga) is pleased to announce the return of its native spirit gold palette artwalk on thursday, feb. 27 from 6:30-9 p.m.
the event takes place throughout the scottsdale arts district, which stretches along main st. from scottsdale rd. to goldwater blvd. and north of indian school rd. on marshall way to 5th ave., and within participating scottsdale gallery association member galleries.
“our native spirit artwalk is one of our most well-attended and unique events of the season,” said sga president jinger richardson. “we are honored to present the works of so many incredible native artists as well as art inspired by the vibrant native spirit that is so prevalent throughout our city.”
in celebration of the native spirit gold palette artwalk, native hoop dancing and singing performances by moontee sinquah (hopi, tewa, choctaw) and his sons will take place in the casa des artistes plaza at 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. in addition, sga members will be presenting the following specially themed events within their galleries:
king galleries scottsdale7077 e. main, #20king galleries presents its annual heard indian market show. the gallery will feature new work by more than 10 different native artists including tammy garcia (santa clara), les namingha (hopi-tewa), steve lucas (hopi-tewa), jared tso (diné), daniel begay (diné), robert patricio (acoma), autumn borts-medlock (santa clara) and others. the show takes place from 5-9 p.m. during the artwalk.
legacy gallery7178 e. main st.the legacy gallery is honored to host don supplee, a renowned hopi jewelry maker, whose original works will be available for viewing and purchase. this special event presents the rare opportunity for guests to connect personally with native american designers and learn the stories behind their exquisite creations. tsali hall (diné), director of palace jewelers, legacy gallery’s jewelry division, will also be present during the event. hall will guide guests through a curated collection of supplee’s extraordinary jewelry. complementing his work, the legacy gallery will also feature an impressive selection of museum-quality native american jewelry from other esteemed artisans. 
the marshall gallery7106 e. main st.during the artwalk, the marshall gallery is pleased to present the works of several highly acclaimed artists including david jonason (oil), alvin gill-tapia (acrylic), nic mcguire (glass) and nocona burgess (acrylic). a member of the comanche nation of oklahoma, burgess presents strikingly modern depictions of indigenous men and women from various tribal nations of north american. his paintings meld careful research, firsthand knowledge and raw passion. santa fe-born descendent from generations of new mexican ranchers, gill-tapia has a precocious talent in drawing, photography, weaving and ceramics. jonason uses his keen artistic talent and combines his love of architecture, landscape and design to create evocative paintings that transcend the angles and shapes of his subject scenes—unadulterated nature itself. with a dream of being an artist since he was a child, mcguire’s goal is to make original glass sculptures of the highest quality and does so using complex italian venetian pattern techniques combined with his own color palettes to produce his current series.
on the edge gallery7045 e. main st.in celebration of the native spirit artwalk, on the edge highlights the works of three artists, dean grissom, pat isaacson and peggy orbon, all of whom will be onsite during the event to meet and greet with guests. dean grissom, wood and ink artist, began his journey as an artist after retiring in 2016. he has met and interacted with many native american peoples whose art, culture, history and struggles influence his works. pat isaacson, fused glass artist, fell in love with glass art—first as a collector and then as an artist herself. her art has been featured in numerous arizona galleries and museums. she is a juried member of the sonoran arts league and the arizona designer craftsmen. peggy orbon was inspired by the dramatic colors, fantastic landscapes and the wonderful weather of arizona to being painting in pastels and oils. a member of the arizona plein air painters and a signature member of the arizona pastel artists association, orbon enjoys painting landscapes on location, as her main focus and interest are on how to capture the light as it appears in a landscape.
the signature gallery7177 e. main st.aligning with the native spirit artwalk, the signature gallery presents “voices and journeys”, a two-artist exhibition showcasing the works of acclaimed bronze sculptor star liana york and renowned oil painter b.c. nowlin, both of whom as new mexican artists with a profound connection to the many different cultures and heritage of the land. the exhibition explores many different narratives of the southwest. york has been sculpting pieces inspired by the people, animals and mythology of the southwest since 1985. nowlin’s deep-rooted appreciation for native american heritage and the natural beauty of america’s western landscape serves as a constant source of inspiration for his art.
territorial indian arts7100 e. main st., #3during the artwalk, the gallery will be presenting classic native american jewelry, both antique and contemporary. guests can also meet jesse robbins, mvskoke (creek) artist, working in the old ways of silversmithing. guests can browse his old style silver jewelry and territorial indian arts’ complete collection of early 20th century jewelry.
wilde meyer gallery4142 n. marshall wayin conjunction with the scottsdale gallery association’s native spirit gold palette artwalk, wilde meyer gallery presents a show of works that celebrate native american culture, including pieces by artists such as jim nelson and thom ross.





the gold palette artwalk brings together the finest art in scottsdale including 28 galleries and two museums — scottsdale museum of contemporary art and western spirit: scottsdale’s museum of the west. the scottsdale gallery association hosts its weekly artwalk most every thursday evening from 7 to 9:00 p.m. in partnership with the city of scottsdale, the sga also presents several gold palette artwalk events per year that feature a dedicated theme and activities specific to the theme including demonstrations and more.
