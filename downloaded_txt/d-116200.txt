japanese bee kites:
hard to find; eminently collectible; generally no longer available -- except here. 

these kites are known as hachi-dako (bee), semi-dako (cicada) and abu-dako (horsefly) in japanese. collectively the style of kite are known as traditional nagoya koryu kites. these insect kites all have hummers attached to sound like the insect. the kites are made from very old bamboo that has turned a deep rich brown. this bamboo is favored because it is very flexible, splits very well and can be bent into any shape.

most of this collection were crafted by kitemaster masaaki satoh. they measure roughly 12 inches tall. while they last at $100 each plus shipping.

chinese opera mask centipede
i came across this centipede on one of my last trips to weifang and had never seen anything like it. the head is an opera mask character with a flowing black beard. the 40 cells each have a different hand-painted opera mask character. pretty cool!

most chinese centipedes feature a dragon head multiple cells. they take some practice to fly, but make a real impact. 

this collectible needs to go. dragons this size are about $100 so we'll ask $150 plus shipping. if you've seen one like this before, let us know and we'll lower the price.

multi-function chinese dragon:
this is a treasure i brought back from weifang in 1989. it was an award winning kite then and i was fascinated with the mechanics and hand crafted gears that were powered by the wind to move the eyes, eyelids, jaw, and tongue. 

click here to 
see a movie.
while the kite has not been flown, it has been on display in my office. it is 30 years old and a bit fragile.,

this remarkable kite was made by zhang tianwei who hails from chinas northwestern city xian. you can learn more about him here.
complete with body cells and a solid crafted packing box. add it to your collection or send to your favorite museum for $750. thats what i paid for in in 1989.

caterpillar:  now the first thing you notice about this ground bouncer is the size of it. it is big. i mean really big! think of a school bus parked inside. it stretches 60 feet long and 15 feet tall. the other thing you quickly discover is that she is  designed with nothing for children to grab hold of. if you  fly big kites, you know this is significant. 

we're selling our big red/orange/black. well used. well loved. no damage.

delta conyne 12 stack: the "dc" is a high flying lifter that soars on the lightest breezes. they are specially designed so you can connect several together in a "kite train". just pass the flying line through the open center and tie it to the next kite's bridle point at ten foot intervals. 
each kite is 8 feet wide and 3.5 feet tall. we used to sell them for $44 each.
i have a set of 6 - one each - in rainbow colors. never flown. we'd like $200 for the set plus shipping.

big inflatable airplane:
are you a bomber pilot? stake this big boy out on the field and you'll have air superiority!
our big inflatable airplane can be flown dual-line but it really works much better tethered to the ground on two anchor points. 
we made one prototype and really enjoyed it. the piece was designed to sell at $950. you can take off for half that -- $475 - plus shipping.

spikey wheels:
it is hard to say goodbye to your fitrst love. but sometimes you need to let go
these big spinning wheels were definitely one of my first big kite loves. they were made in germany and introduced to the usa at the epcot kite festival back in ... well, back when we were all younger. 
four pieces. great shape. need to see some sky and fresh air. how about $1200 for the big bag.

big streamer set:
we  created this set of streamers and took it to france. the next year, we found it featured on a festival post card!

japanese painted kite skin 
some years ago, we acquired this kite sail on one of our trips to japan. loved it. but never knew that to do with it. hang on a wall. display as japanese art? frame it and fly it. instead it waited in a drawer for you...
hand painted on washi paper. measures 6 by 4 feet. we think $150 is a fair price.

gomberg kite productions and g-kites closed in 2020.
what a remarkable ride!
we incorporated in 1987. we have traveled the world, visited more than 50 countries, and attended a thousand festivals. we brought the newest and most interesting kite designs to the market. we flew for motion pictures, walt disney, the super bowl, and the london millennium celebration. we unveiled our first web page in 1996, published 600 weekly updates of news and travel, wrote four books, and opened three kite stores. we were president of the aka an unprecedented ten times and led the kite trade association three terms. we have been inducted into the kite hall of fame (next to ben franklin and the wright brothers!) and were presented the lifetime achievement edeiken award  twice (the second time we declined it which has never been done before or since). weve spent a lifetime spreading the joys of kiting, kite knowledge, and kite friendships. 

after 33 great years  we are ready for new adventures. 

we value each of you and our long association and friendship. thanks so much for being part of our lives and making our business something special. keep flying! keep smiling up at the sky. and keep spreading the joy.

good winds!
david and susan
