cyril van zeeland opened winnebagoland kawasaki in 1975 with his son, lee. by 1977, the business was booming. cyril’s second son, mark was hired on after his high school graduation raising the employee count to three. it was the beginning of a new age! in 1981, cyril’s youngest, joe finished school, and they were officially all working together to build winnebagoland. with four van zeeland's committed to customer service and quality, winnebagoland grew fast.


today, our store is owned and managed by lee’s three children, tom, nick, and rachel. with their guidance and a team of more than 60 employees, we strive to enhance the customer experience in any way we can through sales, finance, service, and fun events!
