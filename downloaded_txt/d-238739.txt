2024 strategic plan



board members volunteered for four work groups to develop goals, objectives and strategies: 1) financial support and sustainability, 2) governance, 3) programming, and 4) public awareness. under the supervision of various board committees, implementable tactics will be developed and include specific action steps, timelines, budget requirements and responsible parties for implementation, monitoring and evaluation at prescribed intervals, to ensure continuous improvement.
