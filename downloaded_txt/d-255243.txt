st. bernard’s offers able young boys of diverse backgrounds an exceptionally thorough, rigorous, and enjoyable introduction to learning and community life.  we wish to inspire boys to value hard work and fair play, to develop confidence, consideration for others, and a sense of citizenship, and to have fun while doing these things.




an ode to st. b's





it is important both to challenge boys and to show them great affection.

signature programs










leadership opportunities
st. bernard’s boys are given many opportunities to lead.  as early as middle school, boys may be voted captains of their intramural teams or representatives to student council, which meets with the headmaster every other week.












good heart program
kindness, honesty, consideration for others, and responsibility to one’s community have been pillars of st. bernard’s since its founding.  to formalize the teaching of these qualities the school has created a comprehensive program of character development.  












social justice
fifth graders take a full-year course, designed by our teachers and counselors, to learn about equity and justice. 












community service
service learning projects range from serving meals to the homeless, spending time with children who have cerebral palsy at daniel’s music foundation, to entertaining disabled veterans at james j. peters va medical center.  












assembly
every friday morning, just after 8:30, all students and members of the faculty and staff meet for assembly in the small gymnasium on the first floor.  we hear announcements, usually from the boys. 












public speaking
every boy from first grade upward will set foot on the stage at least once a year and perform for his fellow students.  boys have many opportunities to speak at st. bernard’s:  class play assemblies, presentations in class, recitations, and athletics reports for assembly.












shakespeare play
the eighth grade has performed a play by william shakespeare since 1910.  the shakespeare play is one of the most cherished of st. bernard’s traditions.  it is a group effort, with each boy contributing to its success.












class trips
a st. bernard’s education also offers boys in all grades many opportunities to learn about the world beyond 98th street.  our teachers plan trips to places here in new york and much farther afield.












guest speakers
speakers can enrich learning, and boys in all grades have the opportunity to hear speakers on a wide range of topics in the classroom or assembly.  each year an author speaks to the boys thanks to the kronengold authors fund, founded by a group of old boys in 2016.












class plays
class plays are big part of school life at st. bernard’s.  beginning in first grade, each class performs a class play before parents and before the entire school at a friday morning assembly.
