what happens if gib gets wet? understanding wet gib and more

 published:  september 8, 2023  / updated: september 8, 2023  tomothy moore  gib fixing, gib stopping, plastering 
 

 
the impacts of wet gib
if your gib board gets wet, it can spell trouble. water compromises the integrity of the gypsum core, leading to softening and potential disintegration. prolonged exposure to moisture can also lead to mould growth, posing health risks and further degrading the board’s quality. hence, auckland homeowners need to act swiftly when they spot wet gib.
 
factors influencing gib drying time:

ambient temperature
gib drying is significantly influenced by the surrounding temperature. just like how the sun dries our clothes faster on a hot day, gib drying benefits from warmer temperatures. cold days can make the drying process sluggish, especially in those auckland winters, where the drop in temperature can be notable.
humidity levels
moisture in the air is another paramount factor to consider. auckland, with its maritime climate, often experiences high humidity levels. suburbs like ponsonby might occasionally witness more humidity due to their proximity to the coast. when the air is already laden with moisture, it has less capacity to absorb additional moisture from wet gib. this makes the drying process more prolonged than in drier conditions.
ventilation
a well-ventilated room can be the saviour for wet gib. when there’s a continuous flow of air, moisture from the gib is carried away faster, facilitating quicker drying. however, homes that are tightly sealed, especially some modern constructions keen on energy efficiency, might not have optimal airflow. in these cases, using fans or dehumidifiers can be beneficial.
thickness of the gib
not all gib boards are created equal. thicker boards naturally take a longer time to dry out compared to their thinner counterparts. it’s essential to factor in the thickness when estimating drying time, especially for larger renovation projects.
type of joint compound used
different joint compounds have varying drying times. while some compounds are designed to dry faster, others provide more working time before setting, which means they might take longer to dry fully. it’s crucial to choose the right compound based on the specific needs of your plastering project.
previous water exposure
if a gib board has been exposed to water multiple times or for prolonged periods, its drying time might increase. repeated exposure can alter the gypsum’s structure, making it retain moisture more stubbornly. in such cases, it might be more prudent to replace the board rather than waiting for it to dry.
understanding the multiple factors affecting gib drying time is paramount, especially in auckland’s unique climate and setting. this knowledge ensures that homeowners can make informed decisions, whether it’s about waiting for the gib to dry or seeking the expertise of professional gib  stoppers in auckland.
 
auckland’s unique plastering challenges
plastering techniques may vary slightly based on auckland’s unique geography. for instance, homes in mount eden, nestled by the volcanic cones, might experience different moisture levels than those closer to the coast. this means plasterers in different suburbs must adapt their tools and methods to the local conditions.
 
gib stopping tools and materials
 
jointing compounds
gib stopping starts with jointing compounds, the backbone of the process. these compounds fill in the gaps and seams between gib boards, ensuring a seamless finish. auckland plasterers often have a range of these compounds on hand to cater to different project requirements:



ready-mixed: convenient for smaller projects, this compound comes pre-prepared.
setting-type: these compounds harden by chemical reactions and are typically used for bigger projects where drying time can be controlled.



trowels and broadknives
the application of joint compounds requires precision, and that’s where trowels and broadknives come in:



trowels: these flat tools are pivotal for spreading compound smoothly over broader surfaces. their shape allows for a more even pressure distribution, ensuring uniformity.
broadknives: available in various widths, broadknives are essential for filling and smoothing the joints between gib boards.



sanding tools
once the joint compound is applied and dried, achieving a flawlessly smooth finish requires sanding:



hand sanders: ideal for smaller areas, these offer precision.
pole sanders: for those hard-to-reach places, a pole sander provides the necessary extension without compromising on the finish.
sanding sponges: these are perfect for corners and tighter spaces, allowing for a gentle and even sanding.



corner tools
corners can be tricky, but with the right tools, they’re a breeze:



corner trowels: specifically designed for internal corners, these ensure a smooth and even application of the compound.
angle boxes: these devices dispense joint compound directly into internal and external angles, streamlining the process.



mixing tools
for those compounds that aren’t pre-mixed, a good stir is crucial:



mixing paddles: attached to a power drill, these ensure a consistent mix of the joint compound.
mixing tubs: a durable tub is essential for mixing your compounds, ensuring there are no lumps.



utility knives and saws
before the stopping begins, the gib might need some adjustments:



utility knives: perfect for cutting and shaping gib boards.
keyhole saws: ideal for making smaller cuts or holes in the gib, especially for electrical outlets.



the world of gib stopping is vast, and having the right tools and materials can make all the difference, especially in auckland’s diverse housing landscape. whether you’re looking to patch up a small area or renovate an entire room, understanding these tools is vital. however, mastering their use is a craft in itself, which is why many aucklanders opt for the expertise of professional gib stoppers to ensure a top-tier finish.
 
local council bylaw requirements
before embarking on any gib stopping or fixing project, aucklanders should familiarise themselves with the auckland council’s bylaws. for instance, certain regulations pertain to homes within heritage sites in some suburbs. therefore, residents of places like grey lynn need to be especially cautious and might require permits before undergoing significant plastering changes. always consult with your local council or a knowledgeable plasterer to stay compliant.
 
why engaging professional plasterers is crucial
gib stopping might seem straightforward, but it requires skill, especially when navigating the complexities of auckland’s diverse suburbs and council regulations. here’s why hiring professionals is the wise choice:

expertise: professional plasterers have the experience to handle challenges unique to each project.
quality finish: gib stoppers auckland residents can hire will ensure a seamless, smooth finish, enhancing your home’s aesthetic.

the final verdict on wet gib
dealing with wet gib isn’t merely about letting it dry. there’s a lot more at play, especially in a region as diverse as auckland. from understanding the intricacies of local bylaws to employing the right tools for the job, it’s clear that plastering isn’t a one-size-fits-all task.
when it comes to gib stopping auckland homeowners need a tailor-made approach. and that’s precisely what plasterers auckland brings to the table. with their understanding of local nuances, from mount eden’s unique environmental challenges to grey lynn’s heritage regulations, these experts can deliver impeccable results every time. so, for those looking to embark on a home renovation journey, it’s clear: engaging a gib stopping/gib fixing contractor is the way forward. after all, your home deserves nothing but the best!

how to stop a gib board in auckland

 may 3, 2023   tomothy moore  blogging 


if you have a gib board in your home, you may wonder how to stop it. gib boards are made of gypsum and paperboard and can be very explosive. they are one of the most common materials used in home fires. fortunately, you can do a few things to help prevent a gib board fire.

1. use proper ventilation when cooking.
one of the leading causes of gib board fires is improper cooking ventilation. when you cook on the stovetop, use the exhaust fan to remove any smoke or steam from the room. it would help if you kept an eye on what you were cooking and never left the stove unattended.
2. don’t overload outlets.
another common cause of gib board fires is overloading outlets. be sure not to plug too many appliances into one outlet, and never use an extension cord with a high-wattage appliance like a hair dryer or space heater. if you need to use an extension cord, make sure it is ul certified and has the correct rating for the appliance you’re using it with.
3. keep lint filters clean.
if your home has lint filters, be sure to clean them regularly. lint buildup can easily catch fire, so keeping the filters clean and free of debris is essential. you should also avoid drying clothes on radiators or other heat sources that could ignite the lint.
4. don’t store flammable liquids near a heat source.
flammable liquids like gasoline, kerosene, and alcohol should always be stored in a cool, dry place away from any heat source. if possible, store them outside the house in a shed or garage. if you must keep them inside, put them in a cabinet or closet that is not near any heating vents or appliances.
5 . keep matches and lighters out of reach of children.
matches and lighters are another common cause of gib board fires. be sure to keep them out of reach, and teach your kids about fire safety as early as possible. it’s also essential to have working smoke detectors in your home and to practice your family’s escape route in case of a fire.
gib boards are highly flammable and can easily catch fire if not correctly cared for. these simple tips can help prevent a gib board fire in your home.
