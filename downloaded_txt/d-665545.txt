first parish of norwell offers individual freedom of belief within our caring community. join us as we learn and grow together and contribute to a more just world.



how is this church different from others?



as unitarian universalists, we are about deeds, not creeds. when we say that we are a community where “love works” we mean that our actions are our prayer. we are also a group of theologically diverse people. some of us do not believe in a higher power, others do. some of us connect to the eternal through nature or personal relationships, others through scripture. we come together to explore questions about the eternal together, in a supportive covenantal space and then we take our work out beyond our doors to build a just world.if you would like to join us, we would welcome you among us and would offer you our love and support in the religious quest that has no end.

“when i needed food or rides to treatments, when i was ill or if my husband or son needed assistance, there was always someone from the church who stepped in with what i needed.  friendship and help are two things first parish does particularly well”

prue miller 








“we wanted our children to hear our views about equality and social responsibility reinforced by an institution that echoes our family’s values. i love that they’ve gotten a background in many world religions and feel empowered to choose their own beliefs. this knowledge of world religions will also help them in their studies of the humanities as well.  their first parish experience has prepared them to think for themselves”

amanda adams








“after moving to the south shore, our family decided first parish norwell would provide a good experience consistent with my humanist/atheist beliefs as well as my wife’s more traditional christian worldviews.  we have greatly enjoyed the friends we have met and the numerous activities of the parish.  i have enjoyed being a member of the choir since i arrived at fpn.  i also greatly appreciate, and like participating in first parish community dinners and chairing the climate justice working group.  i find meaning in these projects as well as the other important work of the first parish service committee.”

first parish of norwell



first parish of norwell, gathered in 1642, is a non-creedal church where all individuals and families can evolve spiritually, morally, and intellectually through worship, education, service, and outreach to our community, locally and globally.  we are a welcoming congregation, unified by our covenant, that provides a place where all persons are respected and cherished, and share mutual care, love, and support; an environment for personal and communal exploration of truth and meaning; and a forum for the discussion of contemporary issues and a catalyst for peace and justice, rooted in our shared history and informed by our unitarian universalist principles.
