there's anything else you'd like to see, my address is listed below.

world, north american, us, amateur, canadian,
women & lightweight records lists or see ...
todd mcdougal's combined open and masters records list (pdf) or the smaller version
record progression lists
a few miscellaneous videos - more to come
frame-by-frame photo sequences (work in 
progress)
a wee bit (and more!) of history (updated march 21, 2006)

when and where to find games
if you want compete in the games, tony dziepak's site
scottish heavy
athletics
has great information on training, technique, equipment and more.
highland games in the news? no, it doesn't happen often. but when it
does, you're likely to find it
at "highland games 
news" at celticgrove.com, or
via
google.
various images - this is the first part of
a photo gallery, which will mostly feature athletes from the 1880s through 1980s.


this site (such as it is) will focus on athletics,
specifically heavy events, in
the highland games. here are a couple of links to try if you're interested
in
piping or
dancing.
contact me at agm@highlandgames.net.

note: masters records are kept at scottishmasters.org. however, masters records for the 56lb weight for height, and 20lb sheaf are not being kept on that site, since the standard weights in masters competitions are 42lbs and 16lbs. these records are now being kept here, on the main records page. accurate masters records for the 56lb weight for distance may be difficult or impossible to compile, but i'm looking into it.
