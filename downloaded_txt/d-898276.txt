 welcome to red hat bugzilla


    thank you for visiting red hat bugzilla.  red hat bugzilla is the red hat bug-tracking
    system and is used to submit and review defects that have been found in red
    hat distributions.  red hat bugzilla is not an avenue for
    technical assistance or support, but simply a bug tracking system.  if you submit a
    defect, please provide detailed information in your submission after you
    have queried red hat bugzilla to ensure the defect has not been reported yet.
    defects will go directly to the engineer responsible for the component you
    filed the defect against. engineers have many responsibilities and will get to
    your defect in due time.
    

    if you are a red hat customer with an active subscription, please
    visit the  red hat customer portal  
    for assistance with your issue.
    

    if you are a fedora project user and require assistance, please consider using one
    of the mailing lists we host for the fedora project.
