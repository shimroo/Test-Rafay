i cannot understand that i did not open the new blog year until now...where did the time go?i cannot describe how it is to danish outside denmark these days. it is very surreal - i can see in the danish medias that the mohammed cartoons take up a lot of space...but here in the netherlands it is mentioned now and then. it is known but not central news down here. i guess distance also can be a filter in this sense.taking a walk always brings interesting pictures along:

the five symbols on the cryptophyle web page are (according to the religious symbols dictionary linked on the same page):1. tau crossthe cross is one of the oldest religious symbols of all time, from the prehistoric solar cross (an equal armed cross), to the cross adapted from pagan cults for christian use after the council of nicaea. cross symbols are among the oldest on earth, and are found in every culture. crosses are almost invariably symbols of the sun, the sky, and the passage of time, and are linked with most solar deities.2. solar cross/alchemy: copper alloythe solar cross is probably the most ancient spiritual symbol in the world, appearing in asian, american, european, and indian religious art from the dawn of history. composed of a equal armed cross within a circle, it represents the solar calendar- the movements of the sun, marked by the solstices. sometimes the equinoxes are marked as well, giving an eight armed wheel.3. ouroboros/alchemy: volatilitythe ouroboros is a greek word, and means "tail swallower." the ouroboros is usually depicted in the form of a snake swallowing its tail, and is usually circular, although it is sometimes depicted in a lemniscate shape. the ouroboros originated in egypt as a symbol of the sun, and represented the travels of the sun disk. in gnosticism, it was related to the solar god abraxas, and signified eternity and the soul of the world. in alchemy, it represents the spirit of mercury (the substance that permeates all matter), and symbolizes continuous renewal (a snake is often a symbol of resurrection, as it appears to be continually reborn as it sheds its skin.), the cycle of life and death, and harmony of opposites. a double ouroboros (two creatures swallowing one another) in alchemy signifies volatility. 4. sun/alchemy: goldthe astrological glyph for the sun, and the alchemical symbol for gold. this symbol originated in ancient egypt as a symbol for the sun god re. 5. saturn/alchemy: mercuryrepresents the planet saturn, and it corresponding alchemical metal, lead. alchemically, lead was the prima matera, or primal matter, and represented putrification and decay. and then what?!
