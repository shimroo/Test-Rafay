things which i have made over the last several weeks





1.  cammo soaker pants: still in progress...learning kitchener graft, and need to do the legs.2.  jayne cobb hat from firefly for myself: still in progress, need to do earflaps and pom pom3.  very cute variegated purple and blue coin purse for drew, my friend's daughter: in progress, need to sew a button on so it closes...assuming drew lets me at it long enough to do it.4.  sample: learning how to knit a snowflake pattern from a stitch book...turning out well, i think.i also bought some cable needles so i can play with cabling again.i've otten so much back into the knitting...i love it.  my brain has been soothed from too much stress.  :p

sheesh.





this blog's getting more comment action than my main one!!so, i've been knitting very little, although i've got a couple gift-y things planned.  i've learned how to crochet (kinda sorta) and i'm tatting like crazy.  that's my craft stuff.i guess i should be thankful for the spammer...it made me pay attention to here again.i've been doing teacher training, so there's been less time for most stuff.  i'm thinking of changing this to a less knitting-based blog and more craft based, since i'm doing a lot of other fibre art now.
