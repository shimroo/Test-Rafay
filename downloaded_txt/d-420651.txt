somewhat to my disappointment, i've realized that the vast
      majority of my website is now encapsulated in my cv, and so have
      replaced my old, stunningly dated pre-css
      website with this document. but if you're looking for my 1998 to 2008 photos or
      my small collection of recipes
  instead of information here, please help yourself.

teaching and advising


i believe teaching is an
            important part of a reflective research practice, and i
            continue to integrate it into my work as a industrial
            researcher. i teach with an emphasis on rapid prototyping,
            user-centered approaches, iterative design processes, group
            work and reflective design. i encourage learning from group
            projects for real-world clients, such as local farmers and
            community outreach projects. i taught stanford's cs247 human
 computer interaction studio in 2014 (with john tang, 80 students) and 
2015 (with six collaborators, 120 students). i 
            co-taught designing liberation technology in 2013 and 
coached
            multiple classes in design and cross-cultural work, all at
            stanford.  i have also judged
            various final class presentations and masters projects at
            both stanford and berkeley, and been on the committee for
            ph.d and masters students at cu boulder, california college of the arts, simon fraser university 
and the university of cape town.
