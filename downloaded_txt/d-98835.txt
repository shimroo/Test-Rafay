	 heidi sees horses
	 
    


august 2010  my mommie was riding around taking pictures of roaming ryan and she drove by the civic center and the arena and they were having the dightman rodeo and she stopped and took pictures. i was not afraid. i didn't bark and scare the horses or nothing.

my mommy has turned me into a celtic thunder dog.  she listens to their music all day long and chats on their forum.  i am pretty tired of this as it leaves less time for me.  she should pay attention to me, but she goes straight to the computer to see what's happening to her favorite group.  i think i will run away from home, but i'll wait until after lunch.

i had an adventure yesterday. just as we got to my g-mother's house, i spied an arrogant little creature tresspassing. my mommy's hands were full, so i managed to fly across the street and into the neighbor's yard.my mommy was frantically calling me, but i didn't care.

	 dog food recall
	 
    


my mommy was feeding me that really bad dog food with rat poison in it.  well, it could have.  i was lucky.  as soon as she found out about it, she took it back to the store and got a different kind.  i like the old kind best, but i guess i have to sacrifice.  i feel so badly for the poor little cats and dogs that got sick and dead from it.  i think all pets should be fed steak and baked potato.  maybe the cats would rather have salmon or something else really good and expensive.
