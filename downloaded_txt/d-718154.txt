the department of history

















                                                why study history?
              




the world around us right now is the product of history.
tracing the turning points and individual actions that built the present helps make sense of the world around us and points to ways that we can make a difference in the future.
history students develop practical, marketable skills that transfer into a wide range of workplaces. 
our classes focus on how to:

find and make sense of data ;
apply critical thinking to that information;
and effectively communicate an analysis to a broad audience.

research, analysis and communication are in-demand skills.
your history degree applies to a career in education, business, journalism, government, law and the non-profit sector.
for more information about career opportunities, see: what can i do with my history degree? and our alumni page.

the university of calgary, located in the heart of southern alberta, both acknowledges and pays tribute
            to the traditional territories of the peoples of treaty 7, which include the blackfoot confederacy
            (comprised of the siksika, the piikani, and the kainai first nations), the tsuut’ina first nation,
            and the stoney nakoda (including chiniki, bearspaw, and goodstoney first nations). the city of calgary
            is also home to the métis nation of alberta (districts 5 and 6).
the university of calgary is situated on land northwest of where the bow river meets the elbow river,
            a site traditionally known as moh’kins’tsis to the blackfoot, wîchîspa to the stoney nakoda, and
            guts’ists’i to the tsuut’ina. on this land and in this place we strive to learn together, walk
            together, and grow together “in a good way.”
