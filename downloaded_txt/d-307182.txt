understanding the criminal justice system
the brilliance of the united states constitution is the separation of powers. it is the separation of powers that keeps our political leaders from becoming tyrants. far too often politicians and some members of the media play on the fears of the public to gain political support or ratings. as benjamin franklin famously said "those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty or safety." 
many paint criminal defense lawyers as part of the problem, as individuals that obstruct the system from working properly, as individuals that stop law enforcement from getting the "bad guys". people who think this way do not understand our constitution and the way that our system was designed to work. these people do not understand that criminal defense lawyers do not obstruct the system, they are one of the protections built into the system. criminal defense lawyers are in the united states constitution, we are in the sixth amendment along with the right to trial by a jury. state prosecutors, state judges and local law enforcement are not in the constitution, they are part of the political system, which is what the constitution was created to protect us from.
