mercedes benz c class

it’s amazing what a bodykit and a set of larger alloy wheels can do for a car.car rental uk national car rentaltake the new mercedes-benz c-class. in its standard form it’s a perfectly attractive car, but adding some select amg bodystyling parts turns it into a far more noticeable and desirable model.car rental ukthe amg kit comes as standard when you upgrade to sport trim and gives the c-class much more in the way of visual clout, from the chunky six-spoke alloys to the deeper front and rear bumpers and prominent three-pointed star nestling in the front grille.car rental uk national car rentalit looks the part, which is good news in a sector where drivers prefer their car to look sporty (think audi s line and bmw m sport).car rental uk alamo car rentalthe subject of this test is the ultimate incarnation of the recently-launched c-class estate (discounting the extreme c63 amg).the c320 cdi sport tops the regular range and makes a convincing case as a desirable all-round car.car rental ukoutside is the aforementioned sports styling pack while under the bonnet is the common rail 3.0-litre turbodiesel v6 engine that also plies its trade in the larger e, clk, s, r, ml and gl models.so, as the smallest car to package this engine, it’s fair to assume that the c320 cdi isn’t short of power.car rental uk national car rentalwith 224bhp and 376lb-ft of torque, this engine delivers effortless performance through the standard-fit seven-speed automatic gearbox.this performance is delivered with such smoothness that it would be hard to argue for the merits of the petrol c350 v6.

mazda

it’s normally at about this time, a few months into the ownership of a new car, that i start finding the things i don’t like about it.car rental ukafter the initial rush of picking up a new machine and revelling in its freshness, the novelty wears off and little niggles begin to emerge, stimulating enough of my wrath to easily fill a page with ranting.which is why it has been extremely annoying to find that the mazda6 i took custody of at the beginning of the year has so far been completely dependable.national car rentali mean, how dare mazda put together a car that has developed no discernable major faults and draws admiring glances most times i take it out?car rental uk national car rentalare they trying to put me out of a job?well, they won’t get away that easily.ok, so the visual impact of the car and its sports appearance pack hasn’t worn off yet.alamo car rentalit still looks sleek and mean, and barely a few days go by without someone asking me about the car when i’m at the supermarket or filling up with diesel.car rental uk national car rentaland, admittedly, the engine has bedded in nicely and continues to impress with its smoothness and refinement once up to temperature.yes, it’s very comfortable for hours on end, with seats that are supportive when the going gets twisty and fitted in just the right way for an ideal driving position.but so what?as a fleet news employee, it is my duty to uncover faults and deride what needs to be derided. car rental uk national car rentallittle things like an increasingly satisfying gearbox and perfectly spaced aluminium pedals won’t throw me off, and neither will the excellent bose stereo and auxiliary input socket that allows me to listen to my ipod.sure, the handling is excellent, the boot spacious and the back seats easily accommodating for three adults.but that won’t stop me savaging it like the cynical hack i am.oh no. car rental uk

renault koleos

renault hasn’t done a ‘proper’ 4x4 before, save for the megane scenic rx4 a few years ago.that was described as a crossover vehicle – a cross between an mpv and a four-wheel-drive. car rental uk national car rentalthe new koleos, however, is different – it’s a crossover vehicle that offers “mpv levels of comfort and genuine off-road ability”… wait, hang on a minute. car rental uk national car rentalok, so maybe renault has done a crossover before, but as far as the french carmaker is concerned, the rx4 didn’t count.it placed emphasis mostly on the mpv side of things, whereas the koleos is far more geared to off-roadness. car rental uksort of. guy salmonthe koleos marks the start of a concerted effort by renault to branch out into the world of 4x4s, and although it says it doesn’t want to just rebadge an existing off-roader, this new vehicle shares its underpinnings with technology swiped from its partner nissan.car rental uk national car rentalthe koleos is, essentially, an x-trail in a fancy french chapeau.this is no bad thing, as the x-trail has proven credentials over the rough stuff, and renault is counting on these skills to establish its own credibility in the sector.car rental ukthe koleos comes with either full four-wheel drive or front-wheel drive, aimed at those for whom the driveway of their house is as off-road as they will ever get.national car rentaland herein lies the problem.the koleos has some decent off-road capability, but renault admits that very few customers will actually use the thing beyond the school-run and motorway journeys.car rental ukthis is a vehicle designed to show the world that renault can do capable 4x4s, even if no-one will take advantage of its technology. guy salmonof course, one could level the same observation at the likes of range rover et al. car rental uk

ford kuga

you really can’t fault ford’s consistency, on two counts.firstly, if there’s a niche going strong, it will be years after everybody else has done it before the blue oval joins in with one of its own products.secondly, when ford brings out new products these days, invariably they are of the very highest quality. car rental uk national car rentalthe new ford kuga pretty much ticks these two boxes.so slow to market, it’s behind even the usually glacial decision-making process of volkswagen, yet in nearly every way it oozes quality, style and sophistication. car rental us national car rentaleven the name is spot-on, sounding like chunky lion king pup simba’s younger brother, and reflecting its compact, muscular appearance.indeed, in a sector where looks and image are vitally important, ford’s director of design martin smith has aced it with the kuga, taking the four-square suv proportions that attract families and imbuing it with little flourishes here and there that make it the best looking of its kind on the market in my eyes. guy salmonthen there’s the driving dynamics, which ford reckons are class-leading, a solid dependable diesel engine, a wide range of lifestyle options and equipment, strong residual values and class-leading co2 figures.before you ask, this isn’t an advertorial paid for out of ford’s advertising budget, and i apologise if it sounds like one, but this really is a fantastic car.alamo car rentallet’s temper things before it gets too sycophantic.there are no door bins on the back doors, which is ridiculous.and if it’s raining, water will disastrously leak on you through the split rear tailgate when it’s open. car rental ukmake sure your drivers understand these inadequacies before opting for three years of limited storage and wet-necked hell.ford has only 6,000-7,000 kugas to sell in the uk annually, as production is limited. car rental us national car rentalthat means there will be plenty of disappointed customers who didn’t act quickly enough.of those available, it is reckoned that around two-thirds will be retail sales. car rental uki’d think this was utter tosh at the best of times – with the lowest co2 in its class, priced at around £20,000 and made by the fleet industry’s largest manufacturer, i’d be amazed if only a third went to fleets.but ford has a bit of a thing about talking up its retail share at the moment, and it’s a message that is getting repeated often enough to make you think there’s a deliberate communication strategy going on.whatever the theory of the marketing, what are the 2,000 lucky company car drivers going to get with the kuga? national car rentalapart from the handsome appearance, the interior also feels well made, clear and functional without being dull, with enough space front and rear without being exceptional (it is built on the focus platform, after all).there are two trim levels – zetec and titanium – with the first starting at £20,500 and the higher model at £22,500. car rental ukthe zetec has interior colour styling cues inspired by trainers and sports bras, with flashes of blue or orange across the seats and doors.the titanium’s more low-key colour scheme works much better.

saab 95

chancellor turns his back on biofuels, says saabin response to the chancellor’s announcement that the fuel duty rebate for biofuels will expire from 2010 jonathan nash, managing director of saab great britain,car rental uk ‘fears that the government has turned its back on biofuels. car rental uk national car rental’‘i am deeply disappointed that the chancellor has announced the removal of the fuel duty rebate for biofuels from 2010.car rental uk alamo car rental the lack of long term consumer incentives for the use of high blend biofuels is a clear indication of the government turning its back on this technology.car rental uk national car rental’‘although the chancellor has stated he will encourage the development of sustainable biofuels by increasing the buy-out price for suppliers under the renewable transport fuels obligation, we are fearful that this will do nothing to encourage the use of e85 and could drive up the cost of eco-friendly bioethanol e85 at the pump for the consumer.car rental uk’‘the uk continues to fall behind other european countries where a more generous package of incentives is encouraging consumers and fuel providers to embrace this exciting technology right now, and reduce the environmental impact of their new car purchase. car rental uk

chrysler concept cars

combining refinement, function and style, the chrysler nassau concept explores a new expression of the chrysler brand. the four-door, four-passenger chrysler nassau luxury coupe is, a more emotional and artistic articulation of what it means to be a chrysler. car rental uk national car rentalthough built on a full-size 120-inch wheelbase, the nassau appears more visually compact than a comparable chrysler 300c. car rental uk national car rental though the arc of the roof resembles that of a coupe, the chrysler nassau concept is in fact a four-door hard top with front and rear side glass that retracts fully, revealing the absence of an above-the-belt b-pillar. the crisp but fluid a-line that closes slightly against the rising belt is also of particular note. car rental uk alamo car rentalfronting the long hood is a new interpretation of the eggcrate chrysler grille, rendered in chrome and satin aluminium. bracketing the grille and sweeping rearward nearly to the wheel openings, the long, narrowing headlamps and their upper chrome brows combine with the rising sculptured line of the upper fascia to subliminally evoke the uplifted wings of the chrysler badge. car rental uk national car rental stepping into the chrysler nassau, one enters a new world of luxury specially designed to a younger, aspiring audience. the presiding interior theme is one of flowing seamless sculpture composed of leathers and fabrics derived from futuristic architectural interiors. car rental uk the instrument panel is a showcase for new technologies in data display, personal control interface, and home theatre-inspired entertainment. gear selection is accomplished via a pod control mounted on the instrument panel while the steering wheel incorporates auxiliary paddle shifters. alamo car rental
