    what our customers say

    
  we have decided to make an aluminum lid for the chamber you fabricated for us last winter, as well as a lid for one of our smaller chambers. we are very pleased with the quality of your chamber and would like to improve the vacuum for this entire system.
justin griffith - university of colorado, physics



 
  the cube with ti windows is connected to the beam line at cern-isolde facility and ready for radioactive-ion beam. the foils are performing very well, they seem to be perfectly light tight, we do not see any noise due to optical photons in the windowless si(li) detector that is located in the vacuum chamber.
martin venhart - cern



 
  damn those atlas things are good! we're off scale in the chamber with your multiple tsp's. might be able to say that we're in 13 scale vacuum......very nice! you guys should go market the hell out of these... congrats!
mike ackeret - transfer engineering



 
  the tailpiece with atlas al window worked very well. it held vacuum and performed as we had hoped. we were able to get some very good low noise scattering data in just a few minutes using the high intensity of the nomad beam line. we're just now analyzing the data.
dr. kenneth f. kelton - director, & arthur holly compton - professor of physics, institute for materials science & engineering



 
  we have been working with atlas for many years using their atlas cf flanges and explosion bonding capability for assemblies such as beryllium windows. when we had a need for a dipole magnet vacuum chamber, atlas competed with vacuum equipment manufacturers worldwide and won the bid, beating out stainless steel vendors in europe and russia by a large margin. this is a large chamber ~2.9 m long with two 50 mrad acceptance aperture ir beamlines tangential to the synchrotron electron beam orbit. all flanges including e-beam orbit, synchrotron radiation ports and pumping ports were fabricated from atlas cf flanges. in addition to the demanding geometrical constraints of the dipole magnet the chamber was required to absorb all excess synchrotron radiation not entering the beamlines and resist any deformation due to forces incurred under vacuum. atlas presented a preliminary design for approval before fabrication and conducted a complete fea analysis of the chamber studying both the thermal loading and the vacuum deflection. atlas fabricated the chamber in two halves with each half having a water cooling surface machined into the chamber. the two halves were welded together and final machining brought the chamber overall thickness tolerance and chamber radius of curvature tolerance to less than 1mm. the chamber is presently installed in the camd synchrotron in bending magnet 2 and attains a base pressure less than 5 x10-10 torr without bakeout.
kevin morris, center for advanced microstructures & devices



 
  the spectrometer was installed in february, and commissioned in march and it was very successful! the resolution was great. thank you again for doing a great job with the spectrometer, it was very appreciated!
michael holmes & bill schlotter, slac national accelerator laboratory



 
  during my tenure at ovonic ecd (united solar) i was very pleased with the service and quality we received from atlas technologies. before working with atlas all of our thin film photovoltaic production line was manufactured out of stainless steel. atlas assisted us in converting the drive and transition chambers to aluminum; this created a substantial (50 to 60%) cost savings. by using the standard weld-on bimetallic atlas at- cf flanges we were able to eliminate o-rings and reduce contamination. the quality of the chambers and equipment we have received from them has been exceptional. furthermore when we commission their chambers it has become worry-free for our installation crews. we maintain a very aggressive production schedule and they have always been accurate, up-front and on time with their delivery commitments. they also price themselves aggressively. i strongly recommend atlas technologies for future work.
george uzoni - formerly, design supervisor, energy conversion devices



 
  this addition (atlas manufactured aluminum loadlock chamber) significantly improved our processing time. the atlas chamber was delivered on time and is of very high quality workmanship, and is performing flawlessly. 
dr. craig outten - research development scientist, denton



 
  the part came into today!  i cannot believe that you guys were able to turn around a custom part that quick.  it looks perfect! thank you so much for helping me work through this part and getting an awesome end result.  two thumbs way up!
james m. somers - mechanical engineer, atk military systems



 
  atlas was terrific to work with on our recent order of vacuum chambers. communication from the production supervisor was proactive and ongoing throughout fabrication, the quality of work was outstanding, and delivery time was faster than expected. couldn't be more satisfied!
derek yegian - engineer, euv tech



 
  all the chambers have performed very well, met our specifications, and they were beautiful!
sergei nagaitsev - deputy director, fermilab



 
  atlas technologies is one little diamond in a vast wasteland of good intentions. their bimetal and aluminum products and problem solving, (a very unique skill set) are so...valuable.
john skaritka - mechanical engineer, brookhaven national labs



 
  atlas technologies has a very unique skill-set that is very special. they are the only ones in the country (the world)  who really know aluminum and they have the ability in bimetal that enables them to solve so many uhv & xhv problems and do so much.  they are also very good to work with., really great people!
john skaritka - mechanical engineer, brookhaven national labs

    next generation vacuum systems: aluminum


 october 3, 2024

written by: richard bothell and justin bothell, atlas technologies; glen tisdale, judith offerle, uhv aluminum company                                                                                     achieving sub-micron feature sizes on a production basis requires an understanding of the complete processing environment including the vacuum reactor itself. molecular level chemical contamination demands that all processes factor in the vacuum environment. the vacuum system base pressures are a critical parameter in determining the environmental contribution to wafer contamination. actual processing levels may be decades above the base pressure, but the base pressure establishes the environmental noise of the system.




   

    customer highlight: dynavac

our customers at dynavac were crucial participants in a compelling project for nasa’s magnetospheric multiscale mission at the goddard space center.                                                      the solar terrestrial probes mission were scheduled to fly four identically instrumented satellites to investigate how the sun and earth’s magnetic fields transfer energy from one to the other. this transfer, called magnetic reconnection, affects space weather and by studying it, scientists at nasa gained the ability to observe how this process affects systems like communications networks, gps navigation, and power grids back on earth.                                                                                                            dynavac, an industry leader in the design and manufacture of thermal vacuum systems, supplied the project with aluminum cryopanel assemblies that allowed for thermal isolation of the satellites while they went through space simulation exercises in the lab prior to their journey in space. each assembly was comprised of multiple panels joined together to form a thermally controlled and uniform test area. aluminum extrusion was welded to each of the panels in a serpentine pattern which ultimately connected to stainless steel lines that delivered the liquids and gases to the assembly.                                                                   ﻿                                                                  dynavac uses atlas atcr fittings to provide a compatible, demountable transition from the aluminum lines to their stainless-steel counterparts. atlas has supplied dynavac with thousands of atcr fittings for the manufacture of their equipment.




   

    aluminum optics chambers with breadboard for max born


 by mel  janecka

august 23, 2024

several atlas aluminum vacuum chambers with breadboards installed at max born in berlin are used for the generation and application of ultra short x-ray pulses via a frequency conversion process called high order harmonic generation. the purpose is to record films of atoms and molecules on their natural time scales from the femtosecond (10^-15 seconds) to the attosecond (10^-18 seconds) range to capture atomic and molecular reactions.                                                                                     reliable vacuum is essential to the process because the pulses absorb air. the rectangular shape and accompanying breadboard allows the team to strategically and simultaneously position several optical elements for ease of filtering and focusing on the x-ray pulses. this permits additional laser pulses, from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet regime, to overlap with the x-ray pulses in order to make the atomic and molecular recordings.                                                                   ﻿                                                                  aluminum, says dr. bernd schϋtte of max born, is the material of choice for the chambers because “it is cost effective and its low weight eases the handling of the chambers.”
