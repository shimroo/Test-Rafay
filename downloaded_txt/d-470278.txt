sea vista estate is : 
updated cottages on a sugar sand beach, pool,
												authentic seminole indian chicki hut w/cooking, tv and a 500 ft dock for your boat.

wildlife surrounds both in the wooded privacy of the 4 acre coumpound, 350 ft of beach right outside your door, and the
												nightlife of key west just minutes away.
one of our guests said it best - " bring a toothbrush,
												cutoffs, t-shirt and clear your mind."
