dc delegation joined at the hip with haaland with one notable exception as heinrich holds out; latest analysis on the already off and running race for governor; coronation or election?  

with a notable exception the state's congressional delegation has endorsed deb haaland for the democratic gubernatorial nomination and the primary isn't until june 2026. her campaign is now rolling out legislative endorsements and report she has already now raised over $1 million. they obviously are
 working feverishly to keep this a single candidate primary as was the 
case with bill richardson in 2002 and diane denish in 2010. senator martin heinrich is the lone hold out in the dc delegation, refusing to endorse haaland who only announced her candidacy feb. 11. (he also refused to endorse progressive abq rep. melanie stansbury for a house committee leadership post as we explored dec. 16.)heinrich decided against his own guv run jan. 24. he passed on a haaland endorsement when he backed out and still wasn't on board when the haaland camp promoted the delegation endorsements friday. when asked by politico's e&e news whether an endorsement will be forthcoming, heinrich replied: if i do (endorse), i’ll let you know.that's understandable. first, heinrich's flirtation with a guv candidacy did not end well, with haaland appearing to push him out. that also happened when president biden passed him over for secretary of interior and chose haaland. after that, this is no time to bend the knee. heinrich and haalandalso, if haaland does get elected heinrich will remain the state's senior senator with enormous influence over legislation impacting the state. he will not and should not give his blessing to haaland until he is good and ready. second, haaland has shown herself more than capable of making mistakes (e.g. her bungled appearances before congressional committees as sec. of interior). there is concern that any missteps by her or polling that doesn't live up to expectations could draw a foe or two with some heft. heinrich is going to give her plenty of rope to play with and if the unexpected should happen and she trips, his options remain open.  there is plenty of irony to heinrich's decision not to endorse. his campaign finance team even picked up on our well-known nickname of him as the "first endorser" because of his penchant for endorsing candidates in contested democratic primaries with no regard for the divisiveness that can result. however, he was re-elected to a third term by a considerable margin so those primary endorsements did not seem to impact his standing among democrats. sam town sam bregman bernalillo county district attorney sam bregman is most frequently mentioned as a possible haaland primary challenger but as a semi-conservative with more past political baggage than american tourister, he is not seen as a major threat to haaland. bregman's fortunes could also be getting dragged down by his lobbying for a package of juvenile crime bills that are currently being shunned at the roundhouse. still, bregman is a champion publicity hound. if he got in, the race could quickly go from sleeper to best-seller. anti-haaland dems would at least have a vehicle for their dissent and the public would get a contrast of ideas. bregman's office deflected a media question about running, but did not rule it out:right now, i am 
focused on fighting crime and working with legislators to pass good 
crime legislation for the safety of new mexicans.bregman's son, famed baseball star alex bregman, just signed a $120 million three year contract with the boston red sox. not that dad needs a campaign loan but. . . follow the moneyanother note on campaign cash from a dem consultant who writes: joe, the haaland campaign announced that just one day after launching she raised $686,323 from 13,394 unique donations. this includes donations from every county in new mexico totaling $232,625 from more than 2,500 donations.

however, there's another way to look at that--only 18% of the donors were in-state and only 34% of the contributions came from nm.

the good news is she has a national following but a primary opponent could make hay over the disparity between her homegrown support and that from out-of-state.  coronation or election?so here we are with a november election that revealed some dem weariness with progressives, senator heinrich holding out on an haaland endorsement, bregman still hovering and a desire by the public to hear policy specifics from haaland who has been conspicuously quiet on them.no-one is yet standing on the railroad tracks to stop the deb haaland train. she is the obvious front-runner. the question is whether the primary will be something resembling a coronation instead of an election.this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

haaland candidacy lands in a sea of discontent; "light on substance" charge leveled; she says "quick fixes not possible" to state's problems; raises a tall campaign cash pile 

a sea of discontent. that's what deb haaland landed in when she announced her '26 run for the dem governor nomination this week. our observers were a bit taken aback by the extent of the scorching she received on the socials and even in some dem quarters. but these are not settled times. and her confidants remain confident the rabid hits will not diminish her appeal with democratic base voters.her campaign may have momentarily quieted the critics with the announcement of an ample fund-raising haul since she started her run tuesday:the deb haaland for new mexico campaign announced that just one day 
after launching, she has raised $686,323 from 13,394 unique donations. 
this includes donations from every county in new mexico totaling 
$232,625 in more than 2,500 donations. a couple of million for a dem primary is considerable so haaland has lived up to her notices that she will be a prodigious fund-raiser and keeps her front-runner status.  reaction central now reaction to the haaland bid. first from a senior alligator at the roundhouse revealing some dissension in democratic ranks:here we go again. democrats don’t learn their lesson. they’re marching toward another disaster a la kamala harris.
haaland may have a beautiful personal narrative, but very light on substance. she’s been at the right place at the right time. that’s it. her prior  electoral wins came with a universe made up of hardcore dem party insiders, not regular voters. the next election is way too important to give her a pass.  
as a longtime democratic, rural, hispanic voter, i hope to see a competitive primary. what was supposed to be her kickoff interview on krqe was cringe worthy. she’s not articulate and can’t deliver a solid message. we did not find her tv interview "cringeworthy" but she did raise numerous red flags when asked how she would handle things differently than the current democratic administration:i feel very confident that by listening to new mexicans and listening to their ideas and everyone working together to find the solutions, that we can find the solutions. i know people want quick fixes all the time. sometimes that's not possible. there were hints of a kamala harris word salad there but "cringeworthy"may be a reach.what is more concerning is her declaration that the electorate should not be expecting "quick fixes." that's not answering how she would do things differently or signaling in any way a more forceful attack on the generational problems facing the state. in fact, it sounds very status quo. that could be a political problem. endorsers  emily's list came with a robust endorsement of haaland:  we’re thrilled to endorse @debhaalandnm
 to be new mexico’s next governor. deb has a proven track record of fighting for her constituents. she has broken barriers throughout her career and we are honored to continue to support her in this election! patricia kurz added this on social media: what new mexico has been waiting for, for a long time. well done dear secretary, we are so proud of you! another gop view bob corneliuslongtime nm and texas gop consultant bob cornelius weighed in: in sports, when you’re near last in all the good columns and near first in all the bad columns statistically, you find a new coach. new mexico has that opportunity to find a new coach or in this case a new governor. unfortunately, although deb haaland would be a new coach, she’s running the same old tired plays that got new mexico where it is today. “fierce” isn’t a game plan. it’s hyperbole. fierce doesn’t solve crime. fierce doesn’t create jobs. fierce doesn’t secure the border or stop the fentanyl crisis. fierce doesn’t fix cyfd. new mexico needs a new leader, with a new vision and new ideas willing to solve problems. the search continues. . .  this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

haaland starts long march for dem governor nod with a shift to the center; emphasizes bread and butter issues; "wokeness" put on the backburner; gop warns of "disaster" 

haaland videodeb haaland began her long march for the 2026 democratic gubernatorial nomination emphasizing her storied heritage, service as secretary of interior, kitchen table issues and with a noticeable absence of the progressive ideology that catapulted her onto the national stage. (news release here. video here.)
  
her campaign underlined this statement from her announcement video: lowering costs, making rent and housing affordable, strengthening our schools, and preventing crimes so that you feel safe raising a family here. the solutions are there if we are fierce enough to choose them.gone were any references to climate change, transgender rights, a woman's right to choose, threats to democracy or other issues that appeared to cost democrats votes in the november election particularly among hispanic northern democrats. still, her "fierce" slogan that has been with her since her political start is back and apparently tests well with voters. the campaign also calls her "a governor who will change the game for new mexico. the candidate will begin a 19 stop statewide tour thursday but much of time this year is expected to be occupied by fund-raising.  her video was well-produced and the script, as you might expect, stuck to the generic and positive. but when she cited the litany of generational woes afflicting the state it raised the question of just what would be different about her approach if elected: crime, poverty, homelessness, addiction. they will keep pulling us down if we do the same things and expect a different result.details on how haaland, 64, intends to lead the state through that list of woes will be closely watched. is there truly something different about her candidacy, aside from its historic nature, or will it be a blueprint of the mlg years that nibbled around the edges? the shiftsam bregmanhaaland's shift to the center is a luxury she can afford. her path to the nomination is uncluttered by any opponents in the early going and she can pursue a big tent message that has appeal in both the primary and general elections. centrist democrat and bernalillo county district attorney sam bregman is making noise about a run and depending on how that develops could keep haaland in check when it comes to her attachment to the progressives who launched her career. in 2018 they gave her a resounding win over moderate democrat damon martinez and others for the dem nomination for the abq congressional seat. those votes are probably secure with no need to shout her affinity from the rooftops. her challenge will be to walk the tightrope between the left and the center with an uncertain political climate created by the trump presidency. that's where her appeal as possibly the first native american female governor in us history comes in as does a calm, nonthreatening demeanor and a personality that has proven voter-friendly. in some respects it reminds us of former dem us senator jeff bingaman (1983-2013)who had one of the most liberal voting records in the senate but his personal appeal and low-key approach triumphed over divisions. he had a 30 year run. haaland paraded with aoc and company during the peak of progressive politics on the hill but she had to pull it back when moderate president biden put her in the cabinet. the change served her well.gop strikes republicans are keenly aware of haaland's vulnerability on the woke front. they came with this hit from gop chair amy barela:
deb haaland represents more of the same, but worse for new mexico. . .she had one of the most liberal voting records in congress and
 consistently peddled the same failed, progressive ideas that have 
produced nothing for new mexicans. as secretary of the interior, she 
made it her mission to target new mexico's number one industry—oil and 
gas—impacting the livelihoods of many navajo allottees. . .she
 . . . consistently could not answer 
basic questions about her job. . .another democrat in the 
governor's mansion spells disaster: more jobs gone, crime on the rise, 
endless failures, and new mexicans left in the dust—again. a republican 
governor is the change our state needs, someone who will finally put new
 mexicans first. that dig about haaland being able to answer questions is another soft spot. her less than successful appearances before congressional committees as interior boss is likely to be a focus of her gop foes. conservative critics are already calling into question her intellectual abilities.  the ghost the ghost of former republican governor susana martinez also lurks in the haaland candidacy. she was the nation's first hispanic female governor. she charmed her way into office on a thin record as a district attorney and a relatable campaign personality that had hispanic democrats abandoning their party in droves. unfortunately, martinez presided over a mostly failed eight years.for haaland, the record is not thin--a former state democratic party chair, a congresswoman and secretary of interior. she has been able to bring people together. the question is whether she can transcend her symbolism and also be an agent of change? does she want to? her long campaign march could tell the tale. holguin analysislongtime dem consultant neri holguin came with this analysis of the haaland run: among the democratic base, she’s beloved and well known across the 
state. it’s also hard to imagine who else will be able to compete 
with her ability to fund-raise nationally and locally.scott forrester. another veteran dem consultant and recently chief of staff for abq us rep. melanie stansbury is haaland's campaign manager.  the bottom lineswe had a heavily caffeinated conversation with sanra fe radio host richard eeds tuesday in which we talked about haaland's candidacy the legislature and more la politica. . .on the monday blog a quote from a tv news report incorrectly stated that apd chief harold medina began his tenure in 2022. here is the correct time line: medina was named interim chief of police in september 2020, and 
appointed by mayor keller to serve as permanent chief of police in march

higher ed scandals: fewer regents and more oversight offered up as solution, plus: rating southern congressional seat and some silliness in santa fe  

it's not a perfect storm but close enough. the multiple scandals afflicting higher education opens a window of opportunity for legislators looking to make substantial changes in the governing of the state's universities.the wnmu scandal is widely known with former president joseph shepard awarded a nearly $3 million hyper-controversial buyout by the school's regents. he resigned after getting called out for misspending school funds. the outrageous buyout is being challenged by the attorney general. then there's the con job at nm tech in socorro where the regents placed over $46 million in school funds in a very low yielding account at first state bank. it was the attorney for that bank who was also a nm tech regent who engineered a whistle blower's firing as president. the sweetheart deal has cost taxpayers millions in interest income. ex-president stephen wells is fighting his firing in court. nmsu in cruces had a whopper of a scandal in their athletic department that dragged on for years and was not resolved until a new president took over. while not a scandal, unconfirmed word is now circulating at the roundhouse that mlg has appointed her 64 year old brother, a part-time student, as the new student regent at nm highlands university in las vegas. if so, that is a pr black eye whose timing is kind of jaw-dropping coming as it does on the heels of the wnmu disgrace. eliminating some of the state's universities is a goal discussed for over 100 years but it's not going to happen. however, streamlining the governance of the schools is seen as possible by one santa fe wall-leaner long on experience and wisdom:joe, there are dozens of regents and the state senate doesn't have a vetting process that is thorough enough before their appointments by the governor are approved. reducing the number of regents to a dozen to supervise all the schools would get us that needed vetting. this plan is superior to measures that would require regents to receive training. that is not the issue. the problem we are seeing with the western and tech scandals is not training--it is too many regents appointed who shouldn't be. and that's because they're being approved without enough probing by the senate. fewer regents. better legislative oversight. let's see if there are any takers. toss-up or lean d? herrell and vasquezit's still a nail-biter, says the in-the-know cook political report in dc of the state's southern congressional seat. dem us rep. gabe vasquez was re-elected there last november by a margin of 10,000 votes over republican yvette herrell. (monahan post-election analysis here.)cd 2 is among just 18 districts that cook ranks as a toss-up going into the 2026 cycle. we moved the seat from toss-up to "lean democratic" during the heat of the '24 campaign. in '22 vasquez won over herrell by only 1,350 votes. his increased margin this time was due to his better performance in the dem counties of bernalillo and dona ana. vasquez is an improved candidate and that means the republicans are going to need a stronger act to hold the dems back. not that the next race won't be close or that an upset is long odds. however, unseating a first-termer is one thing but with two elections under this belt, vasquez has improved his weight class from lightweight to middleweight. we'll stick with "lean dem."santa fe silliness yikes! after the legalization of marijuana turned into a quagmire the legislature is now looking at legalizing psilocybin, a hallucinogenic drug used for "therapeutic purposes." that's just what the doctor did not order--more drugs unleashed on a population vulnerable to drug abuse and a state bureaucracy that is barely managing to regulate legal pot. maybe the sponsors of this bill ought to have some therapy? this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

us attorney plows ahead in unearthing apd dwi bribery caper; plea bargains fell two cop conspirators; will this scandal finally be the end of scandal?  

us attorney uballezthe us attorney appears to be on his way to making major inroads in cleaning up the abq police department, crafting plea bargains with two crooked cops and adroitly utilizing stool pigeon rick mendez. but a major question lingers. mendez was the wingman for the attorney alleged to have gone bad and who masterminded the scandal. the "dwi enterprise"--as the feds call it--had greedy officers take the lawyer's bribes in exchange for not showing up for his clients dwi court cases, all to the delight of the attorney, the suspected drunk drivers and the paid-off police.  but the major question our legal beagles have is how far and wide will the usa's dragnet go? enough to punish members of apd leadership who were part of the years-long enterprise or engaged in covering it up?look at these money lines from one of the plea bargains:
  (officer) alba admitted that he, (attorney) clear and (clear private investigator) mendez also asked senior apd officers who had been involved in the scheme “to use their positions and influence” to ensure the officers involved were not exposed, according to the plea agreement. alba asked these senior officers for help in the fall of 2023 when a complaint was filed against him with the civilian police oversight agency, his plea agreement stated.that's the climb up the food chain that has to be making apd chief medina and other higher-ups doing some midnight pacing. for if the feds do get to the top rungs of the apd ladders it could mark an historic turning point in addressing the cultural rot that has so long infected apd and gone untreated. this lack of consequences has fostered more scandals and more looking away by various mayors, city councils, legislatures and a large swath of the public unable to confront the betrayal of trust as crime is feared more than rancid corruption. while us attorney alexander uballez has done enough so folks can finally pronounce his name and nod with approval, but how impactful will his time at the helm seem years from now? if history is any guide and the apd scandal is put to bed by confining the legal action to rank and file dwi officers, it may be seen as a nice try but no cigar. watchdog barks apd watchdog and former police sergeant dan klein digs a bit deeper: chief medina placed command staff officers who were part of the dwi enterprise into ranking positions in internal affairs, a commander and major, both of whom resigned or were terminated during the investigation. it clearly shows medina allowed the fox into the hen house. he assigned command staff officers who were directly involved in the dwi enterprise to the highest level positions in internal affairs where these ranking officers then helped to cover up the dwi enterprise.  for his part, medina continues to deflect when it comes to demanding accountability for the past, present and future of his long-troubled and provably corrupt agency:medina, who has led the department since 2020, pointed out (the dwi scandal) didn’t start under his leadership, but ended under his leadership.“this isn’t about blaming the past. this is about this point in time,
 this chief, this administration got this resolved. we found out about 
it, we exposed it, we investigated it, and we held people accountable,” 
said medina. the chief said he is not blaming past mayors or chiefs, explaining 
that he had a tough time uncovering the dwi scheme, saying those accused
 of being involved did well hiding it. according to medina, the blame 
should be placed on the officers who participated in the scheme.the chief is essentially saying of the past wrongdoing "move along, nothing to see there." the tragedy is that it sounds so familiar and is the culture that has boost record high crime levels. days of uballezthe trump administration has not yet  given democrat uballez his walking papers but he is on the clock.  in his first term, president trump asked for the resignation of then-usa damon martinez effective march 10, 2017, less than two months after his inauguration. trump will do the same again and appoint a gop us attorney but when is unknown.this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

reader vox populi; contention that trump had win with mexico disputed and more ben ray and kennedy  

time again for another timeless edition of reader vox populi where insightful readers write the blog. the contention that we made here tuesday that trump's recent dealings with mexico paid off drew mail and often the ire of readers. first, what we said on that blog:mexico has agreed to place 10,000 troops on the us-mexico 
border to stop the flow of fentanyl here in exchange for president trump
 delaying his plan to impose tariffs on mexico. say
 what you will, but that is one of the most concrete actions taken by 
any government to interrupt the fentanyl scourge that has ruined the 
lives of so many new mexicans and contributed mightily to the high crime
 rate here. vox populi kicks into high gear with reaction. we begin with longtime journalist peter katel, now retired, who covered mexico for years for numerous national news outlets:  hi joe,

regarding your comment about mexico’s deployment of troops to its border
 with the u.s., this is not a first. mexico sent even more troops in 2019. the latest deployment offered both trump and mexican president sheinbaum a way to back 
down from a tariff war that would have (and still might) hurt both 
sides. whether it does anything beyond that is questionable. if troop 
deployments were a solution to the fentanyl crisis, then the 2019 action
 would have made the latest one unnecessary.

granted, the earlier troop move by mexico was aimed at migrants, not 
drugs. but unless the newly assigned troops start searching every single
 vehicle coming through a port of entry - unimaginable, given the 
traffic volume - this deployment looks like another in the long list of 
drug-war theatrics. as all data make clear, most fentanyl entering the 
u.s. from mexico comes through ports of entry, smuggled by american 
citizens. a well-done summary by the libertarian cato foundation concludes: "policymakers should focus on reducing demand for 
fentanyl rather than futilely trying to reduce supply." former state senator jerry ortiz y pino writes:first, the vast majority of the fentanyl entering the us comes 
through ports of entry and is transported hidden among the containers 
brought across the border by the hundreds of thousands of commercial 
trucks which enter daily.  that putting 10,000 mexican troops on the 
border will do anything extra in stopping that flow is highly unlikely 
unless those military troops have access to some type of technology that
 will detect packages of fentanyl buried among the legal products being 
imported—or unless they are willing to stop every single truck and 
off-load their contents which will bring traffic at the ports of entry 
to a complete halt. in fact, the number of fentanyl-related deaths in the country have 
dropped over the past two years.  there are still far too many lives 
being lost, but the efforts of the biden administration to intercept 
fentanyl at the border have paid off.  that effort was aided by the 
development of better technology for detecting the presence of fentanyl. . .it is in further improvements in that direction that we will be able to 
make headway in reducing the availability of this poison—not in the 
photo op involved in stationing soldiers along the border—doing what? blog addendumgood points from peter and jerry. our position--as explained elsewhere--is that troop deployment can have an impact "when combined with a broader strategy, including intelligence-sharing, addressing the demand for fentanyl, and strengthening partnerships with international authorities." there is no cure-all.lujan and kennedy reader ricardo flores writes in defense of sen. lujan:  i think the criticism of ben ray lujan by the maga media (over his questioning of rfk, jr.) is par for the course when it comes to any racial/ethnic minority member of congress because of racial attitudes that still exist. even where the details of any law or policy are not fully understood by the public, the maga media will sharpen their focus on racial/ethnic minority members who are in the spotlight so that they can launch a full-out attack at the slightest discrepancy, or opposition to their right wing ideology.  opposing rfk was the right thing to do given his stated position on vaccines.  senator lujan did a commendable job of pressuring him to attain some level of disclosure about how he would lead hhs and, more importantly, to expose his loyalty to trump's divisive agenda. on social media, shoebill mcgee wrote: no one attacked benny. we simply pointed out that giving an answer he didn’t like is not failing to answer. 
benny boy was rude and his questions weren’t productive. as a huge fan of rfkj, i’m very happy to see him be questioned, as long as it’s productive. the bottom lines in the first draft of the wednesday blog the last name of mayoral candidate mayling armijo was edited incorrectly several times. we apologize for the error. this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

"no excuses" declares challenger to mayor keller; mayling armijo says "crime out of control; time to stop coddling criminals," calls for giving police more "resources" apd dwi scandal gets no mention  

mayling armijothe newest candidate in the abq mayoral race immediately went to work on mayor tim keller's soft spot, condemning the city's continuing high crime and homelessness and putting the blame squarely on the shoulders of the two-term incumbent. (video here.)mayling armijo, a former director of the bernalillo county economic development office with close ties to former republican county commissioner wayne johnson, is thus far the only officially announced keller challenger.armijo declared her entry tuesday at a downtown coffee bar:  crime is out of control. . .we deserve better. if you commit a crime in abq there will be consequences and, yes, criminals will go to jail. no excuses. it's time to get serious about solutions and restore accountability. notably, armijo, an abq native, gave a strong vote of confidence to apd even as it is mired in the worst corruption scandal in its history. she told supporters and reporters:i understand what it means to wear a uniform. as a (navy) veteran i know the sacrifices and responsibilities. it's time allow our police to do their job effectively and safely, giving them the resources and supporting their goal of a safer city. armijo, who describes herself as a “proud daughter of an immigrant and a hispanic veteran small business owner," scored the keller administration over the homeless problem:homelessness is a public health crisis not a housing crisis. . .fueled by addiction and worsened by failed leadership. resources are thrown at the problem with no measurable results. and on drugs:  the current administration has not made any progress in the last eight years. . . we need true health treatment and counseling for individuals who 
suffer from drug addiction or mental illness. a keller operative responded:what? she doesn't like the gateway center, the first entry into the public health arena the city has ever made? where was she on behavioral health when bernalillo county passed a behavioral tax and they could not move the money out the door? the city approved a tax hike and put it to work. mayling and company failed.  after her formal announcement armijo fully embraced a vigorous tough on crime platform in an interview with kkob radio and their mainly conservative audience, indicating again that she will not be romancing the city's progressives in the november election. the armijo filearmijo, 48, a registered democrat who, if elected, would be the first woman mayor, is making her maiden bid for public office. we blogged january 15 about armijo's ties to private developers, anticipating her entry into the race. armijo
 has also served as deputy county manager for sandoval county (under manager wayne johnson) and is 
currently the executive director of elevated lending cdc which specializes "in sba 504 loans, 
bringing federal funding directly to local businesses. our personalized 
approach ensures that every entrepreneur receives expert guidance and 
tailored financial solutions." the mayoral race race is officially nonpartisan but armijo's ties to johnson who ran and lost against keller in 2017 were seized on by democrats to push her to the republican right. they pointed out that johnson's wife, kurstin johnson, ran unsuccessfully for the start senate last year and is a prominent in abq real estate. armijo's backers says she also worked in economic development under dem gov. richardson.monahan analysis joe monahanarmijo has filed as a privately financed candidate and will not try to qualify for pubic financing. keller, 47, will again pursue public financing for his campaign. he has the organization to get the many small donations needed to qualify for $755,000 in public money.as in the past, a separate political committee apart from the campaign is expected and that could push his total funding to over $1 million. that is a high hurdle for armijo or any challenger to jump.keller is seeking an unprecedented third consecutive term. fatigue and frustration with crime are palpable but so is an air of apathy that may be keeping professional politicos on the sidelines. in the early going a a pattern is forming that was seen when keller won re-election in 2021 when two conservative candidates--former sheriff manny gonzales and radio talk host eddy aragon--ran against keller and split the  conservative vote. democrat keller managed to get well over 50 percent and avoided a run-off election.  this time aragon says he's running again but has not yet made an official declaration with the city. and for another dose of dejavu, former bernco sheriff darren white is said to be eying a run. if both get in that could set up another split of the conservative vote and again ease keller's path.  this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

 ben ray attacked over his questioning of rfk, jr. but doesn't flinch, plus: keller jabs back at sen. cervantes over crime bills while trump scores win in fight against state's fentanyl scourge  

sen. lujan let's check in on dem us senator ben ray lujan ben ray lujan who we blogged about january 7 as he went into cycle for his 2026 re-election bid. he is now on the senate finance committee where last week he queried robert f. kennedy, jr. on his nomination to lead the department of  health and human services. afterwards lujan did an interview with nbc news, saying: one thing i am good at is counting votes and right now i can't count the votes to get him over the top.lujan rose to the rank of assistant house speaker before securing a senate seat in 2020. he also led the democratic congressional campaign committee where he was an ace vote counter. (the finance committee tuesday morning on a party line vote of 14-13 advanced the kennedy nomination to the senate floor. )lujan's nationally televised questioning (video) of kennedy was derided in right-wing media and the socials. examples: @senatorlujan asked robert kennedy jr, during hearings, if mr. kennedy would cut medicaid if directed by the @potus to do so. thank you to@robertkennedyjr for reminding this ignorant senator that congress sets the medicaid rate! kennedy 1 - lujan 0. “dem senator tries to nail rfk jr. with attack on trump, medicaid during hearing, gets embarrassed instead.”
that senator would be ben ray lujan, aka @senatorlujan, who's panties got twisted in a knot when people laughed at him for his line of questioning, not accepting rfk jr's answer that ending medicaid is up to congress, which he should have known. don't you know how things are done in dc, senator? if not, you shouldn't be a senator.   that's a lot of parsing by the critics because the president recommends a budget to congress so both branches of government have a say in how the health-care program for low-income citizens is administered. in new mexico 40 percent of the population is covered under medicaid. the state receives three federal dollars for every state dollar it spends on the program.  lujan appeared healthy and on the ball during his brief round of questioning. in fact, it was kennedy who seemed confused about the distinction between medicare and medicaid. lujan re-election bidin our january 7th blog we wrote: there is just enough ambiguity about the senator that republicans see an opening albeit a very narrow one. soon after that a lujan pr blitz--enabled by his new committee slot and the onslaught of trump's actions--got underway and he now closing the window on that ambiguity.unlike the race for governor, no republican names are circulating of possible hopefuls to take on lujan in '26.  by the way, lujan was the only one of the the states five member all democratic congressional delegation  to attend trump's inauguration. the president appeared to do surprisingly well with rural new mexico hispanic democrats as he trimmed his losing margin here to 6 percent. trump repeatedly says he "loves hispanics." the message was not lost on lujan, a native of the north. keller rebuts cervantes chief medina & kellera provocative blog quote over abq crime and the crime bills pending in santa fe from state senate judiciary committee chairman joseph cervantes drew a sharp response from city hall. first here's that quote again that came from cervantes in reaction to the apd dwi scandal:   i've said for years, with lots of 
opposition, that albuquerque crime is attributable to an utter lack of 
accountability and leadership, and outright corruption, which the public
 and media tolerate. no new laws can solve this. and the push back from mayor keller's office:   for any lawmaker to say that 'laws don't matter' totally undermines the 
point of having a state legislature. it's this kind of flawed logic that
 holds our state back and is a disservice to new mexican families who 
demand action. the mayor and chief have been working from day one to 
clean up the apd, raising the murder clearance rate, reducing auto 
theft, salvaging the reform process, and generally keeping the 
department from falling off a cliff. there isn't a corner of our state 
that isn't affected by fentanyl and violent crime, which is why we need 
everyone to pitch in and do everything in their power to fight crime. aside from the squabble between cervantes and keller, there's the news that mexico has agreed to place 10,000 troops on the us-mexico border to stop the flow of fentanyl here in exchange for president trump delaying his plan to impose tariffs on mexico. say what you will, but that is one of the most concrete actions taken by any government to interrupt the fentanyl scourge that has ruined the lives of so many new mexicans and contributed mightily to the high crime rate here. meantime, new secretary of defense pete hegseth monday made the border at sunland park, new mexico his first trip as pentagon chief, visiting with soldiers stationed there who are assisting immigration personnel with border security. this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

it's still cervantes versus the city; chairman of powerful committee says dwi scandal shows abq crime crisis demands local solutions as guv pushes crime package, plus: mayor keller sanguine about apd future as scandal plays out  

sen. cervantesstate senator joseph cervantes hasn't changed his tune. once again he is pushing his view that abq's crime crisis is primarily a local problem that demands local solutions and won't be resolved by statewide legislation. the powerful chairman of the senate judiciary committee says his views are made only stronger by the staggering apd dwi scandal where numerous officers are accused of taking hefty bribes in exchange for getting dwi offenders off the hook. the blog last week reported the decades-long history of corruption at the department, a report that drew wide reaction including this from chairman cervantes:great coverage of apd corruption. i've said for years, with lots of 
opposition, that albuquerque crime is attributable to an utter lack of 
accountability and leadership, and outright corruption, which the public
 and media tolerate. no new laws can solve this. "no new laws can solve this?" that's an ominous declaration. not all crime bills go before cervantes' committee but there is enough power there for the governor and her legislative backers to hold tight to their four leaf clovers and hope that after years of cervantes and company prevailing that somehow this year is different.  mlg continues to insist that repeat offenders are a major cause of the violent crime. she did so again at a new conference as the votes have yet to appear for her crime package and as she plays batman to bernco district attorney sam bregman's robin. the repeat offender contention has more political appeal than absolute truth because we keep creating new offenders but it has legs. his detractors say cervantes is ignoring the statewide problem because he is a trial lawyer with an inherent bias. still, as cervantes contends, the rate of abq violent crime does far surpass that of the state's other major cities. abq police report 1,319 such crimes per 100,000 population in 2023. that compares to las cruces (cervantes' district) with 579 per 100,000; rio rancho with only 112 and the city of santa fe at a worrisome 854. some much smaller rural cities like gallup and roswell have had notable spikes while there has been a slight improvement in abq's overall crime rate which peaked at historic levels. (stats are here.)cervantes' central point--that abq has not stepped up--has not been shot down. our hot mess mayor keller (krqe)apd has been a hot mess for decades with the federal doj coming in as a response to the record number of fatal police shootings but ignoring the rotten culture dominating the agency.  apd's budget has skyrocketed yet the return on that money is scandal, humiliation for the good cops, disdain for the city by economic planners and a continued population stagnation as people vote with their feet. not all of that falls on the current mayor as evidenced by the years-long dwi scandal and the advent of the sinister fentanyl epidemic that has occurred on the incumbent's watch.cervantes is getting nowhere not just with mlg but also keller as the mayor's tune, like the senator's, has not changed:(keller) said he has faith in the 
current leadership of the police department to fix the culture and 
restore public trust. the allegations 
against apd officers had many people calling on chief medina to step 
down. mayor keller backed the chief. . . mayor keller 
credits the chief with helping the fbi root out any suspected players in
 the scheme.“it takes a lot to be the team that cleans it up and owns 
it. and that’s what we’ve done. so i do feel optimistic going forward 
that this department is in a vastly different place on a number of 
fronts. and i have to believe that this would be caught much,
 much sooner if it were to happen again,” keller said. maybe. or is he whistling past the graveyard?  the crime debate is always messy, complicated, often misleading and ultimately frustrating. we end with the long view from us rep. gabe vasquez from his speech last week to state legislators:new mexicans understand that the path to safer 
communities  begins with addressing the root causes of crime and public 
safety. that includes poverty, domestic violence, addiction, 
gun safety, homelessness  and the lack of economic opportunity.anyone have a magic wand they're not using?(rep. melanie stansbury also addressed the legislature. here is her speech.)this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

other voices: veteran taos newsman rodger beimer recounts epic nm forest fires in wake of california blazes  

rodger beimerthe blame game is underway in southern california as ashes are cooling and fires are still burning.“the fires spread because someone shut off the water!”“we couldn’t stop the spread because the mayor slashed the budget!”let
 me tell you the truth: the fires spread because something, or someone, 
provided a spark and mother nature’s winds fanned the flames. and now, 
thousands of good-minded folks have been involved in trying to stop the 
fires, and keep the flames from rising again.to
 those of us in new mexico, the story of a wind-whipped fire is nothing 
new. we hear that story every year as the forests dry and the spring 
winds blow.the
 destructive fires across southern california have destroyed towns, 
schools, homes, neighborhoods and businesses. that, in itself, will 
prompt many actions in the days, weeks, and months ahead.that’s a good thing.history has shown us how communities can rise from the ashes. take my hometown of taos, as an example.in
 the early 1930s, disaster struck. the may 9, 1932, santa fe new mexican
 headline read: “blaze destroys north side of taos plaza.”the
 story is, the fire broke out just after midnight and soon thereafter 
the bell atop our lady of guadalupe church rang out, waking the town to 
the sight and smell of a massive blaze consuming the courthouse and 
nearby businesses.the
 church bell and word of mouth was about the only means of 
communication. there weren’t many phones, no walkie-talkie radios, no 
radio stations, no tv stations. it was up to the church bell to spread 
the word.an 
associated press dispatch printed in the albuquerque journal that same 
day, may 9, 1932, read: “taos, chiefly an artists colony and indian 
pueblo center, has no fire department, and artists, merchants, natives 
and indians alike joined in the bucket brigade. the village has no fire 
plugs, and water had to be carried in buckets from wells.”that tragedy spurred action.the community incorporated, government funding came for a water system, fire hydrants, and a lone fire truck.but it took more than equipment to make the community fire ready.what
 followed was formation of the taos volunteer fire department, led by 
jack boyer and a number of his relatives and friends, including my 
father, uncle, and others. their efforts are honored by a wooden plaque 
that still hangs in the fire department headquarters, the same 
headquarters first used in the mid-1930s.for
 decades, hundreds of taoseños have answered the call when the siren 
echoed across the valley. the volunteer fire department, and its 
members, became a source of pride for taos. i’m proud to say i served, 
even driving the department’s first rescue vehicle from the factory to 
the firehouse.eventually,
 as the demands for service grew to include emergency response for 
search and rescue and accidents and incidents, the work outpaced the 
volunteers. today, professional firefighters and first responders are 
dedicated to protecting taos.as
 a reporter, i covered many fires, including the massive la mesa fire 
near bandelier national monument and los alamos in 1977. photographer 
dale britton and i photographed and reported from an empty campground 
one day that was transformed into a bustling camp kitchen, serving hot 
meals and ice cold watermelon the very next day.for months, i carried a personal souvenir from that fire — a sprinkling of red fire retardant slurry on my watchband.back to southern california.money-hungry
 lawyers are seeking clients; insurance companies are looking for wiggle
 room so they won’t have to pay; politicians are proclaiming like a 
church bell.let it be.there
 are lessons to be learned and solutions found. they don’t need to form a
 fire department like was done in taos in the 1930s. the issues are 
greater: climate change, building codes and infrastructure development.meanwhile,
 to firefighters battling the blazes in socal and beyond, and to those 
who stand ready in our towns and neighborhoods every day, we should all 
say “thank you.”rodger beimer, 79, is a native of taos. he spent years reporting on new mexico for tv news and later was a manager at nm expo. this column was first published by the abq journal. this is the home of new mexico politics.         e-mail your news and comments.

heinrich stays put; rules out guv run as potential for more dc power grows; haaland remains frontrunner for dem nod but watch is on for other contenders; poll floated showing her trouncing bregman in match-up  

sen. heinrich (roll call)this report was delayed as we brought you coverage of the apd dwi scandal this week. martin heinrich has regained his political balance and decided a run for governor in 2026 is a bridge too far. he announced last week he will remain in the us senate where this month he began his third six year term after trouncing his republican opponent by 10 points in the november election. heinrich barely began celebrating his win when he turned heads by confirming reports first published here that he was seriously weighing a bid for the democratic nomination for governor in two years. but he ran into a high hurdle--former secretary of interior deb haaland and her plans for a candidacy. she tiptoed toward an official declaration  tuesday with this statement from a spokeswoman:deb haaland is of and for new mexico. she’s a proven leader; she’s 
created new mexico jobs, brings people together, and is getting ready to
 run to be new mexico’s next governor. she and her team will be focused 
on listening and solutions that fit the needs of our communities.at the same time a poll conducted december 4 and 5 by ppp among 557 democratic primary voters was being passed around that showed haaland defeating possible dem rival and bernco district attorney sam bregman 50 to 18 percent. the sponsor of the poll was not known. cat and mouseheinrich and haaland played a bit of cat and mouse and heinrich--perhaps with the urging of senate majority leader chuck schumer as well as polling showing the difficulty and divisiveness of a primary with haaland--decided to stay put. also, no anglo male has been elected governor since 1998 when republican gary johnson won re-election. heinrich also would have been the first sitting us senator in state history to give up his seat to run for the state's top office, with repercussions uncertain among the electorate. that history had to loom over him. haalandheinrich is now the ranking member on the important senate energy committee and is already pushing back against president trump. for the first time he is in a position to have a significant voice in national affairs and protect new mexico's interests with more power. he could have a shot someday at senate leadership if he stays steady. whatever the mid-life crisis was that made the 53 year old think about going off the rails appears to be over and the state has its senior senator back. if heinrich can now overcome his apparent distaste for certain aspects of senate life and get on with making a major mark, all the better for new mexicans.  notably, heinrich did not endorse haaland for the nomination, saying he is waiting to see who else gets in the chase. bregman and others bernalillo county district attorney bregman's name is circulating with insiders speculating he could mount a guv campaign to the right of the very progressive haaland and spend considerable money doing so. bregman has not discouraged the chatter. the size of the democratic field now seems to be in the hands of haaland. she is regaled as the first native american to head interior and would claim another first as as a female native american governor. but leadership goes beyond identity and haaland will be eyeballed by possible opponents as she begins her long march to the roundhouse. any serious missteps will be calculated by ambitious bystanders. they still have time but that haaland is now in the pole position for the nomination is not in dispute. the gop field herrellthere's no shortage of possible '26 gop guv contenders. in our january 6  blog we gave the state the first list of names of those thinking about running as confirmed by reliable republican sources. they include rio rancho mayor gregg hull who in response to that report confirmed his interest but has not made a formal announcement. he said:  i’ve been approached by a lot of individuals to look at the possibility
 and i’m currently weighing all of my options. other republican possibles include state senator crystal brantley, former supreme court justice judy nakamura, nella domenici, former lt. gov. john sanchez and state rep. rebecca dow.  and a name not on our first list but now emerges is that of former congresswoman yvette herrell.heinrich statement after careful consideration and many conversations with my family, constituents, and colleagues, i’ve decided to remain in the united states senate. it’s clear to me that new mexico needs a strong voice in washington now more than ever—the stakes are simply too high. president trump’s alarming actions this week—attacking birthright citizenship, pardoning criminals that assaulted police officers, and rolling back american energy leadership—these actions hurt families, endanger our democracy, and threaten the future of our public lands and natural resources. from fighting back against these harmful policies to defending the progress we’ve made lowering costs for working families, growing our economy, and keeping our communities safe, the senate is where i believe i can have the most impact. in my time in the senate, i’ve delivered real results for new mexico—securing historic investments in broadband and water infrastructure, lowering prescription drug costs, expanding access to affordable health care, and strengthening public safety. but there is still so much more to do, and i will not walk away from that responsibility. i will stand up to the president when needed, but i’m also ready to work with him and my senate colleagues to move new mexico and our nation forward. as ranking member of the senate energy and natural resources committee, i am committed to leading our caucus in advancing innovative clean energy solutions, creating good-paying jobs, and protecting our public lands—critical pillars of new mexico’s economic and environmental future. new mexicans deserve a voice that is calm, but resolute, someone who will work tirelessly for their values and a brighter  future. my decision to stay in the senate reflects my commitment to serving the people of new mexico and a willingness to do the hard work that brings our potential and our reality ever closer together.
