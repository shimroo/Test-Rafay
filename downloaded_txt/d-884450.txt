									in events, 
									by wadog									









from maya:
dear instructor/secretary
please find attached information and application form for the upcoming wado academy new year course on sunday 9th january 2022.
the information has been sent in two formats.  the word document can (hopefully) be completed on the computer, saved and emailed, the pdf file can be printed out and completed by hand (to scan/photograph and email back).  please ensure you read both pages, important points to note:
1. should students require the optional buffet, corin pegden must be informed directly before 21st december 2021.2. this is a pre-registration, pre-payment course.2. all wado academy memberships must be renewed well in advance, there will be no provision to renew membership at the course.  the majority of students whose membership is currently in date will have their expiry date as 31st december 2021. please encourage your students to renew membership in advance for 2022 from now on.3. please ensure that your students submit their application and have made payment by 30th december 2021.
with kind regards
maya
