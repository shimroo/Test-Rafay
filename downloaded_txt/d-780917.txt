 "the scratching post that i highly recommend is made by topcat products. it's sisal-covered and the fabric is very tight and well done. the post is round so it's easy for a cat to get it's paws around it and for a kitten, this makes for great climbing. initially, you can place the post on it's side and play with your kitty as he gets used to the feel of it. i think this post is the best out there. another thing i like about the topcat design is that it's hollow inside.
﻿this makes for an incredible sound when the kitties scratch it. i found that my kitties come running from the far ends of the house if they hear me running my nails along the sisal."—pam johnson-bennett, feline behaviorist and the author of "think like a cat," "twisted whiskers," "hiss and tell," and "cat vs cat."our cat scratching posts are endorsed by many cat websites and rescue organizations including: the anti-cruelty society, peta, paws chicago, lisa violet, stop declaw, save a paw, cat care tips and tricks, and many more.
