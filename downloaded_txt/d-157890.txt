“the location is convenient to my house but that’s not the only reason i’m here. i’m home every night, which is very important to me. i really like the terminal management here because they are easy to work with. they seem to be looking out for their drivers so i know it’s a good place to be.”
perry price
“i like that the equipment is kept up and taken care of. i like the open communication with dispatch and that they handle any issue i bring to them in a timely manner.”
