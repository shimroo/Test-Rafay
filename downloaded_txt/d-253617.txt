						why "gemland"?
                          
                        well, arizona is america's leading gem mining state, and we got our start in the
                        gemstone business.
                        but now, we offer much more, too!  you could say "gems in the sky", "gems of
                        places", even "gems of wisdom" -- you decide.
						whatever the case,
                        there is something inside gemland for you.
                        gemstones are rocks, and rocks
                        are our love and our specialty.  there are over 300 pages on our website for you to explore.
