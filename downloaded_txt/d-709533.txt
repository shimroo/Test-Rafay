    about us
  

 

mr. ziegler and his staff have over 40 years of accounting experience. "i will only put you in the hands of a trained individual, and even though that person is well qualified, i still personally review every return before it is filed. with my irs and my staffs combined experience i believe we’re the best at what we do. we are a little company with big ideas." furthermore, some people do not have the money to pay up front to get their taxes prepared; so 1040man can offer you the ability to have your preparation fees taken right out your refund! this way you get your refund as soon as possible without first having to pay for the preparation fees out of your pocket.
