dancer testimonial ~
"when i moved to tennessee, i had no social structure. i was introduced to merrybellies at one of their local performances. i was immediately impressed by the choreography, the group dynamics, and the mix of convention and unconventional styles. i started taking classes with jillanna immediately. in these classes, i found an instructor who made me feel comfortable and cultivated my dancing far beyond my expectations. i never intended to perform, but i found myself feeling completely comfortable on stage and even loving the exhilaration of a solo. i also found somewhere i belong. the women i met in these classes were amazing; they became my new social network. at moonhaven studio, i found a brilliant teacher in jillanna, a fun exercise that has become beyond addictive, and dear friends who have enriched my life."
