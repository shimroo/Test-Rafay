exam accelerator & learning keyi am writing to tell you about my experience. many moons ago i believed that the best time to start revising for my six subjects, five a-levels, was christmas. i put my revision off to half term, then to easter, then to the final half term which was the beginning of my study leave. then to the final 20 days before my exams. then to the night before my real a-level exam. then i finally started on the evening before the exam — 11.30pm to 2.30am and then 5.30am to 7.30am with half an hour recap of two years work, about 250,000 words.i had previously photoread all my work once quite a while ago. i took my syllabus for the exam and in less than 10 hours photoread it again. i then was able to go through each point and find the appropriate notes and make a hugely condensed work load. this still left me with over 100 pages to learn, totally understand and memorise inside four hours. the first period was spent learning all the work. i photoread the notes before i had my three hours sleep. before going to sleep i listened to the paraliminal – memory supercharger to help the photoread notes to be fully absorbed and to make up for the lack of sleep.in the exam i photoread all the questions and followed paul scheele’s advice by skipping questions where the answer would not come straight to my consciousness. i actually found very few questions like this as i felt very unstressed — and i made sure i was in the correct state of mind as soon as the exam started. i have now received the results which will enable me to go to edinburgh university. i am doing a joint degree in mathematics and artificial intelligence. i am also doing psychology as a side subject for the first two years of my four-year degree. as i have to read a lot of books for my degree i honestly believe i can utilise the power of this and continue the two subjects to the extent where i will have two separate full degrees after the four years.[product in reference: photoreading – click here]phillip gillespiemerseyside
sceptic becomes a believer!dr michael bennett at the university of minnesota is one of the few experts on reading skills in the world.he was originally sceptical about the possibility of photoreading, but thought it could possibly work. after being consulted by a television company for the news, he took the plunge and learned to photoread himself.this is what he now says:“photoreading combines all the most efficient reading strategies — proven in university studies over many years — with what is now known about the phenomenal perceptive capabilities of the human brain. it is undoubtedly the best accelerative reading improvement program available today. and, it is presented so that the average person can benefit immediately, and for a lifetime.”[product in reference: photoreading – click here]story from learning strategies
traveller uses mindlab for powerful jet-lag reset“with the life i lead i need to have something for myself that works quickly. the mindlab is such a wonderful thing to own. it’s really a way to get a rest and 10 times more benefit without 10 times more effort. . i personally have a psychedelic experience every time.for me the additional benefit of the mindlab comes when i may be tired and i need to re-energise. it’s like sitting in a really comfy chair, i use the mindlab especially when i’m travelling as i give talks round the world. the mindlab is my faithful companion. it’s perfect for overcoming jetlag and recharging my internal batteries. i call it my portable brain spa!i often use the mindlab in combination with the paraliminal titles. people are surprised when i tell them that i listen to my own cds — of course i do!”[product in reference: mindlab – click here]paul scheelelearning strategies
calm and relaxed at work“i now walk into work feeling really calm and relaxed, instead of all grumpy and miserable as i used to do.“ when i do cap on me and my wife getting on better, our relationship works so much better – the system works fantastically well. “i approach life differently, i approach my relationship differently, and i approach other people differently. as a result, magic happens: little synchronicities come out of nowhere. it’s amazing how it just works. “to be honest, i’m a self help addict. i own about 50 different programmes, and this course is the only one that i have never put away after i’ve listened to it – i’ve kept using it continuously since i ordered it. it’s that good.”[product in reference: effort free life course – click here]gerry smit, dentistkent
build confidence & self esteem!the self-esteem supercharger is wonderful! it does much more than the name implies. you don’t have to be down to listen to the recording, you just need a desire to go higher up.  the title provides a stepping stone from the old, limited person to rebirth as a new, higher, more powerful person. it is like touching the monolith in 2001: a space odyssey, seeing the lightbulb and feeling the infusion of power through a catharsis. listening to the recording made me feel like a butterfly emerging from the cocoon, spreading its wings, and soaring to new heights. thank you very much.[product in reference: paraliminal – self esteem – click here]c michelcustomer
it just works!i went back to college at 39. competing and excelling with younger and smarter people made me search for every advantage that i could get. win’s techniques were the keys to my graduating at the top of my class and getting a plum job before college was even over. i use the techniques with my kids and am astounded with how well they are doing. it just works![product in reference: genius code – click here]mark bossertlifetools customer

how does the photoreading system work? 
bynigel singer 
april 29, 2020august 25, 2022 



how does the photoreading system work? photoreading works differently. it is seeing a whole page at a time and ‘storing’ the relevant information you need and then recalling it as and when you need it. most widely used with age ranges from 13 upwards, it has a success rate of over 90%; which for a…

photoreading v speed reading 
bynigel singer 
april 21, 2020august 17, 2022 



photoreading v speed reading speed reading evolved in from research in the 1940s and then popularised by evelyn wood. it uses the traditional reading techniques, left to right, from top to bottom and developing letters, words and sentences into paragraphs, sections and then the message. however, to get the speed required you go for phrases,…
