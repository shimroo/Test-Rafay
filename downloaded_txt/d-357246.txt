a floral & event design studiouniquely seasonal, garden-inspired, and designed to turn any event into a remarkable experience.we believe flowers can transform a space, set the tone for a celebration, and define a moment in time.  endlessly inspired by the seasonal abundance that surrounds us in california, our work is grounded in an appreciation of the natural world and all of its lush color and incredible texture. our style is timeless, romantic, whimsical, and organic, and reflective of the setting and the story of the day. we value thoughtful design and a collaborative spirit, making for a fun, engaging creative process from start to finish.
