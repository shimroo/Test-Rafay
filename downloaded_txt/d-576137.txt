- george bernard shaw, irish playwright and critic

if you hate a person then you are defeated by them.


- confucius, chinese philosopher




against the awe-inspiring backdrop of the mahakumbh - a once every 
144 year event - that witnessed the largest human congregation on earth 
at prayagraj, millions of devotees congregated to pray and plunge into 
the meeting point of the sacred rivers - ganga, yamuna and the mythical 
saraswati. this created a visual canvas that no scenographer could hope 
to emulate. a powerful and undeniable testament to the power of faith. 





dancers and musicians were part of the daily celebrations. the 
experience has been described by every artiste as deeply moving, 
extremely humbling, life altering.  shovana narayan and geeta 
chandran, whose dance ensemble were invited to perform last month shared
 their individual perspectives on the impact of being a part of this 
human tidal wave.

drenched in devotion. i felt a powerful current of energy as i dipped

insignificance both on earth and in the cosmos. a moment that shakes one
 to the deepest core.
