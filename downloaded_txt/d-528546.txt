about us

drug collection kiosk in little falls hospital's lobby
we're proud to offer drug collection kiosks at various locations throughout our network to help our community members clean out their medicine cabinets safely! just bring your unneeded, unwanted, and/or expired medications to any of these kiosks for free, safe disposal — no questions asked.
at little falls hospital, the drug collection kiosk can be found in the hospital lobby.









 about our drug take-back program



this service is open to the public — you do not need to be a bassett patient to participate.
the program covers over-the-counter, prescription, and veterinary (pet) medications.
only pills and liquids can be deposited in the kiosks. inhalers and sprays should be brought to one of the pharmacy locations to be collected at the pharmacy window.
this program does not accept needles and other sharps. patients should ask their primary care provider about properly disposing of sharps.
participants should only deposit medications prescribed to themselves, a dependent, or someone who is deceased.
medications do not need to be in their original containers.





 why prescription drug collection is important



thousands of americans call poison control lines, get admitted to the hospital, or die each year due to home medication errors or accidental consumption. eliminating unneeded medications can save lives — especially those of children, elderly people, and pets.
prescribed painkillers are often sought out by people struggling with addiction. disposing of unneeded pain medications can help fight the opioid epidemic.
medications dumped in landfills or flushed down toilets contaminate soil, groundwater, rivers, and oceans. returning drugs to hospitals and pharmacies to be properly disposed of protects wildlife and community water supplies.
