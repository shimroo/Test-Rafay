"if a man has lost a leg or an eye, he knows he has lost a leg or an 
		eye; but if he has lost a selfhimselfhe cannot know it, because he is 
		no longer there to know it." oliver sacks 



welcome to corrosion doctors
for most of us, 
corrosion 
		is the degradation of metals that is often 
called rust
		 and is a curse we have to 
endure 
		helplessly. the 
mission of this popular 
		web site is to improve the general 
		awareness of what metal corrosion is all about, from complicated processes 
		that are at play even behind the simplest corrosion reactions to the impact 
		corrosion may have on complex systems (pipelines,
		cars,
		

		central heating, ...) and human health (implants,
		allergies,
		toxic metals 
		...).

		many are surprised when they learn that there are many ways to
		prevent 
		and control this natural force. the corrosion 
		doctors'visitors are also surprised when they learn that these corrosion 
		processes may also be happening inside 
their own body!! 
		however, the topics covered in the many pages of the web site go much beyond 
		metallic corrosion because ... what is corrosion after all?

... a daily annoyance? 
... a complete shift in your way of looking at materials?

			for yourself!

corrosion doctors also discuss the degradation 
		of our lives due to 
toxic elements 
		and the basic degradation of the planet because of 
pollution,
		global 
		warming, and 
global dimming!  more 
		recently, the corrosion doctors' interest has turned inwards with a new 
		focus on the 
corrosion 
		of our brains!!
with more than 1,600 pages and thousands of external 
		links, the corrosion doctors site is a good example of what lean information 
		systems are about.
