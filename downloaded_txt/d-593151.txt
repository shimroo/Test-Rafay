bayit......the hebrew word for home transcends a simple structure, as it also means a state of mind.for our members, ctj is not only a house of prayer, learning, and gathering but it is also an experience that transforms our souls and deepens our lives.we are a lifelong, egalitarian community comprised of visionary leaders who assist our families of all makeups and backgrounds in finding a sacred, safe place to connect to judaism and to others.we would be so honored for you to join us on our journey. אין כמו בבית - ayn k’mo babayit - there truly is no place like home.































thank you for all you do to keep judaism alive in the south bay!
