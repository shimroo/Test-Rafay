message from the chair


welcome to the department of religious studies at the university of california, santa barbara, one of the finest centers for the study of religious traditions and phenomena in the us and internationally.

juan e. campoassociate professor and department chair
since its founding in 1964, ucsb’s department has been at the forefront of discussions about the nature of religion and pioneered new theoretical and methodological approaches. our department has engaged head-on the difficult question of what counts as “religion” and continues to demonstrate that understanding it is vital for our students and the world. we have stood behind the idea that the scholarly investigation of that which we call “religion” — and what is taken to be its opposite, the “secular” — must take place in a university setting where all ideas are subject to the same standards of inquiry.
our present and past faculty includes presidents of the american academy of religion, guggenheim scholars, and award-winning scholars.
today we are the largest department of religious studies in the entire university of california system, and one of the largest departments in the us solely dedicated to the secular study of religion. our 24 full-time ladder faculty and 7 full-time lecturers, together with numerous affiliated faculty from other departments across the humanities and the social sciences, represent an unparalleled depth of expertise in studying the multifarious ways in which humans have conceptualized, interacted with, and contested the sacred.
we offer a major in religious studies, a major in middle eastern studies, and minors in religious studies, american indian and indigenous studies, iranian studies, and jewish studies. the department also teaches several critical languages (including arabic, persian, hebrew, hindi, turkish, coptic, kazakh, sanskrit, and tibetan), which are essential for an in-depth understanding of religions in their cultural contexts. (other critical languages, such as chinese, japanese and korean, as well as european languages including greek and latin, are offered by other departments.)
we are very proud of the students we have educated over the years, who have learned to think, write, and speak about religions—about rituals, traditions, texts, and experiences—in deeply informed and critical ways. our offerings are an indispensable part of a general liberal education. students who graduated with us are active in academia and in the professions.
our graduate program in religious studies is among the very best in the country. many of our alumni are faculty members at academic institutions in the us and abroad.
over the last several decades, the forces of globalization have dramatically changed the religious landscapes of our state, the nation, and the world. the academic study of religion has never been more important, and what we do together as specialists in our various fields has never been more relevant. we are exceptionally fortunate in having a gifted faculty, student body, and staff. i invite you to roam this website to see what we are all about and to understand why the study of religions at ucsb is so intellectually rewarding.
juan e. campoassociate professor and department chair

statement	the department of religious studies at the university of california, santa barbara stands in support of the protests for racial justice and police reform. black lives matter.
	we commonly hear that “the death of one man is a tragedy. the death of millions is a statistic.” this sentiment echoes in the national response to the current health crisis, where thousands and thousands have died and continue to die daily. 
	our expertise lies in the academic study of the world’s religions. each emphasizes the sanctity of life.  in jewish, christian, and islamic traditions, human life is holy because god is holy (lev 19:4; qur’an 5:32, 6:131; 1 corinthians 3:16). in the buddhist tradition, the first and foremost precept is the prohibition against taking life (any life, not only human); at the same time, the human condition is unique and precious because buddhas can only appear in human form. in religious traditions of the african diaspora, black gods and ancestors rise up to defend black and latinx lives in historical rebellions and revolutions. the most well-known of these is the haitian revolution that began with the invocation vodou deities in 1791 at bwa kayiman.
	racially motivated killings are often processed as a statistic, notwithstanding the well-known killings of trayvon martin, michael brown, eric garner, freddie gray, sandra bland, breonna taylor, tony mcdade, and ahmaud arbery, among many others. in the violent taking of george floyd’s life, witnessed by the world, we have not a statistic but a tragedy. it is both a reminder of the anti-blackness embedded in our society and an example of the systemic institutional brutality directed towards minoritized communities.
