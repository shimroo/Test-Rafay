education



apply for the 2025 curatorial initiativethe curatorial initiative reflects the dc arts center's commitment to fostering underrepresented artists by offering a rare, year-long opportunity to develop the fundamental skills of artistic curation. each year, one to two apprentice curators are selected to work alongside a professional mentor curator in planning and mounting two to three full-scale exhibitions at the dc arts center.  first, with the assistance of the apprentice curator, the mentor curator leads the curatorial process—honing vision, selecting artists, crafting a catalog, and bringing an exhibition from concept to installation. then, the roles are reversed, and the apprentice curator leads the curatorial process with the assistance and advice of the mentor curator.

by jiazi yincurated by liz ashe



jiazi yin’s exhibition invites viewers into a world where individual pieces resonate as powerfully as the collection as a whole. her square, abstract works challenge conventional orientations, reflecting the profound influence of memory in her artistic practice. each brush stroke and the interplay of cyanotype and paint demonstrate a distinctive sensitivity, creating an evolving landscape of color, texture, and mixed media. these elements collectively serve as maps, tracing the artist’s journey and sense of self. four color theorem captures poetic fragments of memory and layers them into a rich tapestry, mapping her experiences over recent years in dc and georgia, and celebrating her expanding community and temporal story.

we live in times of great flux, where social and scientific change demand that we reevaluate some of life's most basic assumptions, providing us new choices in how we live, how we love, and how we connect. sign of the times, showcasing the artists of the dc arts center’s sparkplug artists’ collective, presents a scattershot of perspectives that coalesce around the theme of charting new courses through this unfamiliar and unstable landscape.
