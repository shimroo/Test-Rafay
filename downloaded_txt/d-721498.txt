welcome
greetings. we are living through an alarming time. with much of the world on self imposed quarantine batting an invisible enemy and financial uncertainty looming, there may be some difficulties ahead for all. do what it takes to keep yourself and those around you healthy. yes, that may mean turning your life upside down. right now there is no normal and after this passes the new normal will be something different. stay strong and stay focused. this is a community of amazing resourceful individuals. put that resourcefulness to work. network with others in your local community. look out for each other. pool resources and help the elderly and those with greater need and susceptibility to the virus threat that faces us all. take care of each other. ultimately it will be strong local caring communities that weather this storm with the least amount of damage. be strong. be well.

grounding and centering
it happens to all of us. young / old, weak / strong, shielded / open. eventually we all run smack dab into a system overload of energy that we cannot use or is not our type. it leaves you feeling out of sorts, not like yourself at all. often you end up acting out the physical manifestation of that energy leaving you feeling trapped inside your own body doing things that you would not otherwise do.

health and life force energy
how do we stay healthy with our vampirism? all vampires need bio energy and it is this energy that keeps us well and strong. i know that i have easily experienced low levels of my energy within a day of little energy access. feeling everything from lethargy to mental weakness, i know i stay motivated to replinish the energy loss i experience and to defend what i have against those who would take it. it is up to us to be motivated to maintain our energy levels at a place that keeps us strong and alert.
