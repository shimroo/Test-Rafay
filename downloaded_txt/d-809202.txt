h o u r s  +  a v a i l a b i l i t yopen tuesday - friday 11:00 - 2:00**please note, the 11:00-2:00 window is simply for consistency. 
saturday morning pick ups are made possible if we have the order friday by 1pm. 
most days, we are there earlier than 11 and later than 4 but occasionally need to leave for deliveries, consultations, etc. 
we are wildly flexible and happy to accommodate orders beyond this window of time with a little heads up and communication.
need flowers on a monday? church flowers for sunday? can't pick up until 3? we are more than happy to facilitate these requests, so don't hesitate to reach out! 
we are a small staff with a lot of ongoing projects, private clients, and general demands that requires our attention in various places and times. 
most orders can be placed and filled through our order form on this website. otherwise, please call our shop at 231-271-1977. we are very responsive to voicemails + emails!
while this feels like a small window of time, it truly allows us to service our various clients, juggle all the plates, and wear all the hats... i mean flower crowns. 
we appreciate your understanding and respect to our business boundaries!
