new flying spur range
the power of the possible
built on the new ultra performance hybrid v8 powertrain, the flying spur is a luxury sedan that offers a unique combination of breathtaking craftsmanship, unrivalled comfort and power few cars can match, thanks to its ultra performance hybrid powertrain, which can generate 782 ps (771 bhp) and a full 1,000 nm of torque (737 lb ft). in short, this is a car like no other.

a car like nothing else on the road

the new flying spur represents a combination of performance and luxury that should be impossible. passengers can expect an exquisite, limousine-like experience, characterised by generous legroom, unrivalled comfort and intuitive technology, while drivers can expect performance previously unheard of for a four-door, luxury sedan. there are two stunning models to choose from: the flying spur speed, designed to take sporting luxury to new heights and the flying spur mulliner – an unprecedented expression of automotive craftsmanship, whether you sit behind the driver or behind the wheel.

key features
exquisite exterior design

with a sleek new exterior look and feel, the new flying spur is spacious yet streamlined; imposing yet intricately detailed. crafted from superformed aluminium for a near-seamless surface, it exudes elegance and a sense of latent power.
 
from the stunning front grilles to the eye-catching wing vents, handcrafted details can be seen everywhere on the car’s sleek exterior – while eye-catching 22” wheels add even more road presence.

key features
an exquisitely crafted cabin

a luxurious passenger space
wide range of hides
handcrafted veneers





                          a luxurious passenger space
                      

sitting in the handstitched leather seats in the rear of the flying spur is a joy, thanks in part to the generous legroom afforded by the car’s spacious cabin. a panoramic glass sunroof allows daylight to flood in from above. electrically-operated privacy blinds, meanwhile, can be activated individually or all at once with a single tap on the touchscreen remote. 





                          wide range of hides
                      

the leather upholstery is available in a wide range of colours including new gravity grey, while options for embroidery, piping and speciality stitching allow you to make the interior your own. where appropriate, sustainable olive tan leather is applied to sections of the mulliner model’s cabin.





                          handcrafted veneers
                      

the cabin features beautiful, handcrafted veneers – your choice from a range of high gloss woods, contemporary open pore finishes, or technical materials such as carbon fibre and engine-turned aluminium. there is also a range of new ‘piano’ painted gloss colours, including imperial blue, burnt oak, cricket ball and gravity grey by mulliner.

              connected technology at your fingertips
            

every flying spur features a suite of connected services delivered both in the car and via the my bentley smartphone app. it can access road infrastructure data to provide real-time traffic information*, green traffic light prediction* and swarm services from other road users that can inform you of roadworks or diversions*, while also including a wealth of driver assistance systems.
 
* all driver assistance systems and connected car technology are subject to regional availability. please contact your local bentley retailer for full details.





              install your favourite apps
            

with the new my bentley app studio* you can install a selection of apps directly on the car’s infotainment system. this means you don’t need to use your phone to access them, which in turn means they can access data from your car, such as fuel and range information that can be useful to navigation apps, for example.
 
* all driver assistance systems and connected car technology are subject to regional availability. please contact your local bentley retailer for full details.





              bentley rotating display
            

optional on the flying spur speed and installed as standard on the flying spur mulliner, the stunning bentley rotating display brings together the best of bentley’s craftsmanship and technological innovation. it allows the driver to choose between a 12.3” high-resolution touchscreen, a panel housing three handcrafted analogue dials, or a beautifully finished section of veneer, free of instrumentation.





              more control for rear-seat passengers
            

passengers in the rear benefit from the touchscreen remote (tsr), a removable wireless tablet that offers access to virtually all the controls available to the front seat passenger. that includes the audio system, the heating and ventilation and even the seat functions – including postural adjust and seat auto climate, if the wellness seating specification is installed.





              filtered air for improved wellbeing
            

an intelligent new air conditioning system has been installed to filter out potentially harmful pm2.5 particles. if the system detects that pollution levels are higher outside the car than inside, it will stop drawing air from outside and instead recirculate the air inside the cabin. it can also use the gps system to detect when the car is nearing a tunnel and switch to recirculation mode in anticipation.





              innovations in comfort
            

all four seats benefit from advanced features such as heating, ventilation and massage, while the wellness seating specification adds two truly innovative features to make you even more comfortable. seat auto climate monitors humidity and temperature at the surface of the seat, and deploys the heating and ventilation functions automatically in response, to keep you comfortable at all times. postural adjust, meanwhile, uses air pockets in the seat to continuously change the pressure on different muscles throughout your journey, helping to prevent stiffness from setting in. unlike competing technologies, it can even introduce a unique twisting motion, for maximum effect. 





              entertainment for all
            

to enhance the rear seat experience, bentley rear seat entertainment adds removable touchscreens to the backs of the front seats, allowing passengers to stream content to them from their mobile devices.





              unrivalled audio options
            

audio options include the standard bentley signature audio, the 16-channel, 1,550 watt bang & olufsen for bentley and for the most discerning audiophiles, the 20-channel, 2,200 watt naim for bentley system – the most powerful factory-fitted automotive audio system in the world.
