standby please


here's the deal.i have way too much stuff going on in my real life. blogging takes a lot of time out of my day and i can't concentrate as much as i should on things that matter right now. namely, things like grades and college.therefore, i will be taking a break from blogging. i'm going to have to take off at least a month and it could very easily be 3+ months. this is not the end at all. i'm committed to being back up at 100% right after the new year.there is one exception - the friday flickr fetch will not stop. i've pre-selected all future fetches leading up to february so there's no hours and hours searching for that perfect hot pic.i can't wait to come back and rock it out.love,ace

100,000


today, october 3, 2006, at 4:55pm, gayer mechanic wales had its 100,000th visitor. they were the everyday gmw visitor - they got here by way of a link on one of my favorite blogs - aussielicious - and they live outside america - in italy - just like an increasing percentage of visitors here.i started this blog less than 8 months ago on a dark, cold, and lonely wednesday in february. i started the blog for myself, as a personal collection of things that interested me, and i got about 5 hits a day - all from hitting reload/refresh . there wasn't any real need for anonymity - no one was watching. well today, things are a little different.yes, in the future, i want to be out. there are so many things i wish i could share and i think those things would make this blog better. someday when i come out in real life to my friends and family, i'll jump on the computer and do the same for all the readers in cyberspace.until then, look forward to some changes around here - mainly a major facelift that is gonna be gorgeous!love,ace

life: october 1st, 2006


last night i went to a friend's birthday party. i've mentioned her and her parents before. she lives way outside the city that i live in - almost half an hour. when i got to her house, walked around to the back porch, and looked around, i realized that i knew none of the other people there. not to desperage the other people there, but they were all pretty rural and the center of their social lives is the mcdonalds right off the interstate. so generally not the crowd of people that i hang out with.but it was fun.    we had a bonfire and made smores, something that i haven't done in years. i snapped a picture on my pebl. i gave my friend the new scissor sisters album, ta dah. i went to the record store before the party and picked the album up. as i was leaving i realized that i wanted one too so i went back and got another for myself. crazy crazy. since then, i've listened to the album 4 times through, which is insane, but so satisfying. i almost never buy physical albums anymore, mostly i download from itunes. but for both this album and confessions, i go for the real deal.

brandon flowers & fergie on trl this week


"oh fergie, what you gonna do with all that junk? all that junk inside your trunk?""oh mr. flowers, how do so perfectly pull off that eye liner and mascara?"those questions may never be truly answered my friends, but if you love these two like i do, check them out this week on trl.brandon flowers (from the killers, duh) is in my personal opinion, the hottest man in music. i love those cute, tight, velvet blazers and that sometimes almost seussian slicked up hair. he's such a hot little package! and fergie? this is the girl who went from "where is the love?" to "london bridge." enough said - she rocks my socks and if i was straight, i would "tap that." but in the meantime, i'll have to settle for brandon. if only he were gay! :(check them out

oh poor bree van de kamp


oh gosh, bree just had her first orgasm on the the season premiere of desperate housewives. it happened during that scene that was on youtube for a short time before abc got it pulled off. damn, how much would it suck to not ever have an orgasm, and then when it finally came, to not know what it was? her "orgasm" - the thing she thought was an orgasm, was something she described as a "tingling feeling after sex". that is what happens to close-minded republican women. ha, kidding!oh shit, here come the emails.much love,ace

nip/tuck dissection: episode 4.02


the gayness continues...with some scientology!christian is continuing to live in denial, with regards to his gayness - i hate saying homosexuality, so very 1990s. richard chamberlain comes in with his pet, thad luckinbill (great name) and tells christian all the procedures that thad will need, including a new "aristocratic nose" - what the hell? so blah blah blah, christian convinces thad that he doesn't need to pretend to be gay/bi for his sugar daddy, takes him to a strip club, and watches him get danced on(?) by a stripper. oh yes, thad remarks to the stripper (the episode, blue mondae, is named after her) that he has a "woody." fabulous!so i think it's safe to say that by convincing thad that he is straight, christian believes that he too can be convinced that he is straight. so, that storyline ends with richard kicking thad out because of the strip club thing. thad goes to christian's place, blah blah blah, offers blowjob for money, gets punched and kicked out by christian. [i failed to mention the butt shots! sorry! anyone know where there might be pics posted?]oh ya, all that scientology stuff with matt and kimber, crazy crazy shit. those producers have some real balls.in my extensive research for this post i came across:thad luckinbill's fan sitehis imdb profile with picshot pic from daytime emmysace

nip/tuck season 4 premiere


damn, just finished watching. fairly good episode. i'll cover the gay parts. after the rumors going around all summer and the very first scene in which sean asks christian to assist him with "get over here, i'm lonely", it becomes clear that there will be gay themes throughout the season. brooke shields, playing christian's psychiatrist, asks him "ever consider the possibility that you're in love with your partner?" ha, duh. and he ends up doing her on the desk. so that combined with some comments by a mother-daughter whore tag team prompts christian to have an interior designer over to see his place - he asks her to "butch it up." also, there are some nice moments of interaction between sean and christian while sean is handling some ball implants. classic, i salute you.

music: persephone's bees rocks my socks


i just found a great band: persephone's bees. they have an amazing soul, rock, pop, even gypsy sound and my new favorite song is "nice day". their website is here and as you can tell from below they're also ridiculously photogenic.
