since william webb ellis first 
			caught a ball in 1823, an inherent part of rugby is getting together 
			after a tough match for a brewski and a singalong. rugby singing 
			has been part of the game including the all blacks hakah to 
			millenium stadium as it resonates with song for decades.
			nevertheless it is often the bawdy songs that cements the spirit of 
			rugby with mirth and laughter, to continue the rivalry in song for 
			hours after the game.never being able to find a complete list of 
			rugby songs we scoured the web to come up with the definitive list 
			of songs, so take a look.download the lot, print them, learn 
			them and sing them all loudly!if we missed a few - email them to
