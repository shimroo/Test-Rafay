for over 40 years, our hallmarks have been strength, quality, durability, and craftsmanship.
c. j. delery enterprise, inc. manufactures and installs heavy-duty aluminum patio covers and car ports. for over 40 years, our hallmarks have been strength, quality, durability, and craftsmanship. our computer designed, del-port covers have proven to be superior for several reasons:

we use heavy gauge aluminum (.025, .032, .040, .050) and a harder alloy aluminum than other roll form cover manufacturers.
our “baked on” finish is more durable and will not chalk like more frequently used dip coatings.
we use a deeper, stronger panel locking seam.
our 18″ flashing material is .025 thick with a baked on finish (most use 12″, .018 galvanized, uncoated material).
the 6″ x 4″ wrap around clean out gutter system is a significant improvement over other manufacturers’ designs.
our 20 year labor, materials, and leaks warranty is the best in the industry.
del-port covers can be designed to meet or exceed wind load ratings of 110 mph.
we do not use subcontractors in any phase of our manufacturing or installations.
c. j. delery enterprise, inc. is fully licensed, insured, and is a member of the bbb and the greater new orleans home builders association.
