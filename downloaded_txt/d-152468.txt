math is key to academic and career success and core to our work. in houston, home to our headquarters, one in five students does not graduate from high school, and improving math education is a way for us to help equip students in our community for future career success. our signature program supports math education through student peer-to-peer tutoring, supplemental instruction and professional development for teachers. we collaborate with local professional sports teams, rice university and the united way to amplify our message about the importance of math education and to raise awareness about enrichment opportunities for teachers and students. our goal is to increase the number of houston students who pass algebra 1, graduate from high school and are ready to succeed in college.
