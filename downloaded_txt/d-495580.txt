about me

hello and welcome to my page! 
one of my earliest goals in life was to own my own home, and i understand the profound effect that has on our sense of security. i recognize and value the trust my clients place in me and can promise i will listen to your needs, provide sound advice based on a thorough knowledge of the market, and strive to provide you with a seamless, stress free transaction. my previous career working for leading financial institutions in london & new york, provide me with excellent negotiation skills and a strong technology background that i will utilize to reach your goals. i have experience with a wide range of property types from residential rentals to luxury listings, and have a particular interest in horse and farm properties.
originally from london, england, i moved to the us in the 90’s to be with my future husband. granby connecticut has been our home for over 20 years and we could not have chosen a better place to raise our two children. we love the peaceful open spaces, our community’s respect for the natural environment and that special new england small town feel and i am proud to be an active and connected community member. i currently serve on the board of the granby development commission, am a member of the granby community emergency response team.
