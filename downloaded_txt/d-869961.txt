the wholeness method


our exclusive methodology for holistic mental health has been honed after a decade of work with both adult and pediatric patients. we blend conventional psychiatric care with innovative functional/naturopathic approaches such as nutritional therapy, psychotherapy, psychedelic- and ketamine-assisted therapy, neurofeedback, and mindfulness practices that support the body and mind. all our patients undergo a comprehensive biomedical assessment that can include blood work, genetic testing, and brain-mapping technology to provide a 360-degree view of your health. at the wholeness center, you are not treated by one practitioner. instead, our caring and expert team of psychiatrists, naturopathic doctors, and therapists work together to tailor a treatment plan that addresses your whole self to establish and support comprehensive health and overall well-being.
