                voices from schechter            









							schechter provides us an opportunity to really own our judaism in order for our desire to learn and cultivate our knowledge.						

								shira lupiansky-hasson, m.a in midrash and jewish art, teacher							










							the exposure to all kinds of people and a variety of jewish sources allowed for personal growth and the desire to engage with ideas and people different than me.						

								sigal aloni, m.a. in marpeh spiritual care, clinical dietitian							










							i acquired a significant and deep foundation in halakhah and midrash thanks to the best teachers in the field.						

								rabbi raanan malek, srs graduate 2018, chaplain, us navy							










							schechter provided me with the confidence and familiarity of jewish texts to use in my my profession as a tour guide. prior to schechter, i knew a lot of jewish history but i was looking for ways to connect biblical stories and legends to my teaching.”						

								muki jankelowitz, m.a. in midrash and aggadah 							










							at schechter, we learned about the different streams in judaism. this is where religious pluralism came to life for me. i also realized how crucial it is to build a strong jewish identity curriculum within our school, especially for the many students who came from the fsu, where they had little or no jewish background.						

								yael segev, principal and educator in ofakim over 45 years, today deputy mayor of ofakim; schechter m.a. graduate in jewish women’s studies							










							i acquired knowledge to help me understand the world i live in – such as the origins of today’s streams in judaism – learning that we can’t allow judaism to be ‘owned’ by any one denomination because it belongs to us all and we must stake our claim.						

								moriah karsagi aharon, m.a, contemporary judaism and land of israel
