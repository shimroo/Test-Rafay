in loving memory of diana manilova january 14th, 1950 - october 28th, 2021our beloved spiritual teacher and friend, diana manilova, entered eternal life on thursday, october 28th, in her hometown of moscow, russia. diana was born on january 14th, 1950, to miron and eva manilova of moscow. she is preceded in death by both her parents and her son, manilov alexandrovich ‘sasha’. she leaves behind her grandson, manilov nikita alexandrovich, brother, manilov vladimir mironovich, and cousin, bieber lyudmila leonidovna. diana began playing the piano at a young age. she had both a love-hate relationship for the piano. she told me how she would always try to get out of her lessons by sabotaging the piano. she once stuffed tissue paper in the chords to silence them! eventually, her love for music won over, and she graduated from the moscow conservatory of music and began teaching there. diana also graduated from the american university of moscow (i’m not sure about the name of the actual university…help?) with certification in healing. she devoted her life to helping others through her special gifts of shamanism, spiritual consulting, clairvoyancy, and channeling. she traveled the world over the last 25 years of her life, working with thousands. she resided in nepal for 4 years before moving to thailand where she resided for the past 20 years.  as a shaman, diana received her initiation on lake baikal from one of the highest shamans of mongolia, zaren. the name, ‘daughter of the sky’, was bestowed upon her at that time. a writer and poet, diana, was the author of ‘merkaba of love,’ in addition to numerous poems.a few words from the hearts of her students and friends…(i’d love it if we could share the thoughts and words from other students, family and friends below.)‘thank you dear diana for introducing me to channeling and the world beyond. i will be forever grateful for all the gifts you’ve shared. may your soul travel to all the solar systems you shared with us on earth.’ with love, light and laughter – mike‘may diana fly high throughout the universes to experience all the wonders that the gods and goddesses have created. we cannot thank you enough, diana, for all the blessings of love, laughter, and wisdom you’ve shared with us. may you be blessed a hundred times more!’								love you, kiss you, hug you, too! – amylead by buddhist shaman, psychic, and healer diana manilova
