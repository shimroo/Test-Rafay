                        sensory inclusion                    

we want your children to feel safe and secure, so we’ve created a space that is sensory-friendly. shades to control sunlight, predictive floor patterns to show pathways to public spaces, sound dampening wall treatments and wheelchair access are just a few things to take comfort in. prepare your child for their visit with our social story. to learn more about sensory inclusion at the museum, click here.
