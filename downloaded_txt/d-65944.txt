welcome tomadison countyoffering a beautiful country backdrop to history, culture, and nature gives us the reason to boast that “our attraction is only natural.” madison county is home to our four freedoms park, complete with an old-fashioned gazabo in the center of the park square. this is where the four freedoms monument resides to symbolize the four freedoms outlined in a speech by president franklin d. roosevelt and salutes our very own hometown hero, capt. colin p. kelly, the first hero of world war ii. our rich architectural history shines with the stately madison county courthouse, circa 1912, and the real life “to kill a mockingbird” style courtroom still in use today. guided walking tours are available of our downtown historic district that includes madison’s oldest home, the livingston house, circa 1836, many historic markers and churches. we even have a classic steam engine that was in service in 1919 and is still operational today!
