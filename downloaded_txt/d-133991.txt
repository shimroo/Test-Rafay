						lake martin is a man-made reservoir located in tallapoosa, elmore and coosa counties in alabama on the tallapoosa river. it was formed by the construction of martin dam on the tallapoosa river. the martin dam powerhouse is used to generate hydroelectric power for the alabama power company. construction on martin dam began in 1923 and was completed in 1926, creating what was at that time the largest man-made body of water in the world. originally known as cherokee bluffs for the geological formation upon which it was built (which erroneously recognized the historic indigenous people of the area), the dam was renamed in 1936 in honor of thomas martin, the then-president of alabama power company.one of the largest man made lakes in the united states, lake martin is a popular recreation area for swimming, boating, fishing, water skiing, camping, and golfing. the dixie sailing club operates on lake martin. many waterfront neighborhoods and luxury homes are located on lake martin. the cities of alexander city, dadeville, and eclectic are nearby.lake martin hosts many events throughout the year, including fishing tournaments, a fireworks show on the fourth of july, and the alexander city jazz festival, an annual event every june in downtown alexander city and at the lake martin amphitheatre.lake martin includes many popular attractions, including eagles nest, natural sand beaches, restaurants, camping areas and popular islands. the lake has several landmarks, such as the kowaliga bridge, and several marinas, but perhaps the most recognized landmark on the lake is chimney rock, a large rock formation that resembles a chimney. chimney rock is located several hundred yards away; the formation which most people call chimney rock is acapulco rock. the area was the tallapoosa river gorge before martin dam was built, and the water is more than 150 feet deep. the spot is visited by thousands of boaters yearly, who park in front of "the rock" to watch people climb up 60 feet and jump off into the water.lake martin has become a weekend getaway for many of birmingham, montgomery and even atlanta.alabama has a lake of a similar name, the logan martin lake on the coosa river, but lake martin and logan martin lake are not part of the same river system.
