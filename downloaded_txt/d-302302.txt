i’m not here to make you feel comfortable while you eat your popcorn and watch the illusive movie screen you believe is good or bad.
i’m not here to stroke the narrative, or second your favorite ‘truther’.
i’m not here to dig in my heels, to defend a position or attack another.
i’m here to make you feel uncomfortable with the idea that you’re supposed to turn your mind over to a movie, a chess game, a promised unfolding – a savior.
i’m here to challenge the narrative – on all sides – and question anyone who claims to have the “truth,” the “inside story,” and the “answer.”
i”m here to challenge my own shifting understanding and perception, to admit that i am open to change as more information comes in, that i can be wrong and still be honorable, and to embrace anyone who is willing to do the same.
i’m here, my friends, as a sovereign soul, seeking truth, seeking justice, and seeking peace and the betterment of the human condition. 








 
















 



“patricia cori is one of my favorite authors of all time and i’ve read all her books. (she’s) very articulate, can be very analytical, and there’s a very very deep side that goes way down the rabbit hole. she helped take me down some rabbit holes that i found fascinating.  i feel this is her best work yet, which is phenomenal. it’s the perfect timing for material that’s needed, and i think it’s going to help a lot of people.” 



- michael jaco, former navy seal and cia operative

spiritualist. five stars!”


chinaza nnabuenyl, the on-line book club org.








 


hacking the god code is a bold, remarkable statement that stands out in a world of spiritual platitudes that too often pretend threats are not there – an avoidance that only leads to yet more abuse and manipulation of the human race. this book is as brave and honest as it is well written and lucid...
