dog days

posted on february 15, 2025 by robert 

dog days of summer in southern ontario c1985
toronto. one logical category for photo collectors is pets. another is children.
the photo at left is likely too modern for most collectors but it illustrates the categories nicely.
we all know about the dog days of summer when it is too warm to be very active. the little girl at left with her dog is sitting in the shade, carefully tying her laces.
those wishing to add to their collections, or other curious folk, should visit our events this year. as dates and venues are firmed up, the event is listed here to the right under “phsc events”. as the date of each event approaches, a post will be pinned to page one of this site.
come out and enjoy the fun – usually we have free parking and good food for all. admission is modest (or even free for some events).

a weird little camera …

posted on february 14, 2025 by robert 

a strange little camera using unperforated 35mm (?) film – seen at the fall 1995 fair
toronto. … from a fair nearly three decades ago. the photographs and text by bob lnsdale appear in issue 21-4.
the writing for this camera says, “mystery ‘argus’ camera which has brevittato stamped on the front (italian for patented). with an equator anastigmat f/6.3 50 mm koristka lens, used unperforated film. chris hale thinks it might have been made by kraus.”
unfortunately, mckeowns do not list the little camera as an argus model. since koristka is an italian lens, the cameras is likely italian as the patent stamp suggests. the small image is from issue 21-4 while the large image is the journal photo upscaled in topaz photo ai which has a ways to go. it’s getting there … slowly (some upscales are extraordinarily well done).
check out our events for this or other unusual cameras. dates and locations are posted at right. closer to each date i will pin a special post to the front page of this site.

horse sense

posted on february 13, 2025 by robert 

farm horses on a kodak autographic print (early 20th century)
toronto.  photo collectors sometimes choose pet/animal photos like these farm horses.
others may collect special prints like this kodak autographic print marked “dinner time”.
a little ‘horse sense’ goes a long way in deciding if a particular photo would close a gap in a collection. this photo may be too new or poorly exposed for some, but the fact it is autographic, outdoors, work related, etc. may make the print desirable. perhaps it could be a filler, ready for trade if a better photo is found.
visit our events this year and see what you can pick up to augment your cache of prints, cameras, accessories, etc. check the right sidebar for dates and venues. i will pin a post closer to each event. sensible?

man of la mancha

posted on february 11, 2025 by robert 

tilting at windmills
toronto. photo collectors revel in well illuminated, correctly exposed and framed old photos from daguerreotypes to paper prints.
in the 1960s, i had the pleasure of attending a performance of   ‘man of la mancha‘ at o’keefe centre here in the big smoke. the simple stage settings were cleverly combined with  a lighting technique that was just short of magic.
to this day, the last scene remains burned in my memory. the stage lighting carefully shifts your eye from don quixote’s dream to the reality of his prison. all this takes place during the infamous spanish inquisition. in his dreams, don quixote reminisces how he and side kick sancho, go off on adventures such as tilting at windmills (quixote thinks they are enemies) only to come crashing back to reality and their prison cell.
photo collectors can learn about the power of lighting by attending such performances. lighting knowledge can be put to good use at one of our events this year to discriminate amongst the many photos offered to carefully add just those special images to their collection.

remember when? exec meeting by zoom #55

posted on february 10, 2025 by robert 



phsc president
clint hryhorijiw

toronto. … how time flies! february 5th was our 55th executive meeting by zoom. clint has honed in on two dates for the spring auction, but a firm date has not been set. the venue will likely be the long branch legion hall as before.
our meeting began with a brief comment on phsc financials by long time member and one time treasurer judy rauliuk (ca). her insightful suggestions will be reviewed by a sub-committee and reported back next month.
treasurer john morden sent out his report before the meeting  and provided a summary of last month’s cash flows. john is in the process of simplifying our banking structure.
editor patrick gunn’s  first newsletter, 25-1 featuring a new style and number sequence was released last month.  issue 25-2 will be out later in february.
john allman has generously taken on the o3c representation for now. john is a long time phsc member as well as being actively involved in other photography clubs including the o3c.
membership secretary lilianne schneider issued both a monthly report and a trio of detailed membership reports from her spreadsheet records. she requested a change to the website to ensure memberships are clearly marked as new or renewal to aid in routine distribution of the member-only dvd to new members.
just to repeat, our journal is in ‘pdf format only’, so an email address is essential. a mailchimp notification is sent to all member emails when each journal pdf is produced and uploaded.
important: if  you have unsubscribed to our list, you will not receive notification nor photographic canadiana nor other info. mailchimp does not permit me to reinstate a specific email address once unsubscribed by the owner. renewal of such addresses are only possible via a form, not on our site.
also, if you change email addresses, please tell us – mailchimp will tag the old address as cleaned (they cannot add your new address automatically). if you are a member but have not seen any notification for photographic canadiana since you registered or renewed, please email lilianne at member@phsc.ca.
celio barreto reports that the january talk by speaker  janine freeston, of oxford, uk was well received with all seats offered on eventbrite sold out. as new speakers are announced, details will be posted here. celio initiated an investigation in ways to streamline access to our presentations, noting some people registered twice (and the odd one 3 times) on eventbrite.
social media editor, ms markovic was unavailable, but emailed a brief update.

hot time in the city – gastown riots in 1971, a 2008 re-enactment and photo by stan douglas
toronto. the latest edition of ago’s newsletter, foyer, features, “mining the archive with stan douglas”.  the article gives photo collectors one and all, the impetus to dig through various archives to seek image information.
the foyer writer, matthew rolfe, begins this article, “for stan douglas, pivotal moments in history are an opportunity to better understand the present. over the last three decades, the vancouver native has used his distinct command of photography, film and installation to unpack and reinterpret historical archives.
“three works by douglas demonstrating the range of his oeuvre are currently on view at the ago – two in the exhibition light years: the phil lind gift and one in the exhibition the culture: hip hop and contemporary art in the 21st century. on wednesday, february 12 at 7 pm [this coming wednesday], douglas will discuss his work and continued investigation of the image during a live talk at the ago.
“douglas’s relationship with abbott & cordova, august 7, 1971 (2008) dates back to his time in art school in the 1980s.the grand photograph, on view in light years, depicts a chaotic scene from the gastown riots of 1971 in vancouver’s downtown east side [click the  thumbnail at left to see the image left].
“after attending art school and situating his studio in the neighbourhood for years, douglas staged a full-scale re-enactment of the 1971 event with over 100 actors in 2008, resulting in a composite photographic work of remembrance. …”

a call to arms …

posted on february 8, 2025 by robert 

got an idea to meld?
toronto. gearing up for the  publication of issue 73 this year, our favourite editor, rita godlevskis, of photoed has called for photographic submissions.
issue #73 will have the theme ‘meld’ which is described as ” merge, combine, or mash-up” –  that is, using photography as a “creative blender”.
rita describes this issue and more in her january 2025 newsletter.  the newsletter also announces ppoc‘s “canadian imaging conference & expo” in ottawa this spring april 25-7).
here is a great way to get recognized by submitting suitable photos for issue 73 or to learn new ideas and trends by joining the conference up in ottawa this spring!

evangeline, 1913 movie

posted on february 7, 2025 by robert 

bob wilson (right) with staff scientist michel maillet, projection room, science north – photo by stan white
toronto. you likely think of hollywood when you think of films/movies but we also produced movies beginning with evangeline in 1913. in issue 21-2, (sep.oct 1995) ev devoted a number of pages to the centenary of motion pictures in canada, 
his own article titled “phsc celebrates the centenary of motion pictures” begins, “an early canadian feature film was produced in halifax, nova scotia, in that year [1913] by the canadian biograph co. limited of halifax. the company was formed in 1912 by h.h.b. holland of the anglo-american film co. of london, england.
“holland was president and general manager; n. v. castonguay, vice-president; h.g. lawrence, secretary-treasurer; george winters and e.f. keefe, directors. a studio was maintained in halifax on barrington street.
“‘evangeline’ was the first feature release. it was filmed in annapolis and grand pre in october and november. h.t. oliver, an engineer, equipped the laboratory and supervised the entire photographic and mechanical work, becoming a vice-president. w.e. thompson was chief photographer. 
“the scenario was arranged by marguerite marquis following the famous poem by longfellow. local dramatic talent featured prominently as did the financial assistance of local residents. the film was successful both here and in the united states. this success was not repeated in later ventures.
“holland had a dispute with oliver, who left the company in april of 1914. the company went out of business three months later.”
you can read the rest of ev’s tale and other articles in this issue by viewing the appropriate pdf file on the free members’ only dvd. not yet a member? well, heck it is darned easy to join! see the menu above titled membership for the form. send it and your cheque to our membership secretary. want to use a credit card or your paypal account? see the paypal paragraph at right of this page (don’t forget to send the form). questions? write lilianne at member@phsc.ca.

les jones – president’s message issue 21-2
toronto. in april of 1995, we ushered in a new president – les jones (his photo is from the journal, enlarged and enhanced by topaz photo ai).
in the second issue that year (issue 21-2) les offered these points in his first president’s message: “1996 will mark the beginning of an important new phase for the phsc as it develops into a society of national relevance.
“we have come a long way since larry boccioletti, john linsky and morris fischtein founded the society over 20 years ago with a nucleus of just 19 members.
“from these small beginnings, the phsc has grown and prospered to a remarkable extent to become one of the most active and respected organizations involved in furthering the preservation of canada’s photographic heritage.
“our success has meant that we are now in a position to build on the efforts of the founders and to take the next step in establishing the phsc as the premier private organization in the country promoting all aspects of photographic history.
“to this end the executive has adopted a three point focus for the forthcoming years:
1) photographic history to be more pro-active in encouraging original research into canada ‘s photographic history. to explore ways to act as a reference and co-ordination centre for historical photographic information and to further advance the collecting of cameras and images.
2) member benefits produce the best magazine in north america, provide top- notch speakers and offer an array of services of use to our members.
3) membership increase efforts to ensure the maximum exposure for the society and its events and endeavouring to ensure that everyone who might be interested in joining knows of our existence and understands the benefits …”
les went on to list the immediate plans and members heading each plan. read the rest of les’s message in the pdf file for issue 21-2 on the free member’s only dvd. if you aren’t a member, consider joining today! membership is both rewarding and inexpensive. see the menu item above titled ‘membership’ and the notes at right to use credit cards or a paypal account. send the membership form (and payment if a cheque) to the phsc address on the form. any questions? drop a message to lilianne at member@phsc.ca.
