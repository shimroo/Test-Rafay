wow, this is my first blog post once again in god knows how long, should i try to keep this active? is it worth it? for those asking, i will still try to push for the piso para sa puso, its unfortunate that it didn't push through through out the habagat, it could have been so much help... my fault :( 2012 has been great but 2013 will be even bigger... some choices and big decisions will be made as well as big switches and moves, cheers to the present and more to the future! see you again soon

	 piso para sa puso
	 
    


here is my update guys... this is for my #pisoparasapuso drive to make twitter more useful to the community... i was asking if you were ok with me setting up a bank account and hopefully you guys deposit once a month whatever amount sana not more than 5,000 pesos, even the smallest piso contribuition will always be welcome, if my half a million followers hypothetically gave one peso each month that would be 500k plus, a big big amount of help for any charity then we all choose a certain charity/institution  each month to be our recipient... here's the catch..i spoke to the banks and they would be more than willing to accommodate but the bank is worried if some who donate will ask for an accounting of their donation... this might reach a point wherein i will have to disclose some of my personal banking information which i cannot.. so all donations will have to come with a "trust basis"..  no questions asked, i will take a picture of the amount produced each month and post it on twitter so you know how much the total donation will be but i cannot and will not account the donations given, once wired or deposited, no more questions asked... so this will be a disclaimer of some sorts... if you deposit sa piso para sa puso, no questions can be asked regarding the transaction, only to vote which charity it goes too, need your opinion here guys... what you think?additional info : it will be under a separate account however if worst case scenario and someone asks for the accounting and the issue becomes worse, i will have to show my accounts.. which i will not do

" its going to be tough to say goodbye, it always is, nobody loves change but part of life is learning to let things go""a kiss can mean so many different things, it can be the start of something new, it can be how we say this is the person that i love, it can be romantic, it can also be worth waiting for"

	 happy valentines..
	 
    


had some friends over..had a few drinks.. popped a valium and now ready to sleep... its feb 14. so happy valentines guys.. the day of all days... should i be happy... should i be down.. i dont know anymore.. love provides the complexities of life...the similarities and the contrasts the make life worth living...it provides the small things that leave us sleeping and waking up with a smile..love has crossed my path lots of times... sometimes it just doesnt happen, sometimes its not meant to be... sometimes the other party messes it up while majority of the time i mess it up.. i love love...im in love with love..i believe love drives everything around us.. my heart is pounding and racing...i cant wait to be with you

about me

name:  luckym 
location:  manila, ncr, philippines 
you think you know? you have no idea. the real lucky manzano is makulit and malambing. my friends can always count on me. a lot of people have told me that i am a hyper goofball and always full of energy. i have also heard them say that this blog shows a different side of me. so, i guess you're just going to have to stick around to see if there's any truth to this. in the meantime, i'm just enjoying the ride and cracking everyone up along the way...
