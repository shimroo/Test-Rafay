animae caribe 2024//

 




welcome to animae caribe festival 2024:
this festival is more than just a series of screenings and workshops; it’s a celebration of animation intertwined with rich caribbean culture and art.
we are excited to share an incredible opportunity in one of the fastest-growing global industries. the animation industry is valued at over us$400 billion, and animae caribe has evolved into much more than a festival – it is now a platform that connects local animation talent with international buyers, agents, producers, and distributors.
by leveraging our strategic focus on showcasing the caribbean’s brightest animators and filmmakers, animae caribe helps position regional talent on the global stage, offering them unprecedented opportunities for international exposure and growth. this creates a significant pathway for t&t’s animation and film industry to gain the recognition it deserves in the global market.
over the 23 years of the festival, it is customary that you our guests experience the traditional festival activities, but also get to savor the flavors, rhythms, and stories that make the caribbean unique.

diaspora influence at  animae caribe 2024

 




at the #massive intra-african trade fair (iatf2023) in egypt, organized by the african export-import bank (afreximbank) under the creativeafricanexus, i had the distinct honor of being part of a pivotal discussion titled “the future of animation, is africa prepared?” it was an immense privilege to be included among such a distinguished panel of industry leaders and visionaries, representing the caribbean within this vibrant conversation about africa’s animation future.
our panel was composed of remarkable professionals: ebele okoye of jolly squid media & animation from nigeria, john kamara, the global ceo of adanian labs and ada animation in kenya, mahmoud hemeda, ceo/co-founder of samaka studio and the animatex animation festival in egypt, amath ndiaye, a pioneering senegalese animator and ceo of obelus film & animation studio, comfort arthur, award-winning director and ceo of @the comfy studios in ghana, and stuart forrest, ceo of triggerfish.
