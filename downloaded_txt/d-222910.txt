											are there advantages to using internally threaded body jewelry?
									 	

internal vs. external threaded body jewelry
for those getting their first body piercings, the choice between internally and externally threaded jewelry can be a source of confusion. externally threaded jewelry is more common and is usually lower in cost. internally threaded jewelry is less readily available but provides advantages that may make the extra effort to find this style worthwhile.  the primary advantage of internally threaded jewelry for body piercings is the added comfort and safety during insertion or removal of the jewelry. this can be particularly important in dealing with new piercings where the healing process could be set back by the rough threads of externally threaded jewelry catching on the healing tissues and causing tears in the skin.  many professional piercers are also adopting the use of internally threaded jewelry for its advantage in the piercing process. appropriately sized piercing needles with threaded ends can be connected to this style of jewelry. this allows for a single motion to pierce the body part and insert the new jewelry, thus reducing pain and trauma to the surrounding tissues.  another distinct advantage of internally threaded designs as compared to externally threaded body piercing jewelry is the ease with which the component pieces can be put together. with externally threaded barbells, the ball ends are difficult for many individuals to attach due to difficulty in locating the internally threaded hole where the ball attaches to the shaft. internally threaded jewelry eliminates this problem by adding a small externally threaded stud to the ball which connects to the internally threaded shaft of the barbell.

tools for piercing
you may have had your ears pierced with a piercing gun back in the day. while this is not so terrible a method for soft flesh like that found on the earlobe, piercing guns are not recommended for any other type of piercing. the reason for this is that guns tend to crush the tissue they are penetrating. this doesn't allow for adequate healing to occur. instead, your piercing technician should use an autoclaved (sterilized) hollow needle for all body piercings (technically, even earlobes). needles may sound scary, but they actually do less damage to surrounding tissue when they pass through your skin. the difference can be thought of this way: would you rather slice a tomato with a razor blade or a butter knife? the analogy may be a little extreme, but you get the picture!

											what's a good tongue ring to wear to a rave?
									 	

rave over your tongue ring
tongue rings come in a wide variety of styles. from multi-colored balls to flat metal studs to vibrating bullets, you can choose pretty much any tongue ring to suit your mood.
one of the most novel types of tongue jewelry is glow stick tongue rings. just insert one of five sticks through the tip of the ring in five different color choices: red, pink, green, blue, or purple. if you're a more flashy piercee, you might opt for the battery-powered flashing tongue ring. this jewel lights up and flashes in your mouth. a perfect party trick!

											how do i clean my tongue piercing?
									 	

healing your tongue piercing
in order to ensure a safe and quick healing process after your tongue piercing, you'll need to do an oral rinse three times a day, or after every meal. for three to six weeks, use a medical-grade oral rinse for at least 30 to 60 seconds. if you have trouble finding a medical-grade rinse, dilute 4 oz. oral antiseptic in 4 oz. water and rinse with that. do not use a regular mouthwash, as this will do nothing to clean your tongue piercing.
also, be sure to brush your teeth with a soft bristle toothbrush three times a day. gently scrub the ball and pin of your tongue jewelry to avoid plaque build-up on the jewelry.

											when can i start stretching my piercing?
									 	

stretching your piercing
stretching is an ancient tradition that more and more body modification fans are adopting today. most common is the earlobe stretching, but most piercings can be stretched over time -- tongues, navels and septums. tapers are generally used to assist in the stretching process. tapers are needle-like tools that can be moved through your piercing at varying times to widen the hole.
a general rule with stretching is not to rush the process. you may be anxious to try out that great collection of tribal wooden body jewelry, but if you rush, you'll only end up injuring yourself. stretch at about three times the rate as your piercing originally took to heal. for example, if your earlobe took two months to heal, wait six months to begin your stretching process with body jewelery. see your piercing professional for a steady schedule you can follow.
