pardon my progress
thanks to the spambot-party crashers, i'm closing comments pending some sort of upgrade.
the upside of not hearing from you peeps?
1. no one to rub in the dawg smashing today. 
2. no deafening silence to worry about, since you peeps don't comment anyway.
3. no smart ass comments about how your neglect is my fault, because i don't ever post.
wish me luck in ridding the infestation. (yes, silently...)
