operation wallacea is a network of academics from european and north american universities, who design and implement biodiversity and conservation management research expeditions.
research is supported by participants who join the programme, to strengthen their cv/resume, gain skills they wish to gain or expand upon. they could also join to collect data for a dissertation or thesis (also known as an independent research project (irp). academics benefit from funding for high quality fieldwork enabling them to publish papers in peer reviewed journals. this model enables the collection of large temporal and spatial datasets used for assessing the effectiveness of conservation management interventions.

when you come on expedition you think you know what you can do but each day in mexico you discover a new part of you that stays with you forever.

this trip more than exceeded my expectations and after being something that i’ve dreamt of doing for many years i didn’t think it was possible; life-changing.
