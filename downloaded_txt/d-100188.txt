good omens
















every
friday night, my family celebrates shabbat by saying the prayers, eating
challah and … watching british fantasy/sci-fi television.



for several
years now, the shabbat candles have shimmered their earnest little lights on
the dining room table, as we have gathered a few feet away in the living room
to bask in the lcd glow of “sherlock holmes,” “dr. who” and “jonathan strange
& mr. norrell.” 



most
recently, shabbat has meant a family viewing of “good omens,” amazon’s six-part
series adaptation of neil gaiman and terry pratchett’s novel of the same name.
while none of our tv viewing choices (or, indeed, the choice to view tv at all
on shabbat) could be described as “jewish,” our weekly intake of “good omens” seemed
to be the least jewy of all.



centered
around an odd-couple relationship between an angel and demon who attempt to
avert a new testament-style apocalypse, there are exactly no jewish people or
allusions to judaism anywhere in the show. even the flashback scenes involving
old testament stories, such as the garden of eden or noah’s ark, predate
abraham, obviating the need to deal with the people of the book. or, for that
matter, the book. (for what it’s worth, there is also no mention of islam,
buddhism, hinduism or any other “isms.” wiccans, however, get good billing.)



despite
the decidedly un-small-c-catholic perspective of the show, i felt as drawn to
these perfectly imperfect christian archetypes as i do to miriam maisel. 



a jewish fan
of the book posted a question on gaiman’s blog about whether the author’s
jewish heritage informed the characters, particularly the demon crowley, who often
questions the morality of g-d’s actions.



gaiman
responded: “i think my jewish heritage influenced how the whole of ‘good omens’
was written. you can’t be familiar with the midrash and also assume that anyone
in the bible has any idea what’s actually going on, after all. and crowley is
someone who asks questions.”



but i
think there is something even more distinctly jewish underlying this bit of
christian theological fan fiction. the story wouldn’t work at all if it weren’t
for the relationship between michael sheen’s angel aziraphale and david
tennant’s demon crowley. the two actors play off each other brilliantly, making
their character’s unlikely friendship deeply believable.



and that’s
where, i think, the true jewishness of the story comes in. the characters, who
should have been sworn enemies, cling to each other as they are the only angel
and demon on earth. they have little in common with their warmongering brethren
“upstairs” or “downstairs,” and they are obviously not human. so, they are the
perennially wandering “others.” a tribe of two who work together to
(pre-emptively) repair the world.



the jewish
fan who asked gaiman about judaism’s influenced thanked the author for making
“it possible for me to experience a tradition that often excludes me.” to that
particular fan, gaiman’s jewish influences made the book, and i’m assuming the
show, more widely relatable.



as the
series came to a satisfying, clever and (spoiler alert) non-disastrous end, i
could see from the corner of my eye the wisp of smoke that rises when the last
orange glow of the shabbat candle ashes away.



yes, gaiman’s
strong understanding of judaism likely made the show more relatable. but, in
the end, it was a strong relationship that made the show just a little bit
jewish.

strong princesses open up ‘a whole new world’ for little girls









we have a few “girl” superhero costumes in the house. a
puffy-sleaved lavender batgirl costume and a supergirl costume trimmed in red
tulle and sparkles. but when my 4-year-old wants to dress up as a superhero and
fight crime, she no longer reaches for these vestments of token girl power.





she dresses as a princess.



i had forever sworn that, should i be blessed with a
daughter, nary a single tiara would enter my home. having grown up watching
snow white get saved by a prince, and sleeping beauty get saved by a prince,
and cinderella get saved by a prince, and (well, you get the idea), weak
damsels in pretty ball gowns make my skin crawl.



then came tiana. disney released “the princess and the frog”
when zev was four, and it threw me. zev was swept up in the music (and who
could blame him?) but i was more focused on how an aspiring business owner who
spent most of the film as a frog could leap into the princess pantheon. yes,
the fairy tale includes a handsome prince and a beautiful gown, but it actually
concludes with the opening of a restaurant. that’s their “happily ever after.”
a service industry tycoon marries a cute guy and puts him to work. 



i figured that was a one-off. but the princess power didn’t
stop in new orleans. pixar’s “brave,” featured a fearless princess whose only
flaw was that she didn’t listen to her mother. then came elsa and anna of
“frozen,” sisters whose love for each other save the world.

confucius says: i have no idea what to cook for hanukkah 








i have a problem. and, if you usually host a first night of
hanukkah celebration, i’m guessing you have a problem, too.





hanukkah this year begins on christmas eve. so as i prepare
my menu for the first night, i find myself wondering: latkes or kung pao?



before we dive into the sweet-and-sour meat of my problem,
first let me be clear that i don’t think hanukkah is something special. it’s a
weird little commemoration of a short-lived military victory that pales in
comparison to yom haatzmaut in terms of pride and importance – and to christmas
in terms of absolutely everything else. 



and second, we’re all going to have to come clean about christmas.
my rabbi, of all people, last year wrote a facebook post about our tribe’s devoted
rituals surrounding the holiday that began, “i think we should stop pretending
that jews do not celebrate christmas. we do. perhaps not with christmas trees
and jingle bells. but certainly, we have created our own tradition…”



and yes, the rest of that line read, “chinese food and going
to the movies.”



we jews love our christmas rituals. we love hanukkah, too,
but only because of its proximity 

to christmas. without the christian holiday as a
counterpoint, hanukkah is basically veteran’s day with hash browns.

advanced child placement








i never liked my belly. long before its served as an infant
airbnb, my abdomen has been abominable. now that three children have stretched me
out like a spent mylar balloon, my gut is even more of a problem. but every
problem has a solution, right?





i’ve discovered mine.



no, it’s not diet (and to hell with you for suggesting
that). it’s not exercise either, smarty-pants. it’s the strategically placed child.



a few years ago, i realized that by standing directly behind
an adorable child, perhaps with my hands draped gently on the kid’s shoulders,
i can both hide my gut and make myself appear warm and motherly all in one
selfie. this pose also makes me look tall. it’s a nice trick. 



since first unleashing the cosmetic power of children’s
heads, i’ve made sure to shove a smiling (if bewildered) child in front of me
in every flickr pic or facebook photo i take. the marketer in me is brimming
with taglines: it’s like spanx that
you’re no longer allowed to spank! it’s like a tummy tuck, only without the
surgery and you still look lousy in person! ok. maybe the taglines need
work.



the strategically placed child is the photographic cousin of
the weirdly placed lamp or large envelope that tv shows typically use to hide
actresses’ pregnancies. in those case, the babies are the problem. in mine,
they’re the solution.

babs revisited








after years of hearing mothers’ laments about how barbie
poisons young girls’ minds with an unrealistic ideal of womanhood, mattel
created a new line of barbies with three different body types (short, tall and
curvy), 22 eye colors and 24 hairstyles. these are not “friends” of barbie, but
actual barbies.





i should be rejoicing. but instead, i feel a little
disquieted.



it was so much easier to bash barbie when she was the mean
girl from high school with the perfect coif and the impossible bust-line. but
seeing her transformation is like running into your nemesis 20 years after
graduation in the plus-size aisle at target and having her bend your ear about
her scaring divorce. 



i need barbie to remain ridiculously proportioned and
blonde. the uber shiksa with the unobtainable curves. i need her to be that way
because – after all these years – i realize that my problem with barbie wasn’t
a problem at all.



as it turns out, i relied on barbie to be blonde and
button-nosed because i needed a foil for my jewishness. i needed her to represent
the ideal for assimilation and the ideal for womanhood, so that i could know
what to push back against, as well as what to embrace.

breaking up is havarti to do






dear cheese,



these are the hardest words i’ve ever had to write to a food
product, but i have to be honest with you and with myself, and tell you that
it’s over between us.



we had an amazing run, cheese. from those innocent days of
kraft singles and string cheese through those experimental college years of
stilton and gruyere, you’ve been a constant in my life – the first food i ever
truly loved. 



i remember discovering goat cheese and thinking that i had
tasted heaven. some snickered when a girlfriend declared, “havarti tastes like
sex.” but i didn’t snicker. i knew exactly what she meant.



you were sweet. you were salty. with blue, veiny abandon,
you were sometimes a bit nasty. my mother warned me that you were bad for me, but
that just made me want you more. i had you first thing in the morning, spread
out on my bagel, and i twirled you around my tongue atop pasta any evening i
thought i could get away with it. i loved it when you were soft, and oh, how i
loved it when you were hard.



but i can’t go on like this. 



i’m of ashkenazi descent, cheese, and there’s this thing called
familial hypercholesterolemia that affects my people with a greater frequency
than the rest of the world. (you knew, the first time i refused a cheeseburger,
that religion would eventually come between us.) i’m at an increased risk
of having my heart broken by you… well, not broken so much as stopped. clogged
up with cholesterol.



i have to protect myself; i’m a married woman and
a mother. i can’t just go about, cavorting with any food product i like, as
though there were no consequences.

you say thanksgivukkah, i say chanksgiving






this year, for the first time since 1888, thanksgiving will
overlap with the first day of hanukkah, and i for one am excited to smother
latkes with cranberry sauce. but even as i scour the internet for pilgrim-themed
dreidels and a turkey-shaped menorah (you’re welcome, etsy shop owners), i’m
feeling kinda sad.



according to snopes.com, the happy convergence of hanukkah
and thanksgiving will not likely occur again for another 77,798 years. and since
kale and botox will only take me so far, i doubt i’ll be around to celebrate this
ever again.



how to fill the void left by the fleeting thanukkah? i
propose we alter the jewish and gregorian calendars every few years to pair
other holidays, and i know just the ones to link. the following are some
suggestions that i think would go together like gelt and gravy:



new year’s day and
yom kippur: on which holiday do you wake up feeling awful and repentant
about recent indiscretions, resolving to change your behavior from here on out?



exactly, both!



imagine reciting kol nidrei to the tune of “auld lang syne.”
or popping a few corks with your pre-fast meal. and how much more interesting
would the amidah be if it were recited on a rose parade float? 



mother’s day and
pesach: an interminable, bland and overpriced meal in which you rehash a
litany of past misdeeds suffered at the hands of a tyrant. does this describe:
(a) mother’s day brunch or (b) the first night of pesach? if you answered both,
you are correct!



why is this brunch different than all others? because it
features poached eggs on matzah and chametz-free mimosas. dayenu!
