i just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how incredibly pleased i am with your harmonic barrel stabilizer ii with adjustable gas block for my mini-14. i bought this rifle back in 1986 and haven't been able to hit the broad side of a barn with it at ten feet. groupings at 50 feet measured in feet, not inches. i put it in my safe and forgot about it. i ran across your website and was interested but didn't really believe that anything could fix it. i took a chance and bought and installed it and wow! groups were instantly one inch at 150ft! worth every penny, now my mini is what it was supposed to be from the factory. think i'll have you do a trigger job next, you guys are the best.


sincerely, edward ennis
