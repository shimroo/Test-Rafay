all 
											  external alternator voltage 
											  regulators are now shipping with 
											  our new advanced technology high 
											  speed circuit board.
							
if you buy your 
							new regulator elsewhere,

just open it up and you'll get 
							to see

that your nice new 
											  regulator 

the 
											  "others" sold

you is 
											  nothing more than"a 
											  bunch of 
							surplus 
							parts 

stacked up on a scrap chunk of circuit board"
							 but not here at 
							xforceamps.com

we have our own proprietary, custom 
							circuit

 and 
											  circuit board design

which the "others" 
							try to copy

and their 
											  "stuff" just 
doesn't 
											  stack 
							up
