lisa from usa 12/2010
spent 8 days in cr - 3 days in prague and drove around bohemia and moravia visiting ancestors' villages. loved litomysl, cesky krumlov and wished we had more time for hranice and olomouc.                  




varun from india 08/2010
i travelled almost all the parts of europe, bu the czech republic is the most beautiful country and the peoples are very friendly, honest and loving. i travel almost every year for last three years.                  




bernex from usa 06/2010
i cannot get enough of the czech republic. so much to see yet so little time. this time i am renting a car, get my gps and just explore. my only concern is other than prague, no one seems to speak english and my czech is very poor. i love the historic sites, the building, and the people i met so far are great...i will be there for two weeks in july; i will visit seven cities in just four days and the next week i will travel to hamberg for two days then back to prague. any suggestion about parking? never seems to be enough parking anywhere. love the czech republic. the food though is very heavy.                  




tony from usa 05/2010
does anyone know about making calls to and from the czech republic? do you need to have an international phone? can you use your usa iphone?                  




john from united states 05/2010
am attempting to set up a vacation to travel to czech republic, austria, hungary, slovakia, and poland or some of them for three weeks.
would like to travel probably by train, hire local tour guides, stay in hotels, etc.  i would tell you where we would want to travel and when.  do you set up trips like this?
if not, would appreciate it if you could recommend someone who does do this.
