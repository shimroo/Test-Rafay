you may see other nonfiction books listed under sylvia engdahl's name in library or bookstore catalogs. they are textbooks she compiled for greenhaven press as a freelance editor.   she did not write anything in them except the introductions, which do not express her personal opinions about the topics covered.


paperback editions
the paperback editions of engdahl's novels can now be obtained at retailers in addition to  amazon.com. but at higher prices. (this is because copies sold at amazon are printed there; having copies printed elsewhere and made widely available involves substantial distribution costs,) unfortunately, you will not find print copies of her adult novels, or in-print editions of her ya novels, in libraries, as most do not buy indie editions -- but they can get free copies of all her ebooks (except enchantress from the stars) from overdrive and several other library ebook systems. please let your librarian know.
if the paperbacks are too expensive but you prefer a fixed page format to ebook format, you can get pdf editions for $2.99 or less at google play that are the exact image of the paperback pages.

what is ad stellae books?
ad stellae books  is sylvia engdahl's personal imprint, used on the ebook and print-on-demand editions of her books and those written by her mother. it is not a publishing company. the name means "to the stars" in latin according to google translate, though that doesn't apply to all latin sentence structures. you can see all the book covers on one printable web page at www.sylviaengdahl.com/adstellae  (the site www.adstellae.com no longer exists.)
all ad stellae ebooks are drm-free (except for five kindle books that were published before amazon offered authors a choice. drm-free mobi editions of them are available in the children of the star omnibus and/or at smashwords.com). sylvia engdahl says, ''drm--so-called copy protection--does nothing to prevent piracy. it simply restricts the rights of honest users with a legitimate need to copy, such as reading on an uncommon device or for backup if a consistent internet connection is unavailable, while acting as no more than a minor inconvenience to dishonest ones. free copy-protection removal sottware can be easily obtained. the honor system is in effect whether or not publishers respect it."

which of the novels should be read first?
sylvia engdahl's novels are very different from each other and people sometimes don't realize that they might not have begun with the one they would be most likely to enjoy. below are her suggestions for where to start. although many of the books are conncted, each is a complete story in itself; she wrote (and in most case published) them one at a time without expecting to write sequels.

if you are in 5th or 6th grade you should start with enchantress from the stars, and you probably won't like any of the others until you are older.

if you are in 7th or 8th grade you should start with enchantress from the stars, this star shall abide, or -- if you are a girl who likes romance -- journey between worlds. the far side  of evil is rarely enjoyed by readers below high school age. 

if you are in 9th or 10th grade, you will want to read enchantress from the stars if you enjoy stories told in the style of fantasy, but you don't need to read it first. if you prefer books that aren't at all like fantasy, you should start with this star shall abide, the far side of evil, or journey beween worlds.

if you are an adult or a high school junior or senior, you can start with any of the above, but may prefer to read children of the star or defender of the flame first (or journey between worlds if you like romance). 

although defender of the flame is less well known than the ya novels, it and its sequels will be of special interest to adults who like enchantress from the stars and the far side of evil, as the second and third volumes of the captain of estel trilogy deal in detail with the anthropological service that appears in those earlier books. the third voiume, envoy of the flame (revised edition published in september 2022), can be read by itself but includes major spoilers for the first and second volumes. all three contain some material unsuitable for children.

if you are an adult and the controversial medical theme of stewards of the flame appeals to you, then read it before  promise of the flame. if it doesn't, you can skip it, as promise can stand alone.  neither of these is appropriate for ya readers, and neither needs to be read before defender of the flame unless you plan to read all five and want to avoid the spoilers in defender's backstory.

titles not mentioned above are sequels and though they can be read independently, they contain backstory that includes spoilers for the books that precede them.
