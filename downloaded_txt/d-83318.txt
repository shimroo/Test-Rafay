compliments:


your 
	software is simply incredible, very nice work.  a basic design is very 
	easy to modify and we can try new designs every few minutes.


i should tell my colleagues about the software but i like having this
    advantage. sorry.

thank you very much. my students thank you too. this is
    one of their favorite activities...  i love it.
as always the customer service at pre-engineering is
    hard to beat!
  	congratulations - the material presented is excellent and has provided me with a whole host of new ideas to present to my students. please keep me informed of any new teaching products.

    last fall i purchased a copy of your modelsmart software. using the software they were able to significantly reduce the number of test
    models they built before arriving at their final design...   out of a field of 23 teams, my son and his partner won the gold medal for bridge. 
    thanks for such a great product.

    our time has come. my son, daughter, and model smart took first place for the
    state.... we will be heading for the national competition. persistence and the right tools
    will create results. thanks!! 


	thank you very much for all of your help. the information regarding 
	the tx and rx restraints is priceless. thank you for taking the time 
	to make the model and then to lead me through it. there are not that 
	many companies in the world that offer that type of customer 
	service. thank you again!!!!
	

    i have had great success with the program and recommend it to others.  i will
    continue using it in the future.
