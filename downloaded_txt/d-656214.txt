a hated dictator is gone thanks to the people's uprising





as we join the celebration with the people in egypt who showed such courage in the face of 30 years of repression, those of us living in the united states must stop the crimes of our own government towards the people of the region:  the mubarak regime was “made in the u.s.a.” since 1979, the u.s. has given the regime $35 billion, $1.3 billion per year in military support.  because of this, egypt has a large military, and the world’s 4th largest fleet of f-16 fighter planes. egyptian police who have held 10,000 political prisoners receive training from the u.s. military.  even the tear gas fired on demonstrators is "made in the u.s.a."despite decades of torture, disappearing political opponents, and the most open brutality against its own citizens, neither republican or democrat leaders plan to reduce military aid to egypt (la times 2/9/11).the u.s. government and leaders know egypt is a torture state.  the united states, including the obama administration, knows about the torture, abuse, indefinite detention, political suppression, rape and sexual assault that had been taking place over years under the mubarak regime.according to human rights watch, “law enforcement officials have used torture and ill-treatment on a widespread, deliberate, and systematic basis over the past two decades to glean confessions and information, or to punish detainees.” omar suleiman – now the vice president – was the intelligence chief responsible for arranging “extraordinary rendition” of prisoners to be tortured in egypt for the clinton and bush administrations, interrogating some himself.saturday march 19: stop these wars now!  on the 8th anniversary of the u.s. war & occupation of iraq, join the protest!  at the white house 12:00 pm, or wherever you are. u.s. out of iraq and afghanistan!the world can’t waitworldcantwait.net  (866) 973-4463 our government must stop supporting torture & repression in egypt!friday, 11 february 2011© 2011 - world can't wait

poem in mourning





weary as an old plow,dulled blades from too many rotations,rusty red,death looms on every channel.don't they ever tire of the swords? slicing brains like so much red meat,cleaved in the womb,no blood, just catsup, to give it thatall american flavor.savor it is what we have made it, gourmet sushi, served withbitter herbs and ginger,under headstones made of ash.ⓒ 2010 the unknown candidate

7 great websites for information on healthcare reform





by mary ward, guest contributerif you’re like most people, you’ve been interested in following the healthcare debate as it happens. but, if you’re busy like most people, you may find it difficult to keep up with this ever changing debate. following are some great resources for keeping up with the healthcare debate – and they’re all online. twitter – twitter’s not just a site for keeping up with your friends, it’s also a great way to keep up with the news. there are 25 different feeds on twitter that provide updates on healthcare reform as they happen. some of them are admittedly a bit biased, but some are also dedicated to simply delivering developments. senate health education and pension committee – this is a link to the committee that started it all! this committee formerly chaired by senator ted kennedy keeps track of the bill as it progresses. on this site you can see the bill as authored as well as changes to it as it moves through the process. this is one of the few places where you can read the bill in its entirety with no commentary.white house office of management and budget – peter orszag is the chief of the office of management and budget at the white house, and he posts a regular blog, which is lately often about healthcare reform. this is a great place for the white house take on things. new happenings are generally commented on frequently.the treatment – this is a blog, but it is written by jonathan cohn, the author of “sick- the untold story of america’s health care crisis – and the people who pay the price”. cohn is extremely knowledgeable and works hard to write a fair and informative blog.side by side comparison of major healthcare proposals – authored by the kaiser family foundation, this site does a good job of comparing various major healthcare reform proposals. it takes a lot of the work out of the comparison for the consumer. covering health – a website for journalists who report on healthcare, this site keeps very up to date on happenings regarding the healthcare debate. since journalists use this website to assist them in their reporting on healthcare, you can count on it to be up to date and factual. healthcare reform 2009 – this is the website for the new england journal of medicine. most of the site requires membership, but anyone can access their extensive coverage on healthcare reform. this site offers commentary from several different points of view, and most of their commentators are experts in a particular area of healthcare. there’s plenty of coverage out there right now on healthcare reform. regardless of your opinion on the subject, you can find someone who’ll report exactly what you believe. but, if you want to know what’s really happening, these websites should give you plenty of information that is fairly reported and balanced. sometimes, in any debate, the hardest information to come by is the factual information. mary ward is a freelance writer and likes writing about medical education topics, such as how to research and choose among online x-ray tech schools, how to apply for online college grants, and more.

blacklisting progressives: the untold story beneath the daschle headlines





this is a must read: david sirota (open left) reports: "amid the swirling headlines about tom daschle withdrawing his nomination for health and human service secretary is a very dark, very foreboding story that tells us a lot more about what to expect from the obama administration than a single nomination fight. it is a story that every single voter who supported barack obama because of his progressive economic platform should know about - and worry about...."

vote to hold the bush administration accountable





updatean open letter to barack obamadear president-elect obama:while i understand your desire to put the mistakes and failures of the bush administration behind us and to focus on the future with a positive agenda of change, i believe it is absolutely necessary to the credibility of your promise of change that you investigate the abuses of the bush administration and hold accountable anyone who has abused his or her power of office or participated in criminal acts.   without holding government responsible for past abuses, there is nothing to preclude those same abuses from recurring.  when you take the oath of office on january 20th, you will swear to uphold the constitution.  you cannot do so while allowing those who have disgraced it to fail to pay consequences for their actions.   those who voted for you are passionately hopeful that you will live up to your campaign rhetoric and act boldly to do what is right for our country--no matter the political cost.  we are facing unprecedented problems domestically and internationally.  we need bold actions, truth, and real solutions.   i implore you to do what is necessary to restore the faith of americans in our country's leadership by upholding your duties to protect the constitution. thank you. everyone please vote to appoint a special prosecuter by clicking on the badge above.  related:arianna huffington: memo to obama: moving forward doesn't mean you can't also look back paul krugman | forgive and forget? | nytimes.com: "...[a]bout mr. obama: while it’s probably in his short-term political interests to forgive and forget, next week he’s going to swear to “preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states.” that’s not a conditional oath to be honored only when it’s convenient...."forcing obama’s hand on torture prosecutions | the opinionator blog | nytimes.com: "...the former chief judge of the united states court of appeals for the armed forces and general counsel for the department of the army has spoken. her clear words have been picked up around the world. and that takes the prospects of accountability and criminal investigation onto another level. for the obama administration, the door to the do-nothing option is now closed. that is why today may come to be seen as the turning point."earl ofari hutchinson: holder can't prosecute bush abuses too many democrats aided and abetted them obama has to hold bush accountable for the laws he broke | elizabeth holtzman, the nation | alternet:  "obama cannot let former bush administration officials get away with breaking the law without violating his own oath of office...."technorati tags: war crimes, prosecute, special prosecuter, bush, cheney, bush administration, torture, justice, geneva convention, paul krugman

two cheers for rod blagojevich





frank rich | nytimes.com: "rod blagojevich is the perfect holiday treat for a country fighting off depression. he gift-wraps the ugliness of corruption in the mirthful garb of farce. from a safe distance outside illinois, it’s hard not to laugh at the “culture of chicago,” where even the president-elect’s senate seat is just another commodity to be bought and sold.but the entertainment is escapist only up to a point. what went down in the land of lincoln is just the reductio ad absurdum of an american era where both entitlement and corruption have been the calling cards of power. blagojevich’s alleged crimes pale next to the larger scandals of washington and wall street. yet those who promoted and condoned the twin national catastrophes of reckless war in iraq and reckless gambling in our markets have largely escaped the accountability that now seems to await the chicago punk nabbed by the united states attorney, patrick fitzgerald...."  continue reading.photo credit:  frank rich.

������� it’s not about them…it’s about us





�������why we must prosecute bush and his administration for war crimes : information clearing house : mike ferner: "...we are complicit in the horrors of this administration.  we can claim neither ignorance nor innocence.  we are complicit by the very fact that we are citizens of the united states, more so because we paid for the war, and even more so for this reason.  listen to a village sheik i met in iraq describe it better than i ever could...." more on this subject from glen greenwald:  � senate report links bush to detainee homicides; media yawns������������� : information clearing house : glen greenwald: " ...the culpability which the report assigns for these war crimes is vast in scope and unambiguous....[...]...instead, tv pundits were consumed with righteous anger over the petty, titillating, sleazy rod blagojevich scandal, competing with one another over who could spew the most derision and scorn for this pitiful, lowly, broken individual and his brazen though relatively inconsequential crimes...." and then there is this:��������������� cheney admits authorizing detainee's torture : information clearing house:  "monday, outgoing vice president dick cheney made a startling statement on a nation-wide, televised broadcast.  when asked by abc news reporter jonathan karl whether he approved of interrogation tactics used against a so-called "high value prisoner" at the controversial guantanamo bay prison, mr. cheney, in a break from his history of being press-shy, admitted to giving official sanctioning of torture...." video is from abc's world news, broadcast dec. 15, 2008.technorati tags: torture, war crimes, cheney, bush, bush administration, glen greenwald, mike ferner, video, youtube

a quiet windfall for u.s. banks





amit r. paley, washington post, reports: with attention on bailout debate, treasury made change to tax policy"the financial world was fixated on capitol hill as congress battled over the bush administration's request for a $700 billion bailout of the banking industry. in the midst of this late-september drama, the treasury department issued a five-sentence notice that attracted almost no public attention.but corporate tax lawyers quickly realized the enormous implications of the document: administration officials had just given american banks a windfall of as much as $140 billion.the sweeping change to two decades of tax policy escaped the notice of lawmakers for several days, as they remained consumed with the controversial bailout bill. when they found out, some legislators were furious. some congressional staff members have privately concluded that the notice was illegal. but they have worried that saying so publicly could unravel several recent bank mergers made possible by the change and send the economy into an even deeper tailspin...."technorati tags: washington post, amit r. paley, corporate taxes, congress, bailout, u.s. economy, banks, windfall, treasury dept., news

how mccain could win





absolutely must read before you vote:greg palast offers a sobering dose of reality about this election:  it's november 5 and the nation is in shock. media blame it on the "bradley effect": americans supposedly turned into klansmen inside the voting booth, and barack obama turned up with 6 million votes less than calculated from the exit polls. florida came in for mccain and so did indiana. colorado, despite the democrats' rocky mountain high after the denver convention, stayed surprisingly red. new mexico, a state where anglos are a minority, went mccain by 300 votes, as did virginia.that's the nightmare. here's the cold reality....continue reading. photo credit:  indymedia.orgalso must read:motherjones blog: how to protect your votet r u t h o u t | is the election about to be stolen in ohio, pennsylvania and elsewhere?technorati tags: truthout, greg palast, vote fraud, caging, voter suppression, steal election, exit polls, purge voters, provisional ballots, gop, voter verification, help america vote act

the coming mccain military draft





juan cole (informed comment): "...mccain is not about the military status quo. he is ambitious for further conflicts. the current us military is too small to handle yet another front, and to maintain, as mccain insists they must, the current ones.my friends, there is only one way for mccain to make good on his hawkish foreign policy and his virtual pledge of more wars.mccain will need to institute a draft for young american men (and, given the times, maybe for women as well).if you are in your late teens and early twenties, or if you are a parent of a person that age, and you have strong views on a renewed draft, it should come into your decision about whether to vote on tuesday and for whom."technorati tags: juan cole, informed comment, john mccain, draft, military, foreign policy, wars, 2008 campaign

�the evidence establishes, without question, that republican rule is dangerous





must read:john dean:  �why it is high time to fix this situation, for the good of the nation"occasionally, during the past eight years of writing this column, i have addressed the remarkably dangerous manner in which republican party officials rule the nation when they control one or more of the three branches of the federal government. over the same period, i've also made this argument, even more directly and loudly, in three books on the subject.in this column, i will be more pointed on this subject than i have ever been, while also repeating a few key facts that i have raised earlier -- because election day 2008 now provides the only clear remedy for the ills of republican rule...."�continue reading. original article (findlaw.com)technorati tags: ohn dean, republican party, abuse of power, conservatives, john mccain, sarah palin, barack obama, 2008 election, president, republican rule

original mavericks to mccain: "you're no maverick"





brave new films talks to the actual original mavericks, who aren't too fond of john mccain using their name:trouble viewing this video?  click here.fontaine maverick, great-great-granddaughter of samuel augustus maverick (1803-1870) explains the origin of the expression -- and why it shouldn't apply to the republican candidate:  samuel maverick was a texas cattleman, land baron and politician, so influential that he was one of the signers of the texas declaration of independence. fiercely independent and equally liberal. sam became well known for what he didn't do, however. it seems, according to fontaine, that he had taken some cattle in lieu of a debt he was owed. he let them roam on an island off of texas, and for whatever reason, didn't brand them. so, any unbranded cattle became known as maverick's. now, this more than likely wasn't an act of revolt. no one knows for sure, but maverick really wasn't much of a cattleman. he was also shrewd, later on in life if cattle weren't branded, he would often claim them.sam was also very spirited and free minded. it was because of this that in 1867 the term maverick was first cited as being used to describe someone with an independent streak, someone not branded...."mavericks believe everybody has a right to be in america so long as they obey the law," fontaine told me. "grandfather maury was no coward. he chased the klan right out of san antonio once, stood up to the mob... maury was burned in effigy in san antonio, for his defense of members of the communist party's right to assemble, for his defense of the hispanic community, support for those who didn't have a voice. "..."my brother called me from california last week during the vp debate and told me if they said the world maverick one more time, he was going to shoot the tv. of course, he doesn't have a gun, but, you get the point. my mother was just quoted in the new york times about how we feel mccain is branded, palin is branded, they are republicans, and true mavericks carry no brand. it's driving our family crazy, upsetting us and the legacy of my family, and we really with the campaign would stop misusing the word and the phrase."john mccain on a few occasions has shown that he can go against his party, but how hard is that when his party has been wrong on so many things as we now see," she continued. "but he has a brand. and palin, i'm not sure she even knows the history of the word of or my family, but one thing is clear to all of my family, she truly is not a maverick." thanks to huffington post.technorati tags: john mccain, maverick, original maverick, video, brave new films, politics, youtube, republican party, original mavericks, 2008 campaign

the mccain-palin camp's final act of intellectual dishonesty?





cq politics | david corn:  "i've listened to sarah palin several times in the past few days. (it's my job--what i get the big bucks to do.) and as she whips up the crowds that come to her rallies, her biggest argument against barack obama is that he will raise your taxes. did you get that? oh, you missed the nuance. he will raise your taxes. and her case is built on two facts. but they are not facts--or not full facts. and though these attacks have been debunked repeatedly by mainstream media factcheckers, palin and john mccain keep using them. call me naive, but i still find it surprising that they believe they can get away with such serial misrepresenting (or lying). so for the last time--i hope--let's look at these two claims...."   continue reading.photo credit:  a barack obama ad quotes press remarks about john mccain's campaign. democrats have added a ''count the lies'' web page.
