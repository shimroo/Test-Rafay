safety benefits of a limousine 

june 10, 2019

 emily lee leave a comment




who would have thought that riding in a limousine could make you look like a celebrity and save your life? it is no secret that big parties and celebrations can get just a bit crazy. at weddings, at birthday ragers, and a bachelor or bachelorette parties, more than a few drinks are expected. why not? a party is one of your only days out of the whole year to be yourself and have the time of your life! you should have as much fun as possible. but a wild night out does not relieve you of your responsibility to keep yourself, your friends, and other people around you safe. renting a limousine to show off in front of your friends at the beginning of the night ends up being a critical — potentially even life-saving — choice as the night winds down. on your big night, a limo is probably one of the safest cars you can be in. here are some of the reasons why.
each limousine is driven by an experienced, licensed chauffeur. he or she will have had years of practice and experience driving limos. rest assured that his or her record is spotless and that you are definitely in good hands while getting to or from the party. your safety is a chauffeur’s number one priority, while the average taxi driver is usually only looking for the payment at the end of the trip. after a bit of careful research, you can find the most reputable companies that have the best drivers. with the finest chauffeur behind the wheel, the safety of both the people inside the vehicle and those outside the car can be guaranteed.
a chauffeur is superior to a driver of a ridesharing company for quite a few more reasons. he or she will be held accountable for any mistakes during the ride; therefore, your driver will take extra caution to make sure you are taken care of. to be hired, limo drivers are personally interviewed by their employers, background checked and must have provided exemplary service in the past, while a driver for a rideshare service is never extensively interviewed and only needs to have a license and insurance. thus, when you get into a limo, you are driving with a driver trusted by his or her company and colleagues; however, when you get into a car with a driver for a ridesharing company, you could be driving with anyone, qualified or not.
if you are attending a birthday party (or any kind of party, really), you are probably not traveling alone. you probably have about four or five of your best friends with you, and you guys cannot exactly fit into the average uber or lyft. splitting up, especially if you have been drinking, is definitely not safe, and, therefore, not a choice you should make. and driving yourselves while under the influence is certainly not an option, either. if you had rented a limo beforehand, you and your friends could just get in the back and be on your way.
when you go out, you should always make sure that you have the best time possible, but you should also always be sure that you can get home safely. getting in trouble with traffic laws or getting into an accident is never a good thing, but it can especially hit hard on one of your most important nights and, inevitably, soil the evening. so, when you go out for huge celebrations, rent a limo — get to and from the party in style and, most importantly, safely.…

so, as a consumer, you’re probably wanting to know some of the inside secrets and habits of the best limo services.
we’d like to share these with you so you can come back from an event and say “that was the best limousine service i’ve ever had”.
to insure that this happens, do this:

do your homework
ask yelp
ask google
ask friends
ask co-workers
ask facebook
ask the reviews on google maps results
ask local business reviews or the bbb

there is no excuse to not do your due diligence. in today’s online environment, you can take just an hour or so and narrow your list of providers down to 2-3 and then call them to determine who treats you the best and who wants your business.
oftentimes, they will beat your best price and do anything, like granting an extra hour, to get your business.
now, once you secure a limo service for your big event, what makes their services stand out?
here’s a few things to note:

they call in advance to confirm the entire agenda for the event
they stock the limo with complimentary water, ice, cups, snack, etc.
they provide, at your expense, any extras you request in terms of beverages, balloons, food, etc.
they provide a professional driver who knows how to treat clients and knows the roads in the area
they arrive on time.
they provide a phone number for driver to reach at any time
they clean the limo between drop-offs and get ride of trash

these are the basics. the importance of a great driver cannot be overstated. a competent driver makes all the difference.
we hope some of these tips will help with your search and give you the ammunition that you need to ask good questions before reserving your next limousine.

if it is difficult to sell a regular car, have you stopped to think about the difficulty of selling a limousine? 

january 14, 2018

 emily lee leave a comment




being such a particular type of car, getting rid of your limo by conventional means is practically impossible since you will not reach potentially interested customers and it will take twice as long to seal the sale.
what you need to sell your limousine. in just a couple of clicks, you can know its price in the market and decide if it’s worth it. go to the face-to-face appraisal in one of our branches, and sell it instantly! the future of your limousine is here.
i sell a limousine.”
being exceptional vehicles and indicated for particular needs, the limousines fit into a niche market dedicated mostly to leisure, special occasions, and the luxury sector. however, despite the economic impact that these areas have on current life, their value in the automotive market is not as representative, although they are still part of an important sector that moves billions of euros a year and, therefore, always they are present in the buying and selling market.
a limousine car is nothing more than an elongated saloon type passenger car adapted for the transport of a higher number of people, more than 5 or 7 that have space in a family model or an suv. its form of manufacture differs from the classic way in which a conventional vehicle is designed and modeled, and consists mainly of adding a new body to a classic saloon. usually, a limousine car has more powerful engines than standard tourism and is aimed at luxury, which is why it has always been associated with personalities, celebrities or executives with high purchasing power. the limousines are equipped with every detail, from comfortable leather seats oriented in different directions and angles to television, internet, bar and powerful stereo, all designed for the user to have a unique experience.
however, to drive this type of vehicle, it is necessary to have an exclusive driving license so that in most cases the drivers are responsible for driving them. also, the insurance for this class of vehicles is special given its structure and production process, so the price to pay may be higher than it would be for a standard car.
big brands for big cars
the traditional association between luxury and this class of vehicles is also given by the names that manufacture them mainly: cadillac, mercedes, lincoln, and hummer are the most outstanding, so if you intend to sell a limousine of any of these brands there are specific details that can serve as a guide for the sale.
rate your limousine now and enjoy the best benefits
do not complicate your life trying to find interested drivers, to lower the price of your limo or to waste time doing driving tests to potential buyers who finally will not acquire your vehicle.

limousines have made great advancements over the years. therefore, it is always essential for you to ensure that the company that you are hiring deals in the most updated and modernized limousines. the cars that the company deals in should feature all the modern conveniences like dvd players, satellite radio, hd stereo systems and various other important accessories. there is another important thing that you must do and that is ensuring the fact that you along with your guests have complete control on all the major entertainment systems in the car. you must make sure not to depend on the preferences of the chauffeur. there are many limo service providers where the drivers have the power of controlling the dvd players, the cd players and the other important entertainment systems. there is no use spending your money on getting a limo service where you are forced to listen to some other individual’s choice of music during the entire trip.
make the choice of a top quality service
one of the most important considerations when choosing to hire limo services is hiring the services of a company that has good reputation in this field. it is important for you to consider the point that the driver of the limousine will have your life and the lives of the other party members in his or her hands. therefore, prior to hiring a limo service or prior to signing any contracts, you must ask for relevant documents showing the insurance and the licenses of the company.
