rachael l moore
front end web developer


				front end web development is my calling. the first line of code i wrote was for a website. a photograph of a beautiful sunset makes me think about image compression (and sunsets). the only thing that could make me happier at work is to do more of what i love best â€“ and share it with more peers as passionate as i am.
