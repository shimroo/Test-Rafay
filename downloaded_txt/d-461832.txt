galciv iv: supernova dev journal #94 - sneak peek: tales of the arnor

                tales of the arnor is stardock’s latest exciting dlc for galactic civilizations iv: supernova, focusing on events that occurred way back in the history of the galactic civilizations universe. over the past few weeks, frogboy has posted several developer journals teasing the extensive lore he has written surrounding the birth of the nyx so i won’t cover that again.   instead, i’ll be going over a quick gameplay overview to show what content this adds to your galactic civilizations games!     ...

sins ii: behind the scenes - the nuances of hardpointing

                the primary 3d artist on sins ii’s development team, paul kiesling (set), was kind enough to swing through this month to provide a “short” explanation on how we hardpoint assets to get them properly working in sins2. enjoy!  let's say you have a finished good-looking ship model; how do you make it work in game? we must hardpoint the ship so that the game has the necessary location data of where to put turrets, fire torpedoes, or prop effects. let's start with getting your shi...

galciv iv: supernova dev journal #93 - an essay of the history of the galactic civilizations universe...

                my office has a lot of printouts in binders regarding the history of the universe (the mithrilar cycle) that both galactic civilizations and elemental come from.   i once had the opportunity to write a book,  destiny's embers  and that was quite an adventure.  my original story was 300 pages but my publisher, del rey, wanted it fleshed out and had an editor greatly expand the exposition of it.  one of these days, i hope to publish the original manuscript which, i should ...

galciv iv: supernova dev journal #92 - of the nyx

                with the benefit of hindsight, tales of the arnor should have been handled as a full expansion pack. it just has such a massive scope of changes in it.     for me, personally, it's the first galciv iv dlc i've got to work on since tales of centauron which i thoroughly enjoyed.  but this one...this one is just so much bigger.  this will probably not be the last post i make on tales of the arnor so i will probably miss some things here.    of the nyx    so as some of you kno...
