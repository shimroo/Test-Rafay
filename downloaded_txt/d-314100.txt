                        remodeling your pool                    
we started cdc pools 30+ years ago when there were no pool remodeling contractors in arizona. we've learned a lot along the way.
each project is a little different. you bump into surprises -- shortcuts or mistakes -- made years ago. this means you need good people (better people) to do the work and check the work.
this is why we use our own crews for most every phase of a project. it's why we have more superintendents checking the work than contractors twice our size. it's why our owners are in the field, they're the first to arrive, and they touch each project.
now, all this doesn't mean we're perfect. during our busy season, january through june, even in the best of times our lead times grow and our communications can suffer. 
however, our focus will always be the same: to be strainghtforward with you, to do superior work at a fair price, and fix issues when they arise.
thank you for your interest. we hope we can earn your business.
