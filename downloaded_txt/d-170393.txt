peace, love and great music - this book is everything i could have             hoped for, its images perfectly reflecting this somewhat rose-tinted             perspective on the 1960s.             the overriding spirit of the book is one of youthful energy and exuberance.             from unashamedly naked young lovers kissing on college campuses, to             protesting hippies and crowds of people, arms uplifted swaying to             the music of joan baez and bob dylan - these moments, observed by             former rolling stone magazine photographer robert altman, radiate             optimism.             what is most appealing about the work is that we can sense the openness             of altman's subjects: they are clearly just as at ease under the scrutiny             of his lens as he is in photographing them. and by capturing people             at their most unguarded, altman creates the illusion that you are             not merely looking back into the past, but are a part of it, welcomed             into the scene. there is the sense that altman didn't need to put             in any great effort into achieving such iconic images, but that for             the 1960s to look this good, you simply had to be there with a reel             of film, camera poised.             of course, this belittles altman's artistry. his skill lies in taking             photos that, while giving the impression of spontaneity, succeed in             sending out a very specific and intentional message to the viewer.             for example, a shot of an anti-war march in san francisco brilliantly             encapsulates the clash between the young, peace-loving protesters,             and an older generation of americans finding it hard to adapt to what             they see as a lack of patriotism and discipline. centrally framing             a middle-aged ex-serviceman, arms folded in defiance, with a steely             glare directed at the camera, against a backdrop of peace banners             and denim-clad youngsters, altman expresses the generational tension             in america during the 1960s in a single picture of contrast.             grouped together in a section of the book are images of much-loved             musicians in their prime: george harrison, the rolling stones, aretha             franklin, joe cocker et al. atlman does not attempt to scratch away             his subjects' veneer, instead putting them on a pedestal, almost deifying             them. this is in one respect disappointing, but perhaps altman is             doing us a favor. at a time when we are constantly exposed to the             private lives, flaws and lack of judgement of the people we are supposed             to admire, it is refreshing that altman keeps the human frailties             of his subjects concealed. no one wants to know about the weaknesses             of their heroes, and it would be particularly depressing to chip away             at the aura surrounding legends like the rolling stones.             when altman does suggest a more serious message, he does so insightfully,             as evidenced in a double page spread of a demonstration in san francisco,             1969. the sheer mass of people crammed into the frame gives a powerful             impression of their unity and passion. the sharp focus on these in             the foreground enables us to make out the emotion in their faces:             an emotion that seems to reverberate to the back of the crowd, despite             us not being able to decipher all of their faces.  the sixties is an extraordinary testament to altman's talent             - there isn't a bad shot among them. it is a delight to leaf through             a book that is not only full of exceptional photographs, but also             oozes the optimism and vibrancy of the 1960s, just the way you'd imagine             it to be."            sally harper (may 2008)    bookpage - america's book review          "robert altman visually documented the changes that rocked the           ’60s with a scope and clarity no one has surpassed. his remarkable           photographs comprise the bulk of the compelling new collection, the           sixties" (dec, 2007)   the bloomsbury review "altman has a professional portraitist's           eye but can also capture the immediacy of situations; here, deliberate           poses mix with candid snapshots. the combination registers a stamp of           uniqueness, one of the best graphic depictions yet offered of this fleeting,           illusory chapter of cultural history."   publishers weekly review "those nostalgic for the             free love era will revel in this handsome, oversized collection of             photographs by celebrated photographer altman. a master at catching             his subjects at the moment of emotional overload-whether they be mischief             makers, war protestors or musicians-the black and white photographs             collected here are pure nostalgia, making a powerful you-are-there             impression that simultaneously highlights the era's distance-chronologically             and otherwise-from the current moment.              altman's particular genius is best showcased in his legendary crowd             scenes... altman has always felt his purpose was to depict "the             life and times that the sixties inspired"; he succeeds beautifully             with this, an impressive social document and a powerful remembrance."
