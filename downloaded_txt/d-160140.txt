drunken post  


1. this is a drunken post, and for some unexplainable reason i'm going to number my thoughts.2. i just got home from marnie & micheal's house-warming party.3. the party was awesome. i especially enjoyed the post-midnight drinking games which are the main reason for my current drunken state.4. i met someone at the party who i think i'd be very compatible with, but they have a boyfriend, so i'm bummed about that.5. i'm thinking i should go for my walk tonight, but i think i'm too drunk. i've been walking 8km/day for the last 2 weeks, and have lost 2.5kg.6. number 6 is a mystery.7. that is all.8. i think.p.s. i've lost count of how many times i've had to press backspace while typing this post. it's a lot. mainly cos i'm too drunk to type accurately.
