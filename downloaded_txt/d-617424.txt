he was aliveâ¦
                        â â â â  the serpente was gently heeled to port, rolling
                        waves breaking at her bow to ripple the length of her
                        waterline, trailing abaft her stern in a foamy âv.â the
                        sea was a roiling indigo landscape, tipped in crimson
                        where her waves broke in spindrift.â â â â  
                        â â â â  breathing deep of the fresh air, buchanan thought
                        then that he could grow to love the sea. love the ship,
                        with the wind on her sails, the rigging taut, the sea
                        dark & surging with immeasurable power, everything
                        humming in a salty harmony. to reconfigure and restrict
                        oneâs world to the span of a vesselâs deck, the open
                        ocean, and all that sky overhead might not be a bad
                        trade. to test oneself against something so beautiful
                        and dangerous in equal measure, it felt in that moment
                        like a calling, something larger than himself. he knew
                        he would recall to the end of his days what he was
                        feeling, the music and mystery of it all.
                        â â â â  he realized that he was the farthest from home that
                        heâd ever been. the scottish highlands and all that he
                        had ever known were lost in his wake. new countries,
                        even new continents, lay before him. he knew that with
                        each new land under his feet, he would grow and change,
                        just as he had done when he first set foot on the
                        serpente. his life had been forever altered when he
                        answered clan buchananâs call at culloden, and though he
                        would still change that decision if he could, foregoing
                        all that heâd suffered, he couldnât argue that in the
                        end he would be the better for it â¦ if he survived the
                        days to come.
