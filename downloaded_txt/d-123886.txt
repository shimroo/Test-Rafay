our medical center lost our lease at the
  end of december 2024.  after
  careful consideration, we have decided not to relocate to another location.
  the clinic will remain closed.

  “after 55 years of serving this wonderful community, i will be retiring
  from my medical practice.  it has
  been a privilege and honor to be your healthcare provider, and i am deeply
  grateful for the trust and confidence you have placed in me over the
  years.”
