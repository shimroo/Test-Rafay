tim holt is very knowledgeable about porsches and is a straight shooter. we completed our first of hopefully more successful transactions in the future. tim's showroom is worth a visit just to see his incredible inventory of 911's. all are immaculate and yearning to be taken home.

over the past 13 years i have bought 4 911's from holt motorsports. a 1992 carrera 2 coupe, a 2002 turbo coupe, a 1987 carrera targa and most recently a 1987 carrera coupe. i have been very satisfied with all of these cars, primarily because both tim and tim, jr. have a thorough knowledge of the various porsche car models, their strengths and weaknesses, etc. and most importantly, they only procure and offer porsches that are clean, accident-free and ready to drive. plus, they are both really nice guys and place a very high emphasis on maintaining their company's reputation and keeping their customer base happy.

i recently bought a classic porsche from holt motorsports. tim holt the owner has been working with porsche's for 40 + years. they really have some great cars. they only sell the finest used air-cooled classics.  i have had porsche's for decades and the next car i buy will certainly be from them. if you want the best, buy here. you may find cheaper but not better. they truly know what they are doing. pleasure to deal with as well.

i am looking for an air-cooled 911, and while i have not yet purchased one, i wanted to comment how great & professional tim holt is. i am looking at dealers across the country and have come across no one who is nearly as knowledgeable and forthcoming as tim is.

i can’t thank tim sr. and tim jr. enough for their help! they are incredibly knowledgeable about their cars and only carry high quality inventory. i’m beyond thrilled with my ‘86 carrera - a good friend of mine once said all new cars are the same, but every used car is different and you get what you pay for. there’s a reason holt’s motorsports has been around so long and are so respected in the porsche community!!
