research
our original research points out key trends in the marketplace, technologies, and the economy. we have predicted major shifts such as the advent of open source, app markets, social media, web search, and the cloud well before they became mainstream phenomenon. our economic research in 2003-2005 even foresaw the recession of 2008 and subsequent research projected the trajectory of the recovery.





forecasting
we are obsessed not only with just seeing what’s around the next bend in the road, but also in understanding how it will impact your business and the behavior of your employees, customers, and partners.

the loyal brand ebook




from our digital footprints on the web, to our mobile devices, to webcams, to our cars, our behaviors are suddenly naked and fully exposed in ways we have barely begun to realize. is it all part of a dystopian future, or is there a way to look at how we can benefit from this new era of transparency?

industry trends


  





artificial intelligence
the world is at the precipice of one of the most dramatic shifts in history: the transition from an industrial society to one that is based on a deep understanding of an entirely new form of knowledge capital, behavior—our behaviors as well as those of the intelligent machines that we are building. ai will profoundly transform our lives, our economy, and our businesses—from driverless vehicles to intelligent machines, personalized medicine to hyper-personalized products and loyal brands that know what you need before you know to ask for it. in this very near future, every person and digital device will have its own digital-self, which knows more about us than we know about ourselves.
we’ve worked to develop detailed innovation roadmaps and a context for innovation based on specific methods and tools to help you quantify your organization’s innovative ability as well as build a solid foundation for the decisions you will need to create a culture of innovation.










the post-gen workforce
while every new generation has faced its share of disruption in technology, economics, politics and society, no other generation in the history of mankind has had the ability to make sure that every human being (and every “thing” ) on the planet is connected to each other, fully educated, and economically engaged. what might this mean for the way in which we build our business, markets, and institutions for education in the future?
delphi has worked with companies to help them create a vision of the future that will create radical new approaches to marketing and manufacturing and mass innovation. delphi can help you to leverage millenials and gen z to take on your organizations and markets biggest challenges and opportunities.










the cloud
the cloud is the hottest topic since the advent of the internet. and nobody can speak to it with more insight than delphi. it’s why hp, microsoft, gartner, intel, cisco and many others have asked delphi to work with their organization. in its simplest terms the cloud is the new context for innovating business. however, the cloud is not just about technology. in fact technology is only a small part of the cloud. just as important is the way the cloud changes the way we collaborate, work, how we are influenced and how we influence, and how we experience the world.
delphi can help you better understand how you can respond to this massive change in order to transform your organization and our industry!
