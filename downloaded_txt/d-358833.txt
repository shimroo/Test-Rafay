						power

when it comes to health, 
						most people are overwhelmed with information, 


which is more often than 
						not, contradictory. this often leaves us feeling, 
						confused, 

sometimes scared and 
						eventually disinterested. the sad truth is - people are 
						still low 

on energy, in pain and 
						dealing with potentially life threatening illness and 
						disease.

						 

in any health situation, 
						it is vital that you understand in the simplest possible 
						way what 

it is that you are dealing 
						with. to this end, the neo health series of books have 
						been 

written, presenting a new 
						understanding of health, in simple, easy to understand 
						language.

						 

in addition we offer a 
						free 
                        ecourse 


that reveals how to:



						keep your body pain free and disease free for life

whatever the condition, find out how to care for your body, 

how to nourish your body and find out what the cause 

and remedy of the disease is.

and that is all of 
					mankind.



											.

					meaning to life.

this intriguing book offers a 
					real possibility of not only understanding 
                      


the cause of all

alternate cancer 
						information and treatment

cancer is now the leading 
						cause of death in the world.

with trillions of dollars 
						having been spent, it would seem that we are still
						

no closer to an answer or 
						solution. however, in the 1930's nobel prize winner,
						

otto warburg conclusively 
						showed that cancer is an oxygen deficiency condition.
						

while it would be 
						unethical to offer false hope to anyone dealing with the 
						condition, 

it is also important that 
						they get as much information as possible. better 

understanding always leads 
						to better opportunity and to this aim, cancer tutor (the
						

world's leading site for 
						information on alternative cancer treatments) have 
						provided 

a comprehensive 
						understanding as well as advice on hundred's of proven 
						alternative treatments for all stages of cancer. the 
						research of the alternative. backed by the independent 
						cancer research foundation, it is a must visit for 
						anyone dealing with cancer or anyone who has a loved one 
						dealing with cancer.

						diabetes 

the world is currently facing a diabetes pandemic. 


every 10 seconds a 
		person dies of diabetes related causes, 

while in the same 10 seconds 
		another two people develop diabetes. 

currently 246 million people are 
		affected by the condition worldwide 

and that figure is expected to reach 
		380 million by the year 2025. 

		in south africa, approximately 1 in 5 people over the age of 35 


has type 
		2 diabetes and more than 50% of them do not even know it. 

following the 
		current trend, 1 in 3 children born after 2000 will have 

diabetes; however it at the turn of the century , it was under 1 in 100.

new updates -
                        7.02.13



for our regular visitors, 
						we try to maintain this website with new and healing 
						information on a regular basis, below you will find a 
						summary of current & previous updates for ease of 
						reference:
   









						there is a wealth of scientific and well documented evidence that
 every single human thought, word or deed has an effect on everything around it.

                        every day we meet people who acknowledge the "negative side" of our country and most say that they would "like to do something about it"  but just don't know what.  heal south africa will offer every single person, from every walk of life the opportunity to do something, in either thought, word or deed.

heal south africa is a project dedicated to uniting and empowering the people of south africa with the goal of peace, happiness and health for all.  this intent is encapsulated in the hsa slogan - '4 1 4 a l l'. what you do for one, you do for all. 

heal south africa aims to empower the individual and to remind each and every one of us, that we are responsible for our lives and everything that happens in them.

                        in these pages you will find resources for self empowerment and healing,  an online directory for nation-wide hsa projects, a distance healing prayer program and a distance
                        attunement program for those who would like to receive healing and for those who would like to receive the gift of reiki in their own lives. this way each individual can play an
                        active role in their own healing process and begin to accept responsibility and claim their own inner strength and power.

                        by accepting this responsibility, we can address the issues and make the necessary changes. all that is asked is that we accept the responsibility to heal our own lives and we will heal south africa!

                        this can be summed up simply by: 





"what we 
						do for ourselves we do for others"
