key west sailing charters
what makes us different?


locally owned and operated for more than 30 years, danger charters is all about the key west sailing experience – wind in the sails, sun on our face, the sound of the waves lapping against the hull.
our shallow-draft schooners allow us to go where others can’t … and we choose to go where others don’t. we seek calm, crystal-clear water so that you can enjoy the very best of the beautiful florida keys. we can’t wait to host you for an unforgettable day of sailing in key west.





we treat you to the key west that’s inspired countless paintings and poetry, and show you why locals choose danger charters too. kick back, relax, and be one with the wind and waves … we’ll take care of the rest.

								mary							


mary knows the waterways of the keys like the back of her hand and is super knowledgeable about (and still super excited by) our area’s marine life. one of her favorite memories on the water is from new year’s day a few years ago when three manatees swam right up to the boat!

we did a full day sail and snorkel trip with about 27 of us and it was perfect! the crew bryan, logan, and alex were informative, attentive, down to earth, and make a mean pasta salad! they even provided the snorkeling gear and tips on where to look at the reef! hands down the best trip during key west! will definitely book again in the future! thanks guys!

on our kayak tours with danger charters, double-crested cormorants are a common sight!🪺these sleek, black waterbirds are often seen perched on mangrove branches or docks, spreading their wings to dry after diving for fish. sometimes, they’ll swim right alongside the kayaks, popping up unexpectedly after a dive. it’s always fun to watch them in action!✨ #kayak #dangercharters #floridakeys #keywest #ocean #keywestlife #keywesttours #dangercharterskeywest #marinelife
