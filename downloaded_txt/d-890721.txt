we love our clients, and the feeling is mutual.



“limbo listens and works hard to achieve our creative vision. we know that they will bring ideas to the table, are flexible on set to make great things happen and will see the project through to the last bit of finishing if need be. they have made us look very good to our clients.”— craig opfer, creative director, magneto advertising/portland“working with limbo films is always a wonderful experience. the team is buttoned up from a production standpoint and creatively, the work is always stunning.”— emily barrow, broadcast producer, zimmerman/fort lauderdale“no matter what the project, limbo adds excitement to our idea, finds ways to knock down roadblocks, and gives it their own creative spin to make it the best it can be. that's why we've done dozens of projects together over the years!”— tina tacket, executive c.d., loomis advertising/dallas“when placing a creative concept in the hands another, you must have complete trust in their ability not just to execute upon it, but to truly bring it to life. this is why i have turned to limbo films for my most important projects over the last 20 years. they don’t simply meet expectations, they exceed them. every time.”— gary fulkerson, creative director, dva advertising/bend“we have been working with limbo films for several years across many assignments. the team consistently delivers and exceeds our creative vision. gary is a true talent who is passionate, collaborative and always gives 110%.”— lauren flemming, executive creative director, epsilon/chicago“i can't say enough about my time with limbo films, during the 3 spot campaign production of microsoft's launch of their new operating system (ms365). with our aggressive schedule, and no real margins for error, i thought it best to work with limbo throughout the production, in order to keep us as flexible/efficient/true to the creative. it was one of the best production decisions i've made, because not only did we produce such great work (on time, and in budget), but we had an awesome time as well.”— dax estorininos, producer, possible/seattle
