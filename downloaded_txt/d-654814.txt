lenten devotions from lutheran hour ministries

in jesus christ, god himself enters our human condition. in servant of the lord, we see jesus as god칙춫s son and our redeemer. he has made the heavenly father known to us. proclaiming the kingdom of god, jesus served us칙춦lovingly, patiently, compassionately칙춦as he died for our sins and rose three days later in easter victory.    

we have in jesus the supreme example of devoted service. his teachings defined the lives we are to live칙춦both in praise and honor to god and in love and peace toward one another. all this jesus did as god칙춫s chosen servant, sent from heaven to earth to be our king, savior, and trusted friend.
