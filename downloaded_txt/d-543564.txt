home from iraq, wary marine fatally wounded





cleveland - on leave from the violence he had survived in the war in iraq, a young marine was so wary of crime on the streets of his own home town that he carried only $8 to avoid becoming a robbery target.despite his caution, lance cpl. robert crutchfield, 21, was shot point-blank in the neck during a robbery at a bus stop. feeding and breathing tubes kept him alive 4 1/2 months, until he died of an infection on may 18.two men have been charged in the attack, and cuyahoga county prosecutor bill mason said friday the case was under review to decide whether to seek the death penalty."it is an awful story," said alberta holt, the young marine's aunt and his legal guardian when he was a teenager determined to flee a troubled cleveland school for safer surroundings in the suburbs.crutchfield was attacked on jan. 5 while he and his girlfriend were waiting for a bus. he had heeded the warnings of commanders that a marine on leave might be seen as a prime robbery target with a pocketful of money, so he only carried $8, his military id card and a bank card."they took it, turned his pockets inside out, took what he had and told him since he was a marine and didn't have any money he didn't deserve to live. they put the gun to his neck and shot him," holt told the associated press.the two men charged in the attack were identified as ean farrow, 19, and thomas ray iii, 20, both of cleveland. their attorneys did not respond to the associated press' requests for comment.crutchfield knew he was returning to iraq for another tour of duty, but had hesitated to tell his family until he was nearing the end of his 30-day leave.he apparently had a troubled family. holt wouldn't discuss it except to say "his mom and dad didn't raise him, just his grandmother and me." he didn't smoke or drink, she said.he had attended cleveland's inner-city east high school, but asked that he be allowed to live with his aunt and grandmother and attend suburban bedford high school for his final two years."he saw his school was in turmoil and asked to get out," holt said.bedford high teachers recalled crutchfield's smile, his pride in his appearance, his determination to join the marine corps after graduation in 2005 and his aspiration to become an architect."he was friendly and kind and willing to help out in any way that he could," counselor yvonne sims said in an e-mail.connie lanasa, who works in the school office, said crutchfield was a well-behaved student and went about his school work with little notice."he lived out what he wanted to do and that is to be a marine," lanasa said.faculty members remembered crutchfield as a top student in the computer design program, an office assistant and participant in the prom fashion show.after his long hospitalization, an infection broke out a week before he died. "he said it felt like he was getting hit by lightning," holt said.when crutchfield's body was laid out tuesday in the sacrificial missionary baptist church, his white military dress hat was tugged down close to his eyes to conceal the skull flap that had been kept open to relieve swelling in his brain.marines provided an honor guard at his funeral service and carried the casket to his grave at the western reserve national cemetery near akron.he was buried there on the same day as a vietnam veteran, two veterans from world war ii and three from korea.linkthese fucks deserve to die by a shotgun blast to the head!

weird myspace page of the day





talk about give me a seizure.trutherfrom its blog:so i decided to put together these messages from people (sheeple) who choose to stay asleep and be led by denial like lambs to the slaughter. i had a good laugh at some of them. i am happy to report that the positive supportive messages out weigh the negative ones by far more. thanks to all who choose to wake up, do research and spread the truth. we rock! now to leave you with some awesome words from my new friend bry before you go on to read the nasty comments: spread the truth, and like a virus we can infect the minds of those who have blinded themselves. be the seed that germinates, grows shoots of wonder and thought, invigorating the mind and stimulating the soul. be the start of a grand revolution of thinking in which we can heal the hearts of those who are lost. spread love and replace the fear of the world with trust of your neighbor. resistance isn't futile and we need folks like you who act as modern day bards so one day in the future rockefeller's plan will tumble like a house of cards. it all starts with one voice and already we are many. already our voice is heard and what is but a whisper now will shortly become a roar. when the world begins to crumble we will be fighting, standing, screaming all in the name of the truth. all in the name of freedom. in the name of liberty and justice. most importantly in the name of the one to our left and to our right. in the name of those who are clueless. in the name of the soldiers who arrest us. in the name of the police who investigate us. in the name of all the puppets who were lulled to sleep. we will stand and fight in hopes to wake them from their slumber. this isn't just about freedom. this is about humanity and the ability to be the beautiful beings of light that we are. home school our children and teach them to disregard the man on the tv. teach them to stand and be what they are supposed to be. this is the path that we must take. weed out the false and stick to just facts. this is the greatest war that no one knows about. it's the war to win back our hearts, minds and souls and people don't even know they've lost them. drumroll please...i do like this image though...but im not even going to get into the whole 9/11 conspiracy deal.9/11 conspiracy: a controlled demolition destroyed the wtc!!

racist fliers made lady cry...the national guard has been mobilized!





probe of racist flyers sought                                state rep. w. curtis thomas (d., phila.) yesterday requested an immediate investigation by state attorney general tom corbett into the recent distribution of racist flyers in neighborhoods in philadelphia and scranton. last week, the flyers, posted by a group calling itself keystone state skinheads, were deemed "repugnant" but still legal by the city commission on human relations. "they might have the right to freedom of speech," thomas said of the skinhead group yesterday, "but when that speech is designed to incite and encourage violence, it goes beyond the protection of the first amendment." the flyers featured photos of sgt. stephen liczbinski and three other white police officers killed in the line of duty, along with photos and racially charged statements about the black men charged in the deaths. the flyers appeared in port richmond - where liczbinski was shot to death this month while trying to apprehend bank robbers - and nearby neighborhoods. thomas said what prompted his action was when the mother of a young african american girl came to him with a flyer that the child had just picked up in her school. "she literally cried in my office," thomas said. "it outraged me that they were passing out these flyers in schools." thomas also asked corbett to place keystone state skinheads on the state's list of hate groups, if it is not already there. "we want them to stay on the attorney general's radar screen," he said.here is the link to that flier....feel free to print it out and distribute it amongst your friends & family.

boy scouts file federal lawsuit over dispute with city of philadelphia





the local boy scouts organization has filed a federal lawsuit against the nutter administration over the mayor's ultimatum that the scouts renounce the national group's policy on gays or leave their city-owned headquarters. mayor nutter had told the "cradle of liberty" boy scout council to renounce the scouts' national policy on gays, start paying fair-market-value rent, or vacate its city-owned headquarters -- on winter street near 22nd, just off the benjamin franklin parkway -- by june 1st.currently, the scouting group gets the office space from the city for free. negotiations between the administration and the scouts have been going on for months (see related story), apparently for naught.  the local scouting group has now filed a lawsuit in federal court, basically contending that the nutter administration is violating the scouts' first-amendment rights by delivering this ultimatum. jason gosselin is an attorney for the boy scouts: "what the city has done is essentially ordered the boy scouts, the cradle of liberty council, to repudiate that policy. and when they refused to do that, they've now been penalized by the city with the notice to vacate their headquarters." mayor nutter says simply that the city cannot countenance the national scouts' policy on gays: "we don't support discrimination by organizations against individuals for any particular reason as they deliver their services. and certainly not on city land. in the cradle of liberty, the city of philadelphia, that's just unconscionable."link

chitwood: ‘these are race-baiting posters’





upper darby — a member or members of a white power hate group posted hundreds of fliers in drexel hill over the weekend, police said. the kss (keystone state skinheads), aka keystone united, fact sheets lists only a post office box number and web site on the two different flyers that were stapled onto utility poles. “i first saw them saturday morning on my way to work,” police superintendent michael chitwood said of the 268 leaflets plastered along school lane from lansdowne avenue along arlington cemetery in the drexel park section and on garrett road from lansdowne avenue to the bishop avenue bridge, a major thoroughfare in the township. “they are racist and offensive,” chitwood said. “we received a couple of calls, but they weren’t up that long. lt. john burke had officers remove all of them. they were destroyed.  “the fliers solicit assistance to take back the community and stop white flight.” township officials also objected to the fliers and their content. “the content is clearly inappropriate,” at-large councilman thomas wagner said. “they should not be posted anywhere.” at-large council member connie darmiento, a long opponent to any and all types of signs tacked on poles, objected to the message. “this township is definitely against things like that,” darmiento said. chief administrative officer thomas judge jr. was notifying the state’s human relations commission about the contents of the fliers.  advertisement      chitwood labeled the perpetrators “cowards” for posting signs without personally taking responsibility for their actions and had a citation issued to the organization. “these types of guys who put these signs up are cowards,” chitwood said. “they targeted our community with a cowardly act and don’t have the guts to put their name on the piece of paper. and no person is identified on the web site either. “it caused a lot of stir among the officers. they were offended. it shows photographs of the last four philly cops killed in the line of duty. this is an issue of officers getting shot by criminals. when you look at it, it’s racist. it sends a bad, bad message to the community. these are race-baiting posters.” the accompanying flyer declares, “north philly coming to a neighborhood near you!” listing “drugs, crime, graffiti, trash-covered streets” as the possibility. “it’s time to take our neighborhoods back” is in bold print and asks, “what are you going to do about it?” it also includes a web site for information on how to help with news, politics and other activities. “this is a disgrace,” chitwood said. “nobody wants to see this in the community. from my perspective, these are unacceptable and shouldn’t be on our streets. as far as making upper darby a great place to live, we do it every day.” despite not having a name on the posting, chitwood directed officers to issue a citation to the organization for violation of township ordinance 2493 for unlawfully tacking a sign on a pole or post that carries a $500 fine. “my goal is to get them to respond and then we will issue the violations individually for each flyer,” chitwood said.linkfyi you can easily download these fliers from the kss website, print them out and post them yourself. if i printed out 200+ fliers about the philadelphia philles would would i be threatened with a fine? i think not.im amazed that they had the police go around and remove all of the posters!talk about your tax dollars at work. glad i dont live in upper darby.
