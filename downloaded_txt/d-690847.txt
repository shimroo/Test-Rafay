read more about jackie and her rb story









roger bacon provided the ideal high school experience for our sons. they excelled academically and spiritually through the assisi scholar program. the pilgrimage to assisi, italy that senior assisi scholars take enriched their faith, fueled their curiosity, broadened their world view and created a lifetime memory.
— mr. christopher powers, parent






our mission
rooted in the franciscan values of holiness and learning, self-discipline and compassion, roger bacon is a catholic high school which develops the hearts, minds, and bodies of its young men and women in a caring and challenging environment.
