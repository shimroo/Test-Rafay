							welcome to temple micah! 
							 


 









welcome to micah. we’re glad you’re here. in our building, in our homes, and in our city, we practice a hopeful, inclusive judaism. together we attempt to answer the question of what it means to live both a fully american and fully jewish life. to us, reform is a verb.
