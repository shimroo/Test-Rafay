celebrating 75 years as your builder of choice








for over 75 years, andersen has grown in the northwest by leading with integrity, building safely, and putting our clients’ and project team’s needs first. 

andersen is at the forefront of collaborative delivery methods including design-build, ipd, and cm/gc management. innovation and lean construction are at the core of services we offer, including comprehensive preconstruction planning, in-house bim and estimating, scheduling and a full range of professional construction management staff. our teams are known for completing complex, multi-phased projects that often occur on occupied campuses and within fully functioning buildings—across markets from healthcare, education, laboratories, advanced technology, industrial, commercial office, and multi-family. 
guided by nine core values, our employee-owned culture fosters an environment for passionate builders with the grit to overcome challenges in the pursuit of a common goal. you’ll work with people, not portfolios. people who care about the quality of their craft and your experience in the process. to be your builder of choice is an earned privilege. it means at the end of every day, every milestone, every project – we look at each other and say let’s do it again. why andersen? the choice is personal.
