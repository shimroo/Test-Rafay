seattle bicycle club













the seattle bicycle club is a not-for-profit membership organization dedicated to the interests of recreational cyclists.  our interests
are recreation, exercise, safety and camaraderie.  we don't pollute or block traffic and we
encourage cyclists to adhere to traffic laws.

club activities - each week, weather permitting, the
club provides at least one ride for each level of cyclist: beginning, social and 
intermediate.  all rides are in seattle and surrounding areas except for monthly
outings, which are 1-3 day excursions to places like the washington coast, olympic
peninsula, vancouver island, yakima wine country or mount rainier national park.

socializing - while the club has no formal meetings,
it designs all events to have opportunities for members to interact and get to know each other.

other club benefits - club members have access to the 
clubhouse for viewing the activity 
calendar, downloading cue sheets from the maps library, viewing the photo gallery or posting 
a note to a fellow member on the bulletin board.
