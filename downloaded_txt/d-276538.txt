quest to find coconut oil -> healthy oil




being on a keto diet, which is having no/very low carbs and high fat and high protein diet, means that you need to watch what you put into your mouth every day. and of course, daily fish oil capsules and normal daily cooking with canola oil is not sufficient for this diet. you will always need to have sufficient fat for the body to burn.   and so, heeding advice from louis, this knowledgeable soon-to-be physical trainer, i was on a dangerous and arduous journey to find the legendary coconut oil! not to wash my hair, but to eat. to eat? haha, you may laugh. but look at this. an interesting read.    the following article is an excerpt from the healing miracles of coconut oil by bruce fife, n.d. since approximately 64% of coconut oil consists of medium chain triglycerides (mct's) this article leads to an understanding of why coconut oil is so beneficial for our health and why it has rightly been called the healthiest dietary oil.    http://www.coconutoil-online.com/medium_chain_triglycerides.htm   i’ve also quoted the main points from the link above should you not be interested to read the whole page. “an important component of breast milk is medium-chain fatty acids, principally lauric acid. lauric acid is also the primary saturated fatty acid found in coconut oil. apparently nature thought it essential to the baby's health to include it. nature has a reason for everything it does. it doesn't do things, such as putting mcfa in milk, just for the fun of it. some of the important reasons medium-chain fatty acids are included in milk are improved nutrient absorption and digestive function. as noted earlier, pancreatic enzymes aren't even necessary to digest them. they also help to regulate blood sugar levels. another very important function is that medium-chain fatty acids protect the baby from harmful microorganisms. the baby's immature immune system is supported by the antibacterial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitic properties of these vital fatty acids. in fact, without these unique saturated fats, the baby would probably not survive long. it would become malnourished and highly susceptible to a myriad of infectious diseases.”   the only place to find coconut oil is… you guessed it! little india where you can find the majority of the indian community! i went to mustafa centre and mustafa shopping centre supermarket to find the coconut oil! the place is so big! it’s like, the size of carrefour! just the supermarket alone! not including the other levels that sells other items like clothes, electronics and miscellaneous stuff.   i was also faced with many brands and varieties of coconut oil, from crystal clear coconut oil, to yellowish clear coconut oil, to even white creamy looking coconut oil. saw this friendly looking indian aunty picking up this blue bottle of coconut oil, i approached her.   me: aunty, is this good?   aunty: (giving the very confident and satisfied look) yes of course! very good!   me: really?   aunty: yes, very good!   i hesitated.   me: is this good for cooking? can eat?   aunty: (shows the shocked and weird face)   me: ….   aunty: i don’t know. i’ve never used it for cooking before.   and then, few other indian aunties came in to join the commotion and gave their fair share of suggestions on the use of coconut oil, obviously, they do not cook with coconut oil. we were the only chinese at the point of time. they then suggested asking the supermarket’s indian staff for help, and then each of them went to approach different people, and there i was with xiaoqi, looking puzzled.   with the help of the friendly indian community, we managed to find a suitable edible coconut oil for consumption at a very reasonable price.   how does coconut oil tastes like? strictly good on its own, from my experience in my first meal drenched with coconut oil as i could not find a suitable container to bring to work, it is not good to mix it with other food.    just take 10-15ml on its own with each main meal.

health and fitness - the key to life?




i come from a family with a long history of illnesses, to mention a few, diabetes, high blood, weak and painful knees/legs, and most importantly, stroke which broke my family. i am determined to avoid these illnesses as long as i can, i have also set my mind to make a difference to my life and everyone around me. i want to be fit and healthy so that i am able to care for my loved ones. there are also a few other minor points which also push me along, one of which, is the very common one, to look better too. to further elaborate this point on looking better, it means, making any piece of shirt you grab look good on you! to be healthy, to keep fit and be strong, unfortunately, do not come cheap. so this is where i step in, to live my life to the fullest, accomplishing my goals and objectives in my personal fitness, with minimal amount of money spent.

ord oh!




well, just updating here for a while, will probably just come back to blog again, hopefully. as of last friday, i've orded already, starting work tomorrow.. so fast, 2 years has gone by since i've enlisted into the army.. the army has taught me a lot of things, becoming more like an adult, i really support the idea of guys having to go through national service, as this 2 years of service will bring them through this phase of life, experience the transition from being a kid, to being an adult. that is not all, you'll learn to be more mature, understanding and tolerant towards everybody. although inevitably, you'll bring in some traits into the camp, and out of the camp, that any person out there might not like like. so these are the few things you have to handle.however, not all is well after going through the army. backstabbing and hatred is also present in the army. i'm not sure why, close friends around me are also not sure why, some seem to behave kiddishly and still think that backstabbing and inducing others to hate someone, is so fun and enjoyable, they themselves do not stand away from their first person perspective and then view the situation as a whole. there is definately something wrong. well, everything has become a past, letting it go, and let this be a learning experience for me :)i like to work, i like to work, i just had to stress again. i like money being deposited into my bank account every month. i like being able to manage things, i like to experience the fast pace of life, being stressed up, and in turn, still able to handle the stress. think these 5 years of working experience while i'm studying full time before i enlisted into the army has not left me yet.gotta imagine how my new working environment is like, will it give me lots of challenges, opportunities and room for improvement? or will it be just deadtone, boring stuff everyday? i'm still hyperactive all day long, i also have a strong sense of urgency and like to do things fast, but rarely, on some days, i'll be damn demoralised, is that the trait of pisces? most of the time when i'm feeling this way, i'll just think that the cause of it is not drinking enough water. seriously, its not about the 2 fishes in the horoscope, its because when you drink not enough water, you will not feel like talking, and subsequently, you'll be like a dehydrated salted fish.i need to get back to gyming, i've been in the gym like 2 to 3 times per week in camp. but ever since i started to clear off and leave few weeks ago, i've been slacking already. like, maybe once or twice every 2 weeks.. i can already see and experience how lifting weights can do to me, not that big size though, its a slight improvement, i suggest everyone try it too, well, at least i do not have a flat chest now! bwhaha :) well, this is a summary on what i've been wanting to type, its like, more than a year since i last blogged.. things have changed..i'll update again soon.. and lastly, welcome back, myself!

phew..




its been a grueling 2 months of training at the recce commanders course. from killing eels to bashing through in the thick jungle to find check points in the wild, to rappeling from 5 storeys high, experiencing coastal swim and even resisting to interrogation as a prisoner of war. my guess would be, i've done most of what other units have experienced, save for the airborne course for sure. since rcc has ended like, 1 to 2 weeks ago, i've embarked on ispc, infantry scout platoon course, meaning, integrating with our man, currently privates. its been wierd adapting to the new changes once you have the 3 stripes on your sleeve. like the priviledge to go anywhere without marching, where you make decisions on your own which will eventually affect all the troopers. its a whole lot of responsibility and any consequences will be borne by us too. i treat it as good training. managing people? i think its a whole lot of fun to brush up these skills.i think i've lost touch in blogging already, sometimes couldn't find the motivation to write. but somehow or rather, i still needed to find a way to brush up and practice my writing skills. this is where blogging helps, i hope :) i certainly need to get things moving, like finding out what lies ahead in my future. should i further my studies or should i get a job? either route i choose, i would need to do a lot of preparation.xiaoqi has been busy these few weeks because of her irregular shifts from her full time job as a nurse, and in addition to that, new assignments like fashion shows and hair shows keep her pretty occupied in whatever that's left of her spare time. well, its a good thing for sure, which means additional income, who doesn't like it anyway. for her, its just additional shopping money, haha.i've been spending the whole day at home today, which prompted me to start blogging again. i seriously need to visit my mom and my granduncle. qing ming is coming, and i wouldn't be able to book out on that day, i would visit them next weekend.

moving on...




think i've left this blog stagnant for quite some time already. it's been a 2 months since i last blogged. lots of happenings in the army too.just a brief description about life in sispec, it was fun while it lasted. well, my encounters with larger than palm sized spiders, wild boars, snakes and cobras gave me an experience i would never forget. the wild boar even made off with my food rations! after passing out from bslc (basic section leader's course) with the rank of a corporal. all of us had a choice of moving on to aslc or being posted to unit. few days before our parade, there was an interview for 6sir. they came to do interviews for recce commanders. a few of us were selected for the interview, and on hearing that it will be quite 'shiong', some of them backed off. no one knew where we are posted to, until the very day we passed out.for me? i was quite excited and expressed interest to be a recce commander at the interview, nevermind the tough training. it was going to be a challenging task for me. on that day, when postings were announced, everyone was so eager to find out. just like secondary 4 students waiting for their 'o' level results, like primary 6 students waiting for their results too.when the staff sergeant announced my name for 6sir, woah, i felt relieved. yay, 'siong' training for me. it may sound wierd, but why go for siong training when you can slack all the way? different mentality mah, i came to army to train up mentally and physically. if i can endure all these with an open mindset, training wouldn't be that tough afterall.besides, after passing through bslc and on that very day i reached maju camp 6sir, i saw some of my bmt and polytechnic friends over there. they were the ones who didn't want to go or were not selected to go ocs or sispec. so currently, there just had to go through physical training everyday routinely.as a recce commander, what would i do there? the first 3days, i basically watched tv the whole day and then book out. easy life eh, 7am to 5pm watching tv in an air-conditioned room. haha! though it wouldn't happen again lar, the reason why we had the opportunity to do that is because they didn't have a place to put our bags and stay in overnight. so we had to wait for an available bunk for us to stay, which will be at the end of the year.coincidentaly, there is a vehicle movement course that we can go. which means, i can have free driving lessons in the army and get a free military licence. it can't be converted into a civilian driving licence unless you clock 7,000 km in your jeep. nice one, i'm gonna call my driving instructor and book a driving date.so, the whole of december, i get to learn driving at kaki bukit driving centre from 8am-5pm and then go home. once i'm done with the course, i would prepare for my 8week recce course in pasir lebar camp for me to get promoted to a 3rd sergeant. men would also be transferred to me under my charge. between these 2 courses, i would only have 5 days to prepare.it's kind of rush, but i like it, because being promoted as soon as possible means more money for me! snipers were also recruited in the same batch. there's a total of 13 recce commanders and 11 snipers. too bad for snipers, since there is only 1 sniper course per year, they will start their course in march and then end in july. woah, i wonder what they'll be doing these few months without their proper course. well, that's what i heard.with more time on my hands now, i'll try to spare time to visit my mom and granduncle these few weeks. you'll probably see me here updating regularly too. see ya all!
