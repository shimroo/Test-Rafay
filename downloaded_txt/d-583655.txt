who is esrd? 
										
engineering software research and development, inc. (esrd) is a missouri corporation founded in 1989 by dr. barna szabo, mr. kent myers, and dr. ivo babuska. esrd is engaged in the development of advanced engineering software products and offers professional services in this area. esrd’s flagship software product is stresscheck, an advanced fea tool based on the p-version finite element method.

smart hierarchic models.
dynamic results mining.
solution verification. 
										
in stresscheck® the modeling errors are treated separately from the errors of approximation so that the analyst can validate the model and verify the result independently. other fea programs typically have hundreds of elements where stresscheck® would have just one. to us a quadrilateral is a quadrilateral; why would you need more than one? stresscheck® treats the attributes of the element separately from the topology of the element unlike any other code. switching between heat transfer and elasticity, for example, does not require changing elements or remeshing. that’s hierarchic modeling.

numerical simulation.
simulation governance.
democratization. 
										
numerical simulation is made possible by implementing the requirements of simulation governance. simulation governance controls and standardizes the simulation process much like corporate governance controls and standardizes the functioning of a corporation. the yardstick that measures successful implementation of simulation governance is validation of the model and verification of the solution. esrd's stresscheck is the first fea-based software product to meet these requirements and unlock reliable democratization of simulation.

testimonials  “at dst group, we have effectively used stresscheck over the last 10 years to determine accurate stress intensity factors. the results have been used to improve our residual strength and structural life estimates for aircraft in service with the royal australian airforce, including c-130, p-3c and f/a-18 a/b. we have found it to be extremely easy to use and a very versatile code with which to create parametric models.
we have recently used stresscheck to obtain improved stress intensity factor solutions (improved stress intensity factors for selected configurations in cracked plates and improved stress intensity factors for a single corner crack at a loaded fastener hole) for five key generic configurations. these transferable parametric results have been published externally. one specific example is the non-linear contact analysis of a cracked, filled fastener hole, with both fastener and remote plate loading.”
