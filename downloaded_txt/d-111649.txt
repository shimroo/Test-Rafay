badlands off road park
the badlands off road park is 1400+ acres of multi-directional, diverse terrain. you'll find sand dunes, wooded trails, gravel, mud, and rocks - trails and terrain for all types and skill levels of riders. bikes and atvs can test their skills on our full-size mx track. suvs, 4x4s, and side x sides can take on the challenges of our rock quarry/suv park. regardless of your skill level, with caution, you will find riding perfectly suited for your abilities at the badlands. off roading is a dangerous sport. we emphasize safety at all times. alcohol is not permitted in the park creating a family-friendly environment.
