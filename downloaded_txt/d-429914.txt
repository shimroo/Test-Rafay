in wisconsin, we make more flavors, varieties, and styles of cheese than anywhere else in the world. we believe in tradition, producing everything from italian classics, like parmesan and ricotta, to swiss cheese and cheddar varieties. but every wisconsin cheesemaker is an innovator as well, which is why we have so many wisconsin originals, like colby and muenster. whether it’s a grilled cheese sandwich, potatoes au gratin, or a charcuterie board, wisconsin cheese makes every dish and recipe tastier.
