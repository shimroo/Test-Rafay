what can you expect from your stay with us?
Â 
westwind club, located directly on the ocean with a desirable cable beach address in the bahamas, is known for quality and friendliness - we are an intimate, quiet resort with 21 spread-out units (villas) nestled between two private estates. each villa has a private patio, living room and fully equipped kitchen.Â  20 of our villas includeÂ a bedroom and loft, both of which sleep two; the remaining villa has a single bedroom that sleeps two.Â  the villas are located along our private driveway leading up to the clubhouse where our small private beach, heated outdoor pool, and spacious clubhouse with a snack bar are located for relaxing and visiting with old and new friends alike.Â 














beach
enjoy your private beach, whether it be for the scenic beauty, morning or evening sunsets, kayaking, snorkeling or standing and floating around having a cocktail with friends - our beach will open your eyes to the beautiful blue waters of the bahamas.
if you would like to explore public beaches, there are numerous beaches on the island for your enjoyment - junkanoo and goodman's bay beaches on cable beach and jaws beach are just a few beaches for you to explore.Â 



fishing
whether you bring your own pole with you to throw in a line from our westwind beach or you arrange for a private charter for a more adventurous day, the waters of the bahamas have something for any angler.



water activities
for those looking for exercise, rent out one of our ocean kayaks, paddle boards or sunfish sailboat for your own private adventure from the clubhouse.
if you are looking for something more, ask lauren to help you schedule a private charter or sign up for one of the many excursions offered throughout the island.Â  whether it be a relaxing boat ride around the island, a catamaran day of sailing to private beaches or power boat rides toÂ exumaÂ or eluthraÂ islands, your adventure is just a phone call away.

royal blue golf courseÂ - part of the baha mar
