we can look at and see another person
directly.  we, however, cannot look and
see ourselves directly.  we must look
through a mirror, for example.  and still
because letters are backwards as seen through the mirror, we do not actually
see ourselves directly.  likewise with
fingerprints we see a reverse display of the pattern when viewing the
impression on paper.  it is not a direct
display.  a direct display is as seen
from the hand.  this phenomenon
demonstrates the spectrum of confines with an image.
