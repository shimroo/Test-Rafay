serving austin, san antonio, dfw, houston and texas since 1989 and still going strong!
updated 10/23/24   a quick reminder that we are appointment only and come to you.  it all starts with a simple phone call, text or e-mail for details. our preferred method is good old fashioned phone call! i work on games and not websites so this page is for the basic info. i do update our facebook page (s&b amusements) on a regular basis and that is always a great place to check for our latest news and info. we also have plenty of reviews on yelp. just click the logo on the right to go directly to yelp or facebook. i am aware that the only links that work are the fb and yelp. honestly we are so busy i just have not had the time!     we sell, repair and restore pinball machines, arcade games, juke boxes and any amusement game that takes a coin. while we repair and restore slot machines for private homes, we do not sell them.  due to the uniqe nature of what we do, we have clients all over texas and the southwest. that inludes austin, san antonio, houston, dfw and everywhere in between! the quickest way to reach us is by telephone during business hours at 512-833-6560. the business line is cellular so texts or calls are preferred. e-mail is only checked once a day. we are old school!! calls are always the preferred method of communication.   please do not use facebook messenger to contact us as it is rarely checked. customer testimonials can be found on yelp. important updates and news can be found on our facebook page as well. we encourage you to check them out as i am very proud of our rating! just click yelp or facebook links on this page for more information. inventory changes quickly so its best to e-mail, call or text (512) 833-6560.   in the spring of 23, we moved our main shop to georgetown, texas. it is appointment only. however, we still sell plenty of games if you are looking for fairly periced and fully reconditioned games backed by a full warranty and lifetime 75% trade. we also maintain a location in central austin that is appointment only and are there almost every day.  please call or text for an appointment before bringing anything in for repair. all credit card purchases are charged a 3.25% fee. 
** as many of you realize, parts are getting harder and harder to come by. due to this unfortunate new reality, repairs can take much longer than they used to. this is a discussion we will have as part of the intial diagnosis. pinball parts are easier in most cases than jukebox parts. thanks, steve bronson
s & b amusements is austin's and central texas' number one source for game sales and repairs since 1989. trip charge fees on repairs outside the austin area are set before we come to you. we are open m-f from 9-5 and can be reached via e-mail at sandbamusements@yahoo.com or via phone at 512-833-6560. we sell, repair and restore pinball machines from the oldest to the newest, juke boxes, arcade videos, air hockey tables, slot machines, coin operated pool tables, gun games, skee balls and any other game that takes a coin to play! austin area service calls are $195.00 and include an hour of on site labor. if the repair takes longer than an hour, additional time is billed on the quarter hour at the rate of $185.00 per hour. parts are not included. outside of austin, rates are determined by mileage. we believe in no surprises! in house labor rate is $150.00 per hour and larger jobs are bid based on the job. all work comes with a 90 day parts/labor warranty done on site for no fees. out of town work will still come with a 90 day parts/labor warranty but a trip fee will be set for on site warranty before we start the job. we do not approach repairs and restorations with a "blank check" mentality. i will ask you some initial questions when you call and we will be able to determine over the phone an accurate estimate so you have an idea of cost before we even come out. there are a few exceptions, but i will let you know during our initial visit. yes, we still sell games! please call or email for current inventory. we also service and repair games all over texas. we do not sell, repair or recondition any game that we cannot deliver and pick up ourselves or repair on site. please understand one thing - this is a very specialized trade and not everyone who says they know what they are doing really do! i have been restoring and repairing games since grade school! check out our reviews on yelp! we also have a huge selection of vintage movie posters for your gameroom walls! from the smallest repair on site to the largest restorations and sales s & b amusements is the place!
s & b amusements has been serving austin and central texas since 1989. we would not be here still if our games did not hold up well and our clients were not completely and totally satisfied!

we ask that all clients to call first as we are no longer brick and mortar.  so, please call first. we are no longer on burnet road. our main shop is now in georgetown. please call or e-mail. we bring our expertise to you! if we have not heard from a client within 90 days after we have tried to contact them for any repair, game, part or component, it will be considered abandoned and could be disposed of or charged a monthly storage fee. thanks for understanding and we are very happy to be busier then we’ve ever been before!

a few words about pinball machines and classic games in general. parts have been getting steadily more difficult to get. the pandemic didnt help and even put some suppliers out of business. also, the numbers of games out there; while getting more expensive, are getting smaller. the end result is repairs and reconditions are taking longer. fortunately non cosmetic pinball parts are still in good shape. game specific parts and cosmetics such as plastics, backglasses, etc are difficult but some are starting to be reproduced. i will always use original used parts in giid shape over new ones if we can. jukebox parts are really are getting harder as well. we still are able to repair just about anything but it can taje longer than it did a few years ago. i do not buy and sell on the internet and ship games. i do however, repair many bought on line and shipped to the area. funny how they seem to work before shipping! we will only purchase nice examples that we know will make great games for you. in other words, that means there is a lot of junk floating around out there that we will not purchase. if you are in the market for a pinball, please bear in mind that we are lucky to have 2-4 at any time. that does not mean we cannot find you one and will do so. make a smart purchase. take your time and give us some options. we will gladly help you determine what is best; whether you buy a game from us or not. our advice is also totally free! even if not buying from us, you will see us for any repairs. don't hesitate to run a game by us before you purchase. i have helped many folks avoid mistakes that way!
we now offer extended service plans on all games sold or totally reconditioned!
call or e-mail for details.
