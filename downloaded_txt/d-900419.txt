back in london...we flew back to london yesterday with air canada via toronto.  they managed to lose our bags but they were delivered to us this morning, which worked out well as it meant that we didn't need to carry them home on the tube!  we travelled back from arenal (la fortuna) on monday and spent our last few days in san jose.  i will add some more photo links here soon, once i have uploaded them. the trip was fabulous, felt like we did everything we wanted to do and that 3 months away was just perfect.  so now we have a month in london during summer before we head off to australia for another 2 months. then it'll be back to reality!

trekking....the rain stopped today and the sun came back out. we took a cab up to the arenal observatory lodge which has fantastic views of the volcano and over lake arenal. we decided to go for a hike through the rainforest which was all downhill on the way there. we got a bit carried away enjoying ourselves before realising how far we'd gone, and more importantly, how far we had to climb back up.it was such hard work trekking back up, we were knackered by the end of it and had to sit down in the hotel restaurant to recover with an ice cold drink.  we felt good after we'd finished though, as you do. the cloud still hasn't lifted enough to see the top of the volcano spilling lava again, but it was just nice to just have some good weather after such a lot of rain.we are here for one more night before heading back to san jose for our final few nights in costa rica.

rain, rain, rain...well, yesterday afternoon it began to rain here...and it rained, and it rained, and it rained until 11am this morning!!  there was some serious lightning, thunder and torrential rain - we ended up staying in our hotel room the whole time.  i have never seen so much rain in one go!!! once the rain finally stopped we ventured back out again and moved into a different hotel.  it is much cheaper at 30usd a night and is almost as good as the last hotel except that it does not have a direct view of the lava spilling out of arenal volcano.  to be honest, since the first night we were here and were lucky enough to see arenal without cloud around it and watch the red lava running down the hill...we have not seen it again as the weather has been too cloudy so it does not matter all that much! we are saving so much money that it is great value.  it is called the hotel sierra arenal and it is in town so we can now wander out for dinner and to the shops too. we spent this afternoon at baldi hot springs which are great.  they have all different pools of different temperatures and waterfalls, swim up bars etc.  there is even one pool which is 67 degrees celsius, needless to say there was nobody in that one. just one week left in costa rica now...we will be sad to leave.

volcan arenal....costa ricathis morning we did the canopy tour through the rainforest which was awesome.  it was 11 ziplines of varying lengths and height....over rivers and waterfalls.  the weather even held up for us today which was a relief as it has been raining heaps the past 2 days.  the sun even came out and it was dry the whole time.  it was great fun!yesterday afternoon we did the arenal volcano hike and it poured with rain the whole time.  i have this daggy bright yellow raincoat which i wore - ha ha!  we thought the tour would end up being rubbish because of the rain but it was actually really good...the guide took us on a rainforest trek through muddy, steep trails...and we saw howler and spider monkeys.unfortunately when we got to the volcano viewing point it was too cloudy and we couldn´t see arenal!  we aren´t having much luck with volcanoes on this trip!  we are now looking out constantly to see if the clouds and weather clears again and if it does we plan to jump in a cab and head straight up to the volcano viewing point to see it....so fingers crossed. we could hear the volcano!  you could hear the rocks thudding out of it and wooshing noises when it shot hot water out of it which was pretty cool.next we are going to head to the baldi hot springs which look fantastic....sitting at the base of the volcano and heated by it. there is so much more we would love to do, like abseiling down waterfalls and the jeep/boat/jeep tour to monteverde, but have to draw the line somewhere.

arenal volcano, costa rica....we took a bus from san jose to arenal volcano (la fortuna) yesterday.  the drive up was very scenic and pleasant.  we arrived and checked-in to our hotel which faces the volcano.  we can sit outside our room and watch the red lava flowing, which happens quite regularly...it´s amazing to watch it rolling down the side of the mountain.  apparently the volcano is one of the top 10 most active in the world and has been continuously erupting on a daily basis since 1968.  we are going to do a few tours here soon....one to the volcano itself where hopefully we´ll get up closer and see the red hot molten lava coming out.  another is to the hot springs under the mountain.  then we´ll do a canopy rainforest trek-tour where you can hike along hanging bridges over the rainforest.then on monday we´ll head back to san jose to explore the city for a final few days in costa rica.  most of what we have seen around san jose has been tours in the central valley and the area around where we stayed, escazu which is a little way out of san jose downtown. the doka coffee plantation tour was great and we visited la paz waterfalls with butterfly garden, hummingbird garden and frog garden, then we did a boat tour down the river near puerto viejo where we saw howler monkeys, sloths, cayman etc. etc.  we did visit volcan poas but unfortunately, it was extremely cloudy and we were unable to see anything...i think you need to be lucky to see the volcano as it is quite often wet and cloudy up that way.
