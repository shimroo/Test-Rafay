living bible studies online



what's here?
on this site you will find over 1800 bible studies
           when available, these studies are provided in print form.  otherwise audio recordings are provided.
      



why is it here?
living bible studies is a ministry in the building of believers in
         their walk with christ, according to the instruction given in the second book
         of timothy: "and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses,
         the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."
         


what else?
you will find many studies on this site by our former pastor, tim temple, who is now retired.
           he continues to serve our lord in bible teaching through his blog site
           a pastor's commentary.
           on that site you will find more insights into the scripture presented in a
           condensed form that will inspire your personal study and your study with others.
