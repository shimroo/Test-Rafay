        john c. pitcher - artist/naturalist from dorset, vermont
        john pitcher approaches his art as an artist/naturalist, creating his field sketches, field journals and finished paintings with confidence and originality. for over thirty years he has expressed his passion for birds and the natural world through his paintings of wildlife.
john c. pitcher moved to alaska in 1971, there he spent the next twelve years raising his family and developing his art and birding skills. his first sketches of the bald eagle "council grounds" were made in 1982 which he later developed into his popular painting "winter on the river". he since has lived in washington and now in southwest vermont where he and his wife sue westin, also a professional artist, run their gallery on the marsh along the shore the dorset marsh.
nick hammond, a british author/editor/publisher specializing in wildlife and nature, rates pitcher as "among the best american wildlife artists." robert j. koenke, a leading spokesperson on wildlife art and a marketing expert says, "i'd compare pitcher's work with that of any of the great artists in the world." pitcher is an honoured member of the society of animal artists and a canoeing crewmember of "wreaf" (wilderness river expedition artist foundation) where his field studies and paintings are part of the touring exhibit "visions of the boreal forest -- artists deep in the wilderness" - this exhibit will soon be featured at the smithsonian institute, washington, d.c.

wildlife center photography workshop












                steve kroschel
              










                mario benassi
              




        (new in 2008!)

        join steve kroschel and mario benassi on either wednesday or saturday for a three-hour outdoor photography workshop of selected animals at the wildlife center located approximately 30 miles north of haines. steve kroschel has spent a lifetime working with wildlife, both in animal husbandry and natural history filmmaking. his passionate educational work with live animal lectures has taken him across north america -- from elementary school classrooms, to college campuses, to appearances on national television. his natural history documentaries and cinematography are seen on pbs, tlc, discovery channel, and the major networks.
now, in his forties, steve wanted to provide the public with a unique opportunity to experience nature up close and approachable. to that end, he has established a wildlife center with tame/trained indigenous animals of alaska that would otherwise be virtually impossible to intimately experience, unless they were a pelt!
at the kroschel film's wildlife & educational center, visitors can tickle almost all of their senses and photograph these shy native animals like no place else. natural backdrops and cooperative wildlife become a photographer's dream, with the end result being information, experiences and photographs that benefit both subject and observer without any harm to either. to obtain this result in the wild would otherwise require weeks, months and years, as well as enormous amounts of money to achieve. for example, wolverines are almost impossible to view in the wild, and some biologists that study them for a living, never have seen one! yet, at the center, habituated wolverines can be photographed and touched without hazard. a world exclusive! the center continues to be a reality thanks to the curiosity and passion of visitors like you.
there is an additional $80 charge for this workshop and space is limited. please register online when purchasing your festival pass. bus and/or 15-passenger van transportation from haines is included. be prepared to be outside all day and bring a sack lunch and snacks. buses and/or 15-passenger vans will leave the bald eagle foundation at 9:00 on wednesday and saturday mornings and arrive at the wildlife center at approximately 10:00. the workshop will end at approximately 1:00 on wednesday and at 1:00 sharp on saturday. on wednesday, transportation will be provided from the wildlife center back to haines. participants on saturday will be taken directly to the preserve in time for the flight for freedom eagle release at 1:30.
