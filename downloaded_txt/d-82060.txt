rapidly fielding autonomous systems at sea





as the navy continues to develop and deploy autonomous systems at sea, apl researchers are lending their expertise and insights to rapidly integrate, test, and assess low-cost uncrewed maritime systems.

game-changing impact
we solve complex research, engineering, and analytical problems that present critical challenges to our nation.by combining creativity and technical expertise with a culture of risk-taking, we tackle increasingly difficult challenges with impacts across multiple domains.

defining innovations

















a unique aspect of working at apl is the ability to leverage technology from seemingly unrelated areas. for example, we can take knowledge we apply to missile defense—responding to measurement inputs very quickly and making adjustments even faster—and apply it to additive manufacturing.
