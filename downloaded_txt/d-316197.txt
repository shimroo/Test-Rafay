meet the briney family, three generations:


 

 
february 2019, my 89 year old father, myself and my 28 year old son (3 generations of doug. doug sr, doug jr and doug 3rd) had the privilege to go to freeport on what was to be my father’s final trip.  he passed away september 23, 2019. the folks at sunn odyssey took great care of us.  my father had been diving since the early 50’s, i’ve been diving since ‘04 and my son has only been diving a couple times, but they made sure we had everything we needed for a successful and memorable trip.  i really recommend the ben’s cavern dive trip, if you want something totally different. from the parking lot to the site is an easy walk even with the gear, but for my dad, jr carried all my dad’s stuff and made sure he was treated like a king.  i honestly can not say enough good things about the entire crew there.  if you go, give karen a hug for me and ask her about the “firearm” incident.  doug briney​
