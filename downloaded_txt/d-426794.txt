matryomin - how bloody cool is that ?





damn man - just as i about to post again how friggin ace the gakken analog synthesizer kit sx-150 is - and how in 3 days or so i will be assembling this babe and blowing holes in my sub-woofer with sub-harmonic wobbles - i stumble upon yet another damn fine piece of electronic koolio-aid - i quote you now from advertising advert ::'matryomin' is an original electronic musical instrument of the mandarin electron which is japanese theremin maker.  the function of theremin is put in russian famous handicraft matryoshka. it has an amplifier and a loudspeaker built-in for the body.why ? what ? when and who ... are undoubtedly questions streaming through your head as you read this - but after the following demonstration of the power of matryomin - you will fear no more !!and if that does not completly convince of the power of matryomin - then be prepared my reader(s) - be very prepared ::still not with me on this one - well goddam it - you asked for it - maaaannn !!!

air geee-ttt-aaar ..





this was going to be a post on the gakken sx-150 synth kit - that i have just ordered from japan ....   but that post will have to follow this one .. as in researching the synth-beast, as usually happens - i got side-tracked on other kick-ass japanese stuff - and so it ends up being a video post on air guitars ..so without further ado - lets fackin rock-n-friggin-roll- muvvers ...for readers who simply prefer a good old female-rock-out ..  shame to leave without this ..

10cc top trumps ...





kicked into gear by mr. shirt and because here at the glitch barn - we have a super overwhelming soft spot for 10cc here is our top 10 pop picks :gizmo / gizmatrontop of the list in straight in at number one - is the device released initially by godley and creme upon departing 10cc for solo careers sometime around 1975 - the gizmo.... check out the demo disk from 1975 here.basically this consited of 6 motorised wheels - mounted on a guitar bridge - that when pressed eihter one at a time or in combinations against the strings produced whacked out effects - sort of pre-guitar synth type of thing ...    best heard to fine effect on the godley and creme (concept - yikes !!!) lp - consequences ... nice ...more info here ...one night in parisfirst track from what is for me the best lp the guys stuck out - too be honest i was tempted to simply list every darn track from it - at least 3 or 4 separate songs super-glued together here - fine stuff indeed !!cry - godley and cremehow can any list not include this babe - worth it for the video alone - was going to stick on the history mix lp - but upon revisiting realisd it sounds supa-dated probaly due to lame 80s production from trevor horn - this however sounds just fine and dandy..i'm mandy - fly medon't get me started on this one - but takes me back to early teenage lust with a certain mandy i used to fumble around with (if you know what i mean) - best not go there !dreadlock holidaywhite boys try and play pop-light reggae ?  or simply a damn fine pop record - you decide - me i love it !!!donnagot to admit - another girl is involved in selection of this one - god - was my early teen hormones shaped by early 10cc pop songs - crikes??i'm not in love - edwina rigby (1979) / petula clark (1978)the smoocher rooner from the stable - remixed into a glitzy late 70s disco glitter ball - lovely stuff (even the petula clark one ain't all bad)...rubber bulletsimposible not to include this slamming hit ...wall street shuffleyet another slamming 7 incher ...10cc - blackmail (from original sound track)been listening to this lp all weekend - and could have chosen any of them for inclusion as previousl said - this one kicks with a guitar solo straight out of mid-period floyd - unexpectedly psychedelic .now back to spraying "i luv 10cc" on the back of my school pencil case !!

korg ds-10 (yes oh yes)..





well - seeing how the farm has now acquired a nintendo ds thanks to junior-ultra-glitch-boy-o - seems somewhat silly not to grab this damn fine bit of retro-rehash and steel the thing of him ... nice and tasty in a way that cooking mama will never be !!

smashed-face...





been experimenting with that social-network malarkey fb - hooked up with long-lost folks - spent an age customizing the shit out of the page - uploaded stuff - typed shit - read shit - remembered shit and somehow forgot it again ... - thank god someone else was there to remember it happened - my notes don't exit - my photos are incomplete - and my record collection does not support it as a chunk was nicked by an ex (god bless the woman - if only she knew what she took at least she might sell it !!  ... man ..... "it's a lot of wind..." ...

records bought because the sleeve told me to  (part 2 of an occasional series)...





in 1994, i found myself living in mong kok, hong kong.  this cd is a japanese export - i picked up in tower records (windsor house - causeway bay - long defeated by the hmv empire!) - kyoto jazz massive are/were a collective of japanese funksters - the music some 14 years later or so sounds very much a safe-coffee-table-style of jazzy grooves - this has a very early collaboration from dj krush on it ...   \the sleeve some 14 years later remains pretty much as i first glanced eyes on it !

ten records hiding at the back of your collection that no grown man should own





having been passed the baton by mr. shirt - and being forced to delve into those boxes of unseen 7 inchers to remind myself of what utter classic embarrassing crud i have bought in my time - i somehow have managed to get it all down to 10 - to be honest this could have run to 100s !!so here goes .."dum-de-dum, dum-de-dum, mouldy old dough" - utter classic - without this punk/hip-hop and death metal would never have happened ...."nice on cyril, nice on son, nice one cyril - lets 'ave another one" - deep stuff or what .....no idea how the heck this thing got to be in my collection - i would love to say i got it from a pile plastic my sister once gave me - but - that is my hand-writing - so i got to admit - it's mine (god been meaning to get that of my chest for 3 decades - phew)..i was young - on a camping holiday to france with the scouts - hung out with some french girl-guides in some provincial town - and ended up buying this - memories hey -  the other disk i got that day was status quo - rain, but nothing embarrassing about that - this however is totally unforgivable !used to play in a band at school with mark wilson and graham fallows, this was one of the tracks we played back then - first gig being in stoke-sub-hamdon working mens club (1975 or 1976) - how rock-n-roll is that - mark and graham went onto somewhat more serious stuff via the mob - but at the early routes of the anarcho-punk movement lurks a dreamy lament on the joys of sunday morning (up with the lark - no less) ....  elkie brooks - pearls a singer - fucking magic - there - said it - not going to take it back - so there ....everything punk was meant to burn and destroy - but lets face it - this one simply rocks ... how uncool is that ...i have more than one bit of plastic from mr.pedo-pop - but this must be the most hideous of them all ....  say no more squire ..cat scratch fever - apart from this killer guitar riff - is there anything even slightly cool about ted ?  now where did i put that bloody rifle ?1967 - when the rest of the world were getting it on with chemical-altering-mind-explorations - us down here in zummerzet were wrecking our physical-well being with glasses full of the golden-stuff.  this must be the sergent peppers for the cider generation - forget all that grateful dead/merry pranksters kool-aid-acid-pap, simply pour your self a mug of body-numbing-messed-aound-with-apple-stuff - crank the volume to 10, - drop the needle onto "the chew magna cha cha" - and float right out there man - trust me - by the time you get the nerve to stick on the classic - "drink up thy cider" - you'll be tripping so damn hard - it'll be weeks before you can face looking at a farmer again - without getting the fear ...  classic ...
