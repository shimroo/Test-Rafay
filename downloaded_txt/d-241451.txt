"i recently completed the tahoe rim trail with a friend from high school and we'd brought sierra stories: true tales of tahoe along with us. we had vol. 1 for the first five days, and then picked up vol. 2 at our first cache. the stories were an absolute delight; we read two of them every evening before falling asleep, and they were just the most perfect things to have along on the trail. we loved the subjects, but also really appreciated your writing style! they are very accessible, exciting and fun. well researched, and fantastic stories as well. the books were a joy to have on the trail!"
