n-ssba: sustaining long island’s legacy of quality public schools.
























 if not us, who?
since 1959, the nassau-suffolk school boards association has stood as an advocate and resource for and on behalf of long island's public schools and boards of education. our boards of education have long-recognized that long island has something worth protecting and united as an association to take the lead in order to preserve that which has made our region strong - a place where quality public schools are acknowledged as key to a desirable lifestyle and vibrant economy.


























spotlight on long island schools
heard every saturday at 10:30 a.m. on 103.9 fm and simulcast on linewsradio.com, “spotlight on long island schools” is a 30-minute show hosted by n-sbba’s executive director bob vecchio highlighting li school districts. the show promotes school pride moments, communicates school messages and curriculum, while providing thought-provoking interviews and discussions with school officials and educational leaders in the communities we serve.
