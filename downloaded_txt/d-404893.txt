12/31/2024 if you have questions about cats and avian influenzavoluntary recall of northwest naturals brand 2 lb. feline turkey recipe & frozen pet food due to hpai contamination. the recalled product is packaged in 2-pound plastic bags with “best if used by” dates of 05/21/26 b10 and 06/23/2026 b1. please see the full press release below.  dear mercyvet clients, as always, we at mercyvet try to balance feeding species appropriate foods as best indicated for the condition of your pet and your family circumstances. in general, we do not advise feeding raw foods for immuno-compromised or very debilitated pets or in households where the people are immune-compromised or there are very young children. the raw pet food industry will be tasked with monitoring batches for highly pathogenic avian influenza, so the perceived risk may become lower as awareness increases. however, for the felines, if you would like to err on the side of caution, you may temporarily shift to canned food or a cooked cat food (see expanded list below). it is important if you decide to lightly cook raw foods to only do so if the food does not contain ground bone. freeze drying does not eliminate the hpai – but moving forward, these companies may be faced with batch testing as well. since the virus has been isolated in dairy cows and milk, it is primarily a problem in poultry and beef, so other options to look for are pork, lamb and other protein sources. as always, factors that affect susceptibility to disease include overall wellness/vitality, age and immune support in various forms (probiotics, antioxidant supplements, fish oils, for example) can also help pets be less susceptible to all kinds of comorbidities. sincerely, dr. jacqueline sehn and dr. lisa brienen based on susan thixton’s 2024 the list https://truthaboutpetfood.com/  :  brands that make cooked feline diets (order online, although some might be found locally): goodness gracious, just food for cats, milk, my perfect pet, open farm, pau’s custom, portland, raised right, shine, small batch, wild coast raw. just food for cats has one choice a fish and chicken blend.

help us protect homeopathy 
the fda is proposing to reclassify all homeopathic medicines. this would allow them to treat all homeopathic medicines as technically illegal, and withdraw any or all of them at any time. our friends at americans for homeopathy choice submitted a petition to the fda urging them to reconsider this classification. now, we need your help. we’re submitting comments to the fda in support of the petition. when you leave a comment through the afhc website, it goes directly to the fda, as well as members of congress and other lawmakers. our goal is 100,000 comments.leave your comment at: https://homeopathychoice.org/fdacomment/

august 7, 2019.mercyvet’s position on the current controversy about dog kibbles and b.e.g. diets













 last year, cardiologists around the country started observing unexpected cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) in dog breeds that historically had not been known to develop this serious condition. not all cases were alike, but most dogs improved upon dietary change and taurine supplementation. the most frequent commonality between cases were the presence of legumes in the kibble.once the word got out, a team of investigators and the fda started looking into this issue, and in december, the journal of american veterinary medicine (javma), a highly reputable publication, issued an op-ed implicating b.e.g. diets (boutique, exotic and grain free) and lack of taurine as most likely culprits.the article has been downloaded thousands of times, and many worried pet owners and veterinarians are struggling to choose and recommend safe formulations. often the knee jerk response is to go back to poor quality, grain laden kibbles. here at mercyvet, we have looked for answers and spoken to our cardiologists to try to come up with a commonsense response. then we found out that the original article in javma was not peer reviewed, has critical flaws and was written by 3 researchers working for the big manufacturers that heavily rely on grains, a previously undisclosed huge conflict of interest.such shortcomings doom this report in any professional field.  the real lesson we have learned is that we cannot trust anyone! the pet food industry, the manufacturers, aafco (who requires no feeding trials) even the fda which is refusing to release critical information about their research. as veterinarians, the avma has advised us to not promote raw foods – based on research provided by the very same vet who wrote this december article.our cardiologists tell us there is something underlying these new cases, so here’s the advice you’ve been waiting for:                avoid using food from the same company all the time; varying type of food prevents excesses and deficiencies from occurring                use fresh foods, frozen, freeze dried. synthetic nutrients are not the same as natural ones.                 supplement your dog’s diet with fresh ingredients; discuss specific supplements with your vet as dogs are individuals and certain disease patterns affect their needs                keep track of weight. if underfed, the dog may not be getting some critical amino acids – methionine and cysteine – from which the dog synthesizes taurine.                 visit your vet annually, or if there are signs of illness or changes in energy level, appetite, or engagement.
