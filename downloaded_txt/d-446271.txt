"everybody loved katie, and she was friends with everyone at halas hall,” said george mccaskey. “she was one of those rare people that whenever you came into contact with her, you always had a better day."                                                                                                            the fundraiser was held on january 30 and featured various bingo games including a winning card that spelled the letter “n” in honor of nagle, katie’s last name. prizes were generously provided by the bears organization.                                                                                                            katie’s sister, joan cramer, was especially touched by the program and offered this heartfelt message on behalf of the entire nagle family. “katie had a gift of bringing people together, and her kindness and genuine interest in people's lives set her apart,” joan explained. “her bears family knew about her friends at chestnut square and vice versa. bringing these two groups together for an evening of ‘bears bingo for katie’ was a testament to how katie is still spreading joy. her kindness continues to flow through people.”                                                                                                            an independent senior living community, chestnut square at the glen features spacious 1 and 2-br floor plans, all-inclusive services and amenities, restaurant-style dining, an extensive calendar of programs and events, and on-site homecare if ever needed. to learn more about chestnut square, please visit:                                               www.chestnutsquare.info                                                                                                                                                          to learn more about bears care and their charitable initiatives, please visit:                                               https://www.chicagobears.com/community/bears-care




   

    why winter is the ideal time to plan your next move


 january 17, 2025

pictured above: chestnut square at the glen's gazebo courtyard blanketed with fresh snow.                                                                                                            as we hunker down for another winter, you may find yourself thinking about how much longer you want to manage the responsibilities of homeownership—including shoveling snow, ongoing maintenance, and maintaining a property through the coldest months. if you’ve been considering a move to a senior living community, now is the perfect time to start touring the options so you can make the transition by spring or summer, when warmer weather will make the move easier.                                                                                                            here’s why winter is an ideal time to get a jump on the process:                                                                                                            planning ahead for a smooth transition                                                                                                            moving to a senior living community is a significant decision, and one that shouldn’t be rushed. selecting your community now will give you plenty of time to make thoughtful choices and prepare for the transition. you’ll have time to sell your house, organize your belongings, and ensure a smooth move come spring or summer. you’ll also be able to avoid the chaos of last-minute decisions and a rushed experience.                                                                                                            say goodbye to winter woes                                                                                                            a visit to chestnut square now will highlight exactly what you’ll be leaving behind. for many homeowners, winter means dealing with freezing pipes, ice damming, salting the driveway, and countless other stresses. instead, you can start imagining a maintenance-free lifestyle surrounded by new friends.                                                                                                            avoid unnecessary delays                                                                                                            one of the most frustrating things about procrastination is that we usually know the task we’re avoiding would actually make us feel better once we complete it. while it’s tempting not to think about your next move during the colder months, losing valuable time now could make it harder to move later. spring and summer are busy seasons for senior living communities, with many people placing deposits as the weather warms up. waiting until the last minute could mean fewer floor plan choices.                                                                                                            take advantage of our move-assist program                                                                                                            we realize that moving—and downsizing—are a lot to think about, but we make it easier for our future residents. our team has put together a comprehensive moving guide that includes helpful tips, checklists, and a list of reputable senior move managers in the area who can assist with downsizing, organizing, packing, and delivery.                                                                                                            for a limited time, chestnut square is also offering a move-assist credit of up to $3,500 that can be applied toward any of your moving expenses.                                                                                                            to learn more and schedule a personal tour, please call                                               (847) 998-1118                                               or visit                                               www.chestnutsquare.info
