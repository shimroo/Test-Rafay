obama in japanby israel shamir
i came to japan for the preview of obama's visit, when the g7 foreign ministers assembled at hiroshima, led by the us state secretary john kerry. he should apologise, people said. you do not think kerry apologised for nuking the city, did you? neither did obama. the americans never apologise, banish the thought. love means never having to say you're sorry, and they are in love with the rest of the world. otherwise, why would they screw it so violently and wish to possess so intensely?

clinton's gender warsby israel shamir
will the men voting for mrs clinton end up in hell? i am not sure. we know that women who vote for a male candidate have a special place in hell, as  the old jewish feminist lady  divined, and she should know. it is not only madeleine albright looks like a creature from hell, she also belongs there, for her justification of murder of half a million iraqi children, among other deeds. but what about men who cross the gender divide? i would not condemn them. such a condemnation would rather undermine and harm messrs trump and sanders, for men have no gender voting pattern. men vote for the cause they prefer, and they strongly dislike a suggestion that their vote has been determined by what they are , instead of  what they think.

north korea: love thy leaderby israel shamir
a colossal mass demonstration, well choreographed to the level of ballet but  with tens of thousands of participants in the centre of pyongyang completed and sealed an important and unusual political event in this remote and isolated land of north korea – the party congress. the demo has been followed by a show, so big that it could not be staged anywhere else. magnificient fireworks, twenty thousand men and women dancing with torches in the darkness of pyongyang night – this show i'll remember forever. for the koreans it was not a show, but a declaration of their loyalty to the state and the leader – or, perhaps, even for them it was just a night dance. who knows?

three churches summitby israel shamir
as the russian easter approaches – it will symbolically coincide this year with  may day – it is the right time to speak of a very important recent spiritual event that received too little publicity in the west, but it kept russia all agog. this was not an oscar nomination, after all. two old men, heads of two great churches had met on the territory of the third church. these were kyril and francis, the bishops of moscow and rome on the last vestige of the communist territory, in cuba. they represented two ancient and venerable churches: the roman catholic and the russian orthodox, separated by a millennium-old schism, and as the ghost, the communist church was present at this summit.

sanders changes the rulesby israel shamir
you have to pay obeisance to israel if you want to become the us president. you have to swear your full compliance with israel's demands. you have to run to aipac and declare your eternal love of the jewish state. this is a truism, like “monsieur de la palisse was alive fifteen minutes before his death”. 
or so it was until bernie sanders turned the tables and changed the rules. we do not know yet whether his game will succeed and he will be anointed the next president. we do not know even whether he will snatch the democrats' nomination from the teeth of mme clinton. but he already achieved a great victory and toppled the mainstay pillar of the regime.

russia bids farewellby israel shamir
the massive terrorist attack in brussels came as a not so fast answer to vladimir putin's mission accomplished . it appears the world needs more of russian intervention in the middle east if the black killers from the desert are to be stopped. luckily, russia is not in a rush to leave completely. from what i hear in syria, the promised withdrawal is rather a figure of speech. some russians are leaving, others are staying.

yes, i am aware that many of our colleagues, gentlemen of the free press, already explained and justified putin's sudden declaration. they wrote that putin had said in september the campaign would last till spring, so being a man of his word he had to live up to his promise. they wrote the russians had done as much as they could or should, that their mission is indeed accomplished. (this is odd, for the dreadful daesh and his awful sister al nusra are alive and kicking). others said the russians are clever to go while going is good, that is before the looming joint turkish and saudi invasion of syria.

the blessed bigotry of mr. trumpby israel shamir
only a dumb fish would complain if a man were to say: “i never eat fish, and i do not intend to eat fish”. only the dumbest fish would condemn the man as a bigot: “what! he does not like us!” and yet, our muslim american friends apparently emulate the stupid fish when speaking of donald trump. 
				i spoke well of trump. my radical muslim american friend screamed on a list serve: “and what about his racist remarks about muslims that are akin to those made about jews not all that long ago? shall we accept him on that basis as well as his sick stand on overweight women? do we overlook all that???????????????????!!!!!”

russians ride fastby israel shamir
the area around the central moscow tube stations looks like aleppo after an air raid. ruins, destroyed buildings, bulldozers gathering the shambles. no, moscow was not hit by terrorists: this is a planned demolition of hundreds of small and not-too-small shacks erected (in defiance of planning law) in the vicinity of tube stations in the notorious nineties, when the law was vague and easily bought for ready money. the biggest of them, the pyramid on top of pushkinskaya station, went down this week. the municipal workers promptly removed the vestiges of the collapsed constructions, while the erstwhile owners stared in disbelief.

a syrian breakthroughby israel shamir
the russians and their syrian allies have cut the main supply line of the rebels to the north of aleppo, the azaz corridor. in our last report , we wrote about the azaz corridor, “a narrow strip of land connecting turkey to the rebel forces in aleppo. though it has been narrowed down to four miles in some places, the syrian [government] army can't take it, despite the russian aerial support. for the success of the whole operation, it is paramount to seize the corridor and cut the supply lines, but there is a heavy political flak and military difficulties. at the last lavrov-kerry meeting, the american state secretary six times implored his russian counterpart to keep hands off the azaz corridor. the americans do not want to see russian victory; besides, the turks threaten to invade syria if the corridor is blocked.”

god bless you, america!by israel shamir
new hampshire is wonderful news. after many years of frustration, we see the america we would want to bless: an america that rejects the money-making machine of wall street and the death-churning machine of pentagon. both leaders of the presidential race are good—sanders for the left and trump for the right are great, exactly what is needed, and now let the best man win, for foreigners either of them will do fine. both are non-interventionists, both want to fix america rather than interfere overseas. people rejected the war-mongering candidates of the establishment, and that is what matters.

the guns of august. part one
on the pushkin square in central moscow, mcdonald’s, this symbol of pax americana, has been shut down this week. it was opened 23 years ago, as the ussr collapsed, and the unipolar world of one superpower came into being. soviet people queued for hours to get in and try this divine foreign food. they were so innocent, so inexperienced, the russians of yesteryear! for 23 long years, the us has ruled the world alone, while mcdonald’s served its burgers.

the guns of august. part two
the piping-hot stage of the ukraine crisis was over with signing of minsk cease-fire agreement. it is far from clear how long the cease-fire will last, and whether it will morph into stable peace; still this pause provides a chance to review policies and strategies of the sides.

the fateful triangle: russia, ukraine and the jewsby israel shamir
the erotic reliefs of hindu temples with their gravity-defying and anatomy-challenging positions have found a new modern competitor in the ukrainian crisis. each party wants to get the jews on their side, while claiming that the other side is anti-jewish and a jewish puppet at once. this impossible, kama-sutraesque position is the result of extremely confusing alliances: the kiev regime lists devout jews and fiery antisemites among its mainstays.

wikileaks rides east!by israel shamir
a diverse gang of five journalists in their early thirties ride a car through deserts and high mountains of central asia.  amidst breathtaking scenery, they cross impassable tunnels, negotiate steep curves and flocks of sheep on country roads, visit the capitals of new republics that came into being since the fall of the ussr, meet interesting people and discuss freedom of speech and its limits. a road movie par excellence, it’s easy rider by wim wenders, but in a better setting. soon we learn that theirs is not a joyride. these young people had been sent on a quest to far-away lands by the maverick genius of julian assange, captive of ellingham hall in east anglia

first, the good news. american hegemony is over. the bully has been subdued. we cleared the cape of good hope, symbolically speaking, in september 2013. with the syrian crisis, the world has passed a key forking of modern history. it was touch and go, just as risky as the cuban missile crisis of 1962. the chances for total war were high, as the steely wills of america and eurasia had crossed in the eastern mediterranean. it will take some time until the realisation of what we’ve gone through seeps in: it is normal for events of such magnitude. the turmoil in the us, from the mad car chase in the dc to the shutdown of federal government and possible debt default, are the direct consequences of this event

this year, spring in france is unusually cold and rainy, following on the heels of a frosty and long winter. only the last sunday was different: the sun pushed the clouds away for the first time in months, and immediately the lucid parisian air warmed up and trees broke out in full bloom. the french were cheered up after the long, hibernal gloom and went out to the streets to protest – ostensibly, against the new gay marriage and adoption bill that the government is trying to push through parliament despite popular rejection, but verily against the neoliberal policies of their new government.

putin against babiesby israel shamir
to the many crimes of president vladimir putin, a new one was added last month: kicking babies, sweet, innocent, plump babies -- out of sheer wickedness.  this crime was discussed ad nauseam, until it became a meme which was summed up by the ny times’ own thomas friedman: “when recently confronted with his regime’s bad behavior, [putin’s] first instinct was to block american parents from adopting russian orphans, even though so many of them badly need homes.” surprisingly, in russia the voices against the new ban are even more shrill. at recent press conference, no less than eight different russian journalists badgered president putin on this one topic, each offering little more than loaded insinuations disguised as questions. the “white” opposition marched in force against the “scoundrels” (as they describe the supporters of the ban) and compared putin to king herod.

the heavy loaded cargo boats, passenger liners, cruise ships and plentiful ferries packed with tourists steam by the maiden tower. the city, one of the greatest capitals of man of all time, has straddled europe and asia since the days of the roman emperor constantine, who established this new rome. it was the biggest city on earth a millennium ago, and it is still vast.

breaking news: julian assange mossad agent!

by israel shamir
iran is a great country for kebab; their pretty if well-covered girls are fine; but sense of humour is just not their forte. their state media repeatedly broadcasted items lifted from the onion, a satirical magazine taking them for literal truth. now press tv published an attack on julian assange with a bombastic claim: “exclusive: assange-mossad ties unveiled”. oy, it would be better to stick to the onion.

turks, cease fire!by israel shamir
in the middle eastern corrida, the moment of truth is approaching fast. assad’s syria is running around the arena like a wounded bull, fraught and worn down by a year of cruel strife. banderillas of mujaheeds stick out of his broken hide. the public, the europeans, the americans, the gulf rulers call: kill him! and the turkish matador steps forward, pulling out his sword. his cannons rain death on syrian slopes; fire and lead storm consumes the hills. erdogan is preparing to deal last blow to his exhausted neighbour.

pussy riot from london to moscowby israel shamir
shamir's essay briefly appeared on the morning star site, but the british jewish ‘tribal or kosher’ marxists were on the watch; they applied pressure to the morning star, and the british communists surrendered immediately. if they can’t stand up to a few jewish marxists, how can they stand up to real big capitalist enemies?

many liberals and non-ethnic russians are deeply suspicious of navalny. but their presentation of navalny as a "new hitler" is far-fetched. blue-eyed, good-looking, a dash of the racist, yes, but not an especially silver-tongued one. navalny tried to talk to the demonstrators in december but was catcalled more than once. his manner was too rude, as if he were talking to a street gang. even more odd, when asked for a model state russia should follow, navalny said, "singapore." this is an odd choice for a person fighting putin's strong-arm style, as lee kuan yew was probably more authoritarian than putin. as fond as i am of singapore street cooking, i can't imagine a less suitable model for a vast multinational ex-empire than the tiny chinese polis.

moscow is unusually warm: the temperature refuses to dip below zero degrees centigrade, the freezing point.  instead, it is wet and dark. the sun gets up late and goes to sleep early. to make matters worse, president medvedev decided to keep russia on daylight savings  time throughout winter. to offset this stupid decision, christmas illumination was turned on a month before the usual time, in order to cheer up the voters. now it lights the way for the armoured vans of the riot police sent in to pacify the cheery electorate.

caribbean sea pirates in crisisby israel shamir (a lecture on economics delivered at rhodes forum on october 9, 2011)
the crisis peaking in britain is of a caribbean-sea-pirate type: long time no trophies, while lifestyle has to be maintained. neoliberal policies have undermined the toughest folk on earth, hard-working, prudent, obedient, stiff-upper-lipped red-faced brits, the people who managed india, burned down the white house and withstood hitler. their backbone – yorkshire miners and sheffield steel workers – was broken by their golders green grocer-at-large, a.k.a. the iron lady. she folded down the industries, and turned the isles into a tortuga-like pirate paradise, a place for financiers to relax, unwind and plan their raids.

the arab autumnby israel shamir
the independence of truncated palestine is not the ideal. it will not solve the problems of refugees, of separation between the west bank and gaza, of discrimination within israel proper. but don’t worry: mahmud abbas’ bid will not create an independent palestine. it will get the palestinian train out of impasse, it will wipe the snide smirk off netanyahu’s and lieberman’s faces; it will undermine the us hold on the region. more importantly, it will support a new dynamic, extremely negative for israel, even if this straw does not break the proverbial camel’s back. anyway, the palestinians can’t solve this problem themselves: elimination of the apartheid regime in israel/palestine will be effected by the future caliphate, which is sure to enhance its legitimacy and popularity.

i was in belarus to observe the presidential election, and to tell the truth i was expecting some sort of staged little event to mar the day. the outcome of the election was in little doubt. the people were happy, fully employed, and satisfied with their government. they were well aware of what had happened when neighboring countries had embraced the imf, and they felt no ideological need to tread that same dark road. some people, however, are more motivated by dollars than patriotism, and these are the people i was expecting. the pro-western ‘gucci’ crowd can always be counted on to protest the choices of the majority. they protested in iran after the election victory of ahmadinejad. they protested in palestine when hamas was voted into power. they actually overturned the vote in nearby ukraine in 2005, and the orange gangs succeeded in stealing the presidency for five long years. if they cannot convince the people with western dollars, then they simply riot and try to take it by force.

ode to cynthiaisrael shamir’s talk at the ankara conference
in ankara, the capital of turkey, in the course of defending the cause of palestine, i've met with wonderful cynthia mckinney, who would be the best president for the us. after this touching meeting, she wrote to her list:



i can hardly believe this moment!!  israel shamir has written about me and lifted my spirits when i was most down.  even from faraway israel, he understood my plight and dared give voice to the truth.  they say that sometimes distance gives clarity--and certainly in israel's case, in observing my serial targeting, he saw what many inside the united states could not see.  despite his writings, i never met him until this moment, just a few minutes ago!!  we are speaking together this afternoon in ankara, turkey. i will bring these contacts from around the world that i have made on behalf of peace, home to the united states so that we can more easily achieve our objectives for justice and peace and dignity in the area of policy where we and the world need it the most.  we are a part of something much bigger than us individually, and our moment is now.

i add to it now what i wrote about cynthia a few years ago:






a report from planet mammonby e. michael jones
if there were ever a sign of contradiction for the age of irenic interreligious dialogue inaugurated by the second vatican council, it is israel shamir. shamir’s conversion to christianity was a sign that the repressed had returned just in time to save the church from total apostasy on the jewish question. shamir, the jewish convert, saw jews not as our “elder brothers” but as st. paul saw them, which is to say, as “the enemy of mankind.” in accepting baptism, shamir joined a long line of  “jews by birth who denounced the judaic cult of death and accepted the living christ.” for shamir, the crucial “sieve” which separated good from evil in the great struggle of his day was the “relationship to the palestinian suffering”; “whoever disregarded it followed antichrist; whoever denounced it began his way to christ.” like st. paul, shamir has become a latter day apostle to the gentiles and a reproach to all those who would ignore the warning of the gospels and urge upon christians a quasi-masonic brotherhood with their enemies which leads to their mental evisceration and moral ruin.

experts explain the crisis by bankers' stupidity. they did not know what they were doing when they flooded the markets with their cheap credit, or sold swaps or marketed derivatives. alternatively, it is argued that they were so greedy that did not understand their long-term interests and ruined everything. but the bankers and the financial elite are not stupid, neither are they short-sighted. i believe that things happen because people intend them to happen, unless there are very strong proofs to the contrary. i believe that unless we do something pretty drastic, they will emerge out of this crisis even more rich, more powerful and in fuller control of our lives.

la tiranía del liberalismo


in our desire to free holy land from captivity, we wish to unite forces standing against the judeo-american empire from within and without - in new york and teheran, in selva of amazonas and in moscow. we wish to create a new broad coalition for the oppressed majority - and these forces are to be found in the left and in the right. we are not easily scared into obedience by the new york times and le monde : we do not hate ahmadinejad, chavez, nasrallah, hamas, mao, putin, mahler, lukashenka, garodi and duke, we do not even fear to reverently mention jesus christ and our lady mary. our enemies win by sowing discord and some of our friends stay trapped in conventional separatism of left and right. thus in spain, a leading leftist site does not want to publish israel shamir and james petras, in sweden, there is a similar discussion, in england, it was carried by our friend gilad atzmon.

answer a fool according to his folly



(an answer to a jewish chain letter)

maybe you have received one of those annoying letters brandishing alleged jewish claims on palestine; it is admittedly low genre, and not worthy to be replied, but the proverbs (26:5) teach: “answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes.”




a yiddishe medina by israel shamir

readers of this site are always well ahead of 

time. sometimes, years ahead. only now mainstream 

america begins to discuss “jewish lobby”, but on 

this site we expounded this subject in 2001. 

actually, what we said then, remains relevant now. 

here is a re-run of my 2001 essay a yiddishe 

medina (a jewish state, in yiddish), included in 

the galilee flowers, where i ask:



does america support israel because of the jewish 

lobby or because of the ‘true interest of american 

corporations’? the putative answer is: the jewish 

lobby is a superfluous body supportive of the 

israeli right-wing, while america as a whole is a 

grander ‘jewish’ state with interests outside the 

middle east as well.



in a way, this essay sums up much of my writing.

the trefoil and the cross



on the many-coloured hans buenting map (1581), our world looks like a flower; its three petals present the three continents of europe, west asia, africa, united by the holy land. the map allows for a different reading, too: the flower is the faith of christ and our lady, and the three petals are islam, catholicism and orthodoxy. while the westerners preferred to view islam as an antithesis of christianity, eastern christians, notably st john the damascene, considered islam as another christian church, on a par with the western catholic church 

                                                                                                     this is a good place to recognise an unknown victim of the iraqi war: christianity.

siam's poem oh jerusalem



“in a rare guest appearance, now on this site a new poem by siam, arguably the best living american poet, commemorating edward said and the struggle for palestine. siam combines deep sufi mysticism of rumi, and all-american cosmic spirit of walt whitman. his poetry is a natural phenomenon as much as a work of art, and reminds of a volcano in full blast of its furnaces, with lava erupting and rocks flying out: spectacular but scary.

down with human rights:





philo-semitic attacks on the rise by joh domingo
more people died from philo-semitic attacks in

palestine and iraq, than died in the massive

year.  
down with human rights by joh domingo
it behoves us to deconstruct the edifice of the

human rights industry and examine what oozes out.
