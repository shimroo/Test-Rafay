what our families say ...










our children love having marybeth g. as a caregiver. she engages our 5-year-old with activities that he enjoys including reading and puzzles and we feel very confident about leaving our children with her. having her available as a caregiver helps me be more productive knowing that i can leave for work.

tracy g. far exceeded my expectations (although it was not for child care.)  she was on time, pleasant, efficient, and willing to do whatever was necessary.  we were hosting a post-funeral reception for a beloved family member, and it was a very sad and stressful time for us.  tracy took the burden of the reception off me.  she looked professional and was very polite and helpful to everyone.  she cleaned up beautifully and wrapped the leftover food for us.  she is truly a credit to your organization.
