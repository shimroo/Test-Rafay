the epidemiology data center (edc) was established in 1980 as a section of the department of epidemiology in the graduate school of public health (gsph) and is recognized as an official university center at the university of pittsburgh. it was founded by katherine m. detre, m.d., dr.p.h., and is under the co-direction of maria mori brooks, ph.d., steven h. belle, ph.d. and stephen r. wisniewski, ph.d.





the edc has collaborated in over 100 research studies sponsored by the national institutes of health and other agencies. presently, the edc coordinates data management and analysis activities for 26 research projects sponsored by federal agencies as well as by industry. the current studies represent a variety of scientific designs including clinical trials, registries, and case control studies. the successful coordination of our research requires that we facilitate national and global communication among a number of institutions worldwide.




one of the main focuses of the edc since its founding has been developing and refining standard information technology, data management and statistical procedures and models. such procedures and models enable reduced and efficient start-up time on new projects, and promote a high degree of quality control for developed research.








data management
we believe that the primary role of data management is to define methods and utilize technology in a way that ensures the highest possible degree of integrity in our research.
our data management teams work in close collaboration with other researchers from the time of study design through the analysis phase to ensure that data are collected correctly from the inception of a research study and to ensure that we are building in the highest degree of data integrity at every stage of the project lifecycle.
