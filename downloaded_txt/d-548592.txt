“i found the salesperson professional and accountable, and the installers courteous and respectful of my apartment and me.  i highly recommend skyline.”

— deborah




“i live on an exceedingly noisy corner in nyc and was at my wits end with traffic, sirens and street noise. the windows skyline recommended have literally changed my life. my apartment is now like a quiet oasis. best home improvement decision ever.”

— karen




“skyline is the best. i was actually out of town when the work was done. when i got home, you would never have known construction was done in my apartment. everything was very clean and the windows looked amazing. couldn’t be happier with the level of service and product quality from start to finish.”

— spencer
