the tatum family
"as we are now weaning kennedy, we decided to use cow and gate follow-on milk alongside as it complements her weaning diet. cow and gate contains everything she needs from a follow on milk, like vitamin d and calcium, and nothing she doesn’t, so no palm oil or artificial preservative. with a happy baby, we are happy too!"*
@_tatam














laura
"as parents to 3 children between me and my partner, we have been a great believer that cow & gate follow on milk has given our children the best support and growth throughout their early years. my step son and son used it, and when my daughter turned 6 months we introduced it to her and she loves the taste!"*

naomi
"breakfast time in our house is always the happiest but most chaotic time of the day. i love that cow & gate follow on milk contains everything our little one needs from a follow-on milk, it’s been trusted for over 100 years, giving me full peace of mind that tre is getting all the key vitamins and minerals while he transitions into eating more meals."*
@naomibanjo














leah
"as a family we have loved using cow and gate follow on milk. from our eldest getting excited when his beakers were made to our third and final baby slowly transitioning from bottle to beaker. cow and gate is our go- to follow on milk brand with our family and it’s been a pivotal part of our memories with our children."*
