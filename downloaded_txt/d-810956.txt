pristine lakesblackduck lake






lying west of the city of blackduck, this 2,500-acre lake has a maximum depth of 35 feet and provides good angling for walleye, northern pike and yellow perch. in recent years, walleye abundance has been the highest ever recorded, and the northern population has maintained its strength. undeveloped shorelines and shallow areas provided excellent places for wildlife and fish to feed, hide and raise their young.
