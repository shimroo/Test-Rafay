 what people are saying“it is with great pleasure that i recommend yolanda pritam hari.  over the years, i have come to trust and depend on her expertise, knowledge and advice. she is well trained and thorough, and has helped me to heal on many occasions.  she listens and hears me, and i feel she is a trusted partner who cares. yolanda is patient, accommodating and has the highest integrity.yolanda pritam hari is a gift to us, and you are in good hands with her. we did consultations by phone, and used zoom to address my body structure and balance. the work we did early on woke up new awareness inside me and set forth a cascade of healing shifts. so many thanks!"— leenie glickman, ashland ma
