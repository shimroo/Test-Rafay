	 this post is embarrassingly small... and world-changing!
    


i keep seeing commercials for puzz 3d. these are puzzles which defy the laws of traditional puzzle-dom by building away from the center of the earth into three dimensions, shattering the outdated view that had puzzles existing only within two painfully constricting dimensions.but i have exciting news in the world of puzzles! i'm now in development with a puzzle firm to take us into the next generation of puzzles...4 dimensional puzzles!that's right. not only will you be assembling your puzzle along 3 axes, but you will also travel forward through time as you do it. minutes will whiz by you in one dimension while you solve the puzzle in the remaining three.as we all know, up until this point, the flow of time ceased when construction of a puzzle began, to maintain the 3 dimension standard. something in the theory of quantum time manifold has been keeping us from exploring the last great puzzle frontier. but no longer! my long research and studying has finally paid off!welcome to the future!

	 an uplifting story
    


this blog is about tearing down. gutting. destroying. demolishing. cutting open the belly of my everyday life to watch the innards slop onto the ground, blood-soaked and bile-ridden, with a stench befitting a hobo's back-up urine/belly lint collection jar.but today, i thought i'd build up, rather than take down. to raise, rather than raze.this story is about a highschool basketball player who finally got to play in his first varsity basketball game. he scored 20 points in four minutes. and, he's autistic. pretty impressive. watch the video. it's kind of powerful.http://www.wroctv.com/news/story.asp?id=21810&r=l

	 what planet do we live on?
    


nine dead.fifteen dead.i really don't like religion. at least in its organized form. but especially in its radical form. it doesn't seem to do much except cause death. polarize the population. make me feel guilty about masturbation. masturbation that has nothing to do with altar boys. except maybe for me being dressed as an altar boy....anyway, this whole issue boggles the mind. people are being killed -- killed -- because someone in another country drew a caricature of a religious figure. a few lines on a piece of paper.no one seems angered over the fact that garfield is still being printed. "haha, garfield sure does love sleep! genius!" no, not genius. awful. and ziggy has never been funny. marmaduke? funky winkerbean? ridiculous.what i'm saying is, let's be angry and kill people for the right cartoons. jim davis and whoever it is that draws the rest of that crap. religious cartoons are a flash in the pan. but garfield will seemingly... *sigh*... go on forever....no, i'm kidding.  we shouldn't kill people over cartoons at all....except garfield.  that's really exceptionally awful.

	 cheney's bloodlust knows no bounds
    


cheney wants us all dead.  and he's doing the job one human being at a time.  this is made more evident by the most recent cheney news which report that the vice president shot his hunting partner.  "accidentally."cheney accidentally shoots fellow hunterthis obviously isn't the first time cheney has been in the news.  here's a few other headlines that come from a simple search.cheney authorized aide to leak in cia caselibby claims cheney approved classified media leakscheney accidentally shoots hunting companioniraqi wmd will be found: cheneycheney rejects gay marriage bancheney's halliburton ties remainirked cheney gives leahy an 'f'now, some will say that none of these news stories says anything substantial or damning about the vice president.  maybe.  but what happens when i switch a few words around, perhaps combine a few headlines? this just in!   "cheney authorized, shoots fellow hunter""libby claims cheney gay""cheney: 'companion for gay marriage will be found'" "libby/cheney's gay marriage will be approved""cheney, gay companion to 'f'""cheney accidentally shoots cheney" "cheney shoots aide, libby, companion, iraqi"

	 the whole muslim cartoon issue
    


i've been following pretty closely the controversy over some european newspapers printing an offensive cartoon involving the prophet mohammad. the outrage in the muslim world has turned deadly now as four people have been killed during protests in afghanistan.  buildings have been set ablaze, and protests in general have been getting, more increasingly, out of control.while i sympathize with the angered muslim world, i cannot help but question their reaction. now, obviously, the muslim people do not act as a single entity; there are millions of muslims around the world, each with his or her own individuality. you can't make broad-sweeping generalizations about a group of people based on one member. however, to those members of the muslim community who are protesting violently and setting things on fire, i will say this:stop acting like the world'signorant, stereotypical view of you!  it's bizarre to me. it's difficult to really describe my feelings on the matter. except maybe through interpretive dance. but since you can't see me, and this isn't a video blog, i'll just draw it out.

	 oh, neo nazis...
    


recently, a teenaged neo-nazi named jacob robida (aka douche) entered a massachusetts gay bar, shooting two people and using a hatchet on a third. i don't like neo-nazis. in fact, you might even say i hate them.but i want to understand them. i want to understand their motivation for believing and doing the things they believe and do. what's the reason for a neo-nazi to enter a gay bar? oh, it just hit me.this kid is totally gay!dude! you totally went into that gay bar! you're totally gay now! yes you are! you didn't know that?? that's how it works! haha, i can't believe you did that! you're so totally stupid! and now you're so totally gay! i'll bet you made out with guys, too...oh my god, you did!! no, that's not like a handshake to them! oh my god, you totally made out with a bunch of dudes! you're like one big ball of gayness now! soon you'll be calling everything fabulous and stuff. you're just thinking about feeling up big muscle-bound guys right now, aren't you?! you totally are! i mean, come on, look at your picture...oh my god!  you are totally gay!...okay. that's enough. i don't want to make light of a very serious issue. but, since i don't condone violence of nearly any kind -- except, of course, against this guy -- the only way i know how to react to bad people is by making fun of them. and calling a neo-nazi who hates gays "gay" seems like a good way to get my frustration out.seriously, though, look at that photo again. that's the gayest kid i've ever seen! talk about gaylord mcgayerton! welcome to gaytown, usa! population: gay neo-nazi kid! gaaaaaaaaaay!exclusive special updatethanks to an anonymous source, this photo ofthe neo-nazi jacob rabida has just surfaced.compelling evidence, to say the least.more as it develops.
