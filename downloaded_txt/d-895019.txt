because home staging is smart marketing



“if you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten.” - tony robbins



no matter what price-bracket the home is in, the goal of the seller is always to get it sold quickly for the best possible price.  buyers want a home that appeals to their needs and aspirations.  home staging is the winning marketing strategy that ticks all the boxes!  when a listing can meet or even exceed the buyer’s expectations, they’re going to want it and are often willing to jump through hoops to make it their own.  and that’s what home staging is.  it’s about giving the buyers what they want. it’s that simple.   the goal for any realtor should be to present their listing with the potential buyer in mind.   always.   when you start looking at a listing as a product.  when you understand that a superior product is going to garner superior results.  when you recognize that armed with a home staging expert® certification you have it within your power to create those buyer-friendly rooms that sell.   that’s a winning marketing strategy that people want to buy.

see what top producing realtors® across the country have to say about our training















“i loved the class, loved my instructor, and felt like it was the best class of all time!  i didn’t believe that learning home staging was necessary for me, but now i feel like it’s mandatory, even in this crazy, busy real estate market.  i work in the high-end home range and typically the homes are well appointed, but i still feel it’s imperative to stage those homes.  i have a $5.3 million dollar property i listed just before the workshop, then went back and used what i learned.   now it looks drop dead gorgeous!”  -  audrey will, luxury real estate, sotheby’s international realty






“if you have the chance to take this course, you should do it!”— jennifer w. coulson, global luxury specialist, coldwell banker distinctive properties


















“i really advise anyone to take this class! it is definitely worth it! i’ve been selling houses with my team and staging them for about 20 years now and i learned a lot of new tricks!”— ronda courtney, re/max leaders and author of the survival guide to selling real estate: release the golden handcuffs by finding true work-life balance





























cindy burns - luxury hse certified
martha turner - sotheby’s international realtytexas“both tish and i thoroughly enjoyed the workshop, and we really got a lot out of it. i think any active realtor® would benefit greatly from taking this class and participating in your workshop.  it was all very informative, and everyone had a great time! although i will not be as active as a (hands-on) stager, the information will help my clients.  i can’t help but believe that your workshop would be instrumental in helping any active, high-producing, well-rounded realtor® to enjoy even greater success! thank you again. it was great fun, and we really enjoyed meeting you!”











mark standridge - luxury hse certified
compasstexas“lori delivered an outstanding 2-day workshop on home staging. the hands-on experience allowed us to directly apply the principles and suggestions covered in the lectures. the class had a welcoming and collaborative atmosphere, where everyone was encouraged to share their thoughts and feedback. this supportive environment fostered active participation and helped reinforce the staging concepts and practices discussed throughout the workshop.”











janet hu - luxury hse certified
berkshire hathaway california propertiescalifornia"the 1-day home staging workshop taught by lori matzke was an amazing learning experience that helped us put into practice and solidify the 4 key principles in staging a home to showcase its best features.  the property we worked on was the perfect example of the difference between effective staging and merely decorating. at first glance the home's furnishing were mostly current, on-trend, and visually appealing, but their placement and overabundance of accessories needed rearranging and editing to better highlight the features.  i really appreciated lori’s teaching style, which fostered a casual and collaborative atmosphere.  she encouraged us to explore our ideas and try them out.  we reworked each space in collaboration with other students; some rooms were more challenging than others and it was a real confidence builder to reach that ‘aha' moment when our ideas and objectives came into alignment.  i highly recommend!"











deb mccracken - luxury hse certified
coldwell banker minnesota“thanks for such a fun and productive workshop!  i loved it and felt like i was ‘with my people’.  i can see why you are so good at what you do!  you have inspired me to add this service to my business and charge for it!  i’ve always thought i had a knack for staging and became the ‘go to gal’ for room planning and furniture selections in my previous position.  but after the class, i now realize this ‘knack’ of mine is of value as most people i know still ask me for help.  so, thank you for giving me permission to realize i have a talent i can sell, damnit!”











janet meier - luxury hse certified
exp realtycalifornia"enjoyed the class! the course manual has a great summary of tips with photos and examples.  the in-person course was very rewarding. not only did we get an opportunity to apply concepts, but we were also able to learn from each other and gain insights from multiple people’s perspectives and experience.  no amount of book learning can replace the value of hands-on practical application!"











creighton grose - hse certified
compassgeorgia“an ideal course for beginners as well as seasoned agents.  beginners will learn the principles of what’s important about staging and how to effectively deliver a staged space.  more experienced agents will be able to hone in and refine the core strategies that bring consistency to a wide variety of scenarios.  both groups will get a wealth of resources and guidelines.”











susan martin - luxury hse certified
century 21 - martin & associatesvermont“the 2-day home staging expert® workshop was very enjoyable! my clients are thrilled with the value-added service, making it easier to compete for listings. i traveled from vermont (to colorado) for the course and so glad i did. i highly recommend it to any agent seeking to broaden their skill sets for listing and selling!”











nita gray - hse certified
keller williams atlanta classic georgia“the home staging expert® course is an incredibly informative and valuable resource for anyone pursuing certification as a home stager!  with her extensive knowledge, lori delivers the course in a clear and easily comprehensible manner.  i would recommend enrolling in the hse workshop to enhance your skills in this field.”











susan church - hse certified
keller williams realty first atlantageorgia“lori was very prepared and well organized and kept things focused and engaging throughout the entire zoom process.  the visuals and manual handout kept accurately to the subject and presentation, but also serve as a valuable reference tool moving forward in my real estate business.”

why more luxury realtors® are getting home staging expert® certified 



“there are only two ways to establish a competitive advantage:  do things better than others or do them differently.”  - karl albrecht



if you’re already a luxury realtor® or an agent trying to break into that market, you already know the mindset of the luxury property owner is completely different than average. they have much higher expectations of their agent and look to them for more guidance and expertise and are less open to bringing in a third-party for additional assistance. that’s why it’s imperative for a luxury realtor® to    have first-hand working knowledge of the home staging process to guide their client through without offending.the home staging expert® training workshops were specifically designed with the realtor in mind.  we don’t teach you ‘how to work with a stager’ like so many of our competitors, we teach you how to actually stage a property to appeal to more potential buyers and ensure you’re able to provide specific and effective instructions to your client for outstanding results! 



we  didn’t  create  the home  staging  concept.   we  perfected  it.



what you learn from themthis luxury property was staged by a realtor who earned their certification from one of our well-known competitors.






































what you learn from usthis is that same listing, utilizing all the same furnishings and accessories, after being re-staged during a luxury home staging expert® hands-on workshop using our methods and techniques!you’re not the only one taking notice of the marketable difference in the end result!  so do potential buyers.every listing deserves to look its best, and every seller deserves to work with a realtor® who knows what they’re doing!our workshops teach you a completely different way to think about what you’re selling, from the moment you first meet with your potential client on a listing appointment, to the moment the first potential buyer walks through that front door
