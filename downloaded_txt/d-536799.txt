office for ageing well’s guide to the festival















            we acknowledge that the land we gather, work and learn on is the traditional land of the kaurna nation of the adelaide plains. we recognise their ongoing connection to place as the world's oldest continuous living culture and that this land has been a place of movement, music and storytelling for over 60,000 years. we take pride in honouring those traditions.
