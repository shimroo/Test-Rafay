nancy mills, energy artist














at the age of 70, i starting painting. i hadn’t held a paintbrush in 65 years. drawn to start painting in watercolors, i found i have this gift where energy comes through my hands. i am “led” to what i am going to paint and what colors to use. i never know what i’ll paint before i begin. now at 75, i’ve painted over 1000 paintings, sold over 100 originals and began traveling the world to see how my energy art changes from place to place. i’ve recently painted in skopelos island, greece and santa barbara, california. my next painting trip will be in san miguel de allende, mexico.

“i am so moved by nancy’s art, that i have become a significant collector. quite simply: nancy has put her power into her palette and has been creating some magnificent works of art that fill my space with positive, uplifting, and transformational energy. that energy has gone on to change my life.” - rebecca hall gruyter
