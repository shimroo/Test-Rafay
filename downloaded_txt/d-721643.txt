																	foods and drinks that speed up body and skin aging 															

we spend much on buying skin products to make us look younger. however, less concern is taken on the food that we eat. 
what you put on your plate and what you eat does have a significant effect on what you see in the mirror. according to dr. timothy harlan, an assistant professor of medicine at tulane university school of medicine, poor quality food cause inflammation that results in premature aging. trans fat, which you can find in different foods especially processed food, is inflammatory. sugars and processed carbohydrates like baked goods and pasta can also lead to collagen loss and skin damage.  
for professional advice, go to experts like the colorado dermatology for more information about food and your skin. 

sugars 
sugar does not just give negative effects to your skin, but it is also linked to weight gain, saggy skin, wrinkles, and an unhealthy body in general. eating too much sugar triggers glycation. this is a process of glucose binding with your lipids and proteins. this results in advanced glycation end products (ages). these harmful substances can worsen into degenerative diseases and make your body age faster. the glycation process itself can damage your skin’s collagen, which is responsible for making your skin firmer.  
fats 
trans fat, specifically, does not just provide a risk to heart diseases but also stiffen your arteries, leading to blood blockage inside your veins. restricted blood flow can increase the chances of premature aging and wrinkles. it will make your skin look stiff and inflexible.  
alcohol  
this drink drank by many people specifically in the united stated, also increases the development of premature aging of your cells and body in general. combatting dehydration with alcohol is restricting yourself from intaking purified water. aside from the fact that alcohol provides toxins into your liver, it also causes redness, puffiness, wrinkles, loss of collagen, and it depletes your nutrients intake of vitamin a and hydration that cause wrinkles to your skin. vitamin a plays a significant role in the production of collagen in your body. 
salty food 
salt can draw water out from your skin that leads to dehydration. dehydrated skin cells shrink, making your skin looks puffy. excess salt is found in different food we consume like pizza, crackers, chips, fries, cheese, cereals, and the list goes on. not getting enough water leaves the skin with wrinkles and aged skin look. 
charred food 
the char that can be found on grilled meat and food have pro-inflammatory hydrocarbons which are considered to be inflammatory to the body. this can potentially break down collagen in your body.  
caffeinated drinks 
caffeinated drinks include your favorite coffee and sodas. the effects of these drinks are more akin to sleep deprivation. lack of sleep does not just cause other serious physical and mental health problems but also cause stress to your skin cells. you will have increased chances of aging, wrinkles, and eye circles.  
caffeine is also considered to be diuretic. this means that it makes you excrete fluids that cause your body to lose moisture. while this can be prevented by drinking more glasses of water, sodas and coffee may also have sugars added on them, which make them more harmful to your body and skin.
