“ever since we implemented quality solutions’  transaction-based customer satisfaction survey, we have been able to personally address customers with service concerns immediately.  our customers have been very impressed with our timely response to their concerns and equally so, it has benefited our organization.  in our industry, we rely heavily on referrals among colleagues,  so it’s imperative that we garner customer feedback for analyses in order to consistently improve our service offering and remain competitive in the market.”
 jill balcerzak, marketing director, corporate translations, inc.


“we found a true partner in quality solutions.  from the start, they took the time to really understand our business and learned what makes it unique.  the decision to work with them was easy because they believed it was more important to provide us with a solution that met our specific needs, rather than sell us an “off the shelf” product.  if you are looking for a positive impact on your organization, we highly recommend working with quality solutions. the results have met and/or exceeded our expectations.”
bobby collins, senior vice president, pure group of insurance companies
