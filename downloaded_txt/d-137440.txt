 everything went great!! driver /delivery person was super nice and helpful. everything is accounted for and went off without any problems. the pto group all said that we will use your company again!!! very organized and even the prizes were organized. loved the stickers for the bags, easy to find kids bags and phone numbers on sheets were excellent for calling parents.    thank you so much for helping me get through all of this, as this was my first trial at a fundraiser..  i am planning to run for vp of fundraising for the next school year  :)

hi patricia,    i received the order on time friday and when i sorted i had the exact right amount of everything!  i didn't see anything damaged either so hopefully no reports from the kids.  i love that online ordering system with the student names on stickers and paperwork.    thank you for another smooth fundraiser and have a wonderful holiday season if you don't hear from me before then.

to a manager!  to whom it may concern: this was my first time ever doing a fundraiser like this. and i just wanted you to know that pat was my consultant and she helped me every step of the way. she has been so patient and helpful with all my questions and concerns. you are very lucky to have her working for you. she made my experience an enjoyable one. thank you for all you help

hi jenine,    everything was perfect. we got the order in on monday, and we were able to organize it quickly. we haven't had a single complaint or concern.  i passed along your contact information for groups to use your company in the future. it was so easy and nice to work with you. i want you to know that we really appreciate how quickly you returned answers to my questions and how smoothly the whole process worked.    i appreciate you!

thank you jenine, delivery and distribution was a breeze.  definitely good advice to have your folks sort them by student.  we were able to hand them out in time for mothers day and it was a beautiful weekend for gardening.    sincerely,  capri

hi pat, i appreciate your business and you were terrific to work with!  the fundraiser went over our expectations and we were very pleased with the results.  the delivery was right on time and from there, everything worked out good.  if our after school programs continue to be funded for next year, we are expecting to do another cookie [dough] campaign.  thank you so much and have a great day!
