					backbeat is music
				

					we're the only tour company in town that puts memphis' musical heritage in the hands of real musicians. we won't just talk about music, we'll play it live for you!
				





 



					backbeat is history
				

					we wrote the book on memphis history. let us show you another side of memphis as we entertain you with stories of this captivating river town and its people.
				





 



					backbeat has chills
				

					ever seen a ghost? we can’t promise you will, but freaky things have happened on our ghost tours. find out for yourself!
				





 



					backbeat is memphis
				

					as unique and unconventional as memphis itself, our tours are the only way to truly experience this amazing city. one of our passengers said it best: “i felt like a part of memphis.”
				





 



					backbeat is fun
				

					every tour is an entertainment extravaganza, complete with music, comedy, and laughter. grab the bongos or a tambourine and join the fun! there’s always a whole lotta shakin’ going on.

welcome to backbeat tours!
our tours – the popular memphis mojo tour, the memphis discovery tour, the ghost tour, the beale street tour, and the historic memphis walking tour – are the best way to experience one of the south’s most beautiful and complicated cities: memphis, tennessee. starting from the heart of the city at the intersection of beale street and the old blues highway, our tours fan out over the city’s many fabled historic districts and show you what memphis is all about.
you can purchase a gift certificate for any of our future tours by clicking here. gift certificates are good for all of our tours, and make great presents for family and friends. or use them yourself! just choose the tour and the number of tickets, and decide later when to come – there’s no expiration date. in the meantime, you’ll be supporting a small, local business – that’s a win-win right there! 
and don’t forget to check out two great books: a history lover’s guide to memphis & shelby county or the classic a guide to historic downtown memphis – it’s the next best thing to being here with us!
founded by author and historian bill patton, backbeat tours has been showcasing our great city to people from all over the world since 2006. we’ve been featured in the new york times, on cnn, the bbc, irish tv, japanese tv, and fox 13 news, and in forbes, usa today, southern living, memphis magazine, and newspapers around the country. come see us, and find out what all the talk is about!
