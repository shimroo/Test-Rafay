welcome to acpwc







the acpwc is a comprehensive training and certification program for those who dream of becoming wedding and event planners. the acpwc philosophy is “education through practical training.”  while we teach theory in the classroom, we stress that hands-on experience and modern practical training help the individual student in preparing to start their business as a wedding consultant. investing in yourself, and getting the proper training are the keys to any successful business.  networking with other businesses builds better relations and stronger communities.  we provide an opportunity for mentoring and internships upon graduation through our post-graduate program.
“our motto is members helping members to succeed.”













courses
acpwc offers wedding planners training courses for the novice as well as wedding professionals who desire certification. professional training builds confidence and credibility.  we offer classroom experience as well as home study programs.
