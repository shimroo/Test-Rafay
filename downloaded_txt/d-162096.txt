                                        this is the 
									first book to detail the many
                                        
                                               
									sexual functions and benefits
                                        of the foreskin



    







 
  benefits for—not only 
											the man—but also 
											for the woman on the 
											receiving end of the penis 
											during intercourse.
 







   


    it clearly explains: 





 



















 
  how 
											circumcision adversely 
											alters a man's sexual 
											performance 
 
                                                   
  —to his 
											detriment, and to
his female partner's
 







   







 
 why the 
											surgically altered 
											circumcised penis makes it 
											difficult
  —in some cases 
											impossible—for most american 
											women
                                                  to achieve 
 orgasm from 
											intercourse
 







   







 
 
why
                                                    millions of american 
											women routinely experience
                                                    chafing, redness, 
 soreness, 
  and discomfort 
											(even pain)
 as a 
											consequence 
of "circumcised 
											intercourse"

                                                    yes, it can now be 
												said with certainty: the 
												foreskin has a purpose—
  a 
												sexual purpose. 
                                                  and during 
												the intimacy of sexual 
												intercourse, 
                                                  the foreskin. . .

                                                          and the 
														penis's only 
														moving part  
 







  . . . 
												not only makes a 
												difference,   a 
												superlative difference, 
												in a man's 
                                                  sexual pleasure, but

                                                      to

                                                    of the penis,

 if you are a woman, reading  sex as nature 
								intended it  will open 
                                  your eyes to the damage circumcision 
								does to a man's sex organ 
                                  and its harmful effects on your
                                  sexual fulfillment and love 
								happiness.
 once you 
							realize how important the natural (uncircumcised) penis is
                                  to your sexual pleasure and enjoyment 
							of life, you'll undoubtedly want your 
							circumcised mate to consider investigating 
							the many options for restoring his foreskin.  
							and you'll protect your son(s) 
							from circumcision.
 yet, right now, most american 
							women have no idea how important the natural 
							penis is because they have 
							never known the   true
                                      lovemaking experience of 
							natural intercourse. they 
							have only experienced intercourse with 
							circumcised men.
 still, i 
							can explain the differences between the two 
							types of intercourse in such a way that any 
							woman can easily comprehend the foreskin's 
							vital importance, even though 
							she's never experienced sex with an 
							uncircumcised man.
 like most 
							women, i too, at one time, didn't realize 
							that the circumcised penis was the cause of 
							much of my dissatisfaction with intercourse.   
							but because i'd had the good fortune to 
							become sexually intimate with 
a man who had a natural penis, my 
							eyes were opened to the sexual truths 
							revealed in  sanii, summarized in 
							pictures, videos, & text at
  
                                        http://top10wayscircumcisedsexharmswomen
  my full 
							story, wherein i detail my sexual 
							experiences with circumcised and 
							uncircumcised men, appears in chapter 11 of   sanii.
 after i came to realize that 
							"natural intercourse" was an infinitely 
							more gratifying experience, i was curious to 
							find out how other women felt about this 
							subject.
 in this 
							regard, i conducted the 
							first survey of women 
							who have had
                                    the comparative experience of 
							intercourse with both uncircumcised
                                    
                                    and circumcised penises. 

  the vast majority 
								of these women agreed there are indeed
definite, 
								discernible differences
                                    between circumcised and natural 
								intercourse.   natural intercourse is 
								decidedly superior

								—gloriously better.  

  top 3 of the survey's  many significant 
							findings:





     
                                              
 
										women were almost 5 times more 
										likely to achieve vaginal orgasm
                                                      
										when the man had an 
										uncircumcised penis.
                                            and they were more
                                                    
										likely to achieve multiple
                                            vaginal orgasms as well.  

                                          



   
                                      







 

uncircumcised 
												men usually lasted 
												longer. 
 












 
  conversely,  
												premature ejaculation 
												was significantly more 
												common 
                                                      among 
												circumcised
                                                      men. 
												 and, contrary to 
												expectation, even if 
												the 
                                                      circumcised man 
												could prolong 
												intercourse, after 8 -10 
												minutes
                                                      of thrusting, 
												women started wishing 
												"to just get it over 
												with."
 





















    


 
                                                          surveyed women 
													preferred sex with a 
													natural penis by a 
													margin of 
   9 to 1  — not 
													2 to 1, or 3 to 1, 
													but  
 9 to 
													1.

 
 
















 
 






why would this 
							be?  what 
							is it about the 
							uncircumcised penis that makes it the superior 
							instrument for lovemaking, bringing
                                
women 
							fulfilling sexual ecstasy and 
allowing them to 
							achieve orgasm with greater frequency?
  the 
							answers—detailed 
							in sanii—will 
							astound you!  
 but for now. . . 









 please 
												allow me to speak, from 
												a woman's point of view, 
												those words which you 
												will undoubtedly come to 
												say for yourself, once 
												you've experienced  lovemaking the way nature 
												meant it to be.  as 
												a woman:


  
                                                 


 




												you deserve to discover 
												your 
                                                          true sexuality
                                                      with a man who has
                                                      a whole, fully 
												functioning penis.

 


  
                                                 












 
 you deserve  
 to experience the tenderness 
												of "real  
												"
                                                      intercourse 
 with your vagina relaxed, moist, and totally 
												surrendered
 —expecting only joy.
 


  
                                                 












 


you deserve to 
												know
                                                        the smooth, 
												sensuous, gliding 
												thrusting

                                                      that only a 
												natural penis, with 
												it's moveable 
												foreskin, can give you.

 







   







 


you deserve to 
												thrill to the ecstatic, 
												grinding, 
												massaging rhythm
                                                      of natural 
												thrusting, which places 
												an almost constant, 
												gentle pressuring on 
												your clitoris.

 







   







 
 you deserve 
												to know how it feels to 
												be perfectly and 
                                                        seamlessly 
												connected with your 
												partner, in a mutual 
												union
                                                        of pleasuring.
 







   







 
  you 
 deserve to experience nirvana and the 
												entire range of 

												delicious lovemaking
                                                    sensations nature 
												intended for you.
 







   







 
 
												you deserve to have 
												real orgasms
                                                    instead of faking 
												them. 
 







   







 
  with no 
												holding back, lost in 
												voluptuous abandon, you 

												totally want 
												it, you 
												totally need 
												it, and 
												you
                                                       
												totally
                                                        love it.
 







   







 

 instead of what you are now 
												getting from circumcised 
												intercourse,
 







   







 
 
												an abnormally hardened 
												penis head and shaft 
												that

"feels 
												like you're being poked 
												with a broomstick" 
 







   







 
 

												abrasive, 
												elongated thrusting that 
												pumps lubrication out of 
                                                    your vagina faster 
												than you can make it
                                                  
 







   







 
 

												chafing irritation, 
												friction burn, soreness, 
												discomfort (even pain)
 







   







 
 
                                                    frustrating sex,
                                                    constantly 
												feeling "out of sync"
                                                    with your partner
 







   







 
 
                                                    rough, tough, even
pounding,
                                                        bang-away
                                                      thrusting
 







   







 
 
												and when 
												it's over, you 
												think, "thank god he
                                                    
												finally
                                                    came!"
 







   



                                            caused by the circumcised

													i've always felt 
													that the male 
													foreskin 
                                                          is there for a 
													reason.  until 
													recently, i didn't 
													know exactly what 
													that reason was.  
													but now, thanks to 
													kristen o'hara's 
													well-researched 
													book, i finally 
													understand the 
													reasons for the 
													design of the penis 
													and foreskin, and 
													how 
                                                          this design 
													ensures optimal 
													penile function, 
													including the intact 
													organ's ability to 
													satisfy the female 
													sexually.

													after reading many 
													books on 
													circumcision, if i 
													could recommend only 
													one,. . .this would

                                                        [it] completely

													why you should try

													foreskin and why 
													infant circumcision 
													should never happen

													many have hitherto 
													assumed that the 
													male foreskin is an 
													extraneous flap of 
													skin that serves no 
													physical or sexual 
													purpose. . .this is 
													the first 
													publication to go 
													into depth about the 
													sexual toll that 
													comes with slicing 
													off foreskins.





													reviewer: linda from 
													ca




 the 
													truth is finally 
													here. . . for women 
													like me, in a 
													wonderful marriage 
													for 20 yrs. and 
													having had great 
													circumcised sex for 
													the first 12, (with 
													only slight 
													discomfort), this 
													book finally put 
													into words the logic 
													and reasons for my 
													lack of interest, 
													and sometimes 
													distress, about sex.

                                                        every woman 
													should read this 
													book. . . it makes 
													so much sense to me 
													now, as i always 
													assumed my lack of 
													desire was all my 
													problem.  a lot 
													of wives out there 
													have sex for their 
													husband's sake, and 
													i'm sure they wonder 
													why they don't "feel 
													like it" anymore.

                                                        i am so sorry 
													that my husband and 
													i have been robbed 
													of our ability for 
													fulfilling, natural 
													sex.  i highly 
													recommend this book.
