about
suicidal tendencies was formed in venice, california, during the early '80s. founded by lead singer mike muir, younger brother of original z-boy and dogtown skateboard founder jim muir, st merged the essence of skating, surfing and the dogtown area, with a new style of hardcore that brought a new crowd to punk and metal shows. wearing the distinctive look with flipped up hats, hand drawn shirts and bandanas, st quickly gained a notorious reputation and were banned from playing in l.a.this wouldn't stop st. blending punk and metal, leading to cross over, called skate punk and thrash, suicidal has simultaneously merged and broke musical boundaries. the aggressive music and full on attitude naturally made them a favorite of the extreme sports crowd.since the first release in 1983, the band has constantly evolved, and now has several gold records and grammy nominations, was inducted into the skateboard hall of fame and had some of the biggest names in music, from robert trujillo, thundercat, josh freese, brooks wackerman, etc.now 40 years after the release of the first self titled album, st is mike muir, ben weinman (dillinger escape plan), dean pleasants, tye trujillo (robert's son) and newest member jay weinberg on drums, still bringing the energy and aggression like it's 1983 all over.
