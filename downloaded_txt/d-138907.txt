hammock tips
when it comes to hammock, we've been there, done that, now serving 202 tips in 16 categories ranging from camping hammocks to rope hammocks.











											what can i do about a sagging rope hammock?
									 	

my rope hammock is sagging!
rope hammocks will tend to sag as they wear over time. this does not mean you must endure a hammock that sags too much--simply adjust the hanging height and length to bring some firmness back into the rope hammock. you may also notice some "fraying" in some kinds of rope hammocks made with natural fiber. in many cases this is normal and does not mean that the ropes are about to give way. the fraying effect is sometimes known as tasselling and does not affect the strength of the rope. if your rope hammock seems brittle or weak, it may be time to replace it, but the tasselling effect all by itself is nothing to worry about.

											is my hanging equipment weatherproof?
									 	

hanging equipment, part two
if you plan on leaving your rope hammock outdoors, be sure your hanging equipment is able to withstand the conditions where you live. if you live near the ocean, in an area with frequent rains or other considerations, you'll want your hanging equipment to be galvanized steel or other material labeled specifically as 'weather resistant'. untreated wood, metal and rope are particularly vulnerable to ocean salt and heavy weather. know you are purchasing a rope hammock that can stand up to the conditions in which it will be hanging.

											do i need to buy hanging hardware separately?
									 	

rope hammock hanging hardware
many websites advertise rope hammocks that come "complete with hanging hardware." try not to buy rope hammocks from vendors who want to charge you separately for hanging hardware. this hardware should come as standard equipment with the hammock. companies that offer hanging hardware as an optional item may be trying to cater to hammock lovers who already have the equipment; if you are a first-time hammock buyer, check the fine print and order a model that comes with everything you will need for your first rope hammock experience.

											are all rope hammock spreader bars weatherproof?
									 	

rope hammocks and spreader bars
spreader bars are the lengths of wood that hold the rope hammock 'open'. sometimes the spreader bars are an overlooked part of the evaluation of a hammock for purchase. are you planning on using your rope hammocks near the water? what kind of varnish does your rope hammock spreader bars have? some rope hammocks are designed specifically with near-the-water use in mind, and are given multiple coats of marine-quality varnish to protect the wood from salt, weather damage and uv exposure from the sun. take a moment to check the specs of your rope hammock's spreader bars to see just how weatherproofed they are!

											should i invest in an olefin hammock for my boat?
									 	

the olefin rope hammock
some people want the feel of a rope hammock, with the durability and strength of a synthetic fiber. olefin rope hammocks are synthetic rope hammocks that are water repellent, resistant to salt and sweat wear, and uv damage. olefin rope dries quickly and can be left outdoors when not in use. best of all, these rope hammocks are much more resistant to mold and mildew. if you want to install a rope hammock onboard a boat or a ship, give serious thought to an olefin rope hammock. the durability and longevity of these models is much better compared to ordinary rope or hemp when used on the water.

											what is a three-point rope hammock?
									 	

what is a three-point rope hammock?
a three-point rope hammock is one that has a single large connection at one end, and two smaller connections at the other end. this is to provide greater stability for entering and exiting the hammock. this design is excellent for kids and hammocks purchased for multiple occupants. getting in and out of the three-point rope hammock is simple and stable. this is a great gift for someone who would like to try a rope hammock but is unsure about the stability of the more traditional models.
