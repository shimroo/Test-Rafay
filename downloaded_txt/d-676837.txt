attendance
there are 180 school days in a calendar year. it is now more than ever to ensure that your child is at school on time, for the entire duration for school. our students learn so much in one day and unfortunately, we are still closing our achievement gap that was created from covid. 
please view the attached graphic with information about how important good attendance is for your student. contact our school social worker, mrs. martin, if you have any questions or concerns regarding your student's attendance! we would love to help any way we can in helping your student be successful at school!
180 day attendance
