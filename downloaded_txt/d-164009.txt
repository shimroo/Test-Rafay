 well, i knew you were
coming, so i got
all dressed up. :) 
please
note -

- most the pictures for these
pages are
loaded first as thumbnails to help speed things along. just click the
picture for a larger view where available. 
- these pages aren't under
heavy
construction, and never will be. 
-
almost all the texts
in these pages are my own effort, so if you want to reproduce any of it
please ask first for permission!
i've got no problem with you copying any of this for your own use, but
all it takes is an email to let me know if you want to reproduce any of
it. 
**
a disclaimer
- with just about
everything you'll find here, as far as i know all the information and
files are harmless and are also legally on my page. if the files are
not
able to be legally downloaded from here, please let me know so i can
fix
the problem asap. a fair few of the pictures i use are from a few
magazines, and although i should not be copying and using them in this
manner, i am trying to bring knowledge to anyone and everyone as best i
can, so please don't sue - just ask and i shall remove if it's a
problem! 
all of
the files i have for
download here work just fine on my computer, so the chances are if you
have a problem that it's at your end. all of the information pertaining
to modifying engine, etc, has worked for me in the past so they do
work.
just ask if you need more information as to how to make these mods work.
