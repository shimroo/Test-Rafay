what our customers are saying 












i attended the adult camps this summer in both parksville and westshore (langford).  i had an absolutely great time and i learned a lot.  i think at 60 years old i might have been the oldest player on the ice but the coaches, other goalies and shooters made me feel welcome and put me at ease.


doyle childs














my son loves gold in the net. he fits in, he thrives being challenged, enjoys learning from the coaches, forges bonds to further his passion as a goalie and inspire him. the ratio is exactly what a goalie needs in the learning experience. when parents have questions or want to learn more, we get awesome, thorough responses.


hunterann booth














by far the very best thing that we have done for mackenzie with for her goal tending!! she had started attending the camp when she was at the novice level of hockey - she is currently playing the midget aaa level in alberta - she has been with the southeast tigers for the past 4 years the first two years as an affiliate player - without all of the training received from the gold in the net program.
