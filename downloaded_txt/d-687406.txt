   university archives, a unit in the l. tom perry special collections, is in the process of reviewing all archived material to ensure collections do not contain personal information that cannot be shared. this review only impacts university archives materials. the archives can still accommodate research requests, but at least 30 days' notice is appreciated. more time may be needed for larger requests. please submit requests through the aeon system (https://byu.aeon.atlas-sys.com/logon).
					
  materials may be requested prior to your visit. register and request materials here.

we are also happy to help you with your reference questions online. you can reach us by email at specialcollections@byu.edu or on the library website chat.
