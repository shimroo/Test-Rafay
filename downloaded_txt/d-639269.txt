welcome to

al-sharif arabians


we are an arabian horse breeding farm located in north east, maryland.  
we concentrate on the highest quality proven bloodlines to produce beautiful 
arabians with athletic ability.  we are very proud of our black arabians and are 
thrilled with our gorgeous homozygous black stallion who was named the 2006 
east coast champion stallion!

we invite you to learn more about our horses by clicking on the links to see 
additional information including pictures and extended pedigrees on our stallion,

for over 25 years, we were blessed to share our lives with the amazing arabian breed.  there is nothing more 
satisfying than to selectively breed for certain traits and to see your dream come true in the foals 
that are born over the years.   we feel priviledged to have shared our lives with so many horses and are proud of their 
accomplishments, whether it be in the show ring, the endurance field, or beloved family members who just enjoy trail 
riding (our favorite way to bond with our horses).

we are no longer actively breeding our horses.  we have retained several of our favorites and plan to love and enjoy them for 
the rest of their lives.

we will be maintaining the website because there is wonderful history of our horses on the site (pictures and pedigrees).  
any foal owners are welcome to send us updates on your horses and we will update your horse's webpage with the information.  we 
love to get updates from owners!
