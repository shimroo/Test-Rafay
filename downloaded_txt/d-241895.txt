 loved it - great drinks and fun vibe really fun vibe, drinks were great and very on theme, dj was playing a variety of stuff for everyone to dance to. service was a little slow but they were busy and it was a friday night, so didn't really effect our groups opinion. if you have some impatient people in your party, probably head to the bar area vs sitting at one of the lounge tables.

 10/10 recommend this place is a perfect little date night right on the marina. the food and drinks are some of the best we have ever had and kit just made the experience that much better!  highly recommend the empanadas, painkiller and the eye of kanaloa.

 best craft cocktails in cwb no doubt the best spot in cwb for a relaxed atmosphere, craft cocktails, and plenty of tiki history to share. kit has mastered the art of crafting delicious rum mixes while telling the background stories of the drinks and the culture. great views and vibes to be had, don’t underestimate what a place like this can pack… it’s a rose to be enjoyed.

 excellent tiki cocktails and ambience at bar tiki! the authentic tiki cocktails are excellent and the staff is welcoming, friendly, and attentive. we came in for just one drink but stayed for 3+ hours because it was such an enjoyable experience. the views of the marina are beautiful and the decor here is tropical with tiki flair.   special thanks to angie, misty, and devon for a fabulous experience with awesome cocktails!

				my husband and i stopped by for drinks and sunset on cinco de mayo! they offered the largest portion of nachos i've seen. as well as the prettiest drinks ever , but wait not only were they pretty they taste better than they look and you only need 2 maybe 3 ! hahaha  a time was had chit chatting with kit , brett , and devon (bartenders). so much fun picking out your drinks and perfect spot to people watch too. definitely coming back soon and planning a girls day! picture opportunities for the girlies too !!!! see you here.
