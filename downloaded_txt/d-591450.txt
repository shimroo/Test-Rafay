great day yesterday with ali and jared. did the kayak at sparks lake in the afternoon and went over to paulina lake for the canoe in the evening. absolutely fantastic experiences. ali was super knowledgeable about the area, formations, and overall history of the region. made my first trip to oregon a memorable one!- aaron p -
























had the good fortune to have austin as our guide on both the nighttime snowshoe trip around mount bachelor and the afternoon cave exploration at boyd's cave the next day. austin was a lot of fun and very knowledgeable, and did well to tailor the experience to the members of the tour, especially in our second trip as it was just our party. the winter options were a lot of fun, and hoping to check it out when there's more options available in the summer!- spencer c -
























beautiful starlight canoe tour with an exceptional guide, jeannie, who was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic! she was very encouraging and helpful, no worries if you’re not skilled in canoeing. told us all about the geology of sparks lake and the geological history of the area. pointing out planets and stars that were visible on slightly cloudy night but still very beautiful, peaceful atmosphere. local beers, hot chocolate and local bakery snacks were also a nice treat provided. jeannie clearly cares about this area’s breathtaking nature and had plenty of great recommendations for outdoor experiences around bend. highly recommend the experience!- lori u -
























my team and i did the bonfire snowshoeing tour and it was incredible!! i can't say enough good things about it. jared was our guide and he had so much knowledge of the area with lots of interesting stories to tell. the experience itself walking through mt. bachelor at night was amazing but jared made it even more fun and interesting for us. i can't wait to come back to bend and participate in another wanderlust tour!- shelby b -
























kimberly guided me and my three kids on a great tour of a nearby lava tube. my daughter particularly appreciated that this tour was woman-led. kimberly had great knowledge of the cave and its formation to share with our grade school age kids. the cave is about twenty minutes outside of bend. total time underground was around two hours. safety equipment was provided by the tour company. highly recommended half-day trip.- bradley s -
























had a fantastic time with austin during our cave tour. very knowledgeable and friendly. definitely recommend and will use the company again next time i’m around here.- david y -
























charlie was an excellent guide. there were 3 kayaks. the other two went much, much faster than us. charlie was able to handle it all with patience and courtesy. he was just great. the tour was beautiful.
























our kayaking tour with chris was amazing! he was very personable and engaging. he gave just the right amount of information when needed and also afforded us quiet moments to take in the scenery. the experience with wanderlust tour was great from the moment we walked in and were greeted with smiles to when we left with "thank you's" and waves. i highly recommend this tour if you're in bend. best part of the day was seeing two bald eagles!- temetra w -
























fantastic cave tour by austin!- christopher y -
























kayak tour on hosmer lake with chris this morning. what a blast! learned a lot about the area and had a wonderful paddle on a beautiful lake.- teri h -
























i’ve been on a few kayak tours and this one was my favorite ever! colton was the most awesome kayak guide, he kept the group entertained and was extremely informative about the nature and landscape. good driver too! we will absolutely do another tour with this company on our next visit, hopefully we can get him as a guide again!- sierra r -
























we had a ceo retreat in bend and hired wanderlust tours to provide a "brews and canoes" event and dinner on elk lake. they did a fantastic job for us, we were most impressed by erika our guide! we were all very impressed by the entire event and erika's passion and interest in the event. thank you!- luke f -
























we did the brews and canoes tour with colton and had the best time! somehow, no one else booked this tour so it was basically a private tour! colton told us some fun facts about bend, the cascade lakes and beers. you could tell how much he loved bend and all of the area, he treated us like friends instead of tourists and made the tour so informative and fun!- corinne c -
























the tours are incredible and the guides are full of such positive energy. james is a very upbeat guy and katie really knows her geology. i would so take a tour with wanderlust again.- mitchell s -
