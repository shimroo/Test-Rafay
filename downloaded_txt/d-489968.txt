                  we're all prisoners of habit
                

                  matthew always follows too closely when driving; john has a
                  very flat golf swing which affects contact with the ball; brad
                  has converted to a different aircraft but mentally he's still
                  flying his old one; paul underwent retraining but still risks
                  injury every time he lifts a load incorrectly; mary always
                  writes 'accomadation'; tony has difficulty adapting to a new
                  gait prescribed by his physiotherapist; jeff, a promising
                  young pianist, always tenses up before a difficult passage;
                  mara, an olympic javelin thrower has difficulty adapting to a
                  new javelin.
                



                  the solution:
                  old way new way


                  inspirational case studies like these reveal how
                  old way new way, a new higher order learning strategy,
                  can reprogram your brain and empower you to unlearn old,
                  unsafe or inefficient ways of thinking and performing. when
                  practice doesn't make perfect, take back control, break those
                  chains of habit and achieve your personal best with
                  old way new way.

              the evidence
            

              proof of concept
            

              âthe problem is not learning the new; it's unlearning the old.â
            






                    in the world of skill development, skills coaching, mental
                    skills training, and practice drills are the typical
                    treatments for overcoming habit pattern errors. fortunately,
                    quality coaching, training and mental skills clearly improve
                    technique and individuals can perform in the correct way
                    while working with their coach, trainer or sport
                    psychologist. however, the next day when they have to
                    perform independently or when placed under the stress of
                    competition, they seem to have forgotten what they have
                    learned and the same old entrenched misunderstandings, bad
                    habits and technique faults resurface. even where the
                    individual improves, the improvement is often only temporary
                    or takes a long time to appear.
                  

                    what coaches and trainers strive to achieve is that the
                    improved knowledge and skills that were learned during
                    training and reinforced by practice will quickly transfer to
                    the real world. unfortunately, this rarely occurs, or it
                    occurs only slowly, so we have a âtransfer of training
                    problem.â
                  

                    frequently encountered in sports coaching, the training
                    transfer problem is not restricted to sport. as our case
                    studies show, poor transfer is an obstacle to learning
                    wherever automated skill, knowledge, or behavioural routines
                    are involved, e.g., the learning of mathematics, science,
                    and spelling; athletic and sports performance; artistic
                    performance; driving a motor vehicle; working with
                    computers; speech therapy; overuse and sports injuries;
                    postural problems; foreign language learning; and in
                    management training and organisational change. the key
                    element in all these situations is that the person faces
                    having to change their existing knowledge and skills.
                  

                    having to change one's own ways in the face of new and
                    conflicting knowledge is the root cause of the problem. as
                    an old coach once said, âthe problem is not learning the
                    new; it's unlearning the old.â
                  

                    consistent, habitual errors show the presence, rather than
                    the absence, of learning. here, what the person knows is how
                    to do it incorrectly. what matters then is not what the
                    person does not know, but what he or she already knows. the
                    first task is to help the person âunlearnâ the incorrect
                    information or skill, rather than persist with getting them
                    to practice the ârightâ way, over and over.
                  

                    when new information or ideas imparted during coaching
                    disagree or conflict with what the person already knows,
                    this conflict generates habit pattern interference with
                    learning. this interference causes âaccelerated forgettingâ
                    (underwood, 1966) of the new knowledge or skill and within
                    minutes or hours, the player forgets what he or she has
                    learned. this accelerated rate of forgetting is much faster
                    than normal forgetting, which normally takes weeks, months
                    or sometimes years. habit pattern interference does not
                    prevent learning from occurring, it merely prevents the
                    association of conflicting ideas (underwood, 1966). if there
                    is no conflict between the new and the old, then there is no
                    interference and no barrier to learning. however, a person's
                    mind is seldom a blank slate and the potential for conflict
                    between old and new knowledge is usually high.
                  

                    habit pattern interference does not distinguish between what
                    is ârightâ and what is âwrongâ. it protects all prior
                    knowledge and skills from change. it preserves incorrect or
                    unsafe habits just as strongly as it protects correct skills
                    and knowledge. this underscores the importance of getting it
                    right the first time. performance becomes cue-dependent, and
                    the player falls back to old incorrect ways when the coach's
                    or trainer's presence is withdrawn, inhibiting transfer of
                    learning (postman & gray, 1977). this ensures that the
                    faulty knowledge and skills continue to resist correction.
                  

                    unfortunately, although conventional coaching, training and
                    education is very useful when teaching a person new skills,
                    these methods are far less effective in eradicating
                    established performance errors. clearly, we need a better
                    wayâold way new way.

                  chapter 2 history of an innovation
                


                    history of an innovation reveals the birth, development and
                    achievements of old way new way over time.
                  


                  chapter 3 old way new way unboxed
                


                    old way new way unboxed explains the theoretical foundation
                    of old way new way, underpinning research, and uses and
                    limitations of the method.
                  


                  chapter 4 delivery modes
                


                    delivery modes offers flexible implementation which is an
                    important feature of old way new way. equally effective
                    approaches include direct face-to-face instruction and
                    intervention; instruction in the procedure via email, by
                    telephone and online, all with no significant loss of
                    effectiveness. individuals can also self-administer, i.e.,
                    follow the protocol to correct their own performance
                    problems, without the coach or trainer being present.
                    however, self-administration should not be undertaken
                    without expert advice.
                  


                  chapter 5 integrating old way new way
                


                    integrating old way new way explains how to make old way new
                    way a part of your coaching, training or professional
                    toolkit. the old way new way protocol offers an entirely new
                    model for performance improvement. however, old coaching,
                    training and teaching habits die hard and intending
                    facilitators often find it extremely difficult to change
                    their own established ways of coaching and training.
                    guidelines are offered.
                  


                  chapter 6 old way new way protocol
                


                    a step-by-step demonstration of how to apply the generic old
                    way new way protocol to an athlete's technique problem. the
                    protocol can be easily adapted to deal with any kind of
                    performance problem.

                    we don't want the book to be a scholarly tome. after all, it
                    is a handbook for coaches, athletes, players, sport
                    psychologists, educators and therapists. however, there is a
                    lot of underpinning published research for this change
                    management method that provides credibility, as shown in the
                    bibliography.

                  tapio korjus, olympic gold medalist & coach. president of the
                  board, association of sport performance centres.
                


                    "overcoming performance roadblocks takes skill development
                    into an entirely new world of rapid improvement. my coaching
                    experience proves that, despite quality coaching and highly
                    motivated athletes, technique difficulties resist correction
                    after months and, in some cases, years of effort. old
                    entrenched technique habits die hard. this made our elite
                    athletes at the finish institute of high performance sport
                    (kihu) uncompetitive and prone to injury. i needed a better
                    way, so i tried old way new way, an award-winning coaching
                    science method.
                  

                    "improvement came immediately, after one session, and
                    without the customary adaptation period. equally impressive,
                    the observed technique improvement during training
                    transferred fully and permanently to competition. without
                    old way/new way i believe it would have required up to 2000
                    repetitions or four years of practicing the correct
                    technique before the performance would have improved. my
                    elite athletes said they felt empowered by old way new way,
                    they became more self-confident and encouraged by the degree
                    and speed of improvement, were more motivated and wanted to
                    engage in more high quality training like this.
                  

                    "i see old way new way as a practical coaching tool that is
                    readily incorporated into what we as coaches normally do.
                    mind you, old way new way is not just a "quick fix"; it is
                    an "intelligent" fix because it is based on how the brain
                    learns. my sport psychology colleagues report that old way
                    new way also makes traditional sports psychology
                    interventions like mental skills training more effective,
                    because athletes learn these new skills faster.
                  

                    "the inspirational case studies and step-by-step
                    instructions in this book reveal the fascinating
                    underpinnings of this unique self-help method and make it
                    available to all coaches, athletes, sport psychologists,
                    trainers, therepists, educators and individuals in every
                    walk of life."

                    "i have been using old way new way for rapid correction of
                    consistent errors in technique with finnish elite and
                    olympic athletes and coaches, with a pro-tour female golfer
                    and also with a soccer team. the method is very practical
                    and all eight interventions were completely successful. i
                    quickly managed to completely solve the technical problem in
                    just one single session. results are immediate and there is
                    no adaptation period with poor transfer of improvement to
                    competitions, as experienced with conventional skill
                    correction. a single learning trial lasting from one to two
                    hours, including an half hour warm up, usually results in
                    80% or better improvement in performance. the new way
                    (corrected skill) is consistently performed and spontaneous
                    recovery of errors, if any, is easily handled. most
                    importantly, the observed technique improvement is permanent
                    and skill improvement directly transfers to performance in
                    competitions, as shown in our case studies."

                      "this method, which was developed by a south australian
                      and is now being picked up by coaches around the world,
                      corrects bad habits in technique in a matter of hours
                      rather than months."

                          "for the first time ever, this methodology offers
                          practitioners a non-behavioural, user-friendly and
                          cost-effective means of getting directly involved in
                          physical skill development and correction. this is
                          completely different from what is currently known
                          about psychological skills training."
