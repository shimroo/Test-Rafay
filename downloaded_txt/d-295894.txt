il: foid card requirement found to be unconstitutional for third time





an illinois circuit court in white county has found portions of the illinois firearms owner id law to be unconstitutional under the second amendment, for the third time. from wmay.com february 10, 2025:a white county illinois judge has found the state’s firearms owner’s id card unconstitutional when enforced against someone possessing their firearms in their home.the case illinois vs. vivian brown stems from a 2017 case where police found a rifle in her home and charged her with possessing a firearm without a foid card.this is the third time an illinois white county circuit court has found the requirement to have an foid card, merely to possess a firearm in their home, to be unconstitutional. the same judge, t. scott webb, has heard the case all three times.  from the 2025 decision at saf.org:conversely, since the inception of this case, both parties have agreed that the defendant was and is eligible to receive a foid card and, as such, is a law abiding, responsible citizen. only now does the state seek to re-define the defendant as a criminal and strip her of her second amendment rights. despite the state's novel "law-abiding" argument, this court has determined that the defendant is a responsible, law-abiding citizen deserving of the protections guaranteed under the second amendment. accordingly, the defendant's possession of a .22 caliber rifle withing the confines of her home, even without a valid foid card falls squarely within the protections afforded her by the second amendment. the illinois supreme court has been unwilling to make a decision in the case.in a 2018 decision, the foid card was found to be unconstitutional in the case. from illinois vs brown:10. in this case, the facts show the defendant possessed a gun, in her house, for the purpose of self-defense without a foid card. to require the defendant to fill out a form, provide a picture id and pay a $10 fee to obtain a foid card before she can exercise her constitutional right to self-defense with a firearm is a violation of the second amendment to the united states constitution as applied to the states and a violation of article i, section 22, of the constitution of the state of illinois, as applied to this case only.the illinois supreme court sent the case back to the circuit court. the requirement for an foid card to possess a firearm in the home was found to be unconstitutional a second time. from 2021 on ammoland, foid card found unconstitutional:judge t. scott webb, of white county, illinois, found the requirement to obtain a (foid) before owning a firearm in illinois, to be unconstitutional. from the decision, case 17-cm-60, 26 april 2021:in 2022 the illinois supreme court refused to rule on the issue again, and again sent the case back to the circuit court in white county.in a split 4 to 3 decision, the illinois supreme court has refused to rule on the constitutionality of the firearms owner’s identification card (foid) requirements in illinois. this is the second time the court has refused to rule on the same case. the dissent in the june 16, 2022 decision stated:justice michael j. burke, dissenting:the last time this case was before the court, justices karmeier and theis referred to this court’s remand as an “unexpected and pointless exercise” and a “meaningless and wasteful act.” people v. brown, 2020 il 124100, ¶¶ 39, 59 (karmeier, j., dissenting, joined by theis, j.) (brown i). i cannot think of a better description for the remand that the court issues today.perhaps the third time, the illinois supreme court will be willing to do their job and consider the merits of the case. ©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

tx: harris county robbery suspect shot, killed in self defense





once harris county sheriff's office homicide detectives and crime 
investigators arrived, the scene was processed, witnesses were 
interviewed, and the security camera recordings were observed that 
recorded the entire incident. after watching the video and interviewing 
the shooter, detectives determined the shooter had arrived in his 
vehicle and was immediately approached in an aggressive manner by the 
complainant once he had exited his vehicle. video showed the shooter 
restrain himself and back away from the complainant all throughout the 
gas station parking lot. after getting his property taken from him, such
 as his wallet, he removed his handgun from his waistband and pointed it
 at the complainant. this did not deter the complainant, and when he 
approached the shooter again, he fired his weapon, striking the 
complainant. he immediately called 911 and put his weapon in his 
vehicle. more here

 at stone and whitmer streets; as they were on the scene, a 22-year-old

wi: ag sued over denial of second amendment rights





the kenosha county eye has noted a lawsuit filed by  milwaukee man kenneth karwacki in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin, milwaukee division. the lawsuit is against josh kaul, the attorney general of wisconsin for denial of civil rights, 28 u.s.c.§§ 1331 and 1343.  the office of the ag  refused to issue a permit to conceal carry a concealed weapon because of a misdemeanor conviction of karwacki for the delivery of peyote while in the u.s. military.records published online show a united states air force criminal court of appeals convicted airman first class kenneth j. karwacki on 11 december, 2015 by a special court martial in dyess air force base, texas. it is not completely certain this is the same kenneth karwacki.the judge assigned in the case is brett h ludwick. wisconsin is in the court of appeals for the seventh circuit. he was nominated by president trump and confirmed by a vote of 91-5 in the senate, in september of 2020.the issue in the case is fairly clear: does the state of wisconsin have the authority to restrict the right to keep and bear arms, under the second amendment, for a misdemeanor under federal law, which, they claim, would be a felony under wisconsin law?  in particular, is a non-violent misdemeanor under federal law sufficient to deny a fundamental, enumerated right, such as the second amendment from a citizen of the united states? the wisconsin ag claims the delivery of peyote is a "violent" crime.the ag office claims that the plaintiff, kenneth karwacki, is not considered a member of the "people" under the second amendment. to this correspondent, this is a very weak argument. the supreme court in the rahimi case, still considered rahimi to be "one of the people" covered by the second amendment. from the opinion in rahimi, page 1:held: when an individual has been found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another, that individual may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the second amendment. pp. 5–17.it is highly unlikely a federal court will find a united states citizen, without any violent conviction, is not one of "the people" covered by the second amendment.the ag office claims the states have the power to decide whether any conduct anywhere else is a felony or not.  kenneth karwacki was not convicted of a federal felony.the essential argument is the state of wisconsin can define who may exercise rights protected by the second amendment.  this claim seems unlikely to stand. it would give every state the power to decide who, within its jurisdiction, may exercise rights enumerated in the bill of rights, and who may not.  this appears to be directly contradictory to the fourteenth amendment. the second amendment has already been incorporated to the states via the fourteenth amendment, by the mcdonald decision.analysis: the strong indication from the supreme court is the second amendment may not be infringed for non-violent behavior, especially for non-violent misdemeanors. calling a delivery of peyote case a "violent crime" does not make it a violent crime.  no historical evidence or analysis was included in the ag brief to show delivery of a drug was ever a reason to infringe on a person's second amendment rights. instead, they claim because some other crimes were dealt with harshly in colonial times, any crime today can be determined by any state to be sufficient to invalidate any constitutional right. this is an absurd proposal. ©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

wy: repeal of gun free zones passes house 50-10





   in the wyoming legislature, house bill 172 has passed the house, 50-10, on january 23, 2025. the bill eliminates most gun free zones and strengthens the wyoming preemption bill for firearms. the bill would allow limited regulation by government entities of government employees ability to carry in government buildings and schools. here are some relevant sections:  from the wyoleg.gov:section 1 w.s. 6-8-105 is created to read:6-8-105. exceptions for state issued concealed carry permits; penalty. (a)this section shall be known as and may be cited as the "wyoming repeal gun free zones act." (b) persons lawfully carrying concealed weapons in wyoming under w.s. 6‑8-104(a)(ii) through (iv) may carry a concealed weapon in the following places: (i) any meeting of a governmental entity;(ii) any meeting of the legislature or a committee thereof;(iii) any public building not otherwise prohibited under w.s. 6-8-104(t) or regulated under this section.(c) persons lawfully carrying concealed weapons in wyoming with a permit issued under w.s. 6-8-104(a)(ii) may carry a concealed weapon in the following places: (i) any public school, public college or university athletic event taking place on public property that does not sell alcoholic beverages;(ii) any public elementary or secondary school facility;(iii) any public college or university facility.the bill explains how a local board of trustees in a school district may adopt rules for employees to carry concealed weapons in schools.the bill also strengthens the wyoming preemption law.  the bill specifically limits the making of rules and legislation, as listed:the sale, transfer, purchase, delivery, taxation, manufacture, ownership, transportation, storage, use and possession of firearms, weapons and ammunition shall be authorized, regulated and prohibited by the state, and regulation thereof is preempted by the legislature of the state of wyoming.some regulations, such as zoning ordinances, are allowed if they apply to all businesses along with firearms businesses.wyofile.com explains this is the tenth time in twelve years this or a similar bill has been introduced into the legislature. in 2024 the bill was vetoed by governor (r) mark gordon.analysis:the creation of mandated gun free zones is based on a dubious assertion: guns cause problems. more guns cause more problems.  this assertion is not correct. the opposite is true in many circumstances. guns are necessary to protect the nation from invasion. guns are necessary for police to enforce the law. guns in the hands of private individuals are often used to stop crime.those who push for a disarmed population assert a more limited thesis: guns in the hands of anyone outside government is bad. this assertion is also false. guns in government hands can be used for evil purposes. people are still people, whether they are a government employee or a private citizen. guns in the hands of citizens have been used to stop criminals, foreign enemies, and to deter and stop bad actors in our own government.the data shows people who have concealed carry permits are more law abiding than police. people who can legally carry guns have stopped numerous mass murders and attempts of mass murder. banning those people from carrying guns in some places prevents society from benefiting from their ability to stop crimes in those areas.laws which create gun free zones are an invitation for murderers to commit horrendous crimes in places where no armed resistance exists. eliminating these zones is a positive good. ©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

tsa found 6,678 un-authorized firearms from 904 million passengers in 2024





during the year 2024, the transportation security agency (tsa) discovered 6,678 firearms in the baggage of 904 million people who were screened at tsa checkpoints in the calendar year. this was slightly lower than the 6,737 firearms discovered in 2023 when 858 million people were screened.the rate of people who were found to possess firearms at the airport security checkpoints was down from .0000785% to .0000739%, a minor reduction in the tiny percentage of firearms discovered at airport security checkpoints.  the reduction amounts to 59 fewer firearms discovered, a bit less than 1% of the total.given the hundreds of millions of passengers screened, and the tens of millions of passengers who may legally carry concealed weapons, the few thousand found show overwhelming obedience to the law and care in people checking their baggage.all people make mistakes. in the usa about 21 million people legally carry concealed weapons with concealed carry permits. 47 million people live in states where no permit is required to carry a concealed weapon.  those state are:alabama, alaska, arizona, arkansas, florida (permitless), georgia, idaho, indiana, iowa, kansas, kentucky, louisiana, maine, mississippi, missouri, montana, nebraska, new hampshire, north dakota, ohio, oklahoma, south carolina, south dakota, tennessee, texas, utah, vermont, west virginia, and wyoming.a survey conducted in 2023 found 15.6% of voters in general elections carried concealed handguns.about 155 million people voted in the 2024 election. if the survey was correct, there would be about 24 million voters in the united states who carry concealed handguns on a regular basis. that is about 7.3% of the total population. if we assume the percent of legal concealed carriers is the same among the population of passengers screened at airport check points, the number of screenings of legal concealed handgun carriers would be 7.3% of 904 million. 7.3% of 904 million amounts to 66 million passengers who legally carry concealed handguns who were screened in 2024.to clarify, there were 904 million screenings at tsa checkpoints. the 904 million number is the number of passengers who were screened. one person could be screened multiple times as they were a passenger on different flights throughout the year. it appears 66 million of those screenings were of passengers who routinely, legally, carry concealed handguns.most people who are discovered to have a firearm in their carry-on luggage violated the law without intending to do so. if 100% of the incidents occurred without the intent to do so, then 6,678 out of 66 million passengers who normally concealed carry,  made serious and terribly inconveniencing mistakes when getting ready to fly. it amounts to .01% or about one of every ten thousand such people.everyone makes mistakes. mistakes are not intentional. they are often the result of the of an combination of events, which resulted in an unfortunate, unwanted, and unexpected situation.here is a hypothetical example:a husband normally carries a small semi-auto in a small pocket of a travel bag/briefcase. he is getting ready for a trip. in his home office, he removes the pistol and sets it on his desk. at that critical moment, his young daughter appears in his doorway and excitedly exclaims: brandon fell in the pool! the man rushes to the pool to see what is going on.  his wife now enters the office, and sees the pistol on the desk, next to the open briefcase. knowing where the pistol is normally kept, she replaces it in the small pocket which is reserved for it in the bag.because of the excitement at the pool, and the need to take a child to urgent care, the normal routine is disrupted. on returning, the man finishes packing the bag for carry-on. he is running late. he knows he removed the pistol, but time is short. in the rush to get to the airport on time, he does not check the bag again, as is his normal custom.at the checkpoint, the x-ray machine shows the pistol.when people do things often enough, the rare and unusual event will happen. people have expressed this as murphy's law: if anything can go wrong, it will.when 99.99% of people follow a law, it is an incredible success. this is what is seen on the rules for carrying firearms on commercial passenger aircraft. this fact reinforces the research showing people who legally carry firearms are incredibly law abiding and responsible. ©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

greenland, polar bears, and president trump





in his first term, and approaching his taking of office in his second term, president trump spoke of the importance of greenland to american security, and the desirability of purchasing greenland.historically, the united states of america has been interested in greenland because of its strategic position. attempts have been made to purchase the island. in wwii, the united states became the de-facto protector of the island. the usa maintains a military base on greenland.it is uncertain if president trump will acquire greenland for the united states. this may be the opening gambit in a negotiation for more control over greenland's future.what might it mean for hunters if greenland became part of the united states polity?people in greenland have seals, muskox and polar bears to hunt. the most interest would likely be in polar bears. greenlanders have hunted polar bears since the time there were people on greenland. one researcher in greenland assembled records of polar bear harvests from 1796 to 1998. the research was published in 2002. in essence, there was a rise in polar bear harvests from about 1900 to about 1930. in between the harvest dropped and rose. it is impossible to tell how much of the drop and rise happened because of the price of polar bear hides, polar bear populations, technological innovation to allow more access to polar environments, and war.from about the 1970 to 1998, the harvest averaged about 162 bears per year. this is a long sustained harvest. it indicates more bears could be harvested without a negative effect on polar bear populations.in 2005, significant restrictions were placed on the hunting of polar bears in greenland. only native inuit who are full time hunters are allowed to hunt polar bears. hunters cannot use airplanes, snowmobiles, or boats over a certain size. most hunting for polar bears involves the use of dogsleds and dogs. quotas have been established for polar bears in each village. one village might get a quota of 4 bears, another a quota of 24 bears. the overall quota has been 156 bears. a quota cannot be exchanged from one location to another.  this leads to some quotas not being filled, and a drop in the number of bear harvested. from swedenherald.com august 26, 2024:this year, the quota for polar bear hunting in kujalleq has risen to 4 individuals and the limit was reached as early as march 13. local politicians claim that at least 10-12 polar bears would be desirable.the total quota for all of greenland is 156.the number of polar bears seen appears to be increasing. polar bear advocates claim this is happening because of "climate change". susan crawford cogently disputes that assertion.   link to crockford interview. local hunters believe it is because the population of bears is increasing. prices for polar bear hides rise and fall. from nunatsiaz.com, nov 1, 2024:polar bear harvest quotas are compromising food security and making hamlets more dangerous places, says the chair of arviat’s hunters and trappers organization.if the usa takes over administration of greenland, it is plausible more hunters will be allowed to take more polar bears in greenland. it would make sense to remove polar bears from the "endangered" species list. they were placed on the list because of fanciful forecasts based on "climate change". those forecasts have been proven to be incorrect. president trump could champion taking all species off the endangered list which were incorrectly put there because of false forecasts of "climate change."because sport hunting focuses on large male trophy bears, it would make sense for local hunters to sell hunts for trophy polar bears. the harvest of large mature males is least likely to have an impact on overall polar bear populations. polar bear hunts sell for about $20,000.  this is more than ten times what current inuit hunters can realize from the sale of polar bear pelts.in negotiations with residents of greenland, the united states could offer a more reasonable and sustainable harvest of polar bears. a growing population of polar bears could be controlled with more hunting permits. locals could act as guides, bringing in more than 10 times the revenue of current polar bear hunts.©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

tx: customer complies with robber, is pistol whipped, being tied up, draws gun, shoots, kills attacker





that's when the customer spoke up, offering a reason there wasn't much money in the salon."he
 told him that the person who had all the money had already collected it
 and left for the day," she said. "the man got even more mad when he saw
 there wasn't anything to take. so, he hit my customer with his gun. 
pistol-whipped him."nancy says right after he pistol-whipped the 
customer, the would-be robber ordered him onto the ground and started to
 zip-tie him. he was about to tie up the customer's legs when the 
customer – still on his knees – pulled out his own gun, swung around and
 shot the robber at least three times. he was taken to the hospital 
where he was pronounced dead. "it was impressive," nancy said. "it was like he was agent 007."more here

 on wednesday, january 29th, 2025, the wisconsin legislature joint committee for the review of administrative rules (jcrar) approved of the repeal of wis. admin. code § nr 20.05(2) .“no person may…[p]ossess or control any firearm, gun or similar device at any time while on the waters, banks or shores that might be used for the purpose of fishing.”the wisconsin department of natural resources (dnr) rule had been in place since 1999. the rule had effectively banned the possession of firearms over wide areas of the state of wisconsin.the repeal took place because the wisconsin institute for law & liberty  (will) filed a lawsuit on june 6, 2024, as reported on ammoland.because the violation of the united states second amendment and wisconsin constitution section 25, was obvious, acting secretary of the wisconsin dnr, steven little, agreed to to repeal wis. admin. code § nr 20.05(2) as soon as possible.the website of the wisconsin administrative code shows the rule has been suspended since december 17, 2024.bureaucracies move slowly. changes in administrative rules in wisconsin must be approved by the legislature, specifically the joint committee for the review of administrative rules. on january 29th, the milwaukee journal sentinel reported the jcrar had approved of the repeal of the rule. from jsonline.com:after announcement of the lawsuit last year, the department of natural resources pledged to repeal the rule, and said it already didn't enforce the rule. but, the agency said, anglers still won't be allowed to use guns to shoot fish, just simply carry them for protection.the rule applied to everyone, not just anglers. "no person" is everyone. there was no exception, even for law enforcement.this reporter was unable to confirm the approval at the wisconsin legislature website.  skylar croy, a lawyer with the wisconsin institute for law & liberty, was intimately involved in the case. skylar was contacted. he confirmed jcrar had approved of the repeal of the rule by the dnr, on a vote of 7-3. eventually, the proceedings of the committee will be published. we may be able to determine the three wisconsin legislators who voted to keep the obviously unconstitutional restriction in place.the origin of the rule is shrouded in mystery. it appeared as part of a general restructuring of the administrative code in 1999. to the knowledge of this correspondent, no one has been willing to admit to changing the language to such a broad and unconstitutional prohibition.analysis:citizens must constantly guard against this sort of unaccountable activism in legislatures. will is to be congratulated for their victory in wisconsin.this correspondent noticed a similar situation in new south wales australia. draconian restrictions were placed on museums which displayed firearms. the restrictions were placed in an "administrative" change which was claimed not to include any substantive legal changes. when the change was noted, no one claimed responsibility for it. unlike wisconsin, australia has no constitutional protection for the right to keep and bear arms. when this correspondent contacted a previous minority leader in the new south wales parliament, he said he would look into the matter. later, he declared "success" by obtaining an exemption for the lithgow small arms factory museum.  no one in the new south wales parliament was willing to repeal the draconian rule.©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

ar: teen with ar15 type rifle, pistol, subdued by private pilot at texarkana airport





the texarkana arkansas police department says it all happened around 
7:30 a.m., when a teen armed with a rifle and a handgun came up to 
signature aviation at the airport and demanded a plane.“we want everybody to know the airport is safe and secure and flights 
will be going out as usual,” said paul mehrlich, airport director. “today, we are thankful that there were 
no injuries, no lives lost, but it really was through the actions of 
this pilot and the staff at signature aviation that their actions saved 
lives today,” mehrlich said.the teen 
then went to the airfield, where private planes are stored. a pilot for a
 local private business reportedly saw him, grabbed his own firearm, and
 ordered the teen to get on the ground. he complied and was disarmed. 
that’s when police officers arrived on scene and took the teen into 
custody.more here

shovel handle carbine and hi-point pistol with brace  





   at the 2025 shot show, this correspondent stopped at the mks supply booth, attracted by the unconventional brace on the hi-point pistol, shown above. the display model was made up for the show. it may have been inspired by the man who made a workable ak47 receiver from a shovel with a d handle.the d handle does not appear to be from an actual shovel.  the attachments to the cylinder appear to be less sturdy than those on common d handles. hi-point pistols and carbines are straight blowback semi-automatics. the pistols shown below were all chambered for the ubiquitous 9x19mm caliber. they have a shorter barrel than the carbine, which has a 16.5-17.5 inch barrel. these barrels appear to be about 12-14 inches, although this correspondent did not measure them.the middle, camouflage pattern pistol has a traditional pistol brace. the lowest pistol does not have a brace, but has an attachment point to add one if desired.at the kygunco site, hi-point pistols ran about $200, and carbines with a 16.5 to 17.5 inch barrel were listed at about $318  -  $358 in 9x19 mm, the most common caliber. none of the pistols shown above were seen at the hi-point web site. the pistols and carbines are also offered in .30s .380, .40, .45 and 10mm calibers.in this correspondent's years as an instructor, a fair number of students brought hi-point pistols to the class. they worked. the first essential for a defensive firearm is that it go bang when it is supposed to. the hi-point pistols seemed top heavy. the ergonomics did not equal a glock, a 1911a1 or a browning hi-power. but... they worked. they went bang when called upon to do so. they are inexpensive and have a lifetime warranty.the carbines also work. they make a useful home defense firearm. this correspondent has owned a 9mm carbine for a number of years. it has been reliable and reasonably accurate, capable of about 4" groups at a hundred yards. the front sight with the hood is rather exposed. it was not unusual to break the hood on the front sight if it falls on a hard surface. the new carbines use a different front sight design.it is not clear when the hi-point pistols with 12-14 inch barrels and pistol braces will become available. the biden administration's attempt to change policy and grant the atf power to determine if a pistol with a brace is a short barreled rifle, or not, has been rebuffed by the courts.short barreled rifles were added to the national firearms act in 1934 because of the confused, ignorant, or machiavellian desires of representative harold knutson of minnestota. knutson was a member of the powerful ways and means committee. attorney general cummings did not understand why knutson was asking to add rifles to the nfa, as it appeared to be the opposite of what knutson was arguing. however, cummings acceded to knutson's bizarre request.the major thrust of the national firearms act was to license and register pistols. the effort failed when the nra and people around the united states contacted their representatives and demanded removal of pistols from the act. machine guns, short barreled shotguns, short barreled rifles and silencers remained as consolation prizes for the franklin delano roosevelt administration in 1934.it makes no sense  for short barreled rifles to be burdened with all the silly restrictions of the national firearms act when pistols are recognized to be constitutionally protected by the second amendment in the supreme court decisions of heller, mcdonald, caetano, and bruen. ©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

tx: two cases of young adults using guns for self defense 





  link to video on january 15th and january 16th, in houston, texas, two young men fired guns in defense of self and others. one young man was protecting himself and his companions in the car he occupied. the other was protecting his pregnant significant other. both actions appear to be justified. both young men are reported to be less than 21 years old. the texas restoration of constitutional carry, passed in 2021, generally excludes people under the age of 21. here are the two incidents.  on january 16, 9:30 p.m. on i-610 in northeast houston. from khou.com: 
police said the 20-year-old driver again tried to get away from the 
aggressive driver, but the truck drove into the oncoming traffic lanes 
to swerve in front of him and block them. that's when hpd said the truck
 driver got out and ran toward the car with his hands near his pocket. 
police said the 20-year-old driver feared for his life and opened fire 
through the front windshield and through the side of the car, hitting 
the aggressive driver in the torso, arm and leg. 

according to hpd, the 20-year-old driver used to be a security guard 
and had handcuffs on him. he detained the other driver and contacted 
police. hpd said he was fully cooperating with investigators. 

the alleged aggressive driver was taken to an area hospital where he is expected to survive. 

"he's our victim, but again, more of a suspect, really," said lt. r. willkens with hpd. "kind of a self-defense thing."no charges are expected for the 20 year old. on january 15, 2025 at 2:40 p.m. at 7050 inwood park drive in houston, a 19 year old defended himself and his friends. from cityofhouston.news: the male shooter, 19, was not injured in the incident.
hpd homicide division sergeant n. lazo and detective m. providence reported:
hpd patrol officers responded to a shooting call in the parking lot 
of an apartment complex at the above address and found a male suffering 
from multiple gunshot wounds. he was in possession of a firearm. 
paramedics pronounced him deceased at the scene.
officers located the shooter at the scene. he stated that he and his 
friends were inside a vehicle when they were approached by the armed 
male, who raised a gun in their direction. the shooter stated he feared 
for his safety and fired shots toward the armed male, striking him. no 
one else was injured.the incident will be presented to a grand jury. because of an exception in the law passed in 2021, the 20 year old in the incident which started on i-610 was legally in possession of a firearm. the exception is for people possessing firearms in a vehicle or a boat, and on the way to and from the vehicle or the boat. the 19 year old's situation is not quite as clear, as he did not own and was not driving the vehicle. it is unlikely he will be charged with possession, because the prohibition on 18-20 year old people from carrying firearms was struck down in a court case in 2022.  no record of an appeal to the case was found. analysis: 18-20 year old people are part of the people covered by the second amendment. as shown in these cases, they face serious dangers which can be mitigated by exercising their rights protected by the second amendment. it is expected the supreme court will eventually strike down infringements preventing 18-20 year old people from exercising their second amendment rights.©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

ak: road rage? teen points rifle (bb/replica) at man, is shot, killed





police said an argument broke out between
 the two drivers and the 24-year-old man noticed the other driver had 
what appeared to be a rifle in his hands.according
 to jpd, the younger driver pointed the rifle at the caller, who told 
police he pulled out a pistol and shot the teen. he was pronounced dead 
at the scene.officers said a pellet/bb-style co2 rifle was found in the volkswagon.“it
 looked very realistic, very much like a firearm,” juneau police chief 
derek bos said monday. “responding officers also held the initial belief
 that it was an actual firearm. it was determined much later in the 
investigation that it was not.”more here

michigan passes law to mandate destroying valuable assets





image from grand rapids police facebook.com, cropped and scaled by dean weingarten on january 22, 2025, democratic governor whitmer of michigan signed hb no. 6145 into law, as part of a package of bills. hb no. 6145 mandates the state destroy valuable assets as an ideological statement. the bill requires all parts of firearms which come into possession of the michigan state police be destroyed instead of being sold and the money used for the public good. from enrolled house bill no. 6145: sec. 14. ( 1) subject to sections 5g and 14a, all pistols, weapons, or devices carried or possessed contrary to this act are declared forfeited to this state, and must be turned over to the director of the department of state police or the director’s designated representative, for disposal under this section.(2) the director of the department of state police shall dispose of firearms under this section by destroying them. the director shall ensure that all parts of a firearm disposed of under this section are destroyed.republicans flipped the house from democratic control to republican control on november 5, 2024. on december 12, 2024, house bill no. 6145 was introduced in the the michigan house of representatives. the bill was passed with partisan votes in the lame duck session in the house. the new office holders would not take office until january 1, 2025. the senate passed the bill on december 20, 2024. governor whitmer signed hb no. 6145 into law on january 22, 2025. the law will go into effect on april 2, 2025.  from fox2detroit.com:the new york times reported in 2023 that buyback programs often don't lead to the complete firearm being destroyed.instead, a single piece that includes the gun's serial number is disposed of before the company that takes them in sells the rest of the firearm. hb 6144, 6145, and 6146 deals with any gun buyback programs, ordering the michigan state police to destroy all firearms that was purchased during one of those sessions.this poorly conceived bill does nothing to stop crime or benefit the state of michigan. numerous academic studies have found gun "buybacks" to have no measurable positive effect on crime. one large study found "buybacks" to have a slight, but measurable negative effect.  "buybacks" were associated with slight increases in crime.elementary economics indicate the primary effect of the bill will be to increase the number of new gun sales. most of the firearms affected by the bill will be old firearms, many of them collectible. parts for old firearms will now be destroyed instead of entering the market place.the effect of destroying the firearms will be to increase the demand for new firearms. it is simple supply and demand economics. there is a demand for firearms. the demand can be met with new firearms or used firearms. if the supply of used firearms is reduced, the demand easily shifts to new firearms. when more old firearms are destroyed, more new firearms are sold.with over 500 million firearms in the private stock in the united states, destroying a few firearms does not affect supply very much. during the last five years, over 15 million firearms have been sold each year. approximately 87% of them are new stock. since the presidential election year of 2008, 208 million firearms have been added to the private stock. destroying guns or gun parts robs taxpayers in two ways: the state agency has to pay to have the firearms destroyed, and the state loses the value of firearms and parts which are destroyed, rather than sell them and pocket the money.the number of firearms used in crime in a given year are a tiny percentage of firearms in the nation. there were less than three crimes committed with firearms per 1000 people in 2023. there were about 1,500 legal firearms per 1000 people in the united states.  if the absurd assumption is made that every crime committed with a firearm is committed with one firearm, which is never used in crime again, there are 500 firearms which are never involved in crime for every one which is, in any year. in fact, firearms are often used in multiple crimes. other nations with much smaller stocks of firearms per capita have crime rates much higher than the united states. the number of legally owned firearms in a nation has no correlation to murder or suicide rates.the legislation if founded on the false assumption that if you destroy guns, you are somehow limiting the supply of guns. another assumption is more guns = more crime. both assumptions are false. ©2024 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

son turns grandparents and parent's weapons cache over to israeli police





 image from video of mostly pistols link to video an israeli man turned over a cache of weapons, accumulated by his grandfather and father over decades, to israeli authorities. the cache was discovered while the man was refurbishing his parents home.israel was born in military conquest, three millennia ago, rebuilt after babylonian destruction 2.5 millennia ago, destroyed by the romans as a nation two millennia ago, and reborn as the homeland of the jews 100 - 78 years ago.war, conquest and military strife have been part of the nation of israel throughout its history. before the israeli war of independence in 1948, the israelis had significant underground resistance forces against british rule, with shifting internal alliances, sometimes cooperating with the british, sometimes actively resisting and sabotaging the british rulers of the land. the ability to have and hide firearms was critical. toward the end of wwii, the british issued a declaration of the death penalty if a person was found with a firearm.the article/video from israeli national news says the weapons were apparently collected by the man's father and grandfather over a period of years.this cache, with many wwii era weapons, was likely started during that era. the owners risked everything to insure they had weapons to defend against a world full of enemies. consider the risks taken when the regime might kill you for having firearms. consider keeping weapons whose presence might put you in prison for decades.  these were serious survivors of intense strife.it is an interesting collection. watching the video, this correspondent determined these approximate numbers and video level identifications:7 sks rifles2 smle no. 1 mk iii lee-enfield rifles1 beretta 38/42 submachine gun, 9mm, wood stock1 mauser 98k rifle1 break open shotgun1 cz .22 bolt gun, similar to 455 series 9 ak47/akm rifles,  1 missing upper receiver18-20 pen guns/ converter barrels?2 brass knuckles2 german blank guns, semi-auto4 small revolvers, possible converted starter/blank guns1 rifle to pistol conversion1 spanish destroyer .32 semi-auto pistol2 lugers  + 1 luger frame1 steyr m1912 pistol5 swedish k sub-machine guns1 sten sub-machine gun1 swedish nagant revolver1 s&w style double action revolver1 colt style double action revolver2 cz 27.32 pistols1 webley  mk iv .38 revolver1 baby browning type .25 semi-auto pistol1 or 2 beretta 92 pistol(s) (one pistol was either a beretta or a helwan)1 or 2 egyptian helwan 1951 pistol(s)1 converted flare gun1 fn 1922 .32 pistol2 1911a1  pistols3 p-38 pistols3 mauser c-96 pistols (broomhandle)1 enfield .38 revolver16-17 grenades (mills bombs) (detonators separate, but there)30+ pistol magazines24 sub-gun magazines22 ak magazines4 galil magazines1  30 mm explosive roundsome 12 gauge shotgun rounds6 bayonetsthousands of rifle and pistol rounds are reported to have been stored with the firearms.what might the people who gathered this significant collection of weaponry feel or say about the voluntary turnover of these precious weapons to the police? the father and grandfather are most likely dead. if they were alive, there would not be any need to speculate about who collected and stored this impressive arsenal.many of these firearms would be worth thousands of dollars if legally present inside the united states. a beretta 38/42 sub-machine gun recently sold at auction for $19,550.  it is unknown if any or all of the collection will be destroyed by the israeli government.it only takes a generation or two where weapons are demonized and made illegal by a government and society, for future generations to choose to be disarmed, and to trust the government for their security. israel started as a socialist state. israel did not include a second amendment in their vision of the future. the founders of israel, in 1948, did not believe an armed society was a positive good.these firearms would have been highly prized by the israeli victims of the october 7 massacre.  on october 7, 2024, where even a few pistols were effective in saving dozens of lives. ©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

update: hans teeuwen vindicated in air gun incident; all charges dropped  





  on march 12, 2024, hans teeuwen posted a satirical video mocking femke halsema, the mayor of amsterdam.   in the video an object, vaguely pistol appearing, was on a table next to teeuwen. within three hours six policeman appeared at teeuwen's door.link to youtube video of arrival of the police and the original video skit. the skit mocks mayor halsema. the inclusion of the air pistol was likely to bring attention to how halsema, her husband, and son were treated in an incident involving a pistol owned by her husband and criminally misused by the son.teeuwne let the police in. they siezed the object. ammoland noted the object was probably a webley air pistol. this supposition was later confirmed.a commenter on ammoland recently asked: what happened to the case?the original incident received considerable attention and outrage. the resolution of the incident did not receive as much attention. on march 15, 2024 hans teeuwen was informed he could pick up the air pistol.  no charges were brought against him. this was confirmed on x. from x (formerly twitter): hans teeuwen: "i can pick up the air gun from the police."an english language version of an article about the incident was found. from world-today-journal.com:amsterdam – hans teeuwen will receive the gun back on friday that the police took during a raid on his house on tuesday. the comedian announced this on wednesday. a group of six officers arrived at teeuwen’s home after he posted a video online showing the air pistol.“i just got a call and i can come by on friday and i will get the weapon back,” said the artist. according to teeuwen, there are no charges against him: “as far as i am concerned, the matter is closed. although i’m considering turning it into a carnival hit, “i got my air rifle back.” that should be a cracker.”the police said on wednesday that the suspicion against teeuwen has been withdrawn and that he will not be prosecuted. the police do not want to comment now on the question of what kind of weapon it was. first, teeuwen receives an explanation of what is going on.analysis:ridicule is a potent political weapon. femke halsema faced ridicule for the heavy handed way the police raided hans teeuwen's home over what was a legally owned air gun. air guns can be purchased, without any special license, in dutch shops.much international news is missed because of language barriers.  while the incident occurred over nine months ago, ammoland readers deserve to know how it was resolved. ©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

the keltec pr57 is one of the more innovative pistols seen at the 2025 shot show.  as indicated by the name, the pistol is chambered in 5.7x28. the pistol is top loaded, with a 20 round magazine. the magazine is integral, like a steyr 1912 or a c96 broom handle mauser. this allows for a smaller grip, fewer parts, and a very thin and light pistol. as expected, there is significant muzzle flash and blast when the pistol is fired. recoil is more than most .22 rimfire pistols, but less than most 9mm pistols.  the capacity is listed as 20+1. how is the 21st round loaded?one of the keltec representatives indicated he locked back the slide, inserted a round in the chamber, then used his thumb to depress the top round in the magazine. with the other hand, pull the slide back to release the slide lock, and allow the slide to move forward, under control, as the thumb is taken off the round in the magazine.  alternatively, put the 21st round on top of the 20th round, and press down, then using the other hand, pull back on the slide and allow it to go forward under control. as the 21st round enters the chamber, remove the thumb holding it in place and allow the slide to go fully forward until it locks in place.bottleneck cartridges make for reliable feeding.  because the magazine is integral, the feed lips are subject to less possibility of damage. no tolerance is needed to accommodate slight differences in removable magazine manufacture. the integral feed lips are sturdy and unlikely to be easily dammaged. stripper clips are much easier and cheaper to manufacture than magazines.using stripper clips to reload is a little slower than using a detachable magazine. a stripper clip reload is probably at least as fast as reloading a revolver with speed loaders. 20 or 21 rounds of ammunition is likely to allow an opportunity to reload at some point. 20 rounds of ammunition would require three reloads in a six shot revolver.fully loaded, the keltec pr57 weighs 19 ounces, four ounces less than anunloaded glock 19. the pistol is less than 1 inch thick. about the sameheight as a glock 19, and is a little shorter than the glock 19.the disassembly procedure for the pistol is simple. push the trigger forward. pull the slide off the front of the frame. the slide and barrel are locked together. you now have the slide assembly and the frame.  it appears cartridges could be removed from the magazine by simply pushing them forward, free from the magazine feed lips. the keltec pr57 uses a patented rotating front locking mechanism. a lug on the back of the barrel fits into a slot on a part called the trunion by keltec. the trunion fits between the barrel and the frame.  as the barrel and slide move backward in recoil, the barrel rotates and unlocks. the slide continues backward, ejecting the cartridge case.  trunion shown separate, above frame at the keltec booth, this correspondent asked about the unusual circumstance of the jam at the industry day at the range. the keltec representative speculated it might have been the ammunition which was being used. semi-automatic pistols rely on uniform ammunition to function correctly. the jam was easily cleared. it was a simple failure to eject. pulling and releasing the slide cleared the failure to eject. it appeared to this correspondent to be consistent with underpowered ammunition. all self defense pistols should be tested with the ammunition will will be carried for self defense, before they are relied on in critical situations. ©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

summer, 1991, 2 black bears and a .357 





alan yates with rifles, pistols and bear rugs.in the summer of 1991, alan yates was working in the forested mountains near bozeman, montana. he was charged by two black bears at the same time. he successfully defended himself against the bears with two shots fired from his .357 magnum smith & wesson 65 revolver. he was 21 years old.here are alan's words, lightly edited for space and clarity:in the summer of 1991 i worked on a logging operation in the mountains of montana.there was a large bear that lived in the hills and mountains around our community. he was very aggressive. his favorite mode of attack was to charge riders on their horses. invariably, the rider would get thrown from the spooked horse, the horse would run off, and the bear would stand around for a minute or two thumping up and down on his front paws as if gloating. then he'd run off.there was no love for this bear. there was, quietly, a bounty on him. because of his sheer size, and seeming youthful bad attitude, it was widely hypothesized that he was a black bear/grizzly mix.seeing bears was a regular occurance and didn't bother me.one morning in the early fall, i was trimming branches off the tops of cut down trees with a large knife that i had made. it was quiet work, and i was further up the mountain side than the other workers. suddenly i heard an all-to-familiar sound ... "woof, woof, woof ... " quickly getting louder and closer. i knew what it meant. i dropped the knife, grabbed my 357 magnum, while spinning towards the sound.up the mountain ridge came a rolling ball of massive muscle and fur. he was  medium brown in color, with a dark chocolate face and neck. i immediately recognized him from the descriptions i'd heard. he was the problem bear everyone hated.i cocked my revolver and timed his head roll. when he was "close enough" (8 or 10 yards) and his head rolled up, i dropped the hammer. my custom hand loaded bullet hit him square in the chest and i saw the fur fly from the impact. he staggered slightly, turning about 30 degrees to his left and continued  his charge up and over the next (nearby) ridge and out of sight.i watched him go out of the corner of my eye, because when he turned off his  direct path towards me, a new problem showed herself. not 20 yards behind him was a 2nd bear. she was a beautiful black phase with a large white "v" on her chest. she was much smaller - probably a 4-5 year old  bear. she continued her charge full steam at me.i recocked my revolver and at the instant her head rose - on her next to last jump - i dropped the hammer again. i watched the bullet strike her 1" to the right if the bottom of the white v on her chest.the bullet impact, combined with her upward lunge, flipped her completely over backwards and she landed on her back - her head downhill. she rolled over, jumped up and hobbled back down the ridge.i spun around looking to see if the other bear was still a threat, but he was  nowhere to be found. then i ran down the mountain after her. i assumed  that she wouldn't go far. i was wrong.she went straight down the ridge a few hundred yards where she slid off the steep bank and onto the logging road - where the rest of our crew were working. she passed right thru the middle of them, over the bank and continued downhill. when i jumped down from the bank, i yelled "did you see a bear?". they pointed and said "she's right there". we could see  her intermittently. she turned down into the draw and headed up the next  ridge in the open, crossing it at right angles. she was moving slowly.i ran to camp, grabbed my rifle (my old 303 british), and gave chase. i tracked  her along the side of the mountain, up, down, over and under, for the  next 1.5 miles. i lost her trail when she entered a large "blow-down". i circled the entire blowdown searching for her track. i couldn't find it. (lodge-pole pine blow-downs can kill you when the logs shift suddenly, so i knew better than to go in there).returning to camp, i updated everyone and we "loaded up" to go track down the big boar. we were not able to hold his trail for very long. after cresting  the next ridge, he had slowed to a walk in dense timber and his track was soon lost.i spent the next few weeks worried about the possibility of having 2 wounded bears near our camp. but no trouble came.soon enough, the snow flew, logging was shut down for the season, and i was free to go hunting. i quickly found myself hunting elk on the same  mountain. i had come in from a different direction. as i crested a ridge, i heard magpies (a bird) calling from down in the draw below me. magpies, in the mountains, generally mean something is dead. as i worked my way down the slope and began up the next, i discovered that i was back at the same blowdown where i'd lost bear's trail.  the magpies were dancing and calling near the lower edge of the blowdown. i eased very carefully in the short distance, and there she was. she was quite decomposed, but she was all bear, and i could still see the large white v on her chest. i was thankful to find her dead.the large aggressive boar was never seen again - so i assume him dead also.i have no idea why those 2 bears charged me. the most likely theory is that the boar heard me and liked to charge. she was just tagging along.alan switched from a .357 magnum to a .44 magnum. he has hunted the high mountain country of montana for 35 years. ©2024 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

president trump, felony conviction, firearms possession





 former and future president trump is now a convicted felon in the state of new york. the abuse of the judicial system by the prosecutor and  judge are some of the worst seen by astute, leftist legal commentators, such as jonathan turley and alan dershowitz.  dershowitz goes so far as calling him "a convicted innocent man". he says there were 34 non-crimes president trump was convicted of.  at left of center politifact, this question was raised: from politifact:president-elect donald trump’s jan. 10 felony sentencing raised questions on social media about his rights: can he vote, travel internationally and own a gun? yes, likely, and no. it is unlikely the guilty verdict in the outrageous anti-trump lawfare case in new york will survive for long.  when president trump is sworn in to office, presidential immunity will apply for his second term in his presidency. the verdict will almost certainly be reversed long before that term ends. as jonathan turley notes:the case has long been denounced by objective legal observers, including intense trump critics, as a legal absurdity. even cnn’s senior legal analyst elie honig denounced the case as legally flawed and unprecedented while sen. john fetterman, d-pa., simply called it total “b—s–t.”it is a case based on a non-crime. bragg took a long-dead misdemeanor and zapped it back into life with a novel and unfounded theory. by using federal violations that were never charged, let alone tried, bragg turned a misdemeanor into dozens of felonies and essentially tried trump for federal offenses.in spite of a looming reversal, the conviction has positive implications for second amendment supporters and supporters of limited government in general.there are cases moving forward in the legal system challenging federal law which bans all "felons" from possessing or owning firearms and ammunition. this is a relatively new federal crime, which came into being in 1968. some courts have already declared the federal ban to be unconstitutional for non-violent offenses. the case most likely to be heard by the supreme court is range v lombardo, from the third circuit.at the supreme court level, the justices are certain to know about the laughworthy felony convictions of president donald trump. the supreme court has a good chance of hearing the case if the new york courts fail to do their duty.  the trump case is a near-perfect example of judicial overreach and lawfare. the idea of a presidential candidate being stripped of a fundamental, in-numerated, constitutional right, without any hint of violence, is likely to make an impression about the absurdity of many felony laws in the current united states of america.president trump will be affected. it is one thing to generally be in favor of restoring rights protected by the second amendment. it is more personal and significant to have infringements on second amendment rights directly used against you in a preposterous way.president trump has done more for the restoration of second amendment rights than any president before him. he has not demonstrated an intimate understanding of the war to restore those rights or the intricacies of the battles involved. in the future, the intimacy of the lawfare used against him may make the restoration of second amendment rights a personal battle for president trump.©2025 by dean weingarten: permission to share is granted when this notice and link are included.  gun watch

background

two words of ultimate defiance

another symbol of defiance

  “the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.” -- thomas jefferson

syndicated columnist charley reese (1937-2013): "gun control by definition affects only honest people. when a politician tells you he wants to forbid you from owning a firearm or force you to get a license, he is telling you he doesn’t trust you. that’s an insult. ... gun control is not about guns or crime. it is about an elite that fears and despises the common people." 

the rifle itself has no moral stature, since it has no will of its own.  naturally, it may be used by evil men for evil purposes, but there are more good men than evil, and while the latter cannot be persuaded to the path of righteousness by propaganda, they can certainly be corrected by good men with rifles -- jeff cooper (1920-2006)

note for non-american readers: crime reports from america which describe an offender just as a "teen" or "teenager" almost invariably mean a black teenager. 

we are advised to not judge all muslims by the actions of a few lunatics, but we are encouraged to judge all gun owners by the actions of a few lunatics.

two lines below of a famous hymn that would be incomprehensible to leftists today ("honor"?  "right"?  "freedom?"  freedom to agree with them is the only freedom they believe in)

first to fight for right and freedom,
and to keep our honor clean

it is of course the hymn of the usmc -- still today  the relentless warriors that they always were.

the intellectual roman emperor marcus aurelius (ad 121-180) said: "the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane." 


how much do you know about trayvon martin?   it's all here (backups here and here) 

“an armed society is a polite society. manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life.”  -- robert a. heinlein

after all the serious stuff here, maybe we need a funny picture of a cantankerous cat
