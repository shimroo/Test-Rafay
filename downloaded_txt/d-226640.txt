alert: beware of scams targeting international students
scam calls, emails, and text messages targeting international students are on the rise. scammers may impersonate government agencies (uscis, ice, irs), university officials, banks, or law enforcement, using fear tactics to trick students into providing personal information or making payments.
do not share personal or financial information with unknown callers or email senders.
never make payments via gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrencyâ€”government agencies will never ask for these.
general tips to avoid scams
