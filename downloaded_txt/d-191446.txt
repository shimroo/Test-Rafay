gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' land acknowledgment for the ithaca campuscornell university is located on the traditional homelands of the gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the cayuga nation). the gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the haudenosaunee confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. the confederacy precedes the establishment of cornell university, new york state, and the united states of america. we acknowledge the painful history of gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters.
