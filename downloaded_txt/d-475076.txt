i hope i wasn't the only person who thought that the "joker" announced for ultimate was batman's version, since i'd never played...and probably never will...the "persona" series.

i think i saw the image first, but regardless, a lot of "we live in a society" and "robin and joker without batman?" jokes followed.

i'm shocked that even after the footage of it we saw, some people are still convinced mario kart 9 is gonna have nintendo crossover characters

maybe im the crazy one, but i would've thought if nintendo went the smash kart route it wouldn't still have the same rough roster balance of 8deluxe with 80% mario 20% other. it'd be the focus right? the balance would be more... balanced.

i also thought the wonder-esce art style would be enough for deconformation, they wouldn't make a wonder-styled link or captain falcon.

again maybe i'm crazy but i think the nintendo kart ship has sunk, i don't think it's happening

didn't sakurai cover a video on making cartoon characters and realistic characters mix well together in smash by altering their designs, like giving sonic slightly more realistic fur and adjusting bayonetta's proportions for example?

mbredboy31
seeing the guests redesigned in the wonder art style would make them more interesting to see return, wouldn’t it? i can’t really imaging them making a wonder styled zelda game for example, so this would be our only chance to see that. i don’t know if it would look good, but i’m at least curious.

martiansnake
i'm not saying i don't don't want crossover characters in mario kart 9 because i don't think they'd look good in the artstyle, i'm saying i think the artstyle being so specific to mario and so tied to past mario things is evidence that the game will be just mario

i've only seen like 3 episodes of spongebob in my life, and the only way i survive this largely spongebob centric world we live in is through cultural osmosis and stuff.
