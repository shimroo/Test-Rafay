thank you for visiting brazosport retriever club!

hello and welcome to the website of the brazosport retriever club based in the greater harris, montgomery, fort bend and waller county area of texas. we are a licensed club of the american kennel club and a member club of the national retriever club, the national amateur retriever club and the master national retriever club. we hold licensed akc hunting tests and field trials usually each fall and spring in our area.
we have a diverse membership that is based not only in the greater houston area but also throughout the upper texas gulf coast. our members participate in akc, hrc and srs retriever events. most of our dogs do hunt waterfowl and upland birds almost every season.
thank you for visiting our website, and we hope you find a little useful information. our organization receives a small financial support when you purchase glucosamine from one of our partner vendors on spots.com. thank you for your support.
