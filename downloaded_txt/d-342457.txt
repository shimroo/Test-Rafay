...think globally and work locally,							using the creative energies from around the country							and the world to light a fire at home fueled from everywhere. 							thoreau said "							it is something to be able to paint a particular picture							or to carve a statue							and so to make a few things beautiful 							but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the atmosphere and							medium through which we look.							which morally we can do 							to affect the quality of the day							that is the highest of arts."

play like you mean it!   
 
flying beetle goes home! harts lane, east brunswick, nj. many years ago (in a kingdom by the sea ) an old hungarian gave a gift of half a beetle to a group of artists. they took the beetle gratefully and it multiplied and flew many places. now it has returned home with a story to tell.

250 fish bricks, dusty bricks! are now quick fish getting faster. about three weeks ago we discovered an animation program through coffeecup.com, playing and experimenting. 												for years we have photographed whatever we did  with schools and random others. we would like to do our part to initiate internet shows which are about experimenting with programs and the variations achieved.
 we began with fish because we have them. we also have trains, hubcaps and rubber hands. the elements created together are our building blocks. variations on a theme! a foot in the door to a little magic made personal!
