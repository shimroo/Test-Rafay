california's epa 
							report on particle board (pb) dated april 26, 2007 
							confirms:
							7,000 kids in the u.s.(23 to 63 per million 
							population*) under 9 years old are estimated to 
							get cancer due to particle board formaldehyde 
							exposure in their home.
							as many as 56,000 adults in the u.s. (86 to 231 per 
							million population*) will get cancer in their lifetime 
							due to particle board formaldehyde exposure. 
							carb compliant particle board phase 1 will only 
							reduce the cancer cases by 12 to 35 cases. 














*based on epa specifically reporting up to 
					63 kids per million will get cancer (49 million kids under 9 
					in usa) and 231 adults per million will also get cancer due 
					to particle board (243 million adult population in usa).
