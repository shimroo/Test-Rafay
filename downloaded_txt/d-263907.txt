bmi and medical history are among the factors our medical staff considers when determining qualification. if you have struggled with long-term weight loss and maintenance, we encourage you to schedule a consultation. if you do not qualify, you will receive a 100% refund.


what is the name of the medication and are there any side effects?




the medication prescribed to you is determined by our licensed providers based on your medical history and weight loss goals. one of the most popular and effective medications we recommend is semaglutide, a glp-1 receptor agonist. it has been extensively tested for nearly 20 years. common side effects, such as mild nausea or gastrointestinal effects, are manageable by following our experienced team's advice. schedule a consultation with  tmates to learn more.  tmates supports patient choice and does not discriminate based on your insurance plan or carrier.


i've used weight loss medications before, but i'm concerned about side effects.




in clinical studies, semaglutide has shown a slightly beneficial effect on blood pressure for some individuals. moreover, weight loss associated with semaglutide treatment may lead to a small decrease in blood pressure. however, individual responses may vary. during your consultation, our team will discuss this question in detail, taking into account your medical history and current situation.


i'm concerned about the shortage of semaglutide. can you provide more information?




we understand your concerns, but we want to assure you that there is no shortage of semaglutide. while there may have been a shortage of brand name glp1 medication's due to manufacturing issues with its prefilled pen, the active ingredient, semaglutide, has always been available. it's important to differentiate between the brand name and the active ingredient. if you're facing difficulties obtaining a brand name glp1, we can explore alternative options. at  tmates, we are committed to helping individuals with diabetes and other health conditions achieve their weight loss goals and lead healthier lives.
