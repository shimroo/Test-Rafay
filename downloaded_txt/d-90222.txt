braxenburg
rottweilers
is
a small, exclusive urban hobby kennel located in downtown toronto,
ontario, canada established
in 1992 and run by myself, dianna contin & my husband, adam.  
our
rottweilers live in our home, with a 5-year old daughter and a
purebred, tica
registered ragdoll cat.   


jade & berlin



we train
primarily in ckc/ukc/caro obedience and show our rottweilers
in ckc, ukc and german style shows.  we fervently
health-test.  our dogs' bloodlines are
based on a combination of english, german, dutch and
finnish
bloodlines.  we breed rarely but
offer a detailed glimpse into our
dogs and the rottweiler breed.


we are planning
a litter for summer/fall 2014.
