comprehensive overview of elisa kits for proteins & enzymes

 lieven

proteins and enzymes are essential components of various biochemical pathways that regulate cellular functions and metabolism. understanding their roles in health and disease requires precise detection and quantification. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) kits offer a sensitive and reliable method for measuring the concentration of specific proteins and enzymes in biological samples. this article explores elisa…

onsite hiv/syphilis ab combo rapid test

 lieven

abstract background sexually transmitted infections, such as hiv and syphilis, are one of the major healthcare problems worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. hiv testing programs have been widely used for many years. the introduction of rapid point-of-care (rpt) tests that can detect both hiv and syphilis, using a single blood sample, would be…
