important safety message
sullivan county schools has banned all sniffable caffeine products from school campuses, effective immediately. snortable caffeine poses significant health risks, including rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, anxiety, and even potential overdose when misused. furthermore, these products resemble certain drug lookalikes, raising concerns about their visual similarity to illegal substances, which can lead to misunderstandings and create a risky environment for students. this ban is part of our commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all students.
