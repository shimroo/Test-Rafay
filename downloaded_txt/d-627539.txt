latest words o’wisdomaccept changejanuary 12, 2021articlein the self-help world, there’s a lot of talk about “accepting ourselves as we are” but is that really practical? if we really think we’re either too fat or too ugly or too poor, is that even possible?



the key to accepting ourselves is not to put up with the stuff we hate about ourselves, but rather accept ourselves as angry and disappointed with stuff about ourselves; then move on from there.



accept our beliefs



the first thing to do is accept that these are beliefs about ourselves. it doesn’t matter if we got these ideas from our parents or society or tv ads, we’re the ones that are buying into them. you don’t need to accept what you hate… but at least accept how you feel about what you hate. at least that’ll be coming from a place of truth.



accept what we cannot change



next it’s important to realize that we only have so much to work with. we may never look like the celebs we see on tv or be the richest person in the world… but we can look better and feel better. the key is in becoming comfortable with the “stuff” that makes us “us.” embracing what we cannot change often brings us closer to our truer selves.



accept what we can change



the biggest thing to stop us from making ourselves more like what we want is the belief (there’s that word again) that it “can’t be done.” when we believe it can’t be done, we’re right… and when we believe it can be done, we’re right too. life is all about change. we can be a part of it.



accept responsibility



but it won’t happen if we do nothing about it… or if we rely on other people to do it for us. success has no excuses. there’s no need to blame anyone or anything, but simply take control of the changes we want to see happen.



accept the change itself



you want to know another reason why change never really happens? because when it does happen, it’s rejected. not just from ourselves, but also from the people around us. sometimes family and friends undermine the efforts because they don’t want to accept the change… sometimes the new way is scary because it’s so different from our comfort zone, that we cheat and go back to our old ways. by accepting (in fact, by embracing) the changes as they happen, they can take stronger root and grow.



in fact, the change itself is not the only thing that needs to accepted, but the changes that come along with the change. one thing leads to a dozen… and entire paradigms need to shift in order to become the new version of us.



to make it happen, we need to be willing to go all the way….

an optimist walks into the barn, steps in manure and says “where’s the pony?”



the same events happen to all people – good, bad and indifferent. people just don’t realize how much they shape their own experience. your attitude really does change everything. it not only tints your experience; it dictates the decisions you make next, that have a very direct impact on your future.



a perfect example is company “reorgs” – where lots of employees get shifted around from department to department. it’s very uncertain; with people getting half the picture, if at all. they’re left to fill in the blanks with their own imagination.



this is where i see the biggest difference between pessimists and optimists. the pessimists paint the whole world with doom-and-gloom, and resign themselves to the “way it is.” they say things like “we have no choice” and “it’s only going to get worse.”



optimists, on the other hand, are seen as naive, hopeless and hapless… at least by the pessimists (who by this point are labeling themselves the “realists”). what the pessimists often miss are the subtle differences between the passive optimists and the active optimists.



passive optimists are the “hope for the best crowd” that often prove the pessimists right. the active optimists, on the other hand, are the ones that can really take advantage of change — in the office and everywhere. here’s some qualities of the active optimist:



not afraid of changesees opportunities in every movedoesn’t let negative events stop themdoesn’t sit by and wait to be victimizedif they don’t see an opportunity, they seek onethey stay proactive, not reactivedoes what they can to keep the spirits up of those around themgets up one time more than they are knocked down



opportunities don’t often come to those that just sit there. by being active, the optimist takes actual steps that could lead to advancement. by staying positive, they also have an effect on others that the pessimists don’t. that alone can make all the difference in the world….

“now what?”



congratulations you are about to embark on a whole new journey of life. you just experienced a moment that either solidified the direction you were already heading, or perhaps will change your course forever. you had a moment of realization that not only “makes sense” now but brings insight to a whole bunch of stuff that happened in your past. before you move on with the next course of your life, here’re some things to pause and ponder on:



compare then and nowhow does this “moment of sense” compare to the “moment of confusion” just before it?this will help you understand the significance of the “a-ha” moment.



sharpen your hindsightyou didn’t just happen upon this “a-ha” moment… your past brought you here. reflect upon your past. think of as many moments as you can remember, and use your new “vision” to review them. the more time you take now to do that, the more solid your “a-ha” moment will become a part of your life.



evaluate the a-ha moment itselfreally scrutinize it. perhaps it’s a misunderstanding and you just thought you got it. a bad “a-ha” can be a real time waster… yet analyzing a bad “a-ha” could lead you to a real “a-ha” so it’s worth looking into.



set your coursenew realizations can take you to amazing places; they can also mislead you if you just let them be. take the time to imagine all the directions you can go with your new “map.” that gives you freedom of choice.



be open to morethis could be the first of many “a-ha’s” … some of which might be even bigger than the first. keep an open mind and let life offer up its many wondrous surprises….

read more…balance your actjanuary 16, 2021articleeveryone’s talking about balance these days. balance your diet with these supplements and that juicer. balance your time with this timeshare or the latest electronic gizmo. if you use this abdominizer, that rubber stretcher or this electric shock heating pad, you’ll balance your body in no time flat!



balance doesn’t come in a bottle or a box. it comes with time and what you do with each moment.



balance is the ultimate state of being. it’s a completeness that can generate health and longevity. you see it mentioned in eastern philosophies where the yin and the yang have to be in harmony.



but you don’t have to sit in silence for hours on end to achieve balance. in fact, the person who “works hard and plays hard” might actually be in more balance than anyone else.



so how do you get balanced? it’s actually fairly easy in concept… and just a bit more difficult in practice.



just add the other stuff…



it really is about adding, not subtracting. that might seem scary, considering all the stuff you already do; but if you realize that time is finite, adding what you really want will help to push away the stuff that’s putting you off balance.



it’s also important not to subtract first. that creates a void… and anything can fill up the void, including the thing you just stopped. an example of that would be like a diet where you cut out sweets, but don’t eat anything else… only to end up hitting the cookie jar at night. adding gives you the control to have what you want.



take time to play, if you work too hard.work, if all you do is play.



if you sit all day, go for a walk at night.if it’s too noisy, sneak away to a place for a moment of silence.



eat some healthy food.exercise.



do something, however little, for yourself every day.



it doesn’t have to be equal time for each thing. five minutes of quiet can balance eight hours of noise. a moment of play can counter tons of work. it’s about having this stuff in your life, more so than how long you have it.



it’s your time, your life, your choice.



add accordingly….

read more…being presentjanuary 16, 2021articlethe greatest gift you can give to someone is being present



there is a special magic that happens when you acknowledge another person’s existence. it doesn’t have to be much… a smile, a kind word… just something to yes “hi, i know you’re here.”



being presentthe closer they are to you though, the more of “you” they need, in order to feel that sense of commitment. it’s very simple in its principles, not always as easy as it looks, yet farther reaching than you can ever imagine.



to make yourself “present” to someone, you have to bring yourself into the present moment fully, and remove all distractions so you can focus on being with that other person. here are some hints to help you get there:



maintain eye contactwhen someone is talking to you, they can see where your focus is in your eyes. looking away means your mind is there too. looking them in the eye connects you.**



listendon’t pay any attention to that voice that’s competing inside your head. be silent, and really take in what they other person is saying.



acknowledge what they said“uh huh… yeah… uh huh,” is not acknowledgement. make sure you let them know that you don’t just hear what they say, you understand it too. even paraphrase it in your own words and say it back, or ask them a question that furthers the conversation along.



add to their conversation not your ownyour experience can be invaluable to them, but not if it’s going off in some self-centered tangent. make sure what you have to say is relevant, or else (again) they’ll realize you weren’t really paying attention.



don’t judge their viewpointthis can be a tough one, because in order for you to understand them, you have to filter it through your own set of beliefs. you just have to keep your values to yourself, and not prejudge what you’re hearing.



forget your pastthe mind is a funny thing most of the time. they’ll say one thing and you’ll be catapulted back to high school or summer camp and completely leave the present behind. if you get into those moments, get back to the present. you’ll get there by looking at the person with you and listening,



don’t anticipate your futurewe also like to race ahead, way too often. even if our intention is to hurry up and get to the answer, racing too far ahead will leave the solution behind. besides, the person you’re with might veer off at any moment, leaving you once again, not paying attention.



give them your timedon’t rush things. time is your life. the other person knows you value your time, so when you give of your time, you give of yourself. they get your present when you give a whole bunch of your present moments.



** be aware that eye contact varies in different cultures… and the connection that comes from it might be construed as disrespect. stay within the boundaries of comfort here, or else you’ll miss all other points….

read more…blinded by the momentjanuary 16, 2021articleas you look at a mountain in the distance, if you hold your thumb up in front of your eye, it will look as if the mountain is only a couple of inches tall; while your thumb is miles high! your head tells you it’s the opposite, but that’s not what it looks like.



we all know better, right? that whatever is closer just appears to be bigger… yet every day we get caught up in the perspective that whatever is right in front of us is the biggest thing in the whole wide world. the current crisis, the latest temptation… “life is uncertain, eat desert first!”



that’s often why the mountain stays in the distance, and we go on staring at our own thumbs. we get mesmerized, even blinded by our present moments.



keep the proper perspectivestep back and see the overall picture. hellooooo, it’s a thumb!



don’t judge the presentcloser is just closer; it isn’t better or more dramatic… it’s just more immediate.



deal with it on its terms, not you owntake care of the present moment based on what the moment really needs, not its apparent bigness to everything else in the distance. (it’s a thumb, not a mountain).



ask for another’s perspectiveother people don’t have your thumb in front of their face (and if they did, that would probably annoy them)… so ask what they see. their vantage point might be very enlightening.



keep your eye on the goalif you’re trying to reach the mountain, put your thumb down and your foot forward!



the present is what gets you to your future. it’s where you live, but just cause you’re in the present doesn’t make this moment more important than your next moment. it’s just important to see it all without the blinders.



thumbs up to you, now go take on the day!…

read more…bringing blissjanuary 16, 2021articledoing what you love will make you happy, but loving what you do will bring you bliss.



too often we postpone joy. we thank god it’s friday, we look at vacation brochures, we wait for the kids to grow. happiness always seems to be something we have to “get to” rather than something we create for ourselves.



we judge our moments. we think that one is better than the other. and, yes, of course some things are really, really good and some things are really, really bad. life is a cycle after all… but i’m not talking about the biggest moments in your life. i’m talking about where you spend most of your day… usually somewhere in the middle.



the big question to ask yourself is “am i enjoying what i’m doing at this very moment?” (since you’re reading this article right now, i hope your answer is yes, but that’s another story). so when this moment has passed, when you’re in another moment, ask again.



if the answer is no, ask yourself why not. if it’s neither a bad moment nor a good moment, are you judging it because you think you should be doing something more exciting… more fulfilling?



did you know it will take more energy to go off and do something else than it would to simply let go of judgment and just experience it?



one of my favorite stories is of the monk and the buddha. the monk asks “how can i get rid of my desire to eat and to sleep?” the buddha replies, “eat, sleep.”



the answer really is simple. it’s not more complicated than eat, sleep, bathe, take out the trash, do laundry… so enjoy them!! don’t judge it. don’t wish you were somewhere else. just do each moment with love.



there are people who would love the luxury of a hot shower or a cold drink. don’t take what you have for granted. experience your moments as if for the first time, or as if for the last time. become present in the present. happiness isn’t something we get out of life, it’s something we put into it.



so enjoy this moment… and your next one too….

read more…can you spare some change?january 16, 2021articlethere’s something divine about helping others; not just the guilt ridden spare change of a lint filled pocket, but rather the actual, sincere effort to change the course of another’s life for the better. it doesn’t just change that person, but also you… and ultimately makes the world a better place; if only a little corner of it.



the way to help another can come in a million different ways, from years of intense, active listening of someone who just needs to talk to just a simple smile to a stranger who’s had a bad day. there is no right way, but there are some guiding principles you can follow to help you help others.



non-judgmentthis is the thing that can trip us up the most… our own judgment. we filter what is being said, or the person’s condition with what we think is right. it might not be what they really need. by approaching them with a clear mind and heart, we’re in a better place to be more helpful.



presencestaying in their moment puts you in a powerful moment to make actual change. this means really listen to them; don’t stay in your own thoughts.



patiencethe answer might seem obvious to you, but that’s just your opinion. even if it is right, and the other person understands what you’re saying, it takes time for them to change their life accordingly. don’t rush to conclusions. the real solution might not be apparent to you either.



empathypeople don’t really want your sympathy. that comes from a condescending space. really understanding how they feel is on their level; which is the only level that can be helped.



honestyhelp has to be sincere, it has to be truthful. real solutions come with dealing with reality; so vow to be honest… to them and to yourself.



encouragementa lot of people like to tell others what not to do. that’s usually met my resistance. encouragement is a sign that you support the person.



enthusiasmif you get excited about their change, they will too. don’t just half heartedly commit; give it your all!



advocacyone of the greatest signs of support is actually “going to bat” for someone else. it’s not only talking about support, it’s walking the talk.



mentorsharing your knowledge and experience can show someone the way to help themselves. it’s empowering.



temperancehelp must also be balanced to be truly effective. going “overboard” in helping others neither helps them or you, in the long run. however you help someone, temper it with a balanced opposite (e.g. being with someone all day one day, yet leaving them be on their own for another)



justicesimilar to temperance, justice also needs to apply. people’s actions have consequences. helping someone doesn’t mean sheltering them from their own deeds.



unconditional givingthis is sometimes the toughest thing for people to understand, let alone do. helpers can end up feeling unappreciated, even discouraged, if they don’t get some return from the receivers (“not even a ‘thank you’ is a typical complaint). that’s a sign that you gave with some sort of expectations of a return on your investment. it’s not your place to judge the outcome either. true giving gives with nothing expected in return.



win toodon’t lose in order for someone else to win. if you deplete yourself, you will only be able to give for so long.



never empty your cup into another, but rather let your overflow quench the world….

read more…catch your second windjanuary 16, 2021articlethere is a place beyond exhaustion, called the “second wind.” people not only wish for it, they rely on it to get their stuff done.



it’s a fickle monster though. it doesn’t always come when we call it. yet there are things we can do to coax it out of hiding…



don’t keep pushing so hardthe second wind doesn’t always come after your first wind is gone. sometimes it comes before; and sometimes not at all. pushing yourself to exhaustion just results in exhaustion, so don’t force it.



don’t stop eitherdon’t do the opposite and just give up. you’ll end up losing momentum, and if the second wind comes, you’ll expend much of your energy just getting going again.



relaxthis goes with not pushing so hard, but it also involves some rest. by “taking it easy” for a little while, you actually give your second wind a chance to catch up to you.



do something stimulatingit could be that you’ve been stuck in one place for too long; so go do something different for a little bit. get outside, go for a walk; move around… just something else to break up the monotony.



get helpmaybe someone else can pitch in, to add to your strength… or at least give you a chance to rest some.



believe you can make itpeople drift towards what their mind is thinking. picture yourself exhausted and you’ll end up there; visualize yourself reaching your goal and you’ll keep going.



one… more… step…and sometimes you just have to micromanage yourself. think the next step… just the next one… then the next. narrow your focus to the task at hand, pass it, and keep going.



you can get much further than you think you can; just keeping keep catching the winds….

read more…don’t blamejanuary 16, 2021articlepointing the finger isn’t just child’s play. we still do it as adults… every day. and as long as it’s “someone else’s problem” we can just ignore it, right?… unfortunately that also robs us of something more important – our own empowerment.



putting off problems to someone else doesn’t solve it. in fact, it can come back and haunt you even more. so rather than deflect and defer, why not respect and respond?



don’t look for someone or something to blamethink of how much further you’ll get if you spend your time looking for solutions. besides, if you find someone else to blame, think of how much time they’re going to lose blaming you.



taking the responsibility isn’t taking the blamebeing “responsible” puts you in a position of power… and being in power means that you can help control how the solution will be implemented. are you really comfortable with someone else’s solution?



make allegiancesform a team of allies; especially with the person who started the blame game. there is less resistance if your “enemy” becomes your “ally,” and that will get you to the solution quicker.



keep relationships intactremember that the relationship between people is more important than winning an argument. if you can all value that, no problem is too big to tackle.



keep focus on the solutionsthere’s a natural tendency to want to figure out what went wrong, so as not to do it again. nothing wrong with that, except when the return on that investment amounts to very little. before you begin to look back, ask yourself if it would be better to just keep looking forward. some things are better just fixed and forgotten.



learn and move onwhen it’s all over, then you can review and see what not to do again in the future. then, once you learned something get on with it….
