2025 schedule






the 2025 rate will be $450. stating a price for the whole year is unheard of in the business world today.
like all iowans, my driver education automobile insurance increased $4912 last year. no accidents, no tickets, 3 less cars, 4 less drivers? meaning i will be spending $45 per student for 6 hours of instruction. when i started 15 years ago insurance cost $8 per student. thank you for supporting the two small businesses in the area. 
if gas is above $3.50 at casey’s on north pine street, there will be a gas surcharge for each student.
all classes will be delivered 100% online format. there will be no class time at my house. there will be 30 lessons that must be completed within the 30 days of the session. your student may complete up to three lessons per day. there will be emails sent to parents with the status of their child’s progress. if the 30 lessons are not completed within the 30 days, there will be a $30 surcharge fee to complete the course in the next session. we need a personal email address for students, since most school districts have tightened their outside email usage.
the 6 drives are 2 hours in length, with your child driving with another student during the 2-hour driving time lesson. during school days the drives are 5:30am to 7:30am, 4:00pm to 6pm, and 6:00pm to 8:00pm. on the weekends and holidays the drives will be 6:00am to 8:00am, 8-10, 10-12, 2-4pm. the driving times will be set up the week before class starts. calls will be made in the order of full payment. classes will fill up several months in advance, please plan accordingly.
this is my 15th year of owning aaaa driving school and change is constant for sure. i hope that the change to fully online will be a great experience for you as a concerned parent and your child to learn at their own pace in your own home. drives will be with verd and his staff.
driver education takes time, patience, and practice from you, your child and verd. your child will gain confidence, self-assurance, and positive driving skills during their time with verd and his staff.
we firmly believe driver education class is the most important class your child will take during their high school career. they will use the skills every day for the rest of their lives.
call me if you have any questions, 563-370-3778.
