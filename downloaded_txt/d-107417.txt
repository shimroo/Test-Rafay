dear beginner/intermediate
oil painter,

your search to get better
at oil painting can get ridiculous at times, canât
it?
how do i begin? how to oil paint ? am i doing it correctly?

oh, those questions iâm sure you have asked yourself in the past or are
still asking yourself today. iâm ethan
semmel and i started out painting like those painters you see on public
television.

the people who paint a landscape in 27 minutes or so.
the problem was, when i
went to the museums, i saw the greatest painters in
history. renoir, rembrandt, titian, raphael, monet.

how did they paint the fantastic pictures they did?

their paintings made mine look, frankly, silly. i could only paint a
landscape. and, my landscapes looked like the
cheesy kind selling for $17 in a shopping mall, not like their
fantastic paintings.
i was frustrated. "how do
i get the answers to my questions? how can i learn to
paint the way i really want to?"
you can go through the
years of frustration at art schools, like i did, to search
for the answers. but, youâll never get them there.
this is why i created
this web page. i knew other people like yourself were sick
and tired of that frustration that came with doing something you love.
i paint because i love
it, not because i want to be frustrated.
i always knew there was a
much better way for others to learn to oil paint. people
like yourself who are genuinely interested in learning oilpainting techniques or improving
need to get the help you want and
need.
and believe it or not,
there is much better help available for you to learn right
in your home rather than in some crowded class that might cost $2000
and may meet at times that are inconvenient
for you.
i decided to turn my
years of experiences with the frustration of learning to oil
paint into something positive that will benefit beginning and
intermediate oil painters like you.
when you donât get the
results you want, many times you blame this on your lack of
talent, but guess what?â¦
if you get the proper,
direct, instruction which is easy to understandâ¦you paint
better, period
the things beginning and intermediate painters never
hear
you can keep watching
painters on tv who only paint landscapes, or flowers. of
course if you were satisfied with that, you probably wouldnât still be
reading.
you can buy many of the
books out there.
many books out there are
not written by the artist. they have co-writers or
editors who know nothing about painting. but they do know about writing.
they do know how to turn
simple and direct talk into confusing babble that sounds
impressive and fills many pages with information that could have been
direct and simple.
oil painting instruction
doesnât have to sound "mystical".
you can enroll in some
expensive art school. the one i studied in, in new york
city charges almost $6000 for one class for a year. but, when you do
this, something happens that you never thought
would...
the problem with oil painting classes and oil painting lessons
many times the
oil painting course instructors would arrive 15-30 minutes late to class and they would
do the usual "thing" of going around the room and telling students,
while looking at their paintingâ¦
"this is too dark", "this
should be longer", etcâ¦
being the teachers
assistant gave me a wonderful insight. i heard all of the
students complaints.

"iâm not learning." 
"how do you get this
effect?" 
"why donât they tell
me exactly what i should do first?" 
"what medium should i
use?" 
"what brush do you
think i should use? 

i heard it all.
i was confused myself.
i made it my job to get
the answers to my questions on my own.
the thing they donât tell
you about art lessons: the teacher will come in to class
twice a week and spend around 5-10 minutes each class with you. many
will paint right on your painting and will not
give you information of much use. so oil painting for beginners is a long learning curve.
how to truly learn the secrets of painting techniques
so, what is the best way
to learn?
what works?
oil painting involves a
process that must be understood to be able to paint
better. the process itself is not complicated. the problem is you
probably have never been shown the real secrets
of oilpainting techniques.
at least not in a step by
step way that is easy to understand.
following the process and
using the techniques are easy. you simply follow step by
step information. a system, a procedure, and watch how you will paint
better than you ever have.
and, i mean the same
secrets used by the greatest painters in history. they
simply adjusted the techniques to fit their own personality and you
will do the same.
when that happens, you
will enjoy all the benefits of being a well respected
painter.

the compliments

the pride of hanging
your paintings on walls for all to see

selling your work

having people asking
for your paintings

winning awards in shows

the pure joy of
creating something beautiful 

well, you get the picture
from start to finish without frustration
just how do you really
learn the techniques of oil
painting? what would you
need to know to be able to paint wonderful
pictures from start to finish without frustration?
to really discover these
secrets, you need someone who has the information to give
it to you. and this is where i come in so...let me share with you what you really need learn so you can be
painting the way you really dream
about...
new materials and thinking like an oil painter
the first and most
important thing is that you need to learn the language of oil
paint. i will explain..
you see, the material of
oil paint has has certain physical
characteristics...
it is a wet paste,
it is applied with brushes, even just the fact that
the paint is applied to a canvas, (instead of rubbing like you do with
a pencil) at all is different than what
you have been used to for your whole life.
in other words, it is not
drawing.
ok, now as far as
thinking like an oil painter, this gets really
interesting...
an oil painter must see
the world differently than most people and this is the
first thing that you must learn.
one of the biggest
problems people have is that they see a subject like a vase of
flowers, or a person...meaning they see the end product...and then they
want to take those flowers or that person
and just plop them on canvas.
they don't know how to go
about building the picture. the steps to get to the end
product.
which brings us to...
you must change your thinking
you see, you must change
your thinking. and it starts with the most basic of
concepts.
you only have oil paint
and you must represent your subject (flowers, a person, a
landscape, or whatever it is) in paint.
the things you want to
paint are real, but all you have is paint.
knowing how to do this is
the process of translating what you see into
paint.
i'll let you in on a
little secrets they will never tell you in an oil painting
class..
discover how to do this,
and you are halfway there. when
you know this, you can paint anything at all.
not just landscapes or
people, but anything at all. itâs
the biggest secret there is.
i will show you how to do
this with the information here.
the process step by step
next you must learn the
process of oil painting. from
beginning to end.

imagine knowing what
to do in a step by step manner.

never again saying to
yourself "what do i do now?"

never becoming lost or
confused again while painting your paintings. 

and this is no different
than learning a procedure to anything else...for
example:
i think you would agree
that a surgeon knows the procedure to perform an
operation. a carpenter knows the procedure for building a cabinet.
well, you need to know a
procedure for making a painting of whatever you it is
that you want to paint.
when you begin your
painting, which of these steps should you do?
do you draw on the canvas
or panel right away?
do you draw on paper
first?
do you draw with pencil
on the canvas or panel?
the answer is you can do
any of these things, however, you should be able to
choose the method that best suits you.
of course the very
beginning is just one step. then you will need to know the
other steps in the process that you. this involves things likeâ¦

underpainting 
painting over dried paint - how to layer your paint 
glazing and
veiling
how to handle
edges 
checking
your composition 
translating nature
into a simple tone value system 
and more. 

you see, when you know
exactly what these procedures and techniques are you choose
which ones will help you to paint the picture you are working on.
you have
learned how to think like an oil painter.
you have learned how to
translate what you see into the language of
paint.
and now, you will have
learned the techniques to use so you can use your materials
and put it all together in a wonderful oil painting.
will it benefit you to
use a monochrome underpainting? if it will, you use one. if
it wonât, you donât use one. how to layer your paint, when and how to
glaze. you can only do this when you know all
the secrets of oil painting techniques.
now to get this
information, you may think you can enroll in a painting class, and
hope the instructor will teach you all of this vital information.
i have been through many
art teachers myself, and i must say, i
was not taught this vital information in a painting class. i
learned all of this
information on my own from more than 15 years research in museums and
trial and error.
and, i want to make my
research, knowledge and expertise available to you, but
first let me just let you know why you should listen to me...
backing up that this info is the real deal
you can be sure this
information i am going to share will work for you.
the first time i taught a
class at pace university was a great
experience.
let me tell you one
important thing about myself, nothing scares me more than
speaking in front of a large number of people, like a classroom.

i get very nervous

i sometime stutter,
which gets horrible when i am nervous and speaking in front of an
audience

i was panicked the
night before my first class 

but i was talking about
oil painting. after i got over my initial nervousness and
i saw the students actually get excited because they were truly
learning.
i discovered i had a real
knack for teaching oil painting. for teaching things
that would make students think "wow, i really learned something and it
works!"
students would ask me to
teach them privately. and i swore i would not teach the
same way as the teachers that i had. i knew there was a better way to
teach.
with the internet i can
now teach people all over the world. i could teach them in
a way that would not frustrate them and so they would actually learn
from the very first lesson.
** artists magazine website of the month sept 2002
the artists magazine
contacted us, own their own, and wanted to use this website
as their website of the month in september 2002 for the artists
magazine.
** many awards.
besides teaching private
art lessons, i have won many prizes and scholarships
including
the first recipient of
the newington-cropsey foundation art grant as well as their
traveling scholarship through the national academy of design. you can
verify this for yourself by calling them or
writing them.
the valerie delacorte
scholarship and the ernest and helen adams scholarship both
from the national academy of design in new york city.
i have won numerous first
place prizes in shows for portraiture and landscapes. i
have had many exhibits. my last exhibition was in florence italy.
i have paintings in
private collections of people that live on both sides of the
atlantic ocean.
i have been commissioned
many times to paint all types of subject matter, samples
of which can be found here. i do not tell you this to brag, but only to
show you that i know my stuff. i also enjoy
teaching very much.
and, you can view samples of my painting here (opens in a new window)
and of course, what shows my improvement
better than
"before and after" pictures (opens in a new window)
yes, this will work for youâ¦
you may be concerned that
the information i am going to offer you will not work
for you., but let me reassure you...yes this information will work
for you...

if you have never
taken oil painting courses, you have no bad habits to break. oil painting for beginners will be easy.

if you have taken oil
painting lessons in the past (perhaps you are "starting over" and wish
to do it the right way) and would like to learn to oil paint or improve
your current painting.

if you paint
landscapes or nature and would like to try people, or vice versa, it is
not as difficult as you think with simple, direct, and easy to
understand instruction.

if you currently paint
following the painters on public television and want to move beyond
that way of painting.

if you donât paint
very often, or not as often as you want to beâ¦most of the time from the
frustration of not knowing how to begin and other step by step
instruction you can easily understand.


with the information
i have for you, you can join the thousands of
people from over 23 countries throughout the world who have gotten the
instruction they desired and needed to reach
their full potential as an oil painter.
iâd hate it if you fall
into one of the categories above and didnât achieve your
full potential as an oil painter, because you thought it was impossible.
this is why i want you to
have all of my experience. over 15 years worth of
experience and personal notes in my home study course "the
insider guide to the secrets of oil
painting".
using this information
youâll finally have the easy to understand information that
will have you understanding more immediately - not months or years from
now.
with this course, here is
what is possibleâ¦

imagine knowing step
by step, how to paint your picture from beginning to end.

imagineâ¦ knowing
everything you need to do to use the same procedures that the greatest
oil painters in history used.

imagine knowing
everything about your supplies so that they will become your best
friends, as you know exactly what supply (mediums, brushes, canvases,
etc.) to use to make oil painting easier.

having no confusion
because you know you are doing it the right way.

imagine learning the
next time you pick up your brush because you have direct and easy to
understand information that works for whatever you like to paint -
still-life, portraits, landscapes or whatever you wish to paint.

imagine knowing a step
by step procedure to mix any color you want or need. saying goodbye to
muddy color as you know what colors to use before you pick up your
brushes.

here are just some of
the reviews iâve received






he received the secrets he wanted since collegeâ¦

"your information is like a passenger reading it to land a plane! all
the pilots secrets are in there. it brings back those college days,
where you weâre suppose to know instinctively how to master the
different medium. boy, do you hit home."






bill hegarty, virginia











she says universities donât teach this stuffâ¦

"i have gotten a tremendous amount of information. although i have been
painting for 35 years, along with achieving a mfa in painting &
drawing, your information lays out the fine details and techniques
which are rarely taught in todayâs universities. it is great for
teaching, as well as for use in oneâs own studio."








jenny l. lasswell, lasswell studios, texas










hasnât seen anything like it in 20 yearsâ¦

"i have been studying art as a hobby for the past twenty years, now
retired i am in my third year of a painting course with the "open
college of art" (part of the "open university"). during that time i
have never come across such practical informationâ¦ thanks for opening
another door for me - it was a great package well worth reading again -
and again."








brian clarke, united kingdom










like a treasureâ¦

"what a treasure trove!! my library has several hundred art books and
your information seems to be what i have been looking for. thanks
again."








judith lancaster, north carolina










would have saved him $$$ if he had it soonerâ¦

"i am very grateful for all the wonderful tips and wisdom you have
shared. this is a marvelous tool and iâm convinced that it will help
make me a better painter. my only regret is not having the information
about buying useless art supplies years ago! it would have saved me
lots of $$$ to buy more tubes of paint. i wish you continued success
and hope you come out with some more goodies shortly. i am on your
newsletter list, so iâll keep my eyes open for more stuff."








david kreinberg, maryland










learned more from this course than her
college coursesâ¦

"i opened it the second i received it. you taught me more then i
learned from the instructors at college! i especially related to the
paragraph that said to start to practice with student paint. the last
instructor i had insisted we begin with artist quality paints! i can
tell you i was set back about $300.00 and i never bought all the
required colors for the course! needless to say i was totally
discouraged and dropped the course. no, i didnât return the paints for
a refund. i hope you will be able to help me paint a picture with
themâ¦i wish you lived here in so. california so i could take lessons in
person. any way enough with this rambling, thank you so much for being
a level headed guy!"








karen dobbs, california










he was so thrilled he wrote his first
testimonial everâ¦

"i am amazed!! i am 58 years old and have never written a testimonial,
until now. i have dabbled in art for about 40+ years and have collected
many volumes on how to oil paint. 90% are of the "how to" variety. i have become
increasingly dissatisfied with the directions that i am getting and
thus becoming very suspicious. i ordered your information. i was
enthralled!! for the first time someone was telling me why, not giving
me their opinion! i am going to have a huge yard sale this spring and
get rid of several thousand dollars of "useless" art books! thank you
and keep up the terrific work. you will never know how many questions
you answered for me."








wayne williams, crestview, fl





plus, youâll understand all the secrets of color

a simple 3 step
process to follow to be able to mix any color that you see. 

how to easily think
about color like an oil painter. when you know how to think properly
you can apply this knowledge to any painting you ever create. the main
reason you are having problems is because you have never been shown an
easy to follow thinking process.

what exactly are the
colors i use and why, exactly, do i use them. itâs not guesswork. itâs
not because the colors are pretty. itâs an easy to follow reason that
you can immediately apply to your own choice of colors to use. 

how to properly
lighten and darken colors. this way, you can paint objects in their
light areas and shadow areas. if you donât know how to do this, muddy
color and you will remain great friends! 

the myths about black
paint. how to use black or not use black so it will help you achieve
the colors you want. and an example of how two of the greatest oil
painters could paint side by side-one using black and one not using
black and get just the effects they are after. 

easy to follow
examples of how to know what paints to use to mix whatever color you
want before you even pick up your brushes and start painting. 

the two ways for the
oil painter to use color with easy to follow examples. 

the properties of
every color. when you know these properties, you donât become lost
asking yourself "what do i do now?" 

what are the best
paints for you to purchase so you can easily mix any color you see.
this will end your confusion about buying paint and you wonât get
confused with the overwhelming choice of paint tubes in an art supply
store 

why you wonât find this information anywhere else
many art supply stores
are interested in selling you their products, even if you
donât need them. therefore itâs very hard to get them to cover these
lessons at their websitesâ¦in the long run, it
would cost them money.
this information comes
from over 15 years of constant and in depth
research.
i am not affiliated with
any school, and thus i donât have to answer to any
supervisors or "board members" who are more interested in their status
than in their students actually
learning.
this course is different
because i have experienced, firsthand, my own frustration
and the frustration of others while in art school. the wasted money and
time without learning much at
all.
i experienced the type of
teaching that doesnât work so i know to include only
things that will work.
i always knew when i
would teach, i would only teach students things that would
truly help them paint better. i enjoy teaching classes and watching the
students learn and become excited about the
information i give them.

it more than their college art
lessons.
this course is only
available through this website.
i used to charge over
$150 an hour for private lessons. so at bare bones minimum
youâre getting hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of oil
painting instruction at your disposal.
but, iâm not going to

did that, only wealthier people could afford my lessons. but, i am not
going to give them away either. after all it
is my knowledge and research of over 15 years

many people as possible able to comfortably invest in this
knowledge, and to make it an easy decision for you, i have decided to
run a marketing test and price my home
study course starting at 
1) immediately
downloadable version - regularly $97- order by         
, only $69.99 $35

promotion now on
2) dvd version - regularly $147 - order by          
, only $97 $49  - this version includes a bonus of 55 short video tutorials, sample images of which are shown below
 
these
tutorials are 2 1/2 hours of me going over the most important points of
the course right on your computer screen. they work on a pc or mac
computer.

adding this option will make the home study course a complete dvd set

both well
within the reach of someone who would go to an art store to buy their
supplies.
if you implement what i talk about in the course and put
the information to use, this small investment will
generate you multiple times as much - in pleasure, and admiration of
others - with the creations you can make, and
what others will think of you when they see what an artist you have
become.
what's more, your investment is completely risk-free -
since i offer a simple 90 day money back guarantee. if
you find the course isn't for you within 90 days of purchase, then
email me for a full refund or return the items i
sent you in the mail and you will receive a refund then.
if you realize that these oil painting
courses
could easily sell for hundreds of dollars. in fact if you just take a
look at the prices of other art lessons right
on the internet you will see what i mean.
here are some sample
listings of workshops and classes taken right from the
internet. you can see the days and hours the classes meet and the high
prices of them.

order now


now you have a choice - please choose wisely!
i'm presenting you here
and now with a simple choice.
you have an opportunity
not only to discover the keys to mastering your oil
painting techniques (as discussed in my 236 page course the
secrets of oil painting techniques made-easy), but
to master everything about your supplies as well (with
my course the secrets of oil painting
supplies made-easy) and to have the knowledge to mix any color you
want from now on (as discussed in my course
the secrets of color mixing made-easy),
sadly, over 90% of
the visitors to this site will read to the end and then
disappear, without investing in themselves. these people want what the
other 2% - 5% also want - to learn to
oil paint and paint better paintings - but they weren't willing to make
that small investment in themselves and
their passion that would propel them to their desired goal.
unfortunately, that's
just a reflection of life. 90% of people we meet in life
really just want to stay in their comfort zones, and only a small
minority actually take action to change their
lives for the better.
the other 2% - 5% of my
visitors - i'd like to count you among these - are smart
enough to recognize that they need to take action to make the change.
so please make your
choice, and i'll hopefully see you shortly as a
customer!...
"yes, i
want to order today"





sincerely,

ethan semmel
