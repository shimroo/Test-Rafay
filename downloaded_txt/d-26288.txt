rare cancers & tumors

welcome to the rare cancer alliance (rca) website. if you are newly diagnosed with a rare 
type of cancer or a pediatric cancer; you are no longer alone. rca's primary purpose is 
to disseminate information and provide support to all pediatric (childhood) and adult rare 
cancer patients. in the 
forums you will find people just like you - patients and survivors. there are mostly private forums, by rare cancer type, within 
categories.  when you have access to a forum, you also have access to all of the private forums within the same category.  
some of the forums are publicly viewable and they are marked as such so you will not post info you want to remain private within them. if you join a forum, please post a little 
about your own diagnosis, so far, by going to the introduce yourself topic and hitting the reply button there.   
you can also read some of the other patient stories, publicly posted, in the story 
section. our members are people who have had to go through the process of wading 
through information (or lack of it) for their own cancer. the information and support found 
on our website may save you precious time and energy.
within several main section of the website, you will see an expandable menu at the upper left (like this one).  they have access to many additional pages of information within each menu choice. 
just glide your mouse over each entry and they will expand out to the right to pages or additional submenus.  there is a lot of info on this website & the menu will give you 
quick access to some of it. if you want to see all pages, just click on the 
sitemap link at the upper right.
rca's secondary purpose is to offer a consolidated venue to raise awareness and funding for 
rare cancer research, which seldom benefits from donations made to general cancer research 
organizations. many rare cancers have unique traits with specialized treatment needs. please 
visit our page on  research funds. 
rca welcomes new information on other research funds.
