about




i am a serial bootstrap-entrepreneur in the data space. i bring a background as a seasoned data architect, software engineer, entrepreneur and leader focused on solving complex problems in simple, scalable and innovative ways. i started programming professionally at fourteen - data problems are my passion. 
i founded my first software business as a teenager, and grew it to serve 2,400 businesses in 11 countries and languages - all in pre-internet tech. my customers gave my company the name triplethreat software, and it has been the foundation for all of my other companies since. 
my love for cars led me to create simplepart, now the industry leader in retail ecommerce for automotive oems and dealers - and a five-time inc 5000 fastest growing companies honoree. from code i wrote in a coffee shop in east atlanta, i am proud to say that if you have bought a car part online from a car dealer in the last decade, you probably used simplepart to do it.
