jorge a.this place is wonderful, the treatment they give you is way beyond excellent!! i came to this place right when they closed and this dentist was still there but about to go home but when she saw me in pain she cares so much about that she took me in and helped me solve this issue!! if i could give them a 1k stars i would! thank you so much! 

sylviadr elias is top notch. she helped/rescued me and made my smile worthwhile again. i'm from texas visiting boston and my tooth (front) from my implant fell out. i had visited another doctor right before her. they were unable to do anything for me due to not having the correct tools for me. i was referred to dr elias. she was my good send angel. it took a woman's touch to complete the miracle i needed. 

susan r.i highly recommend dr. elias for anyone in need of a skilled and caring dentist. her professionalism, expertise, and genuine concern for her patients make her an outstanding choice for dental care. she and her staffs always keep the smiles that make you feel comfortable 

peter l.polite, courteous, professional and personable. thorough in explaining any issues and in preparing you for dental work.
very good at reviewing dental plan(s) coverage to help you plan properly in order to utilize your benefits to the fullest. we all need that! 

ann d.excellent staff. committed knowledgeable caring. brilliant doc. best i’ve ever had 

jsas s.i had a very pleasant experience with dr. elias and her staff.  having dental anxiety, dr. elias and her staff were prompt and very caring in easing my experience.  she was informative and provided valuable advice with my hygiene care.  i would highly recommend dr. elias at north shore dental center.
