i have retired from teaching!

  
		august 31, 2019 was my teaching 
		retirement day.  after 40 years of teaching, i look forward to 
		participating in quilt events rather than presenting and teaching at the 
		venues.  i will miss the interaction with students and quilt guild 
		members, who have been a source of inspiration.  if plans pan out, 
		a dent in my fabric stash will soon be visible, as new quilts are 
		created!

		thanks to my students for the opportunity 
		to teach you and learn from 
		you.

  jumping jacks, a new quilt, is made 
		from the spinning stars pattern.  the black background and 
		vibrant fabrics create a colorful and striking diamond log cabin 
		variation.
