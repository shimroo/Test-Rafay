where fun and learning come together
offering engaging summer learning camps for elementary and middle school students
bright lights is a nonprofit organization that has established a long tradition of offering engaging, high-quality summer learning camps for elementary and middle school students.
we believe learning should be fun. and with almost 100 camps offered each summer, there is something of interest for every student.
bright lights is a minds-on, hands-on environment and we encourage your student to be dressed for fun, active play and learning. movement breaks and recess will be part of the daily routine. specific instructions about camp attire (costumes, theme days, etc.), special items (such as a stuffed animal or doll) and craft supplies (cans, paper tubes, etc.) that can be brought from home will be communicated by the teacher the week before camp is scheduled to begin.
bright lights is not affiliated with the public schools and has no residency requirements.
