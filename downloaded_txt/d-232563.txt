charles goodrich reviews be broken to be whole by tom crawford



dec 4, 2024




i kept thinking about mark as i read and reread tom crawford’s be broken to be whole, a book packed with tales of gracefully plumbed misadventures—metaphorical, emotional, and spiritual, as well as physical, misadventures. crawford’s poems lead us to places we might not go if he weren’t tugging and cajoling us along. he earns our trust, though, with his own bravery and candor, and his startling perceptions, so we follow where he leads and wind up trembling at the unexpected prospect, glad to be alive.

lana hechtman ayers  reviews i remember not sleeping, by sherri levine



dec 4, 2024




a hybrid of poem, memoir, literary quotes, and graphic novel, i remember not sleeping is an extraordinary collaboration between oregon poet sherri levine and mexico-born california artist / illustrator moises camacho. levine’s title poem, which is the entire text of this book, relates the disorienting experience of being hospitalized for mental health issues in a foreign country. utilizing spare language and haunting images, in addition to being completely original, this volume is an homage to artist joe brainard’s 1970 beloved groundbreaking experimental memoir called i remember.

bethany reid reviews this one we call ours, poems by martha silano



nov 8, 2024




this one we call ours is not silano’s first prize-winning book, and it is signature silano, encompassing regions and geological ages, lacing even the most home-bound task with scientific observation. a less attentive poet, a less scientifically-minded poet, might say a bay is polluted. witness silano describing puget sound’s commencement bay: “tacoma kraft erected a paper mill / requiring 40,000 dump-truck loads to cart away // its deadlier-than-lake-erie-when-it-caught-on-fire / sludge.”
