further update

                            sadly we have sold musician pub. ( stc)
                            yes, after 25 years of unbelievably good live music from leicester and around the world a new chapter has begun.
                            the music has moved from crafton street west to garden street and will present at the international www.the-international.co.uk
                            itâs a superb venue so please do give it your support.
                        
                            after extensive talks with the music venues trust ( www.musicvenuetrust.com) a tough decision had to be made that the most sustainable route forward was to move as the building needs considerable amounts of money spending on it and the business faces huge financial challenges.
                        

                            so this is not the end, the story continues. yes lots of us put our hearts and souls into that building but times are changing.
                        
                        thank you to all who have joined the adventures along the way!
                        
                            a venue is nothing without the dedication and creativity of those who perform and work there so a huge thank you to all of the musicians, promoters, sound engineers, bar and door staff, cleaning staff, partners and supporters.
                            but most of all to you for buying tickets and loving music as much as we do!
                        

                            see you at the next gig !
