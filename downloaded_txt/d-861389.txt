goal
our goal is to bring into communication the variety of approaches to understanding human nature which have a regrettable tendency to be less in touch with one another than they might. we aim to act as host to original work and to seek to create an enabling space, a forum for constructive (including constructively critical) discussion and critiques of the terms of reference and assumptions of various approaches to the understanding of people as individuals, in groups, in institutions, in societies and as political and ideological beings.
