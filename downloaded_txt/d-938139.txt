for more than 90 years, minnesotans have looked to the urban league as a source of strength in the community. from employment to education to engagement, the urban league seeks to help african descendants strive for and achieve economic empowerment and self-sufficiency to build wealth that can be passed down from generation to generation.  



we envision a future in which african descendants can be fully engaged, empowered and invested in the success and well-being of the twin cities metro area. the urban league under­stands that the cultural heritage and assets of people of african descent are a rich resource of creativity, power and beauty.  



the urban league twin cities provided services to over 425 clients in 2022 and close to 2,000 in 2023 with the expansion of workforce solutions and 152,000 in 2022 indirectly and over 200,000 indirectly in 2023. 



we believe that a strong and systemic change is needed to transform our communities. the urban league plays a vital role as advocate and thought leader for issues affecting african descendants in the twin cities.
