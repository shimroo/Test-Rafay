your source for sobriety since 1985
our goldsmith shop has been designing and creating aa, na, and alanon jewelry for decades. what began as a way to support others in the program through finely crafted gold and silver jewelry, grew a business that employees members of aa and alanon, with the same goals and desires - to provide a treasured keepsake that pays tribute and acts as a reminder for the challenges and personal journeys that sobriety brings. 

		with our fully equipped goldsmith shop and onsite designer, we are here to not only provide a quality product but to offer our services to create custom pieces, design, laser engrave or cut to your specifications. jewelry is manufactured in house and guaranteed by us. 
		

		whether you are searching for the perfect piece of jewelry for youself, a loved one, a sponsor, or just a friend who needs a little push in the right direction, we are here to help you realize that goal.
