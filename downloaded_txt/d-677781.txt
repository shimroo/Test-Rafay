 [apr. 18th, 2004|06:20 am] she likes to sit amidst bright lights, it makes her feel bright. but inside, her soul is empty. she tries to fill it with the past but it is like filling up a large, black garbage bag with invisible cans--it's so empty. she stays up late to get through the next day, throwing hours around like she does with money. her bank account is -$49.27. she craves inspiration but is chokingly fed nostalgia. she would laugh if a boy came up to her singing sometimes i wish i was the catcher in the rye, sometimes i wish that i could catch your eye, but it'd be a good laugh. she wishes to find herself again, the good egg that was not cracked but isn't it that once you're cracked, you can't go back? she isn't sure. her heart wants to be happy again, to be cliche and not bitterly think oh how cliche. what is it like, she wonders, to smile without it turning upside down inside, to not always be a little bit sad, is it like hopping on one foot for a million hours--utterly impossible? they call her a bitch and she asks if that isn't a little bit true. but bitch is as bitch does and those who love her will love her, bitch self and all. in elementary school, games used to be fun but now that she's older, games aren't so much fun anymore and take at least two to play. some people yell at her for playing games still but she wants to yell back at them and tell them that if she had her way, she'd chuck those games up their ass while voting for bush. sometimes... she wants to getaway in a fastcar shewantsto getaway ina fastcar shewantstogetawayinafastcar but doesn't know where she'd go. she read a poem once about a beast in the desert eating his heart and it tasted really bitter. it didn't say what color it was but she imagines it to be black. she would like her heart to be red, like in valentine's day cards and for it to have a pink polka dots and white lace around it as well. that's what she'd like, anyway. <3. she remembers that eyes are the window to the soul but she doesn't think by looking into her eyes, one would know that all her soul really wants is to cling onto the string of a red balloon and float up to a smiling cloud 9 like in super mario world. she wants to wake up one early morn in a treehouse in the tallest tree on earth and watch as the sun casts its golden gloriance across its kingdom, waking the million sparkles in the ocean and telling them to dance, giving green to the trees and song to the nasty little birds that sing too early in the morning, illuminating the dark bluish gray sky first with hues of lavendar, pink, orange and yellow and finally bursting them into a brilliant blue and she will breathe, sharp, crisp and clear a morning that no one else has breathed and it will flow into her lifeblood, a new day. and when the day is over, she would like to sit in a red wagon, swinging her feet, drinking apple juice out of those boxed drinks where you have to stick a straw through the little tin foil circle...and not have her straw fall all the way into the hole and not be able to get it out.

i walked into healthyback today to pick up a job application for carolyn.  those healthyback salespeople dude! almost conned me into buying a tempur-pedic bed for $1533. i don't even have $100 in my bank account! and i can't even tell the difference between tempur pedic beds and normal beds. i told them that and they told me no, it was okay. it would be the best investment of my life, it would be like...sleeping on a cloud! hella hustling for 20 minutes!  man, i barely escaped and i didn't even get the application!

we took becky out for a kwan meal today. becky tried everything at dim sum except for the red chicken feet. what's wrong with chicken feet? just suck off the meat and spit out the joints!  the kwan family sleepover in san diego: mommy and daddy took over my room, stephanie, marianna, evangeline, christina and abraham crammed on sleeping bags in the loft with three pillows and one towel, two sleeping bags and three jackets as blankets. angela got the couch.  -dad had fun with the pool table. he says he used to hustle in college. it reminded him of the good old days.  -abraham, marianna and angela had a blast with my food pantry and super mario party.  -christina liked our movie collection and our food pantry, also our refrigerator and everything in it.  -evangeline liked my room decor and my photos. she also liked talking on the phone with jordan the whole freakin time.  -my mom liked carolyn's bathroom and the kitchen. she spent hours analyzing the walls, microwave and stove. -_-  update: i finally finished grading all the midterms, it was hell. i never want to grade another paper in my life. i don't think i can be a teacher. i want to be like kevin and be an optometrist. then i can spend the rest of my life saying, "1....or..........2? ....3... or 4?" and "read the 6th line down for me please." it'll be great!  ok. enough. i have to go back to studying. funny how today is a holiday but everyone's studying. so sad, we are students.

 still have 900 more to go. i hate these students.  they are so stupid. they waste my time. why don't they know the right answers. they write things like, "the t-allele is a very interesting example that i, myself find especially good for representing meiotic drive."  ............when all they are supposed to write is "the t allele serves as an example of meiotic drive because in heterozygote t+ males, sperm carrying the + allele are often non-functional due to the t-allele's two loci of d and r and thus, fertilize a smaller fraction of eggs."  someone else wrote "when a sperm has the t-allele, its flagella is up to snuff and powers that guy up and along his path, if it's the + allele, that guy has out and busted flagella and won't be making any babies. the t-allele will be able to reproduce and spread the love. good times, good times." ...what?!  oakejgialjeoiajtifeam. i hate them. i can't even go out or play or study for my own tests because of these stupis epgjkslkgmae

it feels like forever since i've been back, home is good. :)  i was slowly starting to feel like steph of san diego rather than steph of hacienda heights but now that i'm home, being steph of hacienda isn't quite all that bad either.  i learned how to play poker last night. i've always regarded it as one of the greatest evils but i was enthralled by the idea of keeping poker faces, playing mindgames, manipulating people and lying. how could i resist? the very essence of it appealed to me in a twisted fashion.  after watching the guys and carolyn for 5 hours and wash up $40 each for a 1st place jackpot of $100, 2nd place of $40 and 3rd place of $20, i decided i could take them on.  they taught me about straight flushes, two-of-a-kind, full houses, and all that good stuff because i am not a card person and had no idea what any of that stuff was. they taught me what the different colors of the poker chips meant. i must've seemed so stupid in this area because when it was my turn to deal, geoff asked, "here steph, do you know how to shuffle?" so sad!  i had fun, it's like playing super reverse reverse psychology on them because they thought i didn't know how to play and i didn't really, i was just playing by ear but i had been watching so i kinda knew how each of them bluffed. ben was playing too and dude, ben is as easy to read as a good book.  sometimes i won rounds on accident, other times i would bluff and they'd all fall for it. :) i screwed up when it came to tom though, he called all in and i didn't think he could beat my hand. but ah! he took all my money! right after i took most of cree's chips! i helped him win the jackpot. -_-  i was trying to grade midterms at the same time but it was so sad, i graded for 3 hours and the stack only went down 1/10000000000000000000000 of an inch. now i know how tas react when students write stupid answers and try to bs their way out of it. they read the paper and say, "what the hell! this student is so stupid!" and scribble all over the paper and then at the bottom, scrawl 0.  we saw the sky getting light and we spent a long time trying to figure out when the sunrise would be until we figured out that hell, we didn't care. i crashed for about 2 hours on geoff's $3000 leather couch and headed down to la in the morning, half asleep and bleary-eyed, got lost in costa mesa, circled around the same freakin streets dejavu style until i finally found the freeway again.  i came home and slept for 45 minutes, painfully woke up and took my dear siblings out to banana bay for lunch. abraham ordered this huge pot of hot and sour soup. but it was thai style, it ended up tasting like dish detergent lemon sour soup. it was by far, the nastiest ish i've ever tasted.  we were just going to bring it home and ask our mom to fix it cuz dude, we spent $5 on that!! but we ended up playing a game for shots of that nasty soup. we played the game where everyone plays when they go to banana bay. the one where you go around and say the name of a food and then the next person has to name a food beginning with the last letter of the previous word. ex: apple.... egg....grapes.  and if you cheated by helping another person, you had to drink the soup too. christina would gleefully dole out portions to each loser. evangeline lost first, then angela and then abraham. then christina lost and she totally bailed and walked out. we sat there until she came back and drank that nasty soup. :) we played for a long time and we were the loudest ones in the restaurant. we were so into our game that we didn't even notice we were loud until everyone at the next tables were glaring at us. we disrupted someone's date. o_o  we went to dollar tree after and shopped galore for candy. :) then i came home and helped evangeline out with her college apps. omg, it was so horrible! it was like reliving a nightmare.  dinner time, we played our game again, this time with our parents. my dad was all into it and he was so nervous and excited. we didn't have any nasty soup this time around so we had a pot of chicken in the middle and whoever lost had to eat a chicken leg in 10 seconds.  my dad lost first. he never eats with his hands. he likes to eat french fries with chopsticks. so he picked up the chicken leg with his chopsticks and started eating. but then we started our countdown and he panicked and grabbed the leg with his hand and started eating chunks like a madman. it was quite funny to see my dad, who likes to be civilized, in that state of array.  my mom wolfed down her chicken too. it's such an uncivilized punishment and it's so funny to see my parents succumb and participate in being unmannered.  my dad's english vocab is terrible. o_o we would say seagull! and he'd be all confused and say, "wait, what? what's that!" or it would go something like this:  me: sea anemone! abraham: elephant! angela: turkeys! dad: what does that end with? everyone: s!!! dad: oh! ...zebra!  ...it was classic. and half the time, i got away with murder. what animals start with the letter 'n'? i couldn't think of any so i just pulled up a big word and sprung it on my family. i said "nemesisyticalia yot." and they would say, "huh? what's that?" and i would say, "oh! you guys are so stupid! don't you know?! it's that sea animal that is related to the sea anemones!" and they would kinda have blank looks on their faces but then brush it off as "eh, steph knows best. she's the most educated one among the kids and has better english than all of us anyway." it was great. i even got away with saying that a "xenophile" was some sort of rodent. cuz cmon, what animal starts with 'x!' evangeline said fox and that killed me. i think i cheated but shhh, don't tell them. ^_^  my brother had to go bathroom in the middle of a round so he went to the bathroom next to the breakfast room and we had to yell our answers so he could hear through the wall and then when it was his turn, he would yell his answer and so we continued playing regularly.  the last round, everyone was sick of eating chicken so the punishment was that the loser had to sing a song opera style with hand motions. when it was my mom's turn to be punished, my dad started singing and wouldn't let her sing. he was so annoying! he was enjoying the punishment too much and it wasn't even his turn!  my mom ended up singing "amazing grace" opera style. it cracked us all up. oh btw, another one of angela's jokes for you: why did the kid laugh at his snack? ...because it was a cracker! (hahaha).  my dad sang a song he made up with hand motions. we wanted to make my mom rap but then we were too scared to even suggest that. good times. :)  dude, my brother's a punk. he just handed me a list and said, "here, this is what you can get me for my birthday." his birthday is in january! i need to survive this month and christmas first! this month is freakin crazy... evangeline, ben, my mommy, tim, jennie and cheerio all have their birthdays this month~ hella stress. i tried to buy ben his birthday present yesterday, i was so stressed out that i couldn't find anything that i ended up spending $200 on myself! i got home and looked at all my stuff and i was so mad. my reaction was pretty much what the heck is all this crap i bought!? i have some madd returning to do. :(  i randomly saw the college brochure that dartmouth sent to evangeline. jason lee was in there! man! he already made his mark on his college! what am i doing!  it's getting so cold nowadays, i love it. it's gonna be time to get a good fire crackling, roast marshmallows, lie on the rug wrapped up in a blanket, read a good book and drink hot chocolate. i am quite the sap.

-professor told the class today that i had the most comprehensive field notes she's seen in 3 years.  -doug walked me to class today and apologized.  -i was on the phone with ben and i thought class didn't start yet so i walked into the lecture hall talking really loud on the phone and everyone turned around and looked at me.  -a girl in class asked me a stupid question right when i was eating and i tried to swallow my food so i could answer her even though the answer was clearly written on the blackboard already and all she had to do was look. i choked and almost died.  -relive a1 at random: i've been thinking about the meaning of life got plenty of butter but i don't have a knife watching tv makes me really upset i wonder why i haven't been on it yet i made a lotta money but i got nothing to show. i gotta find a way to invest in zeros.  -i was struggling to stay awake in biology but then i remembered that i left my pen at center hall and i had an adrenaline rush and stressed over my pen for the rest of the lecture and didn't fall asleep at all. i rushed over to center hall after class and found my pen. it was on the floor. it was the happiest moment of my day.  -i saw a lady at carl's jr get so mad today because they didn't have envelopes for their gift certificates. her face turned green and purple and red and she screamed and yelled so loud. i think she was having a bad day.  -i graded 5 midterms so far, it's hell.  -i am going to sleep at 9:30pm tonight.

seattle - uttering the word "guilty" 48 times with chilling calm, gary leon ridgway admitted wednesday he is the green river killer and confessed to strangling four dozen women over two decades â "so many women i have a hard time keeping them straight."  choking is what i did and i was pretty good at it," the 54-year-old former truck-factory employee said in papers submitted as part of his plea bargain.  "i wanted to kill as many women as i thought were prostitutes as i possibly could," he said in a statement that was read aloud in court by a prosecutor and opened an extraordinary window on the twisted mind of a serial killer.  he said he left some bodies in "clusters" and enjoyed driving by the sites afterward, thinking about what he had done. he said he sometimes stopped to have sex with the bodies. in many cases, the killer had sex with his victim and then strangled her.  "i picked prostitutes as my victims because i hate most prostitutes and i did not want to pay them for sex," he said.

this day so needs to end.  my midterm yesterday killed me, i fell asleep in the middle of it, woke up and bubbled in the rest of the scantron, abdec abdec over and over cuz really, the questions were utterly incoherent and i had not the slightest clue of what the answers were, despite hours of painful studying.  this morning, i had another midterm. i hate it when i know the answer but i just don't know how to write it down. it's kinda like...you know your brain works but you're just not really sure how it works...exactly. well anyway, it's like that. kinda. essayed until i didn't even know what i was talking about anymore. it's great, just unloaded everything in my brain into my blue book, too bad midterm graders don't like blogstyle cuz then i would've written a lot more.  i had ta office hours with hoang, peter and tommy at geisel, they took up a good chunk of my sleeping time. i felt so sorry for them, they didn't know anything for their bio midterm! i re-explained things and hoang would sometimes have this look of pure hopelessness plastered on his face. he said to me, "i have to tell you a secret. we don't belong here. we got into ucsd on accident."  he told me that he, peter and tommy are third year transfers from pasadena city college. in high school, they had a 2.4 gpa and they scored roughly 780 combined on their sats. they don't know how they got into ucsd and they want out. he said that they don't know how to study, they haven't studied since 7th grade.  i was so tired after tutoring them and i still had to go to field work. i went home first and slept for one minute. then i drove to my field work.  doug poked my arm fat with a no. 2 ticonderoga pencil while he was tutoring mike. he said to mike, "dude, you gotta try this sometime, it's one of the better things of life, watching the fat on a girl's arm jiggle." -_-  i got reprimanded by a world famous researcher and ucsd professor, michael cole. i have made my mark on fame. doug had told mike that i would break mike's neck if i was his tutor. i begged to differ. i told him that i would be a great tutor and told doug to shut up. michael cole walked by, cuz he just decided to randomly drop in and observe our field work, and snottily said, "remember, you guys aren't in junior high anymore." except i was the one who he directed his comment to since doug was across the room. he's going to hear about it in my field notes. i told my professor what happened, she laughed at me and said i should feel honored that he decided to speak to me, oh posh.  i proctored the bio midterm today, a full hour and 20 minutes. it was interesting, sitting at the front of the classroom with the other tas, watching carolyn, stacey, nahoe, tommy, hoang, peter and my other students squirm and stress out. it was also kind of boring because we just all sat there, staring at the students, like they were a show. i hope jennifer gets an a+, she better! i hella tutored her yesterday, she wrote out a page of questions to ask me. o_o  i want hoang, peter and tommy to do okay too, just cuz i know they stressed and spent the time studying and they tried, i know. although at one point, i saw one of them seriously lean over and look over at the guy's paper next to him. he had a hat on but no, nobody sits leaning sideways like that with their head facing towards the left when they are taking a test. i laughed to myself when i saw him do that because i felt so sorry for him, he must've been so lost. he looked up right when i was looking at him and laughing and he smiled sheepishly and ducked his head. it's hard playing the bad guy.  we all had to take home hella midterms to grade. i have a huge stack of midterms on my desk right now. hehe, i want to look for carolyn's. ^_^ professor chao gave us the answer key and instructed us to be super generous and lenient. he said, "if they even come remotely close to the right answer, give them 2 points, if you're not sure, give them 3 points, 4 points..." dude, i wish my professors were all like that.  i don't have to ta tomorrow. i asked the professor about it today and he was like, "okay you can cancel your section." and then he wrote it on the board in big letters. nov 5th sections canceled. i swear, i was so happy, i just stood up there and beamed. then the professor told the class, "sections tomorrow are canceled, does anyone object?" carolyn raised her hand but he ignored her. ha.  joe's back! he called me up... man. you know it's joe when the conversation goes like this... me: hi joseph! what's up? you're back in america! when'd you get back? joe: i getted back in the yesterday. me: oh! am i the first one you called? joe: no, when i get back, i calling the chris first.  ...so sad, his english has severely deteriorated. he must acknowledge his u.s. citizenship and stay away from taiwan for awhile, all fobbed out.  in any case, the day is almost over and i am ever so glad.

let's fall asleep together,hold me darling 'cause i'm scared,and i can't do this alone.--thrice in kindergarten, i went to badillo elementary school. our mascot was the armadillo, get it? badillo armadillos, how cool was that. we had the best playground in the world and i was elated to be an elite member of such a public school as this.  after a few years, the board deemed the armadillos not cool enough to represent, so they changed it up to panthers. so we were the panthers.  the teachers passed out paw prints (because panthers have paws, you know), which were yellow square sheets of paper with a paw drawn on it and good job! written in the middle. those yellow papers were the highest symbols of prestige and honor. if you committed a commendable deed, such as turning in your homework on time, being quiet when everyone else was being obnoxiously loud or giving up your place in front of the line to someone less fortunate, you, lucky duck, would get.... a panther paw.  anyone who had a panther paw got to be dismissed first, which is a big deal when time stretches to eternity and beyond in elementary school. proud owners of panther paws also got to go to the library first (which was the sole reason i liked panther paws so much, who cares about recess when you have no friends!) and they also got to be the first to estimate the number of jelly beans in the jar. during lunch time, all you had to do was wave your panther paw in the air and *snap* just like that, vip treatment, you would be ushered to the door and let out of the cafeteria into the freedom of the playground, sandbox, handball walls, double dutch jumprope, monkey bars, chinese jumprope, foursquare and hopscotch patterns, jungle gym and a green expanse of field to do whatever it was that your little heart desired, besides what would land you in mr. martinez' office. ...but i digress.  in kindergarten, i went to badillo elementary school. i had an ugly dark green thing that my mom called a backpack that was bigger than i was. when i stuck my arms through the straps, the ugly thing would hang down to my knees.  i, for one, felt it was very unbecoming for my princess complex but nevertheless, didn't i know, when they were my age, my mother and father both had to be content wearing ugly clothes in china so that they could save money to have a little bit of rice on their plates and they would've been ever so thankful and happy to have had a backpack of their own, and here i was, their firstborn daughter, so undutiful, ungrateful and so vain, it was unheard of.  so in kindergarten, when i went to badillo elementary school, i was dropped off in an ugly blue van, wearing an ugly green backpack, sporting an ugly bowl haircut with bangs chopped off too high. it was also a developmental idea of my mother's to dress me in the same pair of pants every day for a week, it saved money for clothes, you know as well as laundromat costs. at least i had two shirts that i could switch off every other day, cuz you know, maybe no one else would notice that little steph kwan wore the same red apple shirt mondays, wednesdays and fridays and then wore the same yellow snoopy shirt every tuesday and thursday.  i had a blast in elementary school. i never got picked on by bullies, i always wanted to be punked so i could give up my $1.50 lunch money like those heroes in the books i read. i wanted to limp home, blackened in the eye, bleeding from the lip, the glory that would bring and the horror it would incite in my mother. then i would be able to tell her i got beat up because she made me wear the ugly green backpack to school.  but as much as i hated that backpack that i so faithfully wore to school, containing one no. 2 pencil and one pink eraser that said pink on it and didn't erase very well and left red marks on my paper, i was protective of it. every day in kindergarten, during naptime, i would go to my cubby, gather all my belongings which consisted of my scrunched up ugly green backpack stuffed in there and my dotted handwriting papers of beautifully drawn a, b and cs with my teacher's stamp of approval on it that would vary between terrific! and fantastic! and excellent! and an a+ job! and grrrrrrreat!  i would arrange my treasures in a circle around me, sit on my naptime mat, eat my snack of golden graham crackers, then i would lay down carefully on my mat amidst my stuff. occasionally, i would pop up to brush away little graham cracker crumbs that would poke into my skin as i laid on my mat. i also rested with one hand clutched to one of the straps of my green backpack, in case anyone tried to steal it while i was sleeping. no matter i didn't really like it, it was mine. and it's always been like that. i like things that are mine to be held close, crumbs elsewhere.

ridiculous: inspiring scornful pity  so looking back, it dawns on me that i've pulled a minna. i used to hate her for that you know? cuz dude, how could she just up and leave? break away and move on, hideout and forget? such a wuss way.  but it's funny cuz the very people who complained that she hurt their dear feelings, are the ones forced her demise. boo-hoo, and so i was sitting here wondering why it was that i was so mad at her? and i realized that it's only because she left me all alone to deal, that flaker.  in any case, it looks like i've gone and done the same thing, fire and brimstone on my head, it's nice to get away sometimes. now i understand why she did what she did.  she had to.

uhm... i think i will now officially remove myself off of listserv. hella random emails...  subj: [vohepic] more diversity date: 11/3/2003 10:30:24 pm eastern standard time from: dcaboy****@yahoo.com to: vohepic@yahoogroups.com reply-to: vohepic@yahoogroups.com sent from the internet (details)   hey chris and epic, you know what i c at epic alot. alot of asians, i know theres alot of asians in the area, but theres also alot of american people that are christian. asians are still the minority in the fifty states of america, ecept for california, we are 7% and whites are 11%. but in the fifty states, asians are about 2%. our numbers are growing, but, our voh should have more american people or at least some anglos saxons americans. we are segregating ourselves from them. lets bring more diversity into this church. i know voh has been a chinese church, but lets let some vietnamese, japanese, filipinos and some americans in. more diversity is better, this is not chinese cali or even asian cali, or viet-cali, this is america, lets have white americans inside our church and invite them.the christian religion was started by white americans even before asian immigrated to california. lets let our founding fathers's ancestors into the church. without them, wed been back in asia, and segregated like in the 1920's when chinese were beaten and made slaves by the whites. wed be beack in china, looking for fish in the ocean,and eating chow mein with chopsticks in villages of china and vietnam. lets bless america under one nation with our original owners. (written on behalf of nathan devries) bye god bless

hey, i forgot about cyrano de bergerac, that was my favorite play! valvert: your nose is ...very big. cyrano: yes, very. valvert: ha! cyrano: is that all?  ----  christian: and now? roxane: your true self has prevailed over your outer appearance. i now love you for your soul alone. christian: oh, roxane! roxane: ...but you can be happy now: your thoughts outshine your face. your handsomeness was what first attracted me, but now that my eyes are open i no longer see it!  ----  cyrano: i take your hand to kiss. (he kisses her hand as though she were a princess.)  ----  cyrano: and what is a kiss, when all is done? a promise given under seal--a vow taken from the shrine of memory-- a signature acknowledged--a rosy dot over the i of loving--a secret whispered to listening lips apart--a moment made immortal, with a rush of wings unseen-- a sacrament of blossoms, a new song sung by two hearts to an old simple tune-- the ring of one horizon around two souls together, all alone!  --edmond rostand  i remember senior year, we had to recite a page from cyrano. rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead by tom stoppard was also fun. if anyone would like to buy me a copy of cyrano de bergerac, it is only $1.18 on amazon.com. :)

i changed my mind.  i want to name my son ryden and my daughter riley. i will refer to them as ryden and riley kwan for now, until further notice of marriage, at which point their last names will be rectified accordingly.  maybe riley anne kwan for now, if i feel like being nice and not bequeathing to them a hyphenated and unenglish middle name like my dear parents did to me. i'm into the anne state, i need to stop reading and writing papers about anne of green gables.  ------- she had wished for her name to be cordelia. it was so much more romantic. but really, if her real name must be known, it was anne. anne spelled with an âe,â mind you, because it vexed her terribly to have her name called ann. she thought it rather unimaginative and unbecoming. it meant a lot to her because, being an orphan, she didnât have much to revel in and her only consolation was her imagination, romantic ideals and love of pretty things.  anne, happily loquacious and hopelessly mischievous, had been a terrible mistake at first. marilla and matthew cuthbert had sent for a sturdy boy to help out on the farm at green gables but anne, decidedly a girl, had been sent instead. but nonetheless, she had been adopted because they could not bear to disappoint the hopes of her, the skinny little orphan girl with starry eyes and a tender heart.  steph kwan, pg. 1 -------  â...i try to imagine that i am the lady cordelia. but itâs a million times nicer to be anne of green gables than anne of nowhere in particular, isn't it?â  everybody and their mom should read this book.

i stole this from jason lee's xanga, it makes darn good sense. what is the only tangible example of an infinitely small point in space?  the present moment.  this is important because it tells us that the past and future are an illusion of the mind.  they do not exist. they exist only in our minds. that is why those who live in the past or future are typically unhappy.  for example, those who are obsessed with the glories/devastation of things past or those who are paralyzed by fear of the future. this is because they are living in a world of illusion, a world which, by definition, is not reality, because it does not exist at present.  the future is unique in that, it has yet to come. so, even though you should not live in the future, you can be aware of the future, mindful. just as you can be aware of what has happened to you in the past, mindful.  but do not let either take priority of that which is under your control and of utmost importance, the present. for the present is all you have.  and any vision you may have of the future will spring from the decisions and thoughts you have of the present, a singular point in time which is in actuality infinite.  be mindful of the present, for, in reality, that is all that is.

so technically, i read everything i was supposed to read for my midterm.  but it's like reading invisible words, i'm not really even sure what i've been reading. i can't get a grasp, if i had to write one sentence about what i read, i wouldn't even be able to do that. essentially, i just read words, many words and that, ladies and gentlemen, is about all i can tell you.  i am so screwed, i want to pummel myself into a wall and bury myself in there and just stay there until thursday. on top of things, my students from bio have been emailing me, asking me hella questions and if i can meet up with them so they can ask me more questions. those cruel, heartless little nerds! have they no sense of empathy!  >>hi, i was wondering if there was anytime tomorrow when you were free, so that i could go over some questions i have concerning the graphs for selection, # 12 on one of the midterms and also a few other questions. i have class at 8am and 10am. please respond as soon as possible!  >>to try to solve this, i found q^2 to be .34 (170/500) and q=.58. p then equals 1-q or .42. therefore 2pq=.49. however when i multiply .49 by 500 i get 245, which is not possible because there are only 230 rh+ individuals. can you please explain this.  i feel like emailing them back and telling them that i have two midterms too and i have to go see my own tas... :( i don't want to answer their questions! o_o  i was so sleepy this morning because i didn't get my 8 hours yet, the only way to achieve my 8 hours was if i slept until late afternoon but carolyn kept walking in and telling me to wake up. i was so sad because she broke my sleep cycle. i was about to go into rem again! i love monitoring my sleep patterns. :)  my schedule for today was just to wake up, shower, sit my diligent self down and study my brains out. that's why i wasn't looking forward to waking up. i tried to prolong the the uninevitable for long as possible.  ben called me up when i was still in my sleeping state and told me to go open the door downstairs, i told him i was so tired that i didn't want to. it didn't occur to me that he wanted me to open the door because he was here. -_-  i woke up in a hurry when it dawned on me that he was here and i ran downstairs to open the door for him. :) he came to surprise me! but then i left him in carolyn's room to talk about tetrinet and i went back to my room to sleep.  when i woke up, we talked about gi joes with carolyn and we talked about what pseudonyms we would have if we were prisoners of war. i said i wanted to be anne but they said i didn't look like an anne. i want to be anne tran, so it rhymes.  we went to souplantation to eat lunch at 3 and watched a lady spill her whole tray of food on the floor. i was so glad it was her that dropped her tray and not me. :)  after food coma, ben left to drive back to la and i tried to start studying but it's just so hard to study when i'd rather be counting polka dots.

you know, for the past 7 weeks, i've been telling myself i'll work out next week.  but really, i really will work out next week.  i'm feeling crazy bloated right now.  i think i'm pretty much running on taiwan time. for the past 3 days, i've been sleep at 6am and waking up at 3pm the next day.  well today, i meant to sleep at 1am but then me, ben and carolyn started playing tetrinet and played on until 4. of course ben going, "3, 2, 1 starting game" every time me or carolyn said we had to go study didn't help things much. i racked up 27 points. ^_^  so then it was 4 and me and carolyn decided we were hungry so we went off in search for jack in the box. we drove all around del mar and even ran a red light, but nope, no sign of jack in the box.  so we drive to solana beach to their carl's jr. but the carl's jr didn't take credit, so we drove to washington mutual, got cash (new $20 bills!) and went back to carl's jr, ordered our food and waited 10 minutes for them to make it, came home and ate our hearts out.  now i am going to sleep.

why do they call reading, writing and arithmetic the "three r's?" i broke my aim fast today, i signed on for some minutes, it was very horrible. i hate aim, although it was nice to reassure a select few that i am, contrary to popular belief, very much indeed, alive and not dead or living on another planet.  phil called me up today. :) he says he misses hanging out, we're going to get boba tomorrow!  ok secret: everyone's out partying (even jane who is dressed up as robin hood, complete with bows and arrows and em, becky, baani and jen who are dressed up as slutterflies) but i am studying. :) it's great! a party with my books.  i am bogged down by millions and millions of pages of readings. there are so many words!

i've found my new passion. --> oneword.com  one word, so little time. simple. you'll see one word. you have sixty seconds to write about it.  as soon as you click 'go' the page will load with the cursor in place.  don't think. just write.  sunday's word: roses.  "dead flowers seem like useless gifts when they're supposed to be the sign of ones love. "thanks, they're dying..." and they have thorns. tough love, i guess." ==jason==  i disagree but that's darn well written for sixty seconds...especially compared to this guy's...  "i like roses. i like to give them to girls as presents. a lot of the time i don't know the girls, and they give me wierd looks. of course, what girl is going to say no to receiving roses. i also ask for there phone number, but they always say no."  today's word: scout  "scout the fairylands, far and near. be the first to see, to breathe in the glittered dust, walk the carpeted lavendar and fly the pink sky scarfed with ribbons of golden rod and delicate cloud wisps. be bold, bleed red, walk through thorns and briars, for scouting is only for dreamers brave of heart." ==mine==  "he scoured the lands in search of her, sent his men in all directions, rode for days and nights on end, to find his bonny lass. he wanted her hand in marriage, he wanted his heart for his own, he wanted to show her his world, to share his kingdom with her." ==random persons that was good==  "boy scouts wear ugly socks." ==another random guy's==

apparently, the san diego school district is closed until monday. that means no work tomorrow, so my weekend officially starts now. :) i hella stressed over a paper i thought we had to read before this class today, the teacher canceled the reading, i can't believe it, i keep getting screwed! i should be a slacker, that way i won't waste any energy. i stayed up til 6 am this morning for nothing! i seriously tried to wake up at 7:30 for my discussion section at 8:30. i was so tired, it was so painful trying to wake up. i finally crawled to the bathroom, undressed to take a shower but then just decided not to go to class, put my pajamas back on and crawled back to bed and slept for another hour.  when i got to school, i was so tired my whole world was spinning. it was like everything was in slow motion and suspended and my head felt so fuzzy and my eyes felt bloody. i sat in class and battled my consciousness, trying to stay awake. it's the hardest thing in the world to keep from falling asleep when consciousness keeps slipping away.  i stared at the clock on the wall, it was going well moving from 11:00 to 11:50... i saw the clock hands at 11:50... struggled to stay awake, zoned out for a little bit, stared back at the clock. it was still 11:50. i thought i was losing my marbles, time was going by so slow. it was crazy, i couldn't believe how slow time was going by and i was so tired. i looked away from the clock and tried to focus, everything the professor was saying came out garbled and fuzzy to my cotton balled brain, i glanced at the clock again. it was still 11:50, it was killing me... i decided to stare at the clock and not look away until a minute had passed. it was unbelievable, time was crawling... the darn thing wouldn't move! my whole concept of time was warped. every second stretched out into 10 minutes... time was practically standing still for me. it was still 11:50! i was going nuts. unbeknownst to me, the clock had stopped working at 11:50. i didn't realize that until it was 11:50 for half an hour. i felt pretty disgusted with that clock. i got my midterm back in lit class. 100%! :) so happy. i thought i failed that one. i walked into bio review session today and hoang happened to be sitting in front of me. he turned around and said, "hey t.a.! i'm going to fail the test! i tried to study and i can't remember anything!"  he started asking me all these questions... and then stacy was like, "dude, stop asking her questions! she doesn't know anything!"  i said, "aah! i do know what i'm talking about! ask me more questions!"  so stressed out. -_- she's trying to blow my cover!!  weirdest thing, tommy and peter were sitting in front of hoang and hoang kept moving away from me when i was talking to him... like off to the side and it was totally throwing me off. i didn't realize what he was doing until i saw tommy aiming his stupid camera phone at me. that's great. -_- my students are taking pictures of me. i must be a great ta.  i tried to write a letter to chris leung today in ling class, but class was so boring that it got to me and i couldn't think of anything to write. class registration dates are coming up again, it's crazy. the quarter is half over. mine's november 12th, i looked up the classes i want to take. i only have 10 more clases to take for my major. if i take full load, 5 each quarter for winter and spring, i can graduate at the end of this year and save hella money.  becky and jen just went to naho's...for a halloween party. carolyn said she didn't want to go cuz she didn't want to drink. becky looked very surprised that there was going to be drinking there... she thought the halloween party was to bake pumpkin pies and sing songs about halloween. she thought wrong. i didn't go because i don't want to see any monsters or vampires.  evangeline told me she wants to dress up as a tree for halloween. the whole kwan family has yet to go trick-or-treating. we've never been. jen asked me what i was going to do for halloween and i told her i was going to study and she told me, "shut the hell up" and walked away.  but really, halloween is my 1/4th birthday. i made a sign and put it on my door already. i'm celebrating myself. :) i have to do it myself... because i think no one else cares that i'm turning 20.25 years old.  you know, today i forgot that my name is stephanie, i've gotten so used to thinking myself as steph. it's kinda like jen... everyone calls her jen so much that i wasn't sure if her real name was jennifer or if her name was just jen. *identity crisis* i'm depressed today. well at first i was just tired, but then... now i'm just depressed. because i just checked my washington mutual bank account and i am severely lacking in funds. i think i am poor. yay peanut butter sandwiches and water for the rest of the quarter. o_o  also, i am depressed because i'm worried about ben's money too (because it indirectly affects me, hehehe). and i'm depressed because evangeline's college apps are stressing me out. and i am depressed because i have a midterm monday, midterm tuesday, paper due tuesday and project due thursday.  carolyn always tells me that i get mixed up between being depressed and being stressed. usually, i am either stressed or depressed. because when i'm stressed, i have no time to be depressed. but sometimes, i get so stressed that i'm depressed. ...maybe i will be unpressed tomorrow.

so it's 4:12 am now and i am quite delirious.  i am anticipating 12.5 hours of class tomorrow spanning from from 8:30am-9pm on an estimated amount of 3 sleeping hours. i've been slaving away at this paper. this paper that apparently, is not due tomorrow. because the professor decided to be funny and post it on his website last minute that we get a one week postponement due to the fires, which is quite nice of him but not really, considering he didn't notify us until 2 minutes ago? and then there's this test...that i should've been studying for but haven't been because i was working on my paper? goodness! i could've gone to sleep 10000000000 hours ago, blast it all.  i'm bitter.

recitation, 'scuse my blogstyle.  so jason's asking why there's school tomorrow, that's what i want to know too.  school closed for the past 3 days, they were supposed to be catch up days for me but i just spent most of each day checking the stupid ucsd website to see if we would have school the next day.  me and carolyn crashed at geoff's place for the past two days... cuz carolyn got hella paranoid when they said the fires would merge and move faster. she thought we were gonna be burnt up so we retreated to irvine.  we chilled and did nothing, it was great. it was like time suspended.  we watched pat and geoff play ninja turtles on gamecube the first night while michael aimed and then we watched confidence, first movie i've seen in a long, long time. it was really good, you gotta think 20 steps ahead.  and then we sat around and talked about how bookkeeper is the only word in the english language that has three consecutive double letters and random stuff like that. ben slept.  me and carolyn got geoff's queen size tempur-pedic bed. :) him and michael slept in the living room on the $3000 black leather couches. we slept at 6am.  we woke up the next day at 1 and checked the ucsd website. it wasn't updated. so we watched the news channel for news of the fire, it was still going on, zero containment. we called jen up and she said the sky was black in san diego. we hoped for no school the next day and went to go eat at the diplomat.  jen called back and told us that school was canceled. we were thrilled.  geoff pointed at a girl who was walking by who had some fat spilling out of the top of her pants and he said, "i hate it when girls dress like that."  we went back to geoff's place and me and carolyn lay on opposite ends of geoff's bed, turned on the aircon, turned on the classical demo on the piano in his room and just stared at the ceiling until we fell asleep. when we woke up again, it was late afternoon and we got up. geoff was shocked and rejoiced, saying, "they're up! they got up!"  we dragged ourselves to the tv, plopped down in front of the news and tried to study. i read 3 pages. carolyn went to rite-aid. geoff went to play ball. michael went to uci. pat went to washington d.c.  carolyn came back, we talked about the process of whipping, geoff came back from playing ball and glowing with health. me and carolyn felt like such fat slugs. ben came over (he bought me colored chalk!) and we all watched the lakers game... and talked about kobe and whether or not the ring he gave his wife was 4 million or 40 million dollars...  we went to dinner at midnight, came back, got yelled at by the lady downstairs cuz we had supposedly been stomping around for the past 2 hours even though we weren't home cuz we were at dinner? geoff yelled at her and then we played james bond 007... that one shooting game, the pre-counterstrike era... i remember we were all over at grant's house, me, jane, cooper, stanley, jennifer, michael, victor... we were supposed to be working on our english hamlet video project... but we were playing that instead. we pulled an all nighter that night.  but anyway, i haven't improved much over the years. playing counterstrike also hasn't helped me get any better in that stupid 007 game... i spent a great half of the time staring at the wall or the ceiling...or shooting at the floor. it's so hard to aim with a joystick! and those bastards, they would still shoot me and kill me even though i told them i was shooting at the wall and couldn't turn around.  i changed up my health to 179 at one point, then i kicked butt. i was invincible for awhile but then i still died. it's hard to stay alive when people are shooting at you and you're shooting at the ground...even with the best of health. low blows, those poor sports! trashtalkers. i hate them.  we switched it up to mario party... it was a happy game. i was 1st place for a long time until something happened and i became 2nd place.  we stopped playing games at 4 and watched anime for a little... ben left, carolyn and geoff fought over the bed, carolyn won and we got the bed again. i wasn't tired yet cuz we had slept all day, i tried to talk to her and she told me i was annoying and to shut up and go to sleep. i shoved her off the bed.  she got mad and shoved me off the bed and then i was trying to fix the bed sheets but she wouldn't get off the bed so i could pull them over the mattress, hella annoying.  i woke up this morning, drove back to hacienda, spent $100 on a wireless gamecube controller and a super mario party 4 for my siblings cuz i know they'd have a field day and preordered the new super mario kart game for them. dropped by home, i've missed them. :) we played super mario party for awhile.  bummer cuz then i found out we had school tomorrow. so i had to study.  i went to fairway starbucks to study and i accidentally sat next to some fob girl who was mad that her boyfriend was going to a stripclub and she kept insisting that she wanted to go with him. it was a great mandarin conversation to eavesdrop on. not that i wanted to. i really wanted to read about my connectionist model theories but man, fobs talk so loud! me and ben chilled at mcdonalds and talked about cookies and how he used to play with barbie dolls when he was small.  then i drove back to san diego...past some cops lounging on the side of the freeway (those lazy cops! they should be helping out with the fire, evacuating people and being helpful instead of trying to catch speeders, no sense of duty!)  ...and here i am, in our oxygen depleted house... and it's hella hot cuz we can't open any of the windows. i've moved back in.  i have a paper due tomorrow and a test to study for. it's 2:14am now and i have class at 8:30am. tell me, why is there school tomorrow?

it's funny how the strikers are all still out there in front of ralphs yelling at people as the masses rush in to buy water and emergency supplies. it really amazes me.  and funny how some people just kinda...wander around, with gas masks on... they look like monsters ...as they walk their dogs. i'm surprised they don't put gas masks on their dogs. and then there's people who just chill at sav-on.... checking out the ingredients in the 99 cent suave shampoo... while others are just running in and out of the store in a panic. a great variety of people make up san diego, i must admit.  then there's those of us who drive right by the fire, going from safe zone to danger zone and watch the flames lick up the field in the marine corps field on miramar.... smoke go up in billows, blackening the sky, ashes raining down... and drive to tea station to get dinner, to go because you can't stay too long in firezone, you know.  three games of wuziqi and you gotta be out (winning streak of 2! yea!) despite the vast amounts of fobs who have poured in to chill since the three of you set foot in an otherwise very chillingly empty tea station.  and all those freshmen on campus, so carefree in the new erc dorms, we hit up asia where michael was at, funny little boy he is, he has the stupidest suitemates ever. we watched the news for awhile and i tried calling the radio station to see if it was safe to return home. i didn't know where else to call. the police lines are all tied up... but the radio station lines were all busy. i called them a hundred thousand million times.... 858-569-talk. yea, i got their number down pat.  cutting hair isn't as easy as it looks, i tried to fade, with three different clips, it doesn't work very well. i made ben look like a mushroom head...but really, in retrospect, it isn't all that bad and at the very worst, it's punishment for me, not him cuz i have to look at it and be seen with it. at least i fixed the holes i made and it's relatively even. :) the clippers tickle my hand.  school got canceled today, i hope they cancel school tomorrow too... cuz then my paper won't have to be due and then they can cancel class on wednesday because then i won't have to ta and then while they're at it, they should cancel class on thursday because then i won't have to take my midterm. i don't care if they have class on friday.  but in any case, i really hope all the fires stop soon and stop burning people and their houses down. :( also, the fires are making me feel hot and when i walk outside, the soot makes my feet turn black.

i don't know where to go. :( they closed down all the freeways except for the 5. and the 5 is packed. and i'm scared to try and drive to irvine because what if the fire comes and i'm stuck in traffic? :(  the state's largest fire, in eastern san diego county, caused at least 11 deaths, including two who died inside their car as they apparently tried to escape the flames, san diego sheriff bill kolender said.  san diego county took the worst of the damage on sunday, with four separate fires burning more than 100,000 acres and threatening 30,000 homes.   matt and juan wanted to go loot the burning houses. -_-  three looters who tried to take advantage of the san bernardino evacuations were arrested, police said.  i've evacuated to la jolla, waiting to see if the wind's gonna change or if traffic is gonna die down. fire everywhere. :(  at least they closed down all the schools for tomorrow. that means no work. if only they'd close down college for tuesday and thursday. then i'd be a-ok for my paper and midterm.  havoc. i feel confused. i took my computer apart and stuck it in my car. but really, i should just let it burn up, that piece of crap so i can get a new one. o_o i took all my underwear, all $400 of it so chris wouldn't feel like he wasted all that time for burnt underwear... i took my pictures of my grandma, my polka dotted bedsheets and pillows, random clothes, passport, digital camera, phone charger, my backpack and textbooks (ha, nerding it all the way) and then i took a second look around my room and just asked, "what the hell is important enough to take with me?" and really, nothing was. i could live without all that. in light of things, really, nothing was seriously important. it was all trash basically.  there are 10 major fires going around california right now...  cedar fire:   size: 100,000 acres.  homes: about 300 destroyed.  deaths: eleven.  containment: 0 percent.  start: oct. 25 in eastern san diego county.  key facts: extends to scripps ranch, poway, miramar marine corps air station, portions of santee, lakeside and blossom valley, poway and ramona. air traffic nationwide was disrupted when the fire forced evacuation of a federal aviation administration (news - web sites) control center.  personnel: more than 800 firefighters.  suppression cost: no data available.  cause: authorities believe a hunter set signal fire when he got lost.  camp pendleton:   size: 4,695 acres.  homes: none.  deaths: none.  containment: 55 percent.  start: oct. 21 on the base north of san diego.  key facts: authorities are downplaying early reports that fire was ignited by live ammunition exercises on the base. (stupid tim!)  personnel: 999 firefighters.  suppression cost: not available.  cause: under investigation.   i wonder how bobby is, they evacuated his school. he won't pick up his phone.

three exits down they're being evacuated. :( now i have to pack my stuff... and prepare to evacuate.  it's so weird... i just went out to ralphs and islands, there were ashes falling all over me. and the sun turned red! the sky is pretty much black with smoke...  they closed down all the freeways, a plane couldn't see through the smoke in the skies and crashed into the center divider on the 163.  matt came down for the weekend and now he can't get his flight back to san francisco, juan, carlos and them came down from la and the freeways are closed so he can't drive back... they're evacuating at solana beach so ben can't take the train back.  the lady on the news said today is "not a good fire day."  apparently, the fire started because a hunter got lost and started a fire so someone could find him. -_-  matt's gonna hose the roof down now.  matt says we should just put everything into the garage and soak it with water.  i don't even know what to pack now. and i can't cut ben's hair anymore. :( we bought clippers at sav-ons while everyone else was buying water.

have you ever felt like a stranger in your own house? it's unbelievable. they've been drinking since this morning. and it's still going loud and strong right now... they're blasting the bass and screaming and shooting pool and taking shots and smoking and emptying out beer bottles. the cops are gonna come soon and i'm pretty sure our neighbors hate us.  i locked myself in my room and read all day. ben read the lion, witch and the wardrobe and i read anne of green gables. i finished first. :)  i'm so glad i have my own room... i wish they'd all be quiet and disappear. there are too many people in the house! 12 people crashing in the house tonight... at least. at least becky and carolyn have still retained their sanity, although i am starting to highly question the sanity of the latter.  i have not yet started writing my paper yet but on a brighter note, it's daylight savings tomorrow so it's actually 11 now, instead of 12.  i'm hella annoyed.

fire in the hole. :( there's a huge fire in san diego... they're evacuating people. o_o  at least two people were reported dead and at least two dozen homes burned as three wind-driven wildfires churned through housing tracts and thousands of acres of brush across san diego county sunday morning.  the largest fire, dubbed the cedar fire, began near ramona at midnight and had burned at least 15 miles southwest to scripps ranch by dawn, charring 10,000 acres on the way.  the paradise fire near valley center had burned at least 1,500 acres by 10 a.m. and a third fire, the mine fire, had burned 300 to 500 acres in the marron valley near the mexican border.  thousands of people were evacuated from several communities around the county.  dozens of roads were closed due to flames or heavy smoke. interstate 15 was closed between highway 52 and mira mesa boulevard due to smoke from the scripps ranch fire. westbound 52 was closed at state route 125.  a huge plume of smoke towered over much of the county, raining a thick layer of ash stretching to downtown san diego.   no wonder there were heat waves at the cliffs last night.  look out the window, it looks like the apocalypse out there.  also, it is jason's birthday. :) happy birthday jason!

tell how, how do you finish a half-gallon of rainbow sherbert by yourself in one day? we went to chill at cliffs for awhile, looked out into the ocean but really it's so dark that it's just all black below... but the stars were so bright. we couldn't figure out which stars were orion's belt because there were two sets of stars with three in a row.  hung out there until everyone and their mom showed up at the cliffs and started drinking and smoking out. we had great fun watching people wobble around, trying to walk down the steep incline of the cliffs. also, we shined our flashlight, not in morse code like the first group of people did to us but just shined our flashlight in general to see where we were going so that we wouldn't end up tripping in the dust, like some other girl did. we also tried to shine our light down to see the ocean but we still couldn't see anything. we sat on a log...that had been previously inhabited by fobs, i know they were fobs because there were vitasoy drink boxes strewn around.  we hit up carl's jr. after and the man in the window scared me because he just appeared out of nowhere and said, "ketchup!" ...then we went home.  and now, everyone is sleeping. i'm so happy! all the drunkards went to sleep. of course, you trip all over them in the living room and in the loft but eh, all is quiet on the home front.

good morning! woohoo! my customized checks came! who wants a check!  missed the dix party last night. charlie said there were 700 people there but i suspect he was lying.  i'm still trying to finish my paper on anne of green gables and orphans. i'm also trying to read through l.m. montgomery's diary of 10 volumes. it's hella crazy dude, it's like my blog, except times 10000000000000000000000000000000 pages. she's freakin great.  john henry thoreau, ralph waldo emerson, brian jacques, jane austen and l.m. montgomery are my literary heroes.  it's terrible, i woke up this afternoon and all of a sudden, the fridge is restocked with more alcohol. when i went downstairs to binge eat at 4 in the morning, the fridge was pretty much devoid of all alcoholic contents. and then i wake up right now and go downstairs to eat (i know, sad life cycle of mine) and voila! it's stocked again. pretty crazy.  apparently, there's a party at my place tonight. o_o aughh, how am i ever going to finish this paper! it's 5th week for goodness sake! crunch time.  i wish everybody else had a paper to write so i'd have some company.

just outta luck, three wishes.  hella crazy dude. drunken debauchery going on downstairs. i am taking no part in it, nah uh. the steph has work to do! responsibilities to fulfill!  edwin has an identical twin named edward, very confusing.  happy birthday baani! :) we all went to eat a sushi bar downtown, me, caro, jen, em, leslie, becky, ebby, baani, edwin and derrick for baani's birthday...things were shady. :)  i was pretty tired after 12 hours of back to back class but i decided to put on my social cap to celebrate baani's existence. i said, "cmon steph, you can do it!" and off i went to contribute my presence.  i accidentally brought the dark red cloth napkin from the restaurant home with me. *_*  derrick buys freakin good cake, we all told him our birthdays so he can buy cake for us when our turn comes around. :)  apparently, edwin is james' friend and derrick is ferze's roommate and knows jason. they're both from back home, el monte and arcadia, it's a small world.  i thought edwin was buzzed cuz they were all taking sake bomb shots at the sushi bar and he was talking hella, he just talked and talked and talked and talked and talked... but then he came over and was like, "you know what the sad thing is? you probably think i'm buzzed, but i'm not."  and i laughed so hard. i can't believe he's like that in real life! he's... like the energizer bunny! on and on and on and on and on...and on and on (and on and on) so crazy! he's like... sarah and jennie put together x 1000000000000000000000000! (btw, got your email sarah, thanks! miss you too!)  so we were talking about t-mobile plans for some reason. and sadly, i knew all the latest updates on the t-mobile plans. and carolyn sighed and said, "yea...you know who talks on the phone too much when they know all the plans!"  and then edwin just went off on how you needed to know all the plans when you have a significant other so you can call them up whenever you want and be like, "yea b*tch, where you at? what are you doing? why aren't you over here!" .........yea. no one wants to be edwin's girl....  edwin: all girls are kinda quirky, you know? jen: *picks up butcher knife* girls aren't crooked!  so derrick thinks he hit my car when he was backing out, i freaked out. but there's no mark so... eh. i didn't want to make a big deal out of it cuz derrick's one of those really sweet, quiet boys who looked like he was about to cry when i was freaking out. man, he didn't even drink either!  there were two haters sitting behind me in lit class today, they would make a snide comment after every question that was asked. they were pretty cruel. i would've enjoyed it if i wasn't so annoyed that they were talking so loud that i couldn't hear what the professor was saying.  my dad's in colorado right now. the most randomest thing ever. also, i miss my grandma. i'm never going to see her again for the rest of my life. that makes me a little bit sad.  also, i can't remember if i told you that danny told me that asians are the smartest people ever and that black people are dumb, but he really ticked me off on tuesday when i was tutoring him, he was the most obnoxious kid ever and made me believe that all boys are hella cocky, arrogant, disrespectful and loud (except for the boys who are meek and quiet and submissive and shy and have low self-esteem, sorry to you gentlemen).  and so today, i worked with the girls and all i have to say is that girls kickass. they rock so much more than boys and that's just a fact. if i was a boy, i'd cry. but then if i was a boy, i'd really be a player for life, it's so much easier being a boy. but as it is, i'm a girl and ben rocks my socks. so that's that.  good day all, here's to 15 minutes of homework.

sometimes, all you can do is sit while the world passes you by because you are just too busy. 1. first day of work today. i read about monsters to kenny, bret and slater. apparently, monsters go to sleep at 8 o clock. but kenny, bret and slater have to go to sleep by 7:30pm. a. bret eats dinner at 6:20 sharp b. slater likes to look at the first letter of the sentence and then make up the rest of it. i.e. "monsters are cool." slater reads, "mmmmothers are nice to their children." c. kenny likes to read by looking at the pictures instead of the words.  2. t-mobile called me today from 18009378997 and a robot told me that i get 50 free additional minutes added to my account for the next 6 months for being a loyal member of t-mobile. the robot told me that these minutes are called loyalty minutes. i said thank you and hung up.  3. i have my own ta office now with hours.  4. i went to the bank during my break at work and ordered pretty checks. the bankman was a punk with a bad attitude. conversation at the bank: me: i want to reorder checks please. bankman: ok. the regular washington mutual ones for $12? me: no i want to order the pretty ones. bankman: why. those cost $20 and more. me: i know. i want the pretty ones please. bankman: well then, you're going to have to look through the folder. me: ok. bankman: but these are checks. you're not going to keep them anyway. why do you want "pretty ones." me: alkmfgalkmgkelagm bankman: ok please wait while i get the folder. i hate walking.  5. elaine and pam came over yesterday.  6. me and ben like the 10 o clock service. i like going to church with ben with all these dressed up people.  7. jane imed me today. she said, "hi stranger."  8. i went to sav-on today to buy frappucinos but they were all sold out. there is nothing left in that store because all the ralphs, albertsons and vons people invaded the store and now there is nothing left. i wish they'd stop striking soon... don't they get bored out there? if i was striking, i'd just stay home. not to say that i don't support the strike (because if i went in front of ralphs and yelled that, i would get beat down) but really, i have no idea what it's all about because i'm too busy studying.  9. charlie owes me boba.  10. on october 31st, all the dark orange roses will die.

there are big green aliens. calvin is fighting them. he is so brave. "calvin, stop attacking your peas!" calvin's mother scolds.  the green aliens fade away. calvin sheepishly stops stabbing his peas. --adapted from calvin and hobbes. my little brother abraham is just like that, stuck and suspended in his own little world of redwall.  i told him that and he laughed, laughed so hard that milk ran out of his nose and gushed out of his mouth.  "i have just confiscated any human dignity i possess," he announced after wiping his face. our family just celebrated christina's birthday. we are very loud, my dad hates it and my brother does too. those pigheaded males think we, the queens of the family, are so annoying. it'd be my mom, evangeline, stina, angela, marianna and me having the time of our lives and my dad and abraham sitting there with the most pathetic expressions of patronization and boredom. evangeline made a great show of reading a book called "sisters" to christina.  "sisters share your jeans and genes!" haha, get it!  and "who needs the mall when you've got your sister's closet!"  haha so true. especially for us. i'm glad my clothes are safely stocked away in san diego now... so i don't have to hear this anymore: hey! aren't you wearing what your sister wore yesterday?? we sang songs and told jokes. christina kept singing about stacy's mom until i told on her.  we reminisced of old times and sang hymns to mock mommy who had ever so patiently taught them to us over the years. we didn't really remember the words so we made them up.  remember henry who lived with minna in 7th grade? remember that he liked this girl named jennifer and we opened his drawer and found her love letter to him and laughed and taunted him and he was so enraged that he ripped the letter to a million tiny pieces in front of our very eyes and we were so shocked that we shut up right away and disappeared? marianna was crying because angela pinched her foot and marianna tried to get back at angela and crawled under the table to pinch angela's foot really hard except she pinched my mom's foot instead. hehehe. we laughed at marianna and she got even more mad. i don't want to blog anymore.

(we should have joined football!!)  so far, the team players i've chosen are: 1) kobe bryant, 2) the shaq or shag? boy (the really tall one i think) and 3) michael jordan. so someone please help me thanks (:  be good and peace out.  evangeline.  -----  jeff's response   hey evangeline,  here's how you join the basketball league. first go to: http://basketball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/nba then click on "sign up now!" then choose "join custom league" then for league id #:, enter "48414" and for password, enter "voh" after that, you should be fine on your own.  as for choosing which plaers and stuff, you're on your own. i don't know enough about nba besides the lakers.  i'm not going to be in the league, but i thought it's not really nice for chris to exclude you like that. but anyway, hope everything is well. also, when you signed up, please e-mail mne back and everything so i know everything is good. thanks.  -in him, jeff  -----  chris' reply  evangeline, it's not only me that don't think you should be in the league. it's everyone else too. the fact that you dont' even know michael jordan isn't in the nba anymore should disqualify you from participating.

close your eyes, give me your hand darling.  i've reached the end of the day. you know, i had to go through the whole day to reach now, it was pretty painful. now i just want to sit here and not move for 50 million hours.  2.5 hours of sleep to go through 12 hours of school with only 3 frappucinos to help me.  human development class this morning was fun (not as fun as when we got to make our own posters and present them to the class, my group was the best! we had colors and pictures!), we met in the computer lab. i couldn't remember which room it was but good thing doug was on the shuttle with me. i hit him up and we explored sequoyah hall together til we found our class.  we all got to sit at a computer and we all did our own thing on the computer for the beginning of class. i tried to blog but then that would've made me a loser so i didn't. :)  i just pretended to be a boy and went on espn.com and looked at scores for i don't know what...something about shooting for marbles was the title and then i discussed last night's baseball game with doug, something about the yankees losing. haha he thought i watched baseball because i was on espn.com like he was but i don't and i just made everything up that i told him. :) i played it off like a true baseball fan. there was a m-something team that won yesterday. i am disappointed because now it will be a boring world series. something like that. :) darnell sent me an email in class! he always tries to talk black to me cuz well, he's black but he also thinks it's funny to address me as, "wassup g!" because it makes me feel uncomfortable. now he just maxes it out until he sounds like one of those ja rule slash jay z songs.  whaddup, dis is dahnizzle of da hizzle fo shizzle. yo straight be crackin me up wit dos boys at e-dub. so play on playa =====quote da oreo nevermore.-darnell- david was on the webboard website in the beginning of class. webboard is where we post all our fieldnotes so that we know what's going on with the other kids that our class is working with, where we comment on each other's notes, etc.  it's like a huge orgy of a blog where everyone just exchanges blogs with each other cuz that's what field notes are, forced, detailed blogs of your day. it's actually kinda fun (but i think i'm the only one who actually semi-enjoys it).  apparently, you can check the time and number of times each person logs on and david was checking it. he laughed at me because besides rick, our fieldwork coordinator and our professor, i'm in line for 3rd person to check the site the most. he also found out that i checked the webboard at 4am in the morning (which makes me officially the biggest loser ever). i just like to go on to see if people replied to my posts (which is actually homework)!  fieldnotes are fun to write though, although very time consuming. it's just like blogging, so i have a party writing them and my professor is now officially one of my biggest fans. she read my 7 pages of single spaced field notes (normal people write 2-5 pages) and then she came up to me this morning and said, "stephanie, i love your fieldnotes! they made my evening when i read them last night! i didn't have to do anything else for the rest of the night!" and she wrote it on my paper too. hehehe. she likes my blogstyling. i made my professor's evening, ohhh *powertrip*, someone catch me.  david showed me how to page people if they're on the webboard at the same time so i amused myself with that for awhile. webboard is the next best website next to blogger. :)  class started 20 minutes late cuz our professor wanted to let us feed our internet craving selves and then she wanted us to go to the webboard and and read up on some information about how we were supposed to design an educational game task curriculum and test it out with kids.  i thought she told us that she was going to delete the information after today so i started taking notes. no one else was really reading though because they were all still zoned into their net surfing...  doug was playing a dexter game on the cartoon network site and coloring in a duck box on the pbs website. the professor got mad at him after awhile, she said cartoon network wasn't allowed in our class. and spongebob too.  anyway, alicia asked me why i was taking notes and i told her it was cuz the professor was gonna delete the information off the webboard after today so alicia started taking notes. then darnell, doug, and david started taking notes too. and then all the way down the row, ashley, amanda, katie...  hehehe and then i asked the professor if she was going to delete the information and she said no, it was always going to be on the webboard. that meant i tricked everyone into taking notes for nothing! *smirk* of course they all yelled at me but that wasn't my fault they didn't double check with the professor. they should've been listening! :) i love that class.  alicia commented on how the first few days of class, i was hella quiet, i wouldn't talk to anyone and now i was the loudest one in class. man, i totally love that class. i would go to that class monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday and sunday if i had a choice! it's so much fun! even more fun than blogging! not as fun as chilling with ben, of course but still... it comes close. :) alicia shared a computer with me cuz she was too lazy to log on and she ended up telling me how her boyfriend asked her out. this boy is straight crazy! he took her out to dinner and then brought her to the edge of cliffs at the beach where there was red carpet leading up to bench lit with candles and two dozen roses. he serenaded to her, read her a poem asking her out and then when she said yes, asked her to open this box that had a glass guardian angel in it and told her that like her own guardian angel, he promised to always try his best to be there for her always, then he took her to this really nice bar and she found out that he had personally hired a live jazz band to be there and he had invited all her closest friends and treated all of them.  when she went home, her bed was covered in rose petals and there was a stuffed tigger sitting on her bed because she had always said that her dream guy would give her roses, a tigger and serenade her. and somehow he had found out and pulled it all off, without even being sure that she'd say yes to him. that boy has game and a whole lot of confidence. in my brain class, i shall call it the brain class because frankly, i don't know what we're learning about in that class, it just seems to be a bunch of ...stuff at random, so i'll just call it my brain class because brains are full of random stuff...ok, not to digress, in my brain class today, carolyn's phone freakin went off in my backpack because caro had forgotten her cell phone at home and wanted me to bring it to school for her. so it started singing and i had to scramble to turn it off except i didn't know how. she owes me!  then when i finally figured out how to turn it off, it turned out to be one of those stupid phones that play some weird tune before turning off and so in the middle when the professor was lecturing, it started going off again and i was so embarrassed.  after that, i put her phone back into my backpack but when i moved my backpack, i accidentally knocked over the empty frappucino bottle that was next to it and it fell down the stairs, making a very loud glass-hitting-cement noise and i was embarrassed again and i just wanted to shrink into polly pocket or turn invisible. but it's ok because i forgot about that when i got my midterm back in that class. i'm so happy, i thought i failed the midterm because i was making things up but apparently, everything i made up happily exists so i got a 94%! miracles do happen. ^_^  in ling class, we learned that unlockable has two meanings. it's so deep, i was so amazed! haha ok... ready? unlockable means 1) you can unlock it or 2) you can't lock it. how deep is that! it dazzled my marbles and totally blew me away.  who came up with language? how do we know it? who made up all these rules? how does it all fit together so well and make sense? have you ever wondered that? it's amazing, just pure wonder. i love learning. :) my ling professor was writing so freakin small today, it was driving everyone in the back nuts. the girl sitting in front of me raised her hand cuz she wanted to tell him to write bigger and clearly instead of scribbling away in this tiny writing that looked like tiny dots from our distance but he didn't see her.  everyone in our whole back section ended up raising our hands and waving them in the air so that the probability that he'd call on one of us would increase. it was funny because everyone's hands in the back section went up at the same time and for a moment there, he looked so shocked before he recomposed himself and called on one of us. i saw calvin before i went to my fieldwork site, i haven't seen that boy since we went to denny's and discussed vegetables. during tutoring, the little 8th grade brat boys kept laughing at me and asking, "can i pinch your wenis?" and then break up into gales of laughter after saying that. well, for the life of me, i couldn't figure out what "wenis" was. i definitely don't have a penis... so that couldn't have been it but that was the funny part for them.  one of the poor unfortunate souls that i pinned in the corner finally told me that wenis meant the fat in your arm above your elbow... those stupid boys wanted to pinch my fat. :( i hate them forever. but i actually think they just wanted to say "wenis" really more than pinch my fat. still, i made them do more math problems to punish them cuz dude, math is the ultimate punishment. if anyone made me do math problems for 5 hours straight, i think i would rather just ta biology everyday.  can you believe (yes) i got stuck on this math problem for 45 minutes and the little girl i was helping was all confused and she was just like, "don't you know the answer? you're in college!"  i sighed and i just pretty much told her, "my dear tennille, math's just not for everyone and i happen to be just one of those lucky people that math is just not for."  in 1985, barry was 13 and his father was 43. what year would barry be 2/5ths of his father's age? that was the darned question! there were six undergrads tackling that problem... i asked darnell, doug, alex, hector, anna... even rick. we figured out the answer easily but we didn't know how to show our work cuz she had to show algebra and you could pretty much figure out that barry would be 20 and his father 50 when barry was 2/5ths of his father's age so that'd make it in 7 years which was 1992 but we didn't know how to do it algebraically.  hector finally figured it out, he is officially the smartest one. but he still couldn't figure the answer to...if he had a clock at 12 o clock, at what times would the hour and minute hand be exactly on top of each other in a 12 hour period... i didn't even want to think about that. i'm sure it's very easy, just some simple trick but no, we just won't go there. i was so tired after field work when i was driving back to school. in lit class, i distinctly remember trying to write in a straight line but i couldn't do it. i wrote off the page, i was so tired. the professor's voice in there was so...soothing. it lullabied me to sleep for a good while, but that was the only class that i succumbed to sleep in.  i was super awake for bio class, i have to listen hard in that class to try and understand everything so i can ta it. i sat behind the three asian boys in my section, they take hella bad notes! it's so funny! no wonder they don't understand anything! and this one guy drew a maze for the other guy to figure out... that cracked me up. he pretty much scribbled lines on a paper and then handed it to the guy next to him and whispered loudly, "here, see if you can find your way through my maze."  in the middle of lecture, one of the boys turned around and exclaimed, "hey! it's our ta! hi!" acknowledged but man, i just wanted him to turn back around and forget that i was his ta. it's worse than failing a class cuz i can't even drop. :( in bio today, we learned about how sometimes regressive evolution happens just because it's good for you. kinda like if you're a fish in a dark cave, your eyes might evolve to become smaller so that it would decrease the probability of you running your eye into a wall in the dark and getting it infected and then dying from the infection.  i met up with the professor after class with the rest of the tas, he's so funny. he's always so flustered after lecturing. he has chalk all over his clothes and he can't even think anymore. he was trying to find the square root of 1/400 and he couldn't even figure it out. even i figured it out before him! he told us that we wouldn't be able to see the midterm before thursday because he planned on procrastinating and not writing up the midterm until the night before. that's funny. :) i guess you're never too old to procrastinate and some people just never grow out of procrastination. i have a feeling that's going to be my fate.  carolyn cooked for me! :) she just knocked on my door and said, "steph, food's ready!" hehehe. like my maid...except i told her that and she punched me.  but she got me the brian jacques loamhedge book!!! for no reason! i'm so excited! happy reading for steph. it's hardcover too! $24. she just gave it to me (i think it's cuz she thinks i'm sad). i'm so proud of her, she recognizes my mouse warrior books! she said she just looked for the comic book section and knew it was right across from that. lol, hella hopeless.  anyway, you know when you're used to certain things in a day, like doing 3 somersaults across the floor before you go to sleep and then at random, you have to refrain yourself from your nightly dose of 3 somersaults because say, your legs got amputated, yea. and then you just feel kinda empty.  everything just as it should be, you see. off we skip like the most heartless things in the world...and we have an entirely selfish time; and then when we have need of special attention, we nobly return for it, confident we shall be embraced instead of smacked. --peter pan
