dianes bc story - dying with dignity







 













 



diane wanted so very much to share her breast cancer story with the world in hopes that her experiences with breast cancer would help others. she spent many weeks in her bed at home and later at hospice typing the text for her site on an old laptop and always said “if no one wants it that’s fine too, but it could be very therapeutic just to put it all down for once in a human experience reality garbled sort of way”.
 "worry lines etched deep in my face
        as i wonder what i'm doing in this place
        tissue being torn in little ragged pieces
      pent up thoughts i'm now releasing."

 











 



 "what we have done for ourselves alone dies with us;
      what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal"

 in life diane loved and served, and 
          in death
          she is sharing her life ... what follows are her words:
 i accept what i cannot have and i remain grateful for what i do have, little as it may seem to other people. i am truly a wealthy woman filled with the riches of love and friendships that will last even when i am gone. if you can hang in there with me through the darkest days to come, it is appreciated more than you will ever know. if at any time this becomes too much for you, because the battle seems to never end, i will truly understand and please feel free to let go.
i 
          have gone into some of the breast cancer sites and read some of the 
          stories from survivors, but i really never did see one that came close 
          to the 4-year struggle that my case has challenged me with. i 
          also found that in most cases it is all very upbeat and positive stuff, 
          as most of it should be to keep you from never losing hope. the 
          reality is that as far as my world has come in research and dna manipulation 
          and cloning and all of that, we are still dying from this disease every 
          day. the truth is that this is a very humiliating, debilitating, 
          painful and demoralizing way to die and it is still happening too much. i know that people only want to hear the good positive stuff that keeps 
          the fears at bay and allows that ray of hope to always shine through. we need a lot of that encouragement so that people can live with this, 
          but we aren't all going to be that fortunate to see our miracle in this 
          lifetime. those of us who are losing the battle do deserve to 
          be remembered for all the smiles we gave through our pain and all the 
          cheers we sent out to someone who needed encouragement, when we needed 
          the most. for all the times when our response to our friends and 
          family when they would ask us how we were doing today would be "good" 
          when is was most likely very bad. for all the times we tried to 
          brighten someone elses life when our own was becoming very dark. for all the times we pushed our bodies to the limit to help make special 
          memories that we could all hang on to when that was all that would be 
          left. for all the times we didn't tell people how bad it was because 
          we didn't want to ruin their day too. for just doing the very 
          best that we knew how to be a good human being, a good friend, a good 
          parent and a good spouse in the short time that we had to accomplish 
          that.
lastly for the courage to fight until the fight is over 
          and to do our best to insure that everything that could make the transition 
          for our families to a life without us as painless as it can ever be 
          so they will be taken care of as they deserve to be while trying to 
          go on with their lives.

a 
        million times we've needed you, a million times we've cried.
        if love alone could've saved you, you never would have died.
        in life we loved you dearly, in death we love you still.
        in our hearts you hold a place, no one else will ever fill.
        it broke our hearts to lose you, but you didn't go alone.
part 
          of us went with you, the day the angels took you home.
