icechat irc client :: the chat cool people use
welcome to the icechat web site.
icechat is a popular irc (internet relay chat) client that can be used in 64bit versions of windows 7/8/8.1 and windows 10.
icechat is a very user friendly program that can be setup in a matter of minutes. icechat is capable of connecting to multiple servers and channels all at once, with ease, so you can easily chat with your friends in your favorite channels.



for those people that wish to do more then just chat with icechat, there are numerous different ways to customize the look and feel of icechat. it starts with simply changing a theme, to writing your own custom commands (aliases) and making your own custom popups, using the icechat editor. icechat 9 can also be enhanced with plugins.
icechat has some unique features that set it apart from other similar programs. most users truly enjoy the built in emoticons. the favorite server tree is truly fantastic, and because icechat is built around its multi-server capabilities, it is an essential part of icechat that makes it that much easier to use.
icechat started in development in 2000, and has gone through many changes in its interface, design, and of course its many features. icechat 9.54 is the latest and last version, released in june 2023.
icechat is freeware, meaning anyone can use it, at no cost. icechat 9 is open sourced, written in c# using winforms, and available at github.
the icechat support channel is located on quakenet (irc.quakenet.org) in the #icechat channel.
this web site was launched on november 11, 2003.
