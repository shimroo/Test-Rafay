17 january 2025download our ofsted report here - "good in all areas"i am pleased to inform you that, following an inspection in november 2024, ofsted inspectors have judged harris lowe academy willesden to be good in all areas. this marks the academy’s first inspection since joining the harris federation in september 2023.

click here to view the report or visit our page on the ofsted website.

throughout their report, the inspectors have praised our learning environment, our students’ behaviour and their attitudes to learning, as well as the improvements made to the academy’s quality of education since the last ofsted inspection.

inspectors have complimented the broad and ambitious curriculum we offer, the depth of subject knowledge displayed by our teachers, and our careers programme which they concluded leads students to be successfully prepared for their next steps after leaving the academy.

below are some of the highlights of the report but i would encourage you to read the full report, which you can read here. i am so proud of our students who were fantastic ambassadors for the academy throughout the inspection, and i look forward to building on this success as we continue to drive improvement in all areas.

yours sincerely,

josh deery, principal
