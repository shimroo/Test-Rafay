injuries, the crash site, the license plates, and the vehicle damages. make and keep copies of all of the documents and paperwork – medical bills, test results, accident reports, and anything else that might be pertinent – generated by the accident and the injury.santa ana personal injury attorney chris purcell represents victims of negligence who have been injured in car, truck, bus, taxi, pedestrian, motorcycle, and bicycle accidents. if the traffic accident that injured you was caused by a defective auto part or by a defective road design – rather than by a negligent driver – chris

financial compensation. let santa ana personal injury attorney chris purcell advocate on your behalf and provide the legal advice you will need. victims of another person’s negligence are entitled by california law to receive complete compensation for ongoing and future medical expenses, loss of income and earning capacity, pain, suffering, and all other accident-related damages.construction and workplace accidentsconstruction workers suffer more injuries and more fatalities on the job than people in any other line of work in the united states, but construction sites have no monopoly on workplace injuries. if you are injured at the jobsite by defective tools, equipment, or machinery, you may have legal recourse – a product liability claim – against the manufacturer. severe burn injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and serious spinal cord injuries – which are common construction and workplace injuries – are frequently catastrophic and often permanently disabling. victims of

patient’s health, additional injury to the patient, or death. misdiagnosis, for example, happens far too often; surgical errors also happen far too frequently. for some patients, a misdiagnosis or a failure to diagnose can be life-threatening. if you were misdiagnosed, it’s also likely that the wrong prescriptions or the wrong procedures were recommended for you. during a surgical procedure, one moment of carelessness can mean a punctured organ, internal bleeding, or worse.when healthcare professionals do not provide a reasonable, quality standard of care, they are legally negligent. if that negligence causes you injury or harm, you are entitled by law to financial reimbursement, and you have the right to file a medical malpractice claim and seek that reimbursement. for a victim of medical negligence to succeed with a medical malpractice claim in california, you and your attorney must prove that a healthcare professional or a healthcare facility provided substandard care and

aggravations, but some defective consumer items – auto parts, power tools, kitchen appliances, over-the-counter or prescription medicines, and scores of other commercial products – can be quite dangerous. if you have been injured – or if you are injured in the future – by using any consumer product that should have been safe to use, you will need to be compensated for your medical costs and related losses.if you are injured using any defective consumer product, seek medical treatment at once. do not sign any documents, speak with, or settle with an insurance company before discussing

conviction. anaheim personal injury attorney chris purcell fights aggressively for the rights of the victims of civil rights violations, police misconduct, excessive force, and police brutality. excessive force by the police can involve the abuse of batons, tasers, handcuffs, pepper spray, or choke holds. physical and sexual assault, sexual and verbal abusiveness, and racial discrimination by police officers are illegal civil rights violations.if you have been a victim of verbal abuse, excessive force, or brutality by a law enforcement officer or a police department anywhere in southern
