trying to win an ipad!! wish me luck.





i’m posting this to enter a contest on offered by brad’s deals at sweetney! i want to win the white ipad 2!  wish me luck.  considering that the screen of my iphone is still broken (and i'm trying to hold out until at least july to replace it), it would make me happy to win an ipad.  i hate that i covet apple products, but i'll admit it!  i do!

marathon running playlist





i mentioned in one of my last posts that i've taken up running.  long story short - after reading several very inspirational books, i realized that i don't have to be the fastest, i don't have to be the best.  i just have to put one foot in front of the other and run.  and i have to say that i'm loving it.  i'm averaging 15-20 miles/week right now. i'll admit, there are times during each run that i find myself hating the moment.  but overall, running has become a mental challenge for me.  i love seeing if i can run farther or faster than...myself.  i'm a competitive person, but i've never been a good enough runner to be competitive at this sport.  however, i can be competitive with myself.  what a fun mind game!

part of the fun for me is discovering new music that makes me happy while i'm running.  although i've started slow and started with reasonable distances, in my heart of hearts i would love to work up to running the denver marathon in october of 2011.  in honor of the year ahead in training (and all those races that will hopefully fall into place along the way), i've created a marathon playlist.  i'm always looking for new songs, so feel free to leave your ideas in the comments.  enjoy!

spiderman in paradise






what more could a 5 year old ask for than to have his face painted like spiderman and to eat his first caramel apple ever while strolling lakeside in keystone, colorado? we spent the long weekend in the mountains with great friends, amazing food and tons of laughs.  you couldn't ask for a better end to summer than cooking s'mores over the grill on a star-filled night in breckenridge.  we are so lucky to have fun friends and to live in colorado - which truly is paradise.
