bradamantthis was my journal from 2002 to about early 2008. it was mostly about books, the news, and my adventures in nyc. i have, confusingly, republished long-ago entries on certain topics that i wanted to share again later. you can find all the books stuff on goodreads and i'm also on twitter.

livejournal entry makes fun of book titles.


apr. 15th, 2009 at 1:02 pm



 


bradamantthe brooklyn public library may be developing a nice collection of ebook titles, but the findability leaves something to be desired. there's no way to filter ebooks from audiobooks, so you can't browse by genre without weeding through all the audiobooks. instead, i usually look at "all ebooks" ordered by date added. in that mode, i get to scroll past all the recently added romance novels. some of them have the kind of title you'd imagine, like "an improper aristocrat," but tons more have titles that are like newspaper headlines for the plot. is this a hilarious new fad among harlequin writers? here are some of my favorites; i'm too lazy to make links.pleasured by the english spypromoted: secretary to bride!she thinks her ex is sexythe spanish billionaire's pregnant wifeblackmailed into a fake engagementbought for the sicilian billionaire's bedthe c.o.o. must marryas usual, it looks like the library is up to date with recent social trends.

ebooks, part iii: pricing and strategy.


jan. 11th, 2009 at 8:31 pm



 


bradamanthow much do the ebooks cost? the library books, obviously, are free (hooray!). the sony ebook store prices are close to what i suggested about three years ago: "i'd want to see $10-$12 frontlist, $7 backlist (i.e. books now available in paperback) and $2 classics (public domain!)." the only difference is that the $11 books are frontlist or trade paperback (i.e. high-prestige titles) and the $7 books are mass-market paperbacks. classics really are $2. this is really not bad considering that the prices of regular books have increased in the past few years, since i posted that comment. (and i also think it reveals something about how publishers think about trade versus mass-market paperbacks.)there's some experimental pricing. for free, i downloaded samples from alan furst and david liss. these were full novels by authors who have several other works available to buy. some books are available in bundles, e.g. the "philippa gregory tudors bundle."surprisingly, the backlist coverage is respectable. if i were a publisher, i'd be nervous about putting backlist books in ebook format. the small collection of older titles that continue to sell and sell and sell make up a lot of revenue for publishers, and just one undrming of such a title could mean a lot of lost sales. think of a book like the pillars of the earth that just keeps selling years after its release, but is still solidly under copyright. yet weirdly, if you click on toni morrison's name from that previous page, you'll see beloved for  $13--exactly the kind of book i'd imagine random house would be loath to release as an ebook. i found plenty of oprah backlist "classics" like midwives too (not to buy, just to experiment, you understand--midwives sucked).okay, what about a new threat, then: there's nothing to stop me from writing 600 pages in word, converting them to pdf, and offering them as an ebook. nothing, you say, except that no one will edit or read it. but i would counter that the fanfiction community demonstrates a high degree of organization that could, if anyone had the will to apply it to original works, replicate a lot of the functions of publishing for certain genres. editing? find a beta reader--people seem to know who the good ones are and take their participation in a work as a recommendation. publicity? personal suggestions, newsletters, or a most-popular list. this isn't foolproof, but then again neither is traditional publishing; when i rejected books i operated pretty much solely on gut feelings and my personal taste, augmented by a sense of what sells, which isn't even necessarily a good thing. did i have any particular training that made me "smarter" than a cumulative ratings system? now, this system isn't going to produce a saul bellow. but meticulous editing is somewhat devalued these days in traditional publishing, anyway. i think "the wisdom of crowds" would be a fine way to produce books in genres like romance (paranormal, historical, etc.), dragonlancesque fantasy, and so forth. judging by the recently returned "shelf" at the bpl and the sony bookstore's bestsellers, readers of those books are into ebook devices. so i really wouldn't be surprised if such a scene were fueled by ebook devices.

ebooks, part ii: format and availability.


jan. 4th, 2009 at 10:04 pm



 


bradamantall right, so the ebook as an object is quite pleasing. what can you put on it and how much does it cost?by sony standards (which we can all agree are abysmal), content for the ebook reader is a real free-for-all. you can put on their bebb books, any pdf including adobe pdf books, and i believe there are "methods" to convert other kinds of things like .lit files. so far, i've only tried bebb and pdf. both are managed by itunes-esque interfaces. the sony ebook manager comes with the device, and the adobe ebook manager i downloaded to use with library books (!). they don't always acknowledge books loaded each by the other, but (bizarrely) they also don't seem to mind sharing the device.buying books from the sony ebook site is just like buying songs from itunes. meanwhile, the brooklyn public library has a collection of about 2,000 pdf ebooks. you sign in, choose an ebook, and click on a link that launches the adobe ebook manager (like a "phobos" link launching itunes). the book is downloaded and stays active for 14 days.using two interfaces is a bit klutzier than itunes. but in order to keep myself entertained in itunes, i have to sync every two or three days to refresh podcasts, which is what i mostly listen to. since the ebook reader can hold many books, i could sync it every two weeks (to manage library books) or even less often for books i buy. and the amount you can read without recharging is amazing.when deciding whether to put the ebook reader on my xmas list, i went to the sony ebook store and checked whether the last twenty or so books i'd read were available as ebooks, and the results were pretty good. (i don't care how many are available overall, i care how many of the kind of thing i like are available.) they now have a page of nyt notable books that you can buy. it's far from exhaustive, but there's plenty to keep you busy and more than half of them are more than 50% off. when i wrote to the library suggesting that they acquire a few more of the titles from that list, they wrote back within two days saying that they'd added nine of them (now that's service!).it's also possible to subscribe to rss feeds, although the sony version has no wifi, which makes this a bit slow and not worthwhile for me. (the kindle comes closer to realizing my 2004 vision of "an avantgo-style newspaper service, and hopefully wifi, to provide easily-legible and quick access to non-book sources of print information." but it turns out that i've got a laptop, an ipod touch, and a blackberry, so i don't need that on my ebook.)finally, i know that some people think an ebook reader isn't worthwhile because it only does one thing, in contrast to, say, a laptop. (and this is really unavoidable: the current e-ink screens don't refresh nearly fast enough to allow activities like games or typing.) aren't laptops insanely distracting through? you're reading some article, then you're on wikipedia, then you're on youtube, and an hour later you whittle things back down to the tab you were originally looking at. the ebook reader is a screen-based device that encourages you to look at one thing quietly for hours at a time. maybe that's okay.

ebooks, part i: ebook as object.


dec. 29th, 2008 at 2:16 pm



 


bradamantso, after occasionally expressing skepticism about ebooks, i've finally got one: the sony 505 (not the 700, on which the touchscreen reportedly renders the screen hard to read, defeating the purpose, and not the kindle, since i'm already schlepping around two qwerty keyboards, thanks). i have finally arrived at a situation where an ebook makes sense: i really am running out of storage space and i carry a laptop three days a week which means i can't carry a book larger/heavier than a small paperback. this doesn't qualify as the killer app i was looking for nearly five years ago, but it's enough for a "why not try it?"looking at this thing first as an object, i'd say that it's a success. i've had it for about a week and have read about 1500 screens worth of text. the screen is very, very easy to look at and doesn't provoke any of the eyestrain i sometimes get even from an lcd screen. it does look amazingly matte and paperlike. every book can be viewed at three levels of magnification; the ones that are published as real ebooks automatically repaginate themselves as you increase or decrease the text size. (with miscellaneous pdfs at a larger text size, you read a single page, 342 for example, as two screens both numbered 342.)i didn't realize how useful the button placement is until i started carting the thing around. there is one pair of page forward/page back buttons on the right edge, where your fingers would be if you were holding the ebook with both hands. then there is a second rocker switch for paging forward and back that is located just where your thumb would be if you were holding it in one hand. the result is that it's very easy to operate with only one hand, such as while standing on a crowded and turbulent subway. also, the book doesn't flop closed, which means that you could prop it up and read it while eating (a particular foible of mine). it might even be possible to read while knitting.finally, it has a comfortable and visually pleasing navy blue leather cover. don't underestimate the way that the leather, which is soft and warms in your hand, improves the feel of the device. this addition was a real stroke of genius on the part of the designers; to the extent that it feels like a real book, it feels like a very nice real book. the cover appears to contain tiny magnets which cause it to snap gently shut in a satisfying way. and while the ebook doesn't gratify a fetishistic desire to collect and display books, it turns out that a single object that allows different books to manifest themselves has a bit of its own magic. obviously, i have a lot more to say about it in terms of book availability, pricing, etc. next post.

chapter mcxc: in which i actually name a favorite book.


dec. 3rd, 2008 at 11:03 am



 


bradamantif you asked me to name my favorite books, i'd have to agonize over it for a while, and then i'd name some titles that you've probably read, like pride & prejudice or pale fire. but i'd also definitely name suburban nation: the rise of sprawl and the decline of the american dream by andres duany, elizabeth plater-zyberk, and jeff speck: a passionate book about towns, streets, and the places where you want to live. this book changed the way i look at the world around me and gave me a new vocabulary to describe where i want to live my life. it's also great fun to read.    illustration 1   originally uploaded by bradamant the authors contrast traditional city planning with the suburban sprawl that took root during the twentieth century. sprawl arose largely as the result of zoning laws that dictate road widths and geometry, the distribution of housing and other land uses, and even the architecture of the buildings themselves, and so that's the level the authors approach. they show how a traditional town constitutes a human habitat worthy of protection, and a suburb is a place that traps people an unsustainable lifestyle that, when they are offered real alternatives, they don't even want.the authors don't fall into the mistake of assuming that people who live in suburbs are banal, instead, they show the social consequences of bad design. as the "victims of sprawl" they identify "cul-de-sac kids" who are "unable to practice at being adults"; soccer moms who work full-time and then must serve as chauffeurs for their kids; bored teenagers; the stranded elderly, who "are neither infirm nor senile [but] healthy and able citizens who simply can no longer operate two tons of heavy machinery"; weary commuters; bankrupt municipalities that must not only pay for roads, roads, and more roads, but sewers to connect all those far-flung houses and police to patrol those neighborhoods; and "the immobile poor" who, without cars, cannot get to the jobs they need to escape the failed social experiment of high-rise projects. it should be easy for most of us to recognize current, past, and future selves among these categories and realize the significance of what this book is trying to tell us. having once been the chauffee, i have no aspiration to become the chauffeur.there are two qualities of this book that make it a joy to read. first, the authors do a marvelous job of showing, in both words and pictures, how small design decisions have significant unintended consequences. (see the first illustration.) second, the writing in this book is passionate and sometimes withering, as in the second illustration, which is accompanied by the comment: "the building pictured here is not, as it may appear, a refugee relocation center or a storage depot, although it could be considered a storage depot of sorts: it's the place where we store our children while earning the money to pay for their cars."    illustration 2   originally uploaded by bradamant although i'd lived abroad for a year beforehand, it took encountering this book and its razor-sharp analysis of how design affects how a place feels to make me notice just how insane and destructive our country's adherence to and idealization of suburban design really is. note that this book is not an encomium to giant cities like new york; the authors reserve their highest praise for neighborhoods and for small cities like charleston. nor do they have a misty-eyed view of the traditional town: their discussion is about how long it takes you to get to work and where you put your trash to be collected, not about norman rockwell. and their new urbanist design program isn't just aimed at making life more pleasant for the upper-middle class, because one of their main goals is to integrate lower wage-earners into middle-class neighborhoods, just as they want to integrate light retail and offices into residential places and vice-versa. they don't want to bring this about by busing-style top-down orders; rather they want to achieve it by eliminating the zoning laws that, for example, often prohibit placing apartment buildings near detached homes. in short, the authors see the neighborhood and the town as natural, enduring units of healthy human self-organization, and suggest that we get rid of laws and prejudices that make them infeasible.if you ever wonder why i insist on living in an expensive city or why i've never owned a car, or why i'd move back to a certain street in my hometown but not another one, read this book! really, you should read it anyway: it offers a fresh perspective on the world you live in--whether you want to or not.suburban nation: 5 smileysrecommended for: americans

decisions.


jul. 9th, 2008 at 1:10 pm



 


bradamanti am currently on page 116 out of 635 of the third printing of "version 3.0" of the world is flat by thomas friedman. so far, the book is about globalization and technology.in the last few pages, friedman quotes someone as having realized that apache was "'produced for free by a bunch of geeks just working online in some kind of open-source chat room.'" then friedman writes, "yes, the geeks in the mail room are deciding what software they will be using--and what you will be using too." a few pages later, "to learn more about [open-source software], i went exploring among the geeky guys and girls in the mailroom." sure, here's a picture i found, i think this shows linus torvalds:then, a few pages later, friedman interrupts a quote from kevin kelly at wired to define bittorrent as "a web site that allows users to upload their own online music libraries and download other people's at the same time."
