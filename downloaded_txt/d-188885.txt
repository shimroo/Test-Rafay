                      of racing at the local level. our goal is to help promote 
                      local racing and racing at levels that still are within 
                      the reach of the everyday working person. 
visit your local tracks every weekend. support 
                      local racing, whether it be circle track, road course, drag, 
                      boat racing, or even lawn mower racing. get out and support 
                      all of them!
