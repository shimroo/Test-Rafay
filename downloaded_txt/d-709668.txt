how you s.e.e. uswe're focused on inclusion.


while our mission has never wavered, our look has evolved. after more than 40 years of advocacy in phoenix, our new logo reflects the work we do to support, engage and empower the lgbtq+ community, aligns with the spirit of our s.e.e. campaign with its lens shape and incorporates the colors representing a rainbow of diverse identities in the progressive flag.














what do you s.e.e.?








  





we’re more than an unforgettable party


we s.e.e. the future.


as a community, we’ve come a long way. and we know that progress has been hard fought. at phoenix pride, we also recognize that we still have more to accomplish. so we continue moving forward.































at phoenix pride, we:
support. engage. empower.


  






it’s why we invest in philanthropy efforts that support those who need it.











it’s why we organize and host events to engage with our community and celebrate ourselves, our progress and our visibility.











it’s why we empower our community through programming designed to instill confidence and understanding.  
















phoenix pride has distributed more than $1.2 million in grants and scholarships since the program’s inception in 2008.

























  





we ask others to s.e.e. us


to walk a mile in our shoes and s.e.e. who we are, and to s.e.e. our future — as allies.
