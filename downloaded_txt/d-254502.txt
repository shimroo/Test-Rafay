welcome to bible notes

a very warm welcome indeed to bible notes.
bible notes is an online repository of the biblical writing of simon lucas. the material published here consists of:

short biblical reflections focusing on a verse or two of scripture;
longer biblical articles that reflect on a longer piece of scripture, with more in-depth thought;
sermons and talks, longer in scope than typical articles;
short, snappy ‘thoughts of the day’, as delivered on the inspirational breakfast show on premier christian radio, a uk based radio station.

you can check out a list of the most recent posts and most popular posts, in the sidebar. alternatively you can use indexes above to find all writing relating to a particular book of the bible. if you’re feeling in need of inspiration, you could click here for a random post from our extensive archive.
simon lucas is also the author of ‘the shepherd god: finding peace, worth and purpose in a busy world’, a well-received book which takes a thoughtful look at psalm 23. find out more about the shepherd god here.
