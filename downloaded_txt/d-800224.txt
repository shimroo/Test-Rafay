about the jollies









the jolly rogers motorcycle club

                            has a rich history and once numbered 100 including a woman's division and a motorycle stunt-and-drill team that rode white harleys in the seattle seafair parade.  for many years the jolly rogers motorcycle club owned and operated one of the only large oval dirt tracks and hill climb track in the surrounding area. 









this site is dedicated
to preserving the rich history of the club. our history page includes many old pictures and articles dating back to the very early years of the jolly rogers motorcycle club. check out our jolly blog for even more jolly history.









toward the end of its existence

                            the jolly rogers racetrack was gradually expanded and converted from scrambles to motocross. available pictures and videos from that era are increasingly hard to find. we solicit any who wish to contribute to make them available for posting. please contact us at: cruizin@jollyrogersmotorcycleclub.com 



















yesterday's memories tomorrow's dreams

                            the one true original jolly rogers motorcycle club website has obtained the copyrights to display legendary jolly rogers motorcycle club member and past club president, carmen tom's book book titled "yesterday's memories tomorrow's dreams". check it out on the jolly blog.  make sure you check out chapters "50 years and the jolly roger motorcycle club" and "the old timers go mountain climbing".  both make references to lifetime club member "the great seymour (bob) and longtime members ron bennett and slimbo, many times referenced throughout this website.

feature:  joan berry
joan berry is one of the only 2 current women members in the jolly rogers motorcycle club. her can-do attitude has won her the support of the faithful and propelled her to the office of madame secretary. she regularly participates in club rides and activities and is a bonding force within the group. joan rides a 2012 harley davidson softail convertible, although it doesnât currently sport one of her custom paint jobs, it just may in the near future. 

an accomplished airbrush artist and custom motorcycle painter her skills are in constant demand. she and her husband (also an officer in the jolly rogerâs mc) have a thriving harley davidson repair shop in burien and a shell service station in white center. joan was born and raised right here in south seattle. 

âi grew up in this community. i spent many a weekend at the jolly rogerâs hill climb. i feel itâs a privilege to be a member in a club so steeped in local history. i remember vividly my first ride on a harley davidson it was a 1968 shovelhead chopper. it belonged to my best friends dad, i was 11 and it impacted my life in a powerful way. that was 1971 and it was all harley davidsons from that point on, except for my first dirt bike- a honda cr80 with a beefed up engine. 

i feel itâs important to preserve the history of the jolly rogers mc and also to embrace the modern version of the club which is now predominately street riding. as secretary i feel the difficulty of preserving our roots yet taking the club forward. if you are over 21 and ride a motorcycle come see what the jolly rogerâs are all about at the chelan restaurant the second wednesday of every month at 7:30 pm.âmore features
