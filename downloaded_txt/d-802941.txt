         a letter 
from the president
        






        dear colleagues:
       



        the 2009 legislative session 
is over and it looks like we can enjoy another successful year.
        
        so far our lobby 
team and board members have been able to defeat any bills that would
        
        negatively 
affect the industry. for example, senate bill 184 relating to salvage yards and
        
        the new documentation requirements for purchases made in this state could have 
had a
        
        negative effect on the recycling industry in south carolina. with the hard 
work of our lobbyists
        
        and board members, we were able to add language that would 
allow us to continue doing
        
        our jobs efficiently and effectively. we need to 
remind ourselves that since 1996, scrda
        
        has influenced more than thirty pieces 
of legislation that directly affected the auto salvage
        
        industry in south 
carolina. this has not been an easy task and it takes your membership
        
        dues to 
successfully combat negative legislation.
       



        over the years, our 
association has grown to be respected in not only within the state
        
        government 
but also throughout our statewide industry. this past years partnership with
        
        hotlines inc. has proven to be an excellent opportunity to reach countless 
buyers and we
        
        have been successful in developing a marketing program with them 
that offers a portion
        
        of the hotlines dues to be given to the association each 
month, providing much needed
        
        money to continue the work we do.
       



        scrda is deeply committed to 
meeting the needs of you, the membership, and elevating
        
        the recycling industry.  
our mission is to assist your businesses by protecting interests,
        
        expanding 
opportunities, and working to increase profitability. key aspects of 
accomplishments
        
        include listening closely to member wants and needs, staying on 
top of key issues of the day,
        
        and delivering results to support member success.
       




         remember, when we join together, we win.
        




        sincerely,
