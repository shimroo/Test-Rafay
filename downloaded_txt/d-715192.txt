christmas
















island



10.4475° s, 105.6904° e



we invite you to uncover the remarkable surprises of a destination full of natural wonders. christmas island is located in the indian ocean, 2,600 kilometres northwest of perth and 350 kilometres south of indonesia.



the tiny, reef fringed, australian territory of christmas island captured the imagination of wildlife lovers everywhere when sir david attenborough, one of the world’s most respected naturalists, showed the world the extraordinary footage of millions of red crabs migrating to the ocean describing it as ‘one of the top 10 most memorable tv moments from his life’s work’.yet there’s so much more to experience here than this brief, albeit spectacular event. thousands of kilometres from the mainland, in the remote confines of the indian ocean, christmas island is teeming with experiences for nature lovers and intrepid travellers who enjoy exploring the paths less travelled. with an eclectic mix of flora and fauna above and below the surface; breathtaking nature, with almost two thirds of the island national park; as well as a fusion of malay, singaporean, australian and chinese food and culture, this extraordinary destination really is a nature lover’s paradise.
