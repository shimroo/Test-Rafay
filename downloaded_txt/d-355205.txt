welcome to
tom's farm market
tom’s farm market, a family-run establishment founded in 1959, takes pride in its dedication to providing top-quality bedding plants cultivated in its 80,000 square feet of greenhouses located onsite in huntley, il. from asparagus to strawberries, gmo-free sweet corn to tomatoes and peppers, a wide array of farm-grown vegetables grace our market during harvest season.
in addition to our produce offerings, tom’s has evolved to include a charming gift shop and a full-service bakery, along with a coffee bar and lunch cafe. we welcome visitors from mid-march through december to experience the delights we have to offer.
