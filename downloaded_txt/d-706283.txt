due to an error in scheduling at the cmp ,we will not be conducting the m1a match on sunday august 25th.****[the vintage sniper match will still be shot on the 25th]****
also we will be adding a modern military 30 round match to the tom hemphill garand , springfield ,vintage match on saturday august 24th. 
contact me as soon as possible so we can get an estimate on how many shooters we will have for each match. 
thank you and my apologies for any confusion!
