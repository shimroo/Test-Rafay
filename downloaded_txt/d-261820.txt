three charged with assaulting police horse
providence,ri  three middletown women have been charged with animal cruelty after
               police said they assaulted a patrolmans horse. 
   the incident occurred friday(7/14) when a mounted patrolman was trying to clear the crowd of people spilling out of
   downtown clubs. a woman started petting the horse but then her companion, karyn schiliro, 21, hit the mare so
   hard in the rear that the animal kicked out, nearly striking two passers-by, police said. 
    when the patrolman threatened to arrest schiliro, the young woman just laughed and hit the horse again, police
   said. then another woman, lindsay kircher, 21, hit the horse with a pizza box and a third woman, tammy polley,
     20, hit the horse in the head with a soda can. after a short chase, the mounted patrolman and another
      officer caught the women and arrested them. the horse, named fleet, was not seriously hurt.
