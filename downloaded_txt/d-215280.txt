valentines weekend feb. 14-15the first two firings of the year will coincide with our valentines weekend shopping fundraiser. in addition to the local charities and fundraisers we support throughout the year, we plan a valentines event to raise money for animal rescue groups. this year, weâ€™ve decided to support the asheville humane society. generally we keep our donations local, but we know there is still considerable need in the western part of our state. 10% of sales at jugtown on friday, february 14 & saturday, february 15 will be donated.pots from two firings will be in the sales cabin for feb. 14-15. we will have new pieces in blue ridge blue, mustard green, turquoise, honey amber, woodsmoke with green, dogwood white, and cinnamon. there will be a great selection of mugs, vases, serving bowls, platters, tumblers, pitchers, and a few smaller animal figures. this will be a fun weekend and we look forward to seeing everyone, and raising money for our furry friends! check out our social media pages for updates and preview pictures - be sure to follow us on instagram and facebook!visit our youtube channel, for videos like the one below!
