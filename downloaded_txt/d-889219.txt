journeys reaffirmed my faith in how people solve problems while traveling.  they were the best in doing this plus showing us africa.  after traveling all over the world, i put my trust in journeys international to show me everything from small things, wildlife, people, plant life to our sacred planet.

this virtual trip was exciting and educational, and i could do it from the comfort of my own home. the interactive pages made it tangible and real. it was clear that tons of thought had gone into all of it. i appreciate all of the work that journeys put into it to make it memorable and interesting. this was my favorite week of the pandemic.

my trip to everest base camp with journeys was everything i had hoped.  the trip was planned, and yet provided a lot of freedom.  depending on the mental and physical condition and weather, we would determine the route, pace and distance for each day.  journeys is all about its customers.
