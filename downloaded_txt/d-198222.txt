what's so special about eddie's sauces?  chef edmund patrick "hoboken eddie" mccarthy starts with the highest quality, fresh, all natural ingredients and mixes them with a secret array of herbs and spices to conjure up his taste bud-tantalizing sauces.  never thickened with cornstarch or xanthan gum, you can taste the difference. there are no animal products, fats or oils. chef eddie, a master chef and certified caterer, takes his sauces very seriously.  he's spent years devising and concocting his brews.  once you taste 'em, you'll be craving 'em!
