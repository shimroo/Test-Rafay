to see more of our testimonials, please read our facebook reviews and google reviews. here are a few that summarize what everyone else is saying.
"i was recommended kiss and make up by a coworker after she hear me complaining about how many bras i had tried on and returned trying to find the right size. i went to kiss and make up as a walk in (although i now see that you can schedule your bra fitting for an appointment). ruth was absolutely exceptional in every way! she fit me properly, and i found out that the "fitting" that i had from other stores were dramatically wrong. no wonder i was never comfortable before. i felt like i was at a boutique with her running and gathering a variety of bras and swimsuits, and then assessing the fit and comfort with me. i love the new bras that i bought, and feel so much more confident and comfortable when i wear them. the prices are very fair, considering how much attention she gives you while you are in her store to make sure that you leave with the best bras possible... i highly recommend, and am never buying a bra from anywhere else!" - sarah d.
"ruth is the best! this store is a blessing. i have never been this happy with a bra before or felt this listened to during a bra fitting. this store is worth a visit 1000%. skip victoria's secret and just go to kiss and make-up!" - sam p.
"ok, first google review i've written, but i had to share. i love ruth. i've been going to kiss and make up for five years now. i have a hard to find and hard to fit size. not only does she make me feel comfortable and happy during fittings, she is really, really good at what she does. she knows how to fit you for a bra and and carries an incredible range of sizes in gorgeous colors and designs. you will leave there feeling like a million bucks. i've recommended kiss and make up to many friends over the years and they all agree she is the best. the bras are not cheap, but they last and feel glorious. it is some of the best money you'll ever spend." - whitney s.
"this rating is long overdue. i began to visit kiss & make up approximately 8 years ago because i was told that they had excellent bras for women with large busts. i was referred by a coworker after catherine's could no longer accommodate me due to my increase in bra size. my experience was amazing. the salesperson looked at me and before measuring me told me my size. then she measured me and was 100% accurate. she was friendly and professional. and she knew her stuff. i have visited her shop since then and i feel no need to shop anywhere else for my bras. i give an a+ rating." - tanya t.
