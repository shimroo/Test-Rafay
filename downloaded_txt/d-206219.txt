b.s., architectural engineering, california state polytechnic university, 2022



why did you go into engineering?
i have always had an interest in structures and design, and always thought i would go into some career focused on art or architecture. i also loved studying physics and math, so when i found structural engineering, it seemed like the perfect fit as it lets me use my skills to help interesting designs come to life.


little known fact
i love reading, traveling, and picking up new crafts.


what is your unusual talent?
i practiced polynesian dance from the ages of 4 to 18.

m.s, structural engineering, university of california, berkeley, 2003
b.s., civil engineering, california polytechnic state university, pomona, 2002




ca, structural engineer, license no. 5260
ca, civil engineer, license no. 68493



why did you go into engineering?
i grew up helping my dad wrenching on his vehicles (ok, mostly holding the flashlight).  i was also good in math and science and as a plus i liked to draw so it felt like a very natural thing to do.  after so many years in the industry i am happy to say i picked something that i am not only good at but really enjoy doing.


little known fact
i love to work with my hands and therefore own a ton of tools that i use to work on my own cars, bikes, and house.  a good weekend for me would involve fixing something.


what hobby would you go into if time and money werenâ€™t an issue?
i love to spend my free time off-roading so if i had more time, i would do a lot more of it.
