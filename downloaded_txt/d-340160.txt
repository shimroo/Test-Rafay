sandra bernhard still speaks her mind—with some exceptionsin the 2022 netflix special stand out: an lgbtq+ celebration, lily tomlin introduces sandra bernhard as “indescribable.” that’s a pretty good way of putting it: bernhard, who identifies as bisexual, has been a transgressive, queer force in comedy since she broke out in stand-up in the 1970s. soon after, she launched to stardom in martin scorsese’s 1981 dark comedy the king of comedy; since then, her career has taken her to everything from a recurring role on roseanne to a stint on broadway, multiple music albums, and beyond. continue reading...

pose star sandra bernhard: ‘i never tried to be revolutionary’the trailblazing actor and comedian on asserting her bisexuality in the 80s, misogynistic male comics – and befriending madonnauring nearly five decades in showbiz, sandra bernhard has racked up title after title – comedian, actor, singer, author, radio host – and a reputation for controversy. she has worked with a long list of superstars, from richard pryor and robin williams to robert de niro and cyndi lauper. but she has never been overshadowed; her force of personality has guaranteed that. even 30 years ago, the los angeles times was paying homage to her “acid-tongued, antagonistic persona”.but there are no cutting remarks today. on this sunny morning in la, she appears relaxed, in a pink-striped shirt and trousers, reminiscent of the early 80s outfits she wore for her many appearances on late night with david letterman.it is almost a year since she finished filming the final series of pose, the much-praised tv drama exploring the ball scene in 80s new york and the gay and transgender artists who built it. bernhard plays judy kubrak, a nurse caring for people dying with aids. judy has an activist streak, bringing other characters into the fight against neglectful politicians and cruel pharmaceutical companies. continue reading…

paul mooney and me | sandra bernhard reflects on her decades-long friendship with the late comicon may 19, paul mooney died from a heart attack at the age of 79. mooney was one of the most influential figures in the history of modern comedy. a behind-the-scenes giant, he had his hands in so much that would define the art form: he collaborated with richard pryor during the stand-up’s creative peak, maybe most famously writing the “word association” saturday night live sketch. he was the godfather of the so-called “black pack,” working closely with eddie murphy, keenen ivory wayans, arsenio hall, and robert townsend. he worked as a head writer on in living color, creating homey d. clown. fifty years into his career, he became a chappelle’s show breakout star. he was a stand-up that influenced generations — and a mentor. continue reading…

striking one last pose with sandra bernhardi have been following sandra bernhard since the 1980s when this relative unknown came on the scene in a big way going toe-to-toe with seasoned heavyweights like jerry lewis and robert deniro in martin scorsese’s the king of comedy. it was a groundbreaking performance in an iconic film about the cult of celebrity and what happens when things go off the rails. there was something subversive about bernhard’s arresting portrayal of celebrity-stalking kidnapper masha which spoke to me. she validated and empowered neurotics everywhere. i continued following bernhard’s career over the decades across various platforms from her live stage performances to her forays into episodic television from rosanne to pose and her sirius radio program sandyland. through it all, sandra has remained an original who has managed to make us laugh and think at the same time. continue reading…

sandra bernhard doesn’t think new york is dead just yetsandra bernhard has no filter, nor does she need one. her big break came in 1982, when she starred in martin scorcese's the king of comedy, and ever since then, her bold, over-the-top stage persona has lent itself to scathing musings on politics and pop culture. the performer is also trailblazer in her own right: bernhard was one of the first to play an openly lesbian character on roseanne, has always addressed lgbtq issues in her comedic material, and became something of a new york legend when she appeared around town with madonna at parties. on pose, which takes place when new york's ballroom scene blossomed from subculture to popular culture and madonna's "vogue" was on repeat, she plays judy kubrak, a nurse who works closely with quarantined patients in aids wards. in the season two premiere, judy brings pray tell (billy porter) to an act up meeting to discuss a demonstration that would protest the aids crisis and the government's mistreatment of the lgbtq community. judy also cares for blanca (mj rodriguez), who is diagnosed with aids and learns she must take azt, an antiretroviral medication, to treat the disease. this season, bernhard's role as judy has expanded to give her a more colorful background, more screen time, and of course, more of her signature zesty one-liners.in her culture diet, bernhard muses on her role as an activist nurse on pose, reading the works of contemporary literature it girls like sally rooney and rachel cusk, fighting with social media trolls, and whether or not new york really is dead these days. continue reading…

sandra bernhard on leaving bitchy behindthe “pose” actress and queer-tv trailblazer was embraced by the drag demimonde in her ferocious days but has a gentle vibe in person.i miss seeing you on television!” an elderly woman named renee squawked at her neighbor the actress, comedian, and singer sandra bernhard. they were in front of the stately brick frederic fleming house, on west twenty-second street, a residence for formerly homeless new yorkers, where renee has lived for sixteen years.“but, honey, you see me all the time,” bernhard replied. (she walks her dog, george, along the block daily.)renee, who has no teeth and a quantity of chin hair, eyed bernhard up and down and told her, “you look different on television!” bernhard is starring in the second season of “pose,” the ryan murphy drama about the gritty, glamorous world of transgender women and gay men who staged new york’s legendary drag balls. she plays an activist nurse at roosevelt hospital during the height of the aids crisis.“we’ll put your show on the schedule,” martha binikos, fleming house’s manager, who was passing by, promised. “thank you, sweetheart,” bernhard said. “this place keeps the neighborhood grounded in old new york—like there’s still a place where people can live, and not be pushed out by twenty-million-dollar apartments.”season 2 of “pose” is set in 1990, when there were still hookers on the piers and madonna’s “vogue” video introduced the culture of ballrooms to viewers of mtv. it was a time when bernhard and madonna were tight—they were often photographed out together, like a kind of two-headed it girl. “it was really fun. we would go to parties and be bitchy—we were bitchy to joan rivers,” bernhard said. “i had a little crush on her, and i loved that people were, like, ‘ooh, madonna likes sandy!’ ” continue reading…

sandra bernhard: ‘pose’ recalls horror of early days of aidsthere’s a good reason why sandra bernhard was upped to a series regular as nurse judy kubrak in the second season of “pose,” the fx drama about the underground lgbtq ballroom scene of the 1980s and ’90s. “nurse judy is there to serve as a conduit between the characters who are starting to show hiv-positive status — and to do something about it,” she said. “she becomes a friend to them as well as a medical advocate.” the show, which has been renewed for a third season, is addressing the epidemic because “it’s the reality of the time,” she added, but it won’t always be easy. in the season’s second episode judy convinced blanca (mj rodriguez) to take the antiretroviral hiv medication azt, but pray tell (billy porter) remains resistant to treatment.bernhard, who turned 64 on june 6, recently spoke with the post about judy’s passion, performing during the early days of the aids crisis and the show’s message for young viewers.could you describe judy?judy is tough. she’s in the trenches and yet very vulnerable and loving towards her patients and the people she deals with in the ragged hospital corridors. she wants to find a way to get them through it and not have them die, but she sees that every day. continue reading…

how sandra bernhard’s luggage landed her on the revolutionary fx series “pose” sometimes you get the gig through time-honored channels: your agent gets an audition, your manager books a stand-up show.but then there are times, as actress-comedian sandra bernhard describes how she ended up on the fx series “pose,” when it almost seems like fate steps in.“i ran into the co-creator steven canals and one of the writers, our lady j, on a flight from l.a.,” bernhard says of the felicitous way in which she found herself on “pose” not long after its premiere in june 2018.“our mutual friend judith light introduced all of us, and i was just talking to both of them by the baggage claim at jfk,” she says. “and i said, ‘i love the show, if anything ever comes up i’d love to do something.’”as fate would have it, the creative team led by ryan murphy, whose previous creations include series such as “glee” and “american horror story,” had just written a role on “pose” for a nurse working with hiv and aids patients. the series is set amid the underground gay and transgender world of ballroom culture in new york city some three decades ago.“so they went back and spoke with ryan murphy, who’s an old fan of mine, and he said, ‘absolutely,’” bernhard says. “i think he’d been trying to think of something for me over the years. it’s a great story.”the moral of which is … hang out at the baggage claim more often continue reading…

‘pose’s’ sandra bernhard on trump, madonna, roseanne—and how misogyny stops women from winning the presidencysandra bernhard tells tim teeman she and madonna don’t talk, trump must go, de blasio sucks, and while elizabeth warren has her vote, misogyny will kill her presidential campaign.america under donald trump, said sandra bernhard, taking a bite of grilled fish, has become “a cheap soap opera.” we met just after robert mueller’s brief press conference, which didn’t clarify anything and seemed to upset all sides even more. “mueller is not the person to pursue,” said bernhard sitting in cookshop, one of her favorite restaurants near to the chelsea home she shares with longtime partner, sara switzer. (her 20-year-old daughter, cicely, is in her junior year of college.) “now it’s up to congress. we just need to get that man out of the white house.”if you are a bernhard fan, be assured that off-stage the voice is still that low, ambiguously toned growl of mischief, if quieter. bernhard is “concerned, frustrated, and fed up, but i’m also activated and doing everything to put the word out, like supporting planned parenthood, and women’s reproductive rights.” her past and present-day politics and activism mean that her casting in fx’s pose as judy, an hiv and aids nurse involved in act up, has an acute echo embedded in it.in the second, just-underway season of pose, set in 1990, nurse judy is both taking care of blanca (mj rodriguez) and pray tell (billy porter), and is also an avatar of the passionate activists of the time who fought governmental indifference and ignorance to the decimating aids pandemic in a time long before hiv-as-a-treatable-condition and prep. continue reading…

sandra bernhard / “quick sand”the actress, comedian, singer, and radio talk-show host sandra bernhard tells it like it is—it’s a big part of her wonderfully gimlet-eyed style—but she’s not here to soothe our nerves during a testy time. (although she can console.) indeed, what i look forward to most is her turns of mind and riffs that don’t so much lead to a conclusive point but, rather, mess with all our status-quo impulses, impulses that prevent us from really letting loose on all that bothers us. commenting on politics, family, entertainment, and a multitude of other subjects, bernhard’s new show, “quick sand” (at joe’s pub, dec. 26-31), asks a lot of big questions about the nature of existence—what is it? prove it!—and about what makes humor. bernhard gets up on that stage night after night not because she wants to prove herself but because she has something to say, and loves the rush that comes from being strong enough and brave enough to say it. — hilton als continue reading…

signature sandy — sandra bernhard on her holiday show, ‘pose’, and ‘ahs’the week between christmas and new year's means one thing for sandra bernhard: joe's pub. for more than a decade now, the iconic raconteur and singer has performed two shows a night through new year's eve, this year with a show she playfully calls "quick sand." (for more information about the show, visit her website)reviewing a previous holiday show, a critic for variety wrote: "what makes bernhard's comedy so rare — whether she's philosophizing about taylor swift's squad or singing dolly parton's "hard candy christmas" imagined by caitlyn jenner — is that within every keenly observed pop-culture rant, there's an element of piercing truth."in past years bernhard would travel with the show to cities around the country in the new year, but not in 2019. instead from february through may she will be shooting "pose," the highly acclaimed ryan murphy series that she joins as a series regular as aids nurse judy kubrak, a role she introduced last season. this season the story moves to 1991 at the height of the epidemic in new york, so expect this no-nonsense character to play a larger part in the story.she also had a spectacular turn on an episode of murphy's "american horror story: apocalypse" in which she played a storefront minister with a twist: instead of worshipping jesus, she leads her followers — in an over-the-top bernhard manner — in worshipping the devil.in addition, bernhard continued with "sandyland," her daily radio show on siriusxm's radio andy channel 102, which has introduced her acerbic style to a new fan base and won her a gracie award.edge spoke to bernhard recently. continue reading…

unfiltered: sandra bernhard will bring new, one-woman show to la jolla and san diego regionit’s not a solution to the current  state of world pandemonium, but “sandemonium,” the latest one  woman show from the irrepressible sandra bernhard, promises to at least be an entertaining reaction. it plays the lawrence family jewish community center on dec. 12. in the show, bernhard, 63, weaves her biting comedy around musical numbers she sings with a backing band. a broadwayworld.com review of the new york  premiere stated: “keeping the show lively without abandoning who she is and being honest  about the state of the world without wallowing it in was something of a high-wire act … (but)  she never bailed on her promise to remain upbeat.” phoning the light from her manhattan apartment, bernhard called the show “a real roller coaster ride.” “some of it is stand-up, some of it is more storytelling, some is rapid-fire stream of-consciousness,” she said. “it kind of wraps in and out of songs and dramatic moments. i go  all over the map.” bernhard is in the midst of a resurgence in her acting career. known primarily  for starring on the hit sitcom “roseanne” from 1991 through 1997, she drew more recent raves  for portraying a satanic high priestess on this past season’s “american horror story.” she has  also logged well-reviewed guest appearances on the hulu’s “difficult people” and another  cameo, on “sweetbitter,” just got fleshed into a recurring role for the starz series’ upcoming  second season. continue reading…

l.a. weekly’s first cover subject, sandra bernhard, on her new show, sandemonium sandra bernhard has proven to be a most enduring comedian and her sassy, unfiltered, meta takes on life and pop culture continue to provide thoughtful laughs and so much more. she is and always has been fun to watch and listen to, no matter what she’s saying or doing — in movies, on tv, on record and, more recently, on radio (via her siriusxm show sandyland). but being in her physical presence is something altogether other-level. it’s watching a superstar shine but also sort of like hanging out and dishing with your wittiest friend, the one who says things so brilliant and oddball yet spot-on that you often want to jot her words down for future use. her latest stage show, sandemonium, surely will offer all this and then some. bernhard has perfected her “pastiche of madness,” a term we took from one of her past shows at redcat (yes, we jotted it down!). bernhard is loose and spontaneous-seeming onstage yet remains razor-sharp in her points, ideas and narrative. her fearless style made her a perfect first l.a. weekly cover subject, along with other young groundbreaking female comedians making a name for themselves at local venues like the comedy store. the 1978 debut cover story represented everything the paper sought to celebrate: uncensored commentary that was smart and bold but didn’t take itself too seriously, and a celebration of los angeles’ creative underground bubbling up to influence and change the mainstream. forty years later, both l.a. weekly and its first cover subject are striving for the very same things continue reading…

sandra bernhard brings 'sandemonium' to guild hallsandra bernhard is set to return to the hamptons on saturday, june 30 when she will present sandemonium at guild hall in east hampton. we caught up with the performer, actress, singer and author the week before her hamptons performance to learn more about the new show. long known for her outspoken (and hilarious) takes on a range of disparate topics, in recent years ms. bernhard has also found her voice in a somewhat new and totally retro realm—radio, where her show “sandyland” can be heard at noon five days a week on siriusxm’s channel 102. while she’s settled into a nice routine with the radio show, when it first premiered three years ago, ms. bernhard wasn’t certain what direction “sandyland” would take. “i had no idea what it was going to be. though i had done radio, i didn’t know what my point of view would be,” said ms. bernhard in a recent phone interview. “but what people want to hear is the day-to- day quotidian tidbits of what you do in your life.  “everything these days is so political—this is just a chance to be able to get personal and funny,” she added. fans of ms. bernhard’s work will no doubt find her both personal and funny as well as musical when she brings her live show, “sandemonium,” to guild hall’s john drew theater on saturday, june 30. while many comedians these days are using their platform to dissect the current political madness, ms. bernhard sees her show as something of a respite from it. continue reading…

sandra bernhard´s “sandemonium” @ronnie scott´sronnie scott’s: it’s not the first venue you associate with performances by american comedy legends, but sandra bernhard’s not your average american comedy legend and this was far from the average twenty-first century stand-up gig. the style and structure of the performance harked back to the jazz and cabaret clubs where music and comedy took equal billing across the night and often across individual performances; the band stayed on stage throughout the comedian’s set and often helped out with improvisations. this was how lenny bruce delivered his routines. the stage line-up for “sandemonium” is sandra plus piano, drums and guitar; her act has developed over the decades from purely stand-up to a combination of songs, observations of everyday new york behaviour, politics (almost inevitably), showbiz stories, family stories and some stream of consciousness, lenny bruce-style riffing and spritzing. and that’s before you get to the impressions, which are seamlessly stitched in to the tapestry of the performance, not as stand-alone routines but as a way of smoothly moving the narrative along. here’s an example continue reading…

concert review: sandra bernhard at ronnie scott’s, w1who would have thought she would end up here? sandra bernhard is a rock chick rather than a standards singer, but this show, full of impromptu asides, hot riffs and, yes, the occasional awkward pause, was as exhilarating as the very best jazz gigs.there’s never been any question about the american entertainer’s all-round talent: remember how she managed to steal scenes from robert de niro in that criminally under-rated scorsese satire the king of comedy? on stage though, bernhard can be her own worst enemy: without the right material that caustic outsider wit can sound like the whining of a b-list celebrity who thinks she deserves a stretch limo and a larger swimming pool.  continue reading…

talking with sandra bernhard: are great in sandylandsandra bernhard returns to boston this week after a long absence with "sandemonium," her latest show that offers a mix of her provocative comedy and songs, this friday night at city winery. edge spoke to bernhard about the show, her daily radio gig and celebrity culture. it might be hard to believe that sandra bernhard hasn't performed in boston in years. the comedy superstar has been an annual visitor to provincetown, as well as holding court at manhattan's joe pub during the holiday season, but boston hasn't been on her agenda. that drought ends this week when bernhard comes to the city winery, the relatively new downtown performance space, this friday night with the appropriately titled "sandemonium." (for tickets visit the city winery website.)  for the past three years bernhard has added radio personality to her resume with a daily show on andy cohen's siriusxm channel called "sandyland" that has endeared her to many new fans. on the show, she interviews other celebrities as well as offering her pointed commentary on a variety of pop culture subjects. the huffington post wrote of the show: "it's hard to describe, much in the same way it's hard to put words to a brilliant jazz artist's improvisations. she simply took the conversation places that were at once enlightening, provocative and intimate." continue reading…

bww review: sandra bernhard ushers in a new dawn with sandemonium at joe´s pub"we're gonna keep it up upbeat. right, kids?" finding light in the darkness was a dominant, if not the dominant, theme in 2017, so in closing out the year with sandemonium, it tracks that sandra bernhard would work it into her new year's show---in her own distinctly sandyland way, as her patented snark is a feature, not a flaw---and the crowd during her december 29 performance at joe's pub seemed just fine with that. bernhard stalked onstage singing the neil diamond tune "brother love's travelling salvation show," shaking a tambourine as she did. all business, she betrayed no emotions as her hands rained down in tune with the music.seemingly in a single breath, the star rattled off a rapid-fire series of rhetorical questions, asking the crowd everything from, "have you ever come face-to-face with a white supremacist?" to "have you ever been strung out on oxycontin?" and when it was over, she reassured them that they had left the world of pandemonium and entered sandemonium. continue reading…

bernhard’s sandyland radio show on sirusxm is as unique and beguiling as the actress herselfrecently in new york, i accompanied musician john oates on part of the media tour he was doing in support of the new book that we wrote together, his memoir, entitled change of seasons. for the most part, the dozens of interviews that john did on radio and television were pretty solid. as usual with this kind of back to back day of appearances, some were better than others.but there was one that stood out for the both of us. after appearing on the howard stern wrap-up show at siriusxm, john was taken down the hallway, away from the beehive celebrity bustle near centered the stern show. there in the back, tucked away in her own quiet corner studio, is where actress-comedienne-monologist sandra bernhard broadcasts her hugely popular and highly acclaimed siriusxm radio daily live show, sandyland on andy cohen’s radio andy channel 102. show.i think both john and i knew that the moment this interview started, that it was special. for one, it was not an interview per se. i would call it a conversation, but it was even more than that. within just a few moments, bernhard had begun leading john down a thoughtful and mysterious conversational path that revealed things about john that i didn’t even know, and i’ve been writing with him for more than two years contiue reading…

bww review: sandra bernhard takes a stroll down sandra monica blvd at joe's puba woman of many talents, one of sandra bernhard's greatest gifts has been her finely-honed ability to satirize hollywood from the inside. luckily, her latest residency at joe's pub, the year-ending sandra monica blvd: coast to coast, gave her plenty of opportunities to keep sharpening that blade.in fact, bernhard began with deconstructing her own celebrity, opening the december 27 show with a story about famed talent agent sue mengers, who represented her negotiations for hudson hawk and, in her bid to make bernhard "a superstar like ann-margret," mengers attempted to more than double the $200,000 offer for her client to co-star.and, while history shows she did, in fact, appear in the film, as bernhard ominously recalled, "i was never offered that salary again..." regaling the audience with that showbiz fable, not unlike the tale of icarus flying too close to the sun, she proved keenly aware that to many, "stars" are essentially the last remaining mythological creatures continue reading…

sandra bernhard is still here, damn it: review of ‘sandra monica boulevard: coast to coast’ as 2016 draws to a close, sandra bernhard has returned to joe’s pub—the intimate performance venue attached to new york’s public theater—for her annual year-ending series of shows, and she is defiantly upbeat.in sandra monica boulevard: coast to coast, her opening number—a jangly, energetic cover of billy joel’s “say goodbye to hollywood”—aims to project the stoic closure of its lyrics to the past year, a theme she picked up in her ensuing monologue. the road trip that inspired its title can also double as a metaphor for taking stock on where you’ve come from and what comes next. in a year—and week!—seemingly dominated by celebrity deaths, in which it seems the outpouring of appreciation for the deceased may not have been adequately reflected while we still had the person in question with us, the show makes one wonder what to make of bernhard’s distinctive place in the entertainment firmament. she is a show business stalwart of over three decades, a longevity that bernhard lampoons when slyly referring to having met her longtime accompanying pianist, mitch kaplan, in 1885, as opposed to the actual 1985 continue reading…

sandra bernhard drives down ‘sandra monica boulevard’ in l.a. stop“it’s a crazy time and i’m not going to talk about it,” said sandra bernhard by way of introducing “sandra monica boulevard: coast to coast,” her traveling one-woman show that kicked off its three-day l.a. swing-by thursday night at the sorting room at the wallis annenberg center for the performing arts. “we’re living in a lawless society.”she was referring, of course, to this year’s presidential election. and of course she did talk about it — and everything and everyone else. because that’s what bernhard does. from her scorching sailor’s tongue to the fiery curly hair to the giant mick jagger lips from which bernard belted billy joel’s “say goodbye to hollywood” to the 150 fans gathered for her performance (jesse tyler furguson was at a table up front), bernhard remains as brash and brazen as she was in the 1970s, when she first came to fame critiquing celebrity culture and satirizing establishment politicians at places like the comedy story and on “the richard pryor show.”all the old hollywood greats were on bernhard’s menu for discussion during her 90-minute show, from talent agent sue mengers to ann-margret to legendary singer tom jones. accompanied by her back-up band throughout the show, bernhard waxed nostalgic about beverly hills, the city where she first decided to make a go at stand-up while attending beauty school on the side: “my entire higher education cost $365 dollars.” continue reading…
