bravo to susanna m√§lkki and the la phil for a brilliant celebration of mtt. playing rhapsody in blue at disney hall was a dream of an event! i concluded with mtt's beautiful song grace. also a big shout-out to piano tech extraordinaire mori kina, whose pianos are the best anywhere!#lastminutegig #gershwin #rhapsodyinblue #laphil

anatomy of a cancellation‚Ä¶1) manager calls late wednesday night - la phil needs a last-minute gershwin rhapsody in blue for saturday night. am i available? theoretically yes, but i need to finish doctoral auditions at rice all day thursday. there‚Äôs a 9:59pm flight to lax. 2) due to bush airport construction and consequent massive traffic jam, i am one minute late to check in my bag and consequently i‚Äôm bumped off the flight and shuttled to an airport hotel. so much for my three million miler and 1k status on united. nobody at the airport cared in the least. (the guy on the phone was helpful, though.)3) up at 4:30am to catch the first friday morning flight to lax and will be driven straight to rehearsal. it‚Äôs the jazz band version and i‚Äôll thrilled to be playing with the la phil again. 4) forgot to mention, i‚Äôm replacing yuja wang. talk about pressure ‚Ä¶!la phil#laphil #rhapsodyinblue #lastminutegig
