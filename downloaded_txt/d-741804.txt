things i do


















hey! i wrote a book!
launch it - 300+ things iâve learned as a designer, developer and creative director. for over 20 years i have talked with fellow designers, developers and digital creatives who were asking for advice on how to launch their  careers. as a creative director, i have mentored people on topics like work ethic, finding inspiration, creative process, skill acquisition, how to get a job, handling clients, agency life, freelance, self-promotion and work life balance. i scoured through years of old emails, interviews, presentations and conversations for any advice that i had given others. some of those findings are loosely organized into this book.

i have designed, developed, or animated 40+ fwa award-winning sites, 3 awwwards, and 3 adobe cutting edge awards. my work has been featured in over 60 magazines including advanced photoshop, web designer, .net, and computer arts projects. i have also served as a judge for the adobeâ® design achievement awards for students and the prestigious fwa site of the year. in 2014 i was honored by .net magazine as one of the top 50 designers in the world. in 2017 i published the book launch it: 300+ things iâve learned as a designer, developer and creative director. in 2019 i was a part of the nasa/spacex team that won an emmy award for best interactive broadcast. in 2021 i published the book the designer's journey. i have most recently worked with spacex as a principal ui/ux designer, where i helped to design and develop the crew dragon vehicle interfaces used by nasa astronauts to fly into space. those interfaces have now flown over 50 humans to space!
when not reclined in front of the computer designing and developing interactive projects, i enjoy spending time with my wife and two daughters, helping my mom on the family ranch in silverado, ca., crossfit, traveling, coaching football, statistics, archiving projects, and engaging in the relentless pursuit of photography.
