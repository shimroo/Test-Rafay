client testimonials 

























abg digicon series 3 is a fast and effective digital label finishing machine. it is the perfect solution to finish our digitally printed web as it offers the fastest set up, lowest set up waste and consistent register. the quality of the solution and support that we received from vinsak was highly appreciative.







mr. rajeev chatwal
kwality offset printers (delhi, india)









we began our journey into labels with vinsak in 2017 and have really grown since then. beginning with a humble vinsak slitter rewinder, we added a fully loaded 8 color lombardi synchroline 430 flexo press, a vinsak usar die cutting and slitting system, a vinsak vis1200k ink jet and a vinsak lfd flatbed die cutter over the years. we are now known in the north of india as the leader in quality for specialty labels, thermal boarding passes and tickets, short run shrink films and specialty packaging. the kit from vinsak has really performed and delivered as promised.







mr. raman anand chahal
neovation graphics (gurgaon, india)









we purchased a vinsak usar die cutting and slitting machine in 2017. the price performance ratio of the equipment and the technical support from vinsak has been excellent.







mr. sm nasir uddin mahmud
interlabels robust (bangladesh)









to address our in-house requirements of short run aluminum blister foil, vinsak has provided us with lombardi synchroline flexo press. the machine has performed well and ensured that our export commitments are now met efficiently and economically. the sustainability aspect of moving away from solvent based gravure inks to low migration uv inks has been an added feather in our cap.







mr. praveen narlaka
aurobindo pharma limited (hyderabad, india)









this is our second purchase of a flexo press and our repeated business is proof enough of our satisfaction with the lombardi/vinsak team towards all aspects of the business. keeping in mind our highly technical requirements of special units and special applications for the markets we operate it, we find the solutions offered by them give us the best roi







mr. abiram reddy
citrus packaging solution pvt ltd (hyderabad, india)









this is our second flexo press purchase within a short span of 3 years, and our repeat business with the vinsak/lombardi team proves our satisfaction with the team's authenticity and commitment. working with vinsak on previous projects has resulted in good success and we are happy with the technical services and application support provided by the vinsak/lombardi team. we look forward to future technical developments with vinsak for our specialized functional label products.







mr. manish desai
mudrika labels pvt ltd (mumbai, india)









in vinsak we found a partner of choice, says mr. rajendra kothari. “they have taken on the complete project as a turnkey, procured and installed the machines, and provided operator training to make us operative in the shortest possible time. their continued after sales support has ensured our growth in this segment.







mr. rajendra kothari
samyak india pvt ltd (maharashtra, india)









vinsak has been highly supportive and instrumental in helping us to finalize on the synchroline flexo machine and then install and begin production even during the times of the pandemic. our move from a traditional commercial printer to a full-fledged packaging house has been smooth and ensured that we remain relevant to the market for many years to come.

mr. rama krishna
classique labels & packaging llc (ras al khaimah, uae)









their consultative approach is very different to some of the hard-nosed sales teams with whom we have dealt in the past. in fact, our decision to move from another global brand to lombardi was greatly driven by the service provided by vinsak. we have recently installed a lombardi 530 10 color press for our expansion into shrink films and sustainable packaging
