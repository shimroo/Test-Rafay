“chadwick electric was fantastic!  prompt communication, fair pricing- did a great job.  many electricians would not touch our historic home because of the older electric (knob and tube) but chadwick electric didn't shy away- very professional, very competent.  will hire them again for our next electric project!!”– ec

"chadwick did great work. tad arrived at the scheduled time, explained what he needed to do (i was rewiring a 5-prong electric range outlet to hold a standard outlet), and gave the quote. there were 2 options, he was able to make it very clear the difference between the two things he could do. the job is done with no hassle. i'd definitely use them again.” – dave r.
