looking for a spiritual home? you are welcome here.visit our church events page for details about social, educational, and service opportunities.join us every sunday at 10:00am for worship in the sanctuary.click here to access our youtube page to watch worship services, concerts, weddings and funerals.click here to access the worship bulletin.  you matter to us!













founded in 1842, greenville community church is a warm and welcoming community that seeks to live out jesus’ call to love and serve all people. we come from many different faith traditions, and some from no faith tradition, and joyfully celebrate our diversity. we welcome people of different ages, abilities, ethnicities, races, sexual orientations and gender identities from across westchester county and beyond. we believe spiritual growth is a journey, and we thrive when we walk that journey together, sharing our stories, questions, doubts, wonderings, and gifts as we experience the renewing power of christ. we treasure our children and youth and seek to offer them opportunities to grow. the sunday experience anchors our life together, and we love vibrant worship, beauty, food (!) and fun. join us in-person or online sundays at 10:00am!faith matters to us!













a church home is a place to come together and make friends, but it is also a place to grow and be nurtured spiritually. it’s a place to find out what god has to say to us and learn about how god wants us to live. our church is part of a protestant denomination whose beginnings in the united states are traced to a worship service in 1628 over a flour mill in what is now new york city. you’ll find loving spiritual care and guidance here, whether you’re 1 or 100! if you seek a faith that will help you live a meaningful and rewarding life in today’s world, we believe you will find it here.mission matters to us!













at greenville church we reach out to show people the love of god locally and around the world. we believe in service to others. that starts right in our own congregation and then expands to the larger community and world. and, it’s not just about giving away money (although we do that too). we believe in helping others in hands-on ways, like bringing cans of soup for the food pantry, going on a road trip to plant a garden to feed people in need, and giving away 200 pairs of shoes to children.worship with us!our sunday worship service is held year-round at 10:00 a.m. sunday school begins most sundays at the same time; students begin in the sanctuary and depart after the children’s message. parking is readily available. join us after the service for coffee hour in hessler hall, featuring delicious treats and great fellowship. you may also join us on livestream, and watched archived services on our youtube page.











 








compelled by the inclusive love of god revealed in jesus christ, we envision a day when all people–of all sexual orientations, gender expressions and identities, races, abilities, and ages–are fully affirmed as children of god, free of violence based on human prejudices and judgments.greenville community church is a room for all congregation! 





we stand upfor the dignity of all people.we stand upfor immigrants.we stand upfor gay rights.we believe injesus christ, who said, “love one another.” come stand with us.
