al-fuqra exposed





i've not been blogging actively this summer as you can see. however, i've not gone away altogether. this blog took a turn a couple years ago when i began writing here almost exclusively about al-fuqra and muslims of america, thus i decided to create a new site as an archive of information on this group. i don't have a complete archive at the new site yet, but it does contain some additional information - links to additional information sources, photos, video, etc. i hope it will be of use to those who are interested.click here to visit alfuqraexposed
