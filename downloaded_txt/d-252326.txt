anonymous writes "
i first saw a paramotor on the web, never a second thought about getting one. before long i'm working on getting the extra money to buy one, not ever having flown anything before in my life. i ended up selling my old hobby, a 1970 olds cuttlass supreme.
with cash in hand, i asked around about where i could see one fly. i was told at the beach and i found the guy with no problem. after watching him fly a few times and making it look so easy, i knew i had to have one. my mind was made up.
he sold me a new wing, an apco prima, and a rebuilt adventure, which still runs well at a price i could afford. i happily signed stating i would get training with a local paraglider trainer."
