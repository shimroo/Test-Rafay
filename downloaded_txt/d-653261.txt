occupational aspirations 










how can you not be happy when you have a student who, when
she’s “grown up”, wants to be either a tooth fairy, or a cheeseburger?



thank you god.  

thank
you for placing this wonderfully innocent personality in my class.


it's going to be a marvelous year!

seizure disorder







note:  i haven’t written in a while, i think
because until now i haven’t needed to write.  and maybe that’s a good thing.





seizure disorder



it’s been almost 22 years since the accident and closed head
injury that nearly took my life…but things are still popping up.  



since about the summer of 1993 i’ve been having these
“things”, as i call them, and until now they have been a mystery.  



i can feel them starting and they’re a strange feeling that
kind of moves over or through me like a wave.  it builds in intensity to a peak and then tapers off.  they feel like they last for 5 to ten
minutes, but melissa, who has witnessed more than one, tells me they only last
for about 30 or 40 seconds.   



my speech comes out in nonsense words, yet i can tell i'm not making sense.   i can feel
myself trying to communicate, i know what i want to say and i can even hear the
correct words in my head, but the words that come out don’t make sense.  not even to me.  once i had one while teaching a math lesson and i kept teaching but i felt like i was saying everything twice.


after having these “things” every 3 to 6 months for almost
20 years, going to several doctors and having multiple mri and eeg tests
without results i had given up hope of ever getting a true diagnosis.   i had just gotten used to having them and moving on with the day.     



however, i recently had one while eating dinner with melissa
at home.  i felt it coming on and
said, “one of those things is starting.” 




she started asking me questions.  “can you count to 10?” “what year is it?”  “who is the president?”



honestly, i don’t remember if i could answer them.



she’s seen them before, but this one scared her.  that’s why i agreed to go to the doctor
again, but i wasn’t expecting much. 




long story short, dr. gerhardt found (after looking at my mri for about 5 seconds) scarring on the left
side of my brain that he said is causing a discharge.  i believe it is an electrical discharge of some kind.  i don’t know if it’s like a blackout or a power surge, but i intend to ask dr. gerhardt at my next appointment.  



the doctor also knew right away that these were
seizures.  



it wasn't until he said that it's possible to die from these that i agreed to start taking seizure medication.  i'm only doing it for melissa and macy.



i don’t like it at all and i believe i’m still in denial. 



what i do know is that this is weighing heavily on my mind…thanks
for listening.



writing this is like therapy for me.  i’ll probably write more later.

i couldn't find any words that rhyme today







you know, i couldn’t find
any words that rhyme today 

and i don’t know if i care
to look anymore 

it’s strange, but part of me
doesn’t care 

it doesn’t care if i ever
rhyme again

rhyming suggests enjoyment

but rhyming is hard work

hard work is therapy

this is therapy

therapy is hard work

but rhyming is hard work

i don’t care if i ever rhyme
again

it’s strange, but part of me
doesn’t care

and i don’t know if i care
to look anymore

i couldn’t find any words
that rhyme today...you know

7 days left










our year’s winding down, 

and it has been long

i don’t quite know why, 

it could be my new thong



but that’s not a matter, 

that we should discuss

it’s not like i’m some old man, 

wearing a truss 



a truss?  what
the hell?  

where is my poem going?

there are too many words 

and my mind’s overflowing



the year’s winding down,

yes, yes now we’re on track

now all that i need, 

is some catchy wise crack



a crack?  aw
heck!

now we’re back to the thong,

i’ve got to write something 

or things will go wrong



not thongs, tightie-whities,

and not boxer briefs

i must write of school things,

to give some relief



i must shift my focus, 

to matters of school

there are kids there are teachers,

and both topics are cool



or the fact that ours days,

are now down to seven

when you’re in single digits,

you know you’re in heaven



to get thoughts off my thong,

it seems best to say

relax and breathe easy,

cause it’s our last monday!

20 days left...





years ago i started writing poems and emailing them to my grade level and or school.  somehow a kind of end of year countdown started a few years ago.  i don't do every single day, i write when i'm inspired.  

i decided to post them here.  at least some of them.

enjoy,
hugh


20 days left



there’s a chance it’s just me,

but you may feel it too

our clocks move quite slowly,

up one minute back two



each year at about now,

our odd time dance gets loose

you feel like your head,

is stuck in a noose 



we know the steps well,

though it’s not a line dance

you waltz or you tango,

you boot-scoot and prance



what makes each dance hard,

it the students these days

they’re bodies all move,

in peculiar ways!



when i say things like that,

you all think i sound old

it’s a damn metaphor!

so read on and don’t scold



but just when you think,

things have gone on too long

your feet start to ache,

and you’d like a new song



cg’s voice pipes in, 

and she starts with her schpeel   

then the dance floor gets restless,

the excitement you feel



the band plays its last tune,

as you glide round the floor

then you kick those small backsides,

right out the front door



then you rest and prepare,

for tomorrow’s swaray

i never said “booze,”

but you like it that way



for i say every word, 

with a nod and a wink

and you know that it’s time,

for a rather large drink



kim’s growing potatoes,

that we’ll use in fun ways

they’ll be ready to drink,

in just 20 days!

nude beach





and so we’re on this cruise with st. maarten as on of our ports.  i’ve been to st. maarten before.  it’s a fun port with nice beaches.  melissa and i decided to do an excursion called rhino rider.  basically, a small, inflatable boat with an outboard motor.  it seats 2 and i drove with melissa on the back.  
our guide led the rhino convoy of about 10-12 rhinos.  
st. maarten is a small island that is divided down the middle.  one side is french and the other side is dutch. 

(well, it’s not really the middle somehow the french cheated and their side is larger…but i digress)
we started on the dutch side and our guide led us around and through the waterways over to a beach on the french side.  before we left he made sure to let us know that the french side is a bit more open minded than the dutch side.  and as such, is littered with clothing optional beaches, and that we shouldn’t be alarmed, or point, or laugh, or giggle when we see these free spirited bathers.  
my first thought was, “hey, i’ll get to drive a fun boat and see some fun sights to boot.”
i was only half right.
driving the boat was a blast!  i highly recommend it if you ever have the chance.  
as for the nude beach…
well it was somewhat of a disappointment.  for you see, there were two couples enjoying the surf wearing nothing more that sunglasses and smiles.  however, they were also probably five years older than my parents and not in very good shape.  
i tried to avert my eyes, but i kept finding myself looking in their direction.  i don’t know why.  maybe i was hoping i was wrong, maybe i was hoping someone easier to watch would join their party, maybe i was hoping they would put some clothes on. 
whatever the reason, next time someone says, “nude beach,” i’ll know not to get my hopes up.
            note to mom and dad:  in no way did i mean to imply that your age should keep you away from a nude beach.  i’m sure you both will fit right in.  

            just make sure i’m not around
