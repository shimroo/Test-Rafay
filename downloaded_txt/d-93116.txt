if the old exclusivisms evolved into the exclusivism of the enlightenment, from the moon, together, we can see universality...
as a global epic tale, i am speaking to the entire planet, not merely the western world. while the whole is always more than the sum of its parts, i gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to such writers and thinkers as the historian arnold toynbee, carl jung, huston smith, aldous huxley, joseph campbell, thomsas merton, and many others of open and universal sensibility. campbell, especially, wrote on shamanism and myth and their power to heal the tribe through a visionary experience and tale. campbell also wrote repeatedly about the overview image of earthrise, rising above the horizon of the moon, as the great new mythic image and symbol for our time.
"it's very contemporary, in some ways, and very much old school... this is really some cool stuff, i have to say, 
        and i'm not just saying that, just to say it. it really is, and when you hear some of his epic poetry and poetry, hopefully you'll agree and want to grab a copy of the parliament of poets. if you've done any study of classic epic poetry, this fits the bill. and don't let that turn you away. it's really good stuff."

"quantum physics and poetry â reflections." quantum physics intimates a whole new way of understanding âreligionâ that can help heal the psychic wounds of modernity.

fourteen years in the making, the myth of the enlightenment is frederick glaysherâs first collection of literary essays since the grove of the eumenides in 2007; 2024 revised edition. divided into three sections, these essays and reviews were all written during the 21st century, with many of them central to his evolving intellectual and spiritual struggle to write his epic poem, the parliament of poets, which he completed and published in late 2012; 2024 edition. 
        these essays open up glaysherâs own biography and his life-long interest in the writings of leo tolstoy, rabindranath tagore, john milton, saul bellow, robert hayden, and other poets and writers, offering a fresh, new vision of literature and culture....
reviews
âin an era in which the value of human life has become as precarious and narrow as the study of the humanities itself, we need glaysherâs voice more than ever.â âphillip m. richards, department of english, colgate university

from the introduction: 
thirty years in the making, set  partly on the moon, at the apollo 11 landing site, the sea of tranquility.
in a world of quantum science, apollo, the greek god of poetry, calls all the poets of the nations, ancient and modern, east and west, to assemble on the moon to consult on the meaning of modernity. the parliament of poets sends the persona, the poet of the moon, on a journey to the seven continents to learn from all of the spiritual and wisdom traditions of humankind. on earth and on the moon, the poets teach a new global, universal vision of life.
one of the major themes is the power of women and the female spirit across cultures. another is the nature of science and religion, including quantum physics, as well as the "two cultures," science and the humanities.
all the great shades appear at the apollo 11 landing   site in the sea of tranquility: homer and virgil from the greek and   roman civilizations; dante, spenser, and milton hail from the   judeo-christian west; rumi, attar, and hafez step forward from islam; du   fu and li po, basho and zeami, step forth from china and japan; the   poets of the bhagavad gita and the ramayana meet on that plain; griots   from africa; shamans from indonesia and australia; murasaki shikibu,   emily dickinson, and jane austen, poets and seers of all ages, bards,   rhapsodes, troubadours, and minstrels, major and minor, hail across the   halls of time and space.
that transcendent rose symbol of our age, the   earth itself, viewed from the heavens, one world with no visible   boundaries, metaphor of the oneness of the human race, reflects its   blue-green light into the blackness of the starry universe.

longer excerpts from reviews of the parliament of poets: an epic poem
"to put this in context, in my view the last complete and true epic poem in the english language was paradise lost written by john milton in the 17th century, and apart from that poem there are only two others: the anonymous beowulf from old english, and the unfinished faerie queen by edmund spenser from the 16th century. don juan, by byron [also unfinished], is perhaps a true mock epic and apart from that the only poet since milton who has come remotely close to writing in the epic style is keats with his two sublime, but unfinished and maybe unfinishable (even had he lived), hyperion fragments... 
      this brings us to the 20th century and all the phoney poets (brits and americans alike) claiming to write epics, âmodern epics,â but doing no such thing. the most egregious example of this would be ezra pound and his cantos: unreadable and undecipherable rubbish masquerading as a work of genius in the manner we are nowadays too familiar with in conceptual art and music. indeed, only two types of people ever read the cantos: university professors who make a career out of untangling it; and wannabe poets who write just like that (except of course completely differently â solipsism smears the pane in its own way: thereâs a brown smudge, but hereâs a green stain) and naturally vote for models justifying their own inanities. (as for modern epics of the âhuman mindâ â beginning wordsworth, whitman et al. â these, despite their odd purple patches, seem extended and tedious forms of narcissism)... 
      one fabulous quality of this poem is its clarity and luminous quality. i love the fact that despite the wide ranging topographical and lexical references this poem is easy to understand and follow: it is a poet writing for people, not one trying to be clever, and not one concealing their lack of poetry in obfuscation."
      i take the view, therefore, and surprisingly to myself, that glaysher is really an epic poet and this is an epic poem! one can hardly congratulate him enough, then, on this achievement, since it has been so long awaited... â glaysher has written a masterpiece... i strongly recommend frederick glaysherâs poem and hope he will find a larger readership for it. 
      âthe society of classical poets (2,272 words) 
"a great epic poem of startling originality and universal significance, ingeniously enriching the canon of 'literary epics' while in every way partaking of the nature of world literature. glaysher is in a creative dialog with the greatest epic poets of all time. he is bringing together in beautiful verse form diverse visions of humanity from all over the world, frequently casting them in the form of spatial and cosmic imagery. a pure joy. contemporary 'world literature' at its best. the cover itself is worth the price of the book." âhans ruprecht, ckcu literary news, carleton university, ottawa, canada, author on goethe, borges, etc. 
"i'm not kidding! get this book by frederick glaysher asap! mr. glaysher has written an epic poem of major importance that is guaranteed to bring joy and an overwhelming sense of beauty and understanding to readers who will travel the space ways with this exquisite poet. while the poem reads like the classic poetry of milton, it has the contemporary edge of genius modernity. i am truly awed by this poet's use of epic poetry that today's readers will connect with, enjoy and savor every word, every line and every section. frederick glaysher is a master poet who knows his craft from the inside out, and this is really truly a major accomplishment and contribution to american letters. jump in. taste and see if what i say (and many others are saying) about this tome is not the truth. once you enter, you will not stop until the end. a landmark achievement mr. glaysher. bravo!" âml liebler, department of english, wayne state university
"the artistic culmination of a long spiritual journey. if you choose to read the parliament of poetsâand i hope that you will!âknow that you are reading a devotional work of a poet-seer, one who yearns for and envisions a unified world in which spiritual verities draw all people together." âbob dixon-kolar, assistant professor of english, college of dupage, glen ellyn, illinois
"i am in awe of the brilliance of this book! food for the soul, and answers to humanity's most pressing problems, right where they belong, in the epic poetry of all the teachers, magicians, prophets, shamans, and poets of all time... bravo, bravo, bravo. everyone must read this book, especially if you enjoy literature, wisdom, and philosophy. we held a poetry salon in honor of this book. it was wonderful!" âanodea judith, author, novato, california
"in the classic epic poem, the hero suffers many challenges, meets many obstacles, and experiences what joseph campbell described as the heroâs journey... a hero must meet obstacles, and in the case of the persona, the obstacles are both internal and externalâvery jungian is our hero. the quest for individuation or the coming together in wholeness, is evident as we, the readers/listeners follow the trials and travels of our hero. beautiful book."â âthe examiner, portland, oregon
"the purpose of the spiritual journey of the poet of the moon is to seek deliverance of the modern human from the captivity of nothingness, nihilism and atheism, and from the resulting chaos and chasm of soul. from the versatile he gets scores of life-affirming lessons, yet the core meaning of all is that the supreme being as well as the earth is one, and so human beings are one nation irrespective of their clan, class, color, race, religion and gender. in this earth human beings are part of the great mysteryâs creation and their duty is to keep the balance and harmony of the universe, to achieve union, to choose sacrifice, and to be self-controlled. in this manner glaysher sings the song of âone earth, without borders, mother earth, her embrace encircling one people, humankindâ (19)â¦. the lucid and placid feet of the language moves deftly and smoothly from the beginning up to the last line of the poem. bravo to the poet for this toilsome but brilliant endeavour."â âumme salma, international islamic university, department of english language and literature, chittagong, bangladesh, in  transnational literatureâ vol. 7 no. 1, november 2014, flinders university, adelaide, australia
"the parliament of poetsâ is an exquisitely rendered epic poem that weaves ancient and contemporary vision into the heart of modern darkness and the light of eternal hope.... for this reader it was like being enfolded into a glorious, celestial, orchestral song in which every instrument is finely tuned, timed, and vital to the whole, with different melodies coming together as a single motion to do something none of them could do alone.... 'always the world awaits the poet who can find the right words, more so now than ever,' says tolstoy, final words of counsel to the persona after his many crossings. in this book are such words, and the author, like gandhi, must surely be 'wrapped in selfless practice'âdedicating thirty years of his life to finding them on our behalf.â the parliament of poetsâ is a worthy literary masterpiece, the author a curator of the human story, the book a living cultural artifact. once read, you know your life was impoverished without it."â ânew consciousness review,  portland, oregon,â and amazon review
"it only takes the first few paragraphs of this modern epic poem to feel the mental gush of ideas, fascinating juxtapositionings, and unique symbolism for our time.... the reader travels with the epic poemâs narrator, and hero, the persona, exploring their journey throughout the seven continents â and transcending space and time - in order to acquire wisdom from mankind. in the case of the persona, much of the struggle and the obstacles relate to whether or not he can find his way, or know himself. it is perhaps not a surprise, then, that the parliament of poets discusses a cross-cultural milieu, especially given glaysherâs vast and varied experiences in his own life." âthe jewish post and news of winnipeg; landmark report (toronto reprint) canada
"what attracted me was the ambition in this work, which attempts to look at what poetic traditions, ancient and modern might have to offer to a world which perhaps has lost touch with its spiritual and ecological centre of gravity... but possibly even the ambition of these [odysseus elytis and derek walcott] is dwarfed by what is attempted here. ...he is attempting to unify lessons from many traditions, eastern and western, and there are references to many poets from english language ones to ones from places as diverse as china, india, mexico and poland, as well as many times. this is an attempt to fuse a truly global vision drawing on many poetic traditions...
      "this is a highly stimulating read. the range of reading on display is impressive. it is refreshing to see poetry with a mission, and a suggested role in the modern world. this work is an impressive intellectual as well as visionary feat as well as being poetic. it will certainly be of interest to those of a philosophical, poetic and visionary frame of mind. ...i will be getting a book version of this work. there is much to ponder on here as well as to relish." —graham mummery,  amazon uk reviewï»¿
"the parliament of poets is one of the most important books of our time. in this grand sweeping epic, glaysher has managed to live up to the task given to him by the parliament of poets. ...a new vision for humanity; one of unity and oneness of humankind. ...synthesizing and integrating the great thinkers of all time. ...a tangible vision of our shared humanity. ...an impassioned plea that we wake up before we destroy ourselves and our one precious planet. ...an inspired epic that integrates the ancient wisdom teachings of the world's greatest wisdom teachers and poets. ...a new vision and sense of responsibility towards our shared humanity. an impassioned plea on behalf of humanity that reaches down and grabs the human longing for the awakened heart." —tina benson, transpersonal/jungian psychotherapist, mill valley, california
"the plot follows a poet (presumably glaysher himself, hinted at in the title of âpersonaâ), taken magically to the moon, where a collection of the worldâs greatest poets have assembled a parliament to consult on the âmeaning of modernityâ. ...an attempt to merge the sciences and the humanities to reach a greater understanding of the human condition. ...the poetry and language is rather beautiful. glaysher has grasped epic poetryâs rhythms and cadences, favouring an iambic meter to create a pleasant, rolling pace to the piece. ...itâs really very readable."â âsavageonline, london, uk
"the power of a mythological tale is interwoven into the fabric of its narrative. the crescendo that builds, and which ultimately leads the reader to its climax of revelation, is the key ingredient that makes the epic poem so seductive as a literary form. with this in mind i shall not comment overly on the story in the parliament of poets for fear of spoiling its essential spiritual message and core dynamic for potential readers. this is more than simply trying to avoid ruining its 'plotline' or fear of introducing a 'spoiler' into the equation but is, instead, my way of safe-guarding the inherent esoteric value of the work for a reader - one which is invariably expressed within its whole rhythmic phrasing and textual structure....
"in this regard the parliament of poets - both as a story and as an independently-produced publication, is a success on many levels. it is a tale of, and about, our age of modernity and several contemporary themes have been woven into its narrative in such a way that remind us that perhaps the spiritual crisis humanity faces is an extension of the technological age that we now live in. on the other hand, the poem, it should be stated, is not without its odd flashes of humour and dry irony which, once again enriches its overall value as a dynamic and engaging piece of art rather than a dry academic exercise....
"this is a uniquely powerful work that introduces an established and powerful literary tradition to a world that is in desperate need of its essential rhythms and harmonies for spiritual sustenance." âspirituality today, uk
"the parliament of poets is, in the truest sense of the word, an epic poem. whilst not grandiose in its execution it does deal with one of the greatest challenges to face humanity at this moment in its history - namely the desperate need for a spirituality context that serves humanity going forward. the style of the narrative is engaging and flows with colour and descriptive intent whilst not being overly 'flowery' in a way that so often befalls many other inspired poets. indeed the story is grounded in contemporary issues and includes moments of humour and sardonic wit which are enjoyable. the main story is an interesting proposition, that maybe it is poets and philosophers, rather than activists and politicians, who can ultimately help transform this world into something better." âmr. p. j. morris, amazon uk
"frederick glaysher is truly a genius poet! the parliament of poets carried me on the journey of universality and all is one with the melodic rhythm only poetry can bring. everyone needs to take this visit to the moon and look about the universe and all that it encompasses with the awe with which it deserves! i wish i had half the talent to express in poetic verse all the many perspectives and beliefs and visions that were incorporated in this book! it is so worth the time for each of us physically, emotionally, psychologically, mentally but even more spiritually to read this magnificent epic that will raise your eyes to the sky and wonder how someone could capture it all so well! congratulations frederick glaysher....it was an honor to read this book!" âcheryl b. duttweiler, fernandina beach, florida, amazon review
"a book for the upliftment of spirit...and purpose!! if you're looking for inspiration, for the upliftment of your spirit, for a meaningful connection with the direction of evolution as divinely guided by unity consciousness, for a sense of renewed and heightened purpose, read the parliament of poets by frederick glaysher. it will make your day, week, month, year...and life!!" âmike schwager, florida, amazon review 
"frederick glaysher has written a truly epic poem. over a 30-year period, he crafted a story of history, archetypal energies, famous writers and poets from around the world, spiritual lessons, personal growth, adventure, and beauty. his writing takes you soaring across space and time, and his wealth of knowledge and wisdom shine through on every page. it makes me wish i could study at his feet, or that i could sit at his feet and listen to him weave this tale in person. 'look inside' and you'll be hooked - just as i was. buy this book. read it. be amazed. it's awesome."

"it seems that an epic poem is just about the perfect container for works that provide insight, humor, and speculation about the bigger issues of life, and i'm so glad i found the parliament of poets. the poet's narrator is a seeker, and he has sought to understand both the philosophies that have guided poets and sages, and to understand the earth from the perspective of a narrator looking down on it from the moon. the narrator makes several trips through outer space and goes back and forth to the moon, as if he were an astronaut. that trope is, indeed, a vital part of this epic poem, a poem that asks us to gather our collective wisdom (as if we were buzz aldrins) and apply it to saving the planet and ourselves. the poem is, at times, amusing, serious, philosophical, lyrical, and entertaining. i especially enjoyed don quixote's cameo appearances. bravo. a fine and enjoyable read." âmarylee macdonald, tempe, arizona, amazon review 
"faced with great suffering and overwhelming obstacles, the journey of the hero is beautifully portrayed in this classic epic poem 'the parliament of poets' by frederick glaysher.
        can poets and philosophers be the key to transformation of the world? discover what happens when the greatest poets and philosophers that ever walked the earth gather on the moon and create a new vision for humanity." ârebekah rose, amazon review
"glaysher...has shown...that with the right subject matter and the right language, one can create an epic poem even in today's age. ...a beautiful poem that falls off the tongue smoothly. all through this epic poem, the poet of the moon is addressing or discussing the buddhist concept ofâ itai doshinâ or the unity of the mind in the midst of diversity, which is also the concept that underpins the ubuntuâ philosophy, which translates into 'i am, because we are'. ...in effect the poet wants to see the unity of what he calls 'false dichotomies': science and religion, reason and intuition, material and spiritual, white and black, and others. ...an excellent piece of poetry." ânana fredua-agyeman, accra, ghana, africa, imagenations;â goodreads
"i found this book to be up to the standards set by homer. ...very thought provoking as it brings into question what humanity is doing to the earth and each other." —librarything, usa 

"most of the contemporary poets and critics claim that epic is not suitable for our modern age. but frederick glaysher has proven them wrong... 'the parliament of poets' has all the grandeur, all the loftiness and qualities which make an 'effort for an epic' a 'true epic.' in essence, 'the parliament of poets' is a song of unity, an audacious declaration that unity does not mean conformity, it means being in harmony. the poet himself is the main character of this epic poem, who travels to the moon, meets a large number of great poets and writers of the world, comes back to earth to have some glimpses of bygone times. throughout the entire journey, many poets, writers, sages guide the poet and share their invaluable knowledge and insights." âratul pal, rajshahi, bangladesh, goodreads
"awesome book!! this was ordered as a gift and i have to admit i had a hard time letting it go! highly recommend both the book and the seller!" —stanleys mom, amazon review 
"the poets that are identified in this fascinating book see a universal brotherhood...." —amazon  reviewâ

"you know how on space probes they have these little goodie bags full of things. it is my feeling that they should include a copy of the parliament of poets, because you give this overview, this panorama of the best of human civilization, the voice of her poets, the voice of her dreamers and thinkers, and done it with great honor to each of them, and so i do want to commend your book to our listeners. don't be intimidated by an epic poem. it's really, coming back to that image of the storyteller sitting around the campfires of the world,  dipping into and weaving the story of humanity, in the most beautiful, mellifluous language. so kudos to you, sir! thirty years were not wasted. if anybody listening has contacts to nasa..." —miriam knight
"i was so impressed with the parliament of poets. ...i love the vision of apollo calling all poets and wise people to the moon to debate the meaning of modernity. i mean it's such a contemporary question and it's so deliciously wrapped in history and culture, and the poet, the persona character, he travels many journeys to find the answers to the meaning of modernity. ...so the vision, essentially, is one of a global vision. ...an amazing, wonderful book." —julie clayton
"frederick glaysher in conversation about his great epic poem of startling originality and universal significance, the parliament of poets, which is ingeniously enriching the canon of 'literary epics' while in every way partaking of the nature of world literature.  ...a truly universal epic." —hans ruprecht, ckcu literary news, carleton university, ottawa, canada. june 2013.  includes two excerpts fromâ the parliament of poets: an epic poem. 26 minutes (skip bbc).  here 
      "with his new book, the parliament of poets, frederick glaysher is in a creative dialog with the greatest epic poets of all time. he is bringing together in beautiful verse form, tending, as he writes 'to the iambic pentameter, depending on thought and need', diverse visions of humanity from all over the world. frederick glaysher's poetic imagination is frequently casting them in the form of spatial and cosmic imagery. that is very exalting to the reader's spirit. what is more, in reading his new book one is not only compassing, beyond the horizon of empirical facts, a borderless world, but one is also beholding the 'oneness' of humankind in a different light. â¢ 'the parliament of poets' (earthrise press, 2012) by frederick glaysher is a pure joy; embodied in a literary work of fine verbal art, it is contemporary 'world literature' at its best. the cover itself is worth the price of the book." —hans ruprecht, ckcu literary news, carleton university, ottawa, canada. august 6, 2013.  â a radio ckcu/literary news 'encore' 26 minutes (skip bbc).
