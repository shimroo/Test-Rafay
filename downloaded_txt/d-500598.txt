what is the difference between criminal procedure and civil procedure?



when a crime has been committed, action is taken by a government agency against the person, persons, organization or other entity that violated the law. the first purpose of a criminal prosecution is punishment, which frequently consists of a fine or jail time. in a civil matter, the dispute is between two or more individuals or entities. the first purpose of a civil prosecution is obtaining compensation for the wronged person or entity. settlement in a civil matter is generally an award of a money judgment. a criminal sentence is not imposed in a civil matter.contact us now to discuss your case with one of our experienced attorneys.



if i hire an attorney but do not want to go to trial, can i settle?



in the course of preparing a case for trial, your personal injury attorney will work with the defense attorneys and insurance companies in an effort to secure a fair settlement for you and your family. the final decision to accept an offer of settlement or go to trial is yours alone to make.contact us now to discuss your case with one of our experienced attorneys.



if arrested, what steps can i take on my behalf?



1. do not discuss your situation with anyone except your attorney.2. unless your attorney says otherwise, do not discuss your case with law enforcement.3. request to have your attorney present if you are to be put in a lineup or subjected to testing.4. remain calm and courteous. allow your attorney to speak for you to ensure that your rights are protected and you are given all the benefits afforded to you under the law.contact us now to discuss your case with one of our experienced attorneys.

“the service provided at hacker & murphy was beyond exceptional and i would highly recommend them.”
the service provided at hacker & murphy was beyond exceptional and i would highly recommend them. julie nociolo was professional, respectful and knowledgeable. her representation of my family member went above and beyond that of what you might see at some firms. she was compassionate and took the time to explain every little detail of the litigation. she has extreme patience when dealing with our questions and never over promised. she was confident, respectful and determined while in court giving my family member the strength she needed while in of the judge. i cannot thank julie and the firm enough for their time and effort!

“i can't recommend julie highly enough for anyone needing legal assistance.”
i wanted to share my experience with attorney julie nociolo. as an international student, i had zero idea about the legal process when i faced an academic integrity case with my university, especially with a prior violation on record. the stakes felt incredibly high. julie was a lifesaver throughout. her support, expertise, and quick responses were invaluable. she made sure i understood everything and guided me to a successful outcome. i can't recommend julie highly enough for anyone needing legal assistance.
- sri g.




















“julie and james were both absolutely great!”

“ultimately i was exonerated and i have james to thank as a big reason why.”
i utilized the services of james knox to help on a complaint against my license. this was my first time ever needing an attorney and he was open and honest throughout the proceedings. he explained how the process works and made sure i understood each step as it went on. the entire process lasted over 3 years, and james kept in touch with me as updates rolled in. ultimately i was exonerated and i have james to thank as a big reason why.
- clarissa p.




















“i highly recommend this firm and mr. knox, especially. he knows what he is doing.”
mr james knox was my criminal attorney. i made a simple but stupid mistake which unbeknownst to myself, broke the law and was a felony which got reduced to a misdemeanor. he was confident from start to finish that he could keep me out of jail, he did. i ended up paying a fine. i highly recommend this firm and mr. knox, especially. he knows what he is doing. he is highly practiced and he cares. he was always happy to speak with me during his months working with me.
- paul a.
