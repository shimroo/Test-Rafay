sofsem is an annual winter conference devoted to the theory and practice
      of computer science. the conference traditionally focuses on the  latest
      results and developments of fundamental research in computer science
      (informatics), inspired by the algorithmic challenges of our time.
      sofsem has a long tradition as a high-quality research conference, and a
      venue where researchers from academia and industry in all stages of their
      career can share their insights. the series of sofsem conferences began
      in 1974, and was only interrupted in 2022 due to the covid pandemic. in
      2025, at its 50th edition, sofsem will be held as a physical event in
      bratislava, slovakia. the proceedings will  be published in the subseries
      arcoss (advanced research in computing and software science) of the
      lecture notes in computer science (lncs) of springer.
