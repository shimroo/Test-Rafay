features that qualify saltwater to a best coming of age novel
march 4, 2023january 3, 2023
 

 

the young woman attempting to find her place in the world is the heroine of jessica andrews’ first book saltwater which was published in 2019. after moving from sunderland to a university in london, where she struggles to blend in and make ends meet, lucy escapes to her late grandfather’s irish home after graduating. it is a typical coming-of-age story, but it also contains a very uncommon element in literary genre: a working-class heroine who was created by a young and working author.

depiction of bravery
the novel is presented in numbered sections, a hip literary method that doesn’t always work. but in saltwater, the fragments fit the protagonist’s youth since, despite the fact that the internet is not mentioned, lucy belongs to a generation that was reared on social media, a platform that consists of short passages of text dedicated to self-exposure. the structure parallels the characteristics of memory at the same time. when it pertains to lucy’s connection with her mother, the writing is occasionally uncomfortably honest. this brave work tackles sensitive topics like alcoholism, class, handicap, puberty, and relationships between mothers and daughters. there are uncomfortable truths, but there is no moping.
handling problems
while anecdotes and stories from lucy’s background assist to ease the stress of adolescence, the shortness of the parts assists in breaking up the emotional intensity. the strength of the book lies in andrews’ vivid depictions of lucy’s friends, family, and neighborhood, particularly those of her single mother, her completely deaf brother, and lucy.
maturity in deciding
the subjectivity of one young woman is the focus of the entire undertaking. there isn’t much conversation, but even though the interiority can become old at times, it’s worth it for the novel viewpoint. lucy is well aware of the conflict between wanting to stay in your community and wanting to leave. the book will provide those who stay comfort in knowing they are not alone. saltwater warns those who stay that life exists elsewhere, but that discovering it can rip your heart apart.

attracts with simplicity
saltwater is poetic and prickly, unfiltered and funny, full of emotion at moments while remaining distant. a complex non-chronological tale, it alternates between the present tense and the past tense and is presented in brief chapters that are never longer than three pages. the novel picture clearly on lucy and her inner journey rather than being dialogue-driven. because of andrews’ outstanding descriptive skills, the interiority doesn’t grate. it interweaves lucy’s past and present stories. as a young adult, lucy experiences some awkwardness in her relationships, city, home, and physical appearance. reminiscence for millennials is saltwater. its simplicity makes it attractive.

 
eye-opening teen novel that you shouldn’t miss
february 5, 2023january 3, 2023
 

 

teenagers who read novels have an increased capacity for empathy, a better understanding of themselves and others, and a higher sense of wellbeing, in addition to gains in reading and proficiency, creativity, vocabulary, and general information. here are some mind-blowing suggestions for teen books.

julie c. dao’s forest of a thousand lanterns

stacey lee’s the downstairs girl

mary mccoy’s i, claudia
don’t overlook this book; despite the unflattering cover image, it is a gripping high school historical and political drama that was named a printz honor book. anyone who enjoys political and psychological drama should read this novel. claudia, a new historian, provides the narration. she describes how she gained control of the esteemed student government at her high school. although claudia has witnessed the injustices committed by her forebears, she nonetheless succumbs to the corruption of authority.

 
everyone in this room will someday be dead: a review
january 3, 2023january 3, 2023
 

 

everyone in this room will someday be dead written by emily austin speaks to the obvious fact about mortality but is a book that can be savored and enjoyed. it was published in the year 2021 and gained a tremendous response among readers.
a framework of the novel
gilda, a lesbian in her 20s who loves animals and is an agnostic, cannot stop thinking about dying. she responds to a poster for free treatment at a nearby catholic church, eager for respite from her racing thoughts and estranged from her controlling family. father jeff greets her and assumes she is coming for an interview process. gilda is quickly hired to take the place of the recently dead receptionist grace because she is too ashamed to correct him. gilda starts an email conversation with grace’s old acquaintance while also trying to memorize the lines for catholic mass, concealing the idea that she has a young and new girlfriend, and building a dirty dish tower in her run-down flat.
she can’t bear to tell her friend the bad news, but she also can’t tolerate ignoring the lovely old lady who has been attempting to contact her through the church mailbox. she starts emailing grace in a desperate attempt to get help. however, when the authorities uncover strange circumstances surrounding grace’s passing, gilda might have to finally come clean about her embarrassing life.

the valiant masterpiece
the realistic fiction in this book can be refer to as “a day in the life.” it has nothing to do with unusual circumstances, a brand-new love, or altering lives. it’s just a person doing what they’ve always done to live, possibly while trying to get out of it. gilda leads a frightening and limited life. even though she is frequently so fatigued that she can hardly speak with the persons she cares about, she is continuously terrified of what others will think of her and of their rejection. she also has a continual obsession with death, as the title suggests. it’s bizarre, depressing, and frightening to view the community through gilda’s eyes. but it’s also quite illuminating. although gilda is undoubtedly a neurotic outlier, her eccentricities and difficulties are incredibly relatable.
emerges youth’s mind
the writer really compels the reader to look in the mirror and confront the anxieties and embarrassments that keep us from living fully each day. gilda’s obsession with death is a prime example because it sustains her pursuit of the life she now has, which is almost absurd. the young teens will emerge from it with a determination to enjoy life to its fullest. the novel also distinguishes itself for its superb prose, enduring characters, and captivating setting!
overall, this book may occasionally be uncomfortable to read owing to its somber subject matter, yet it is so instructive and significant that it is advised that everyone read it at least once!
