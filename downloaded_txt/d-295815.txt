if your tip leads to an arrest then you could be eligible for up to a $3,000 reward.
 
put simply it is a three part approach to solving the crime problem. crime stoppers relies on cooperation between the police, the media, and the general community to provide a flow of information about crime and criminals.

the phone call

calls are received through the local crime stoppers tips line call center. this phone is a stand alone instrument which does not provide caller id, and conversations are not recorded. the crime stoppers call taker receiving the information completes the tips information form, makes initial inquiries and then passes the information to the investigating officer. calls are accepted regarding any crime, fugitive, or information that could lead to the prevention of a crime.

by guaranteeing a caller's anonymity crime stoppers allows the caller to give information in a positive atmosphere without the fear of retribution. by offering cash rewards for information leading to indictment or arrests, the program encourages otherwise reluctant callers to provide information.
call the crime stoppers tip line at 850-437-stop (7867). do not give your name. say you are calling with a tip.
 
give the information you have relating to a wanted fugitve or criminal activity in your school or community. you may be asked some questions regarding your tip but you will not be asked to reveal your name or any other information relating to your identity.
 
you then call 850-437-stop on the 3rd friday of the next month (in the afternoon) and ask for the status of your tip using the special code provided at the time of your initial call. your code number is your only link to the status of your tip. it is your responsibility to remember and protect that code number.
 
should your tip lead to an arrest, apprehension or prevention of a crime, you will be provided with specific instructions for collecting your reward. rewards are paid in cash and must be picked up within six months of the award date. rewards are only approved once a month, the 3rd friday. please do not call more often, because new information will not be available.  the most current information will be available that 3rd friday afteroon.
remember - do not reveal your name, telephone number, address or any other information relating to your identity. relaying any identifying information will disqualify you from rewards!
   the online webtip
tipsters now have the option of giving us tips online. the process is completely secure and anonymous and is a very effective and efficient means of safely communicating with us in today's world.
the very unique integrated two-way dialog capabilities allow the tipster to come back and provide additional information to their tip at any time, but also provides a secure means for the coordinator to ask questions or provide reward information back to the tipster through the same secure and encrypted interface.

structure and funding of crime stoppers

crime stopper programs are organized as a not for profit organization (charity). a civilian community board of directors provides direction as to the financial and promotional activities of the program. the board of directors enhances the community involvement aspect, and its function is vital to the programs success.
the crime stoppers program is funded by a state grant, private donations and fund raising. no tax dollars are involved. the reward money paid out by the program is from the fund raising and donations from concerned citizens and businesses.
a community board of directors, made up of persons from throughout the area, meets on a monthly basis to evaluate arrests and to decide on the size of rewards to be paid, up to $3,000. rewards are then distributed in a private manner to the callers. callers are eligible for rewards up to $3,000, but, despite this, many callers choose not to collect their rewards.
     does crime stoppers work?

the answer is quite simply yes. since the start of crime stoppers, many calls have been received resulting in thousands of arrests and recovery of substantial amounts of property. calls have included information about murder, robbery, rape, assaults, drug and firearm offenses.

the success of a crime stoppers program cannot be purely judged on statistics, however, other benefits are also present:


a greater awareness in the community that there is a crime problem.


a willingness by the community to fight back against crime if it is given the opportunity and motivation.


improved relationships between police, media, and the community.


 
crime stoppers is definitely here to stay. it has been accepted by police as a valid and effective investigative tool, and the public, through its overwhelming response, appears to have accepted it as a more palatable alternative to traditional methods of giving information.
