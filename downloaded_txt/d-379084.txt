what are your career goals?
finding internships abroad largely depends on narrowing down your career goals. once you know what it is that you want to do or which skills you want to improve, you’ll be that much closer to finding the right internship abroad for you.
do you need college credit?
are you a college student seeking credit towards your degree, or are you a post grad or even mid-career professional? if you don’t require college credit for your international internship, it will actually greatly widen your options, since some university degree programs can be strict about what they accept for credit. if you don’t need college credit, your program options are basically limitless—meaning your dream internship is practically guaranteed. intern abroad organizations have connections all over the world, so if you’re willing to pay the program fee, you’ll get unrivaled experience to add to your resume or cv.
