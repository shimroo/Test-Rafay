update on powerschool data breach

powerschool, hempfield’s student information system (sis) provider, informed all customers on tuesday (1/7) of a data breach that occurred in a support system they manage in december. this breach allowed the attacker to gain access to some customers’ sis data. powerschool has confirmed that hempfield’s system was not one that was compromised. our own review of our systems and a review by carbon lehigh iu (our powerschool hosting provider) both concur with this finding. we have no reason to believe that any student, staff, or parent data was accessed inappropriately. we take data security very seriously and look forward to reviewing powerschool’s final report on the incident to determine if any additional security measures need to be put into place.
