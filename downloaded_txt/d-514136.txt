clearspan reviews








seamless deal from ordering to delivery! my salesman, denis smith, was great to deal with! the product itself, we couldn't be happier with. it's a nice looking structure that lives up to it's reputation. days after constructing ours (40'w x 30'd), we had a wind storm of 70-80 mph. no affect to the structure at all. top notch quality. very happy all around. when i need another one, i will call clearspan for sure!read more

marc hoffman 21:54 06 may 20









in process of determining if and @ what size structure we would like for an indoor riding arena.

very helpful in reviewing options that are most likely a year or so away - need to get back on even keel from the covid outbreak, first!read more
