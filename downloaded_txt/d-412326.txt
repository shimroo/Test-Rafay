									very hospitable from the beginning, i felt like family, it happened several times that we went to eat together in the restaurant.
with the children everything was perfect, they got used to it straight away, i can only recommend this experience.
my duties were mainly to help during/after dinner, take the dog out, help keep the house tidy and in the mornings go out to play with the older child, near the house there are more places to take the child to play so it is not essential to have a car.
