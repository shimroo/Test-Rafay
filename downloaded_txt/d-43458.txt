can't breathe? suspect vocal cord dysfunction!


by carol sidofsky




vocal cord dysfunction (vcd)
is a hidden, yet very, very common, usually unsuspected condition of throat
closure &/or choking sensation that can strike any age,
can cause sudden, severe episodes (attacks) of breathing difficulty,
sometimes with wheezing (whistling or sighing sounds) &/or stridor
(harsh, high pitched, ‘windy’ gasping sounds). in the emergency room (er),
vcd is usually misdiagnosed as being difficult (refractory, or brittle)
asthma,
anaphylaxis (severe, life threatening allergic reaction), or hysteria (all
in one’s head).
vcd can feel like straining
to breathe through a straw. some cannot get any air in (or out) at all.
panic and fear of dying from feeling that one isn’t getting in enough air,
often causes repeated er visits or hospitalizations. 
the "throat" closure actually
occurs inside the voice box (larynx), (behind the "adam's apple") when
the vocal cords go into a "closing-up" spasm.  (see
drawing on web-page 1).
vcd attacks can happen at
any time, including at night, while sleeping, or, at rest, when exercising,
during or after meals, etc.
a vcd patient can have one,
several, or even many causes of vcd.
many
doctors, nurses and
er personnel have not yet heard about vcd, even though vcd is common.
although there are many journal
articles in the medical literature about vcd, few medical text books
even
mention vcd, even though vcd has probably existed since time immemorial
--like from volcanoes, dust storms, forest fires, "silent" gastric
reflux (without heartburn), other
medical conditions, etc. 

vcd
was seen to exist, back
in the 1800's (mistakenly called hysteria), was written about in
medical literature in the 1970's, and later, vcd was studied
extensively by
nat'l jewish medical & research center in denver, co in the 1980's
to the present/2020. much confusion existed and still does, from the many different
names given to vcd, and from the multi-factorial (many possible causes) nature of vcd. 

misdiagnosis of vcd as asthma--when
the person doesn't have asthma at all--or, has only mild to moderate asthma--
has resulted in many vcd patients unnecessarily taking steroids &/or
bronchodilators for years, and even decades, before finally getting correctly
diagnosed with vcd.
also, vcd attacks can happen
alone,
or along with, some life-threatening conditions. some of these
life-threatening conditions may have symptoms that "mimic" (seem similar
to) vcd. some examples are: severe asthma, severe allergic reactions
(anaphylaxis), collapsed lung(s), pulmonary embolism, actual choking, something
obstructing (closing off) or narrowing parts of the airway, spasms of the diaphragm muscle, pediatric gastric reflux, etc. 
and,
(after the patient is
saved by emergency room doctors), some of these life-threatening
conditions,
may even cause vcd attacks. one example of this, is gastric reflux
(pediatric, or at any age), that can cause vcd. and/or, actual choking
can cause (bring on) a vcd attack in those who are "pre-disposed" (for reasons i don't know) to getting vcd.
vcd attacks, themselves,
can sometimes be life threatening (see webpage 2). and, please see note!!!

i made this website in the spring of 2001, and i continue to update it (2021). 










outline of webpages:




1. what exactly is vocal cord dysfunction (vcd)? how is vcd different from laryngospasm? or is it? vcd is one kind of laryngospasm!

2. list of some
      signs (physical, objective--seen, etc. by others) and symptoms
(subjective--experienced by patient) that occur during vcd attacks (and
between attacks):

3. how to recognize and accurately diagnose vcd/laryngospasms:

4. how can vcd patients and medical people quickly control and treat vcd (stop each attack), during and between attacks? (includes "vcd attack survival guide"). also listed are some life-threatening vcd "mimics" (that have symptoms similar to vcd).

5. what are some causes of vcd, triggers of vcd, aggravators of vcd (that make vcd worse), and associated conditions that may pre-dispose people to develop vcd? (all are mixed together on this webpage 5, since it's sometimes hard to tell them apart).

6. can vcd/laryngospasms be prevented or cured, or controlled?

7. what medical
centers, etc., know a lot about vcd? this includes national jewish
medical & research center, in denver, colorado.

8. what vcd
conferences are available, for medical professionals
and allied health professionals? i update this webpage 8, as i learn
about upcoming medical (vcd) conferences. let me know if you know of any upcoming vcd conferences, too!

9. references:
medical journal articles, books, internet web links, personal
communication with physicians, anesthesiologists, speech pathologists & vcd
patients, and others. also please click on the "links webpage" below,
for more references.

10. vcd support
for patients, family, friends, medical people & others. also, tips
(ideas & suggestions) that may help cure vcd (ask doctor first):

disclaimer: the information in this website
is not intended to diagnose you. call (911 or 0, etc.) for an ambulance,
or go to an emergency room, immediately, for any breathing problems!
then, please see web-page 4, for "vcd attack survival guide".
 

the
information in this website comes from the experiences of many patients
(some diagnosed with vcd/laryngospasms, and some not yet diagnosed),
from doctors, (see below for descriptions of specialist doctors),
nurses,
speech pathologists, respiratory therapists, medical journal articles,
books, vcd patients, vcd conferences, etc.  as i learn more information, i add it to this
website. 

after being seen in an emergency
room, you may
need to go to one or several types of doctors, speech pathologists, and
others, to help you get fully and accurately
diagnosed: your primary care doctor, a pulmonologist (lung specialist
doctor),
an ent (ear, nose & throat specialist doctor, especially a
laryngologist--
who specializes in voice, vocal cord, throat problems, etc.), a
gastroenterologist
(digestive specialist doctor), an allergist (allergy specialist
doctor),
a doctor who is a specialist in environmental & occupational
health,
a neurologist (nerves & brain specialist doctor), an
endocrinologist for thyroid problems, hormone imbalances,
etc., a respiratory therapist, a slp (speech & language
pathologist),
gynecologist (for possible female problems), urologist (for possible
male problems), a cardiologist (heart doctor), an anesthesiologist (to
prevent a "laryngospasm" during or right after an operation/surgery), &/or additional kinds
of specialists (doctors, etc.). 
this may include speaking with each doctor, etc., getting
      examined (including by an ent doctor and speech pathologist, directly looking at vocal cords, during a "laryngoscopy" exam), having medical tests done &/or prescribed, and learning about
treatment choices (options), etc., described by each doctor, etc.


it was not easy for my husband and me to get the
vcd correctly diagnosed: 
in
1998, my husband went to several emergency rooms,
where no doctor had any idea of what he really had. he was misdiagnosed
as possibly having asthma, or midlife crisis, or panic attacks.
finally,
after about a week of very frequent vcd attacks, a pulmonologist (lung
specialist
doctor) suspected vcd, and recommended that my husband go to national
jewish
medical & research center, in denver, colorado (see webpage 7),
where
he was quickly diagnosed with vcd, that same day, in 1998. (one of my
husband's diagnosing doctors at national jewish, had a cast on his
ankle. i asked why. he answered, "that damned cipro!", meaning that the
antibiotic called "cipro" had broken (destroyed) his achilles tendon, as a horrible
side effect! my husband first, in 2019, and now, in 2020, is wondering if the cipro that he
himself had taken for an infection, might have contributed to his
getting vcd! for this reason, i am including 2 links
about the dangerous side effects of the antibiotic called cipro: https://www.amazon.com/how-halt-cipro-levaquin-catastrophe/dp/1518626866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=utf8#customerreviews
and https://amyknichols.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/how-levaquin-tried-to-kill-me-but-i-fought-back/i
strongly urge any patient to avoid taking cipro or any related
"fluoro-quinolone" antibiotic, unless one is "at death's door"!!!instead: ask your doctor for a safer antibiotic, if an antibiotic is really needed!!!________________________________________________a
speech/language pathologist (slp) at nat'l jewish taught my husband how to do
the special speech therapy (see webpage 4) that stops most
vcd attacks, the same day he was diagnosed, and he was told to work on
improving his sinus condition. then, we
began the tedious but necessary work of figuring out all (or most of)
my
husband’s underlying causes of his vcd. 
doing
this helped me to discover the sinus tips,
and the gastric reflux tips, (see appendix a & b, on webpage 10),
which
resulted in my husband quickly conquering his vcd, in 1998. he has had
no more vcd attacks, since that year (1998), including up to now
(2020), which means about 22 years of being free from vcd attacks.
in
2000, i first had vcd attacks (during a severe case of bronchitis).
after many misdiagnoses
at emergency rooms, i also went to nat’l jewish, and was quickly
diagnosed
with vcd. vcd is not “catching”, but, it is common. each person’s list
of vcd causes is unique to that person. using the sinus tips, and the
gastric
reflux tips, helped me to also quickly control my vcd, back in 2000,
which in my case, may have been due to  a "post viral vagal
neuropathy", since my bronchitis was viral.after we both learned how to immediately stop any vcd attack, i created this free vcd website, in 2001, to help
others of all ages, whose vcd hasn’t yet been diagnosed. no one should
suffer one minute longer than necessary, with this frightening and sometimes
dangerous ailment.my husband, who had "exercise-related" vcd, and also vcd at rest, has had no
more vcd attacks
for about 22 years, 
i now
(2020) have almost no more vcd attacks, except for the very rare vcd
attack due to my swallowing something, such as saliva, or food, or
liquid, "the wrong way", causing normal
"choking", that in my case (and in others who may be "pre-disposed" to
have vcd attacks) leads to a vcd attack, or, from "burping" (gas or
liquid) due to having an episode of "high up", silent (no heartburn)
gastric reflux, known as "regurgitation" (technically called
lpr/laryngeal pharyngeal reflux, where "laryngeal" means voice
box/larynx, and "pharyngeal" means throat, and "reflux" means liquid
rising up from the stomach, the wrong way).
these days (spring 2020), when i have an occasional vcd attack (also known as laryngo-spasm),
to immediately stop the vcd / laryngo-spasm attack, i use the "larson
maneuver", described at the bottom of webpage 4. here's a link to
webpage 4: http://cantbreathesuspectvcd.com/page4.html-------------------------------------------for
anyone who knows a covid-19 virus patient who is "intubated" with a
breathing tube ("endo-tracheal" tube), who is also on a special
breathing machine (respirator), you can learn the "larson maneuver",
which you can teach to the covid-19 virus patient's caregivers, so that
when the patient is ready to be "extubated" (have their breathing tube/
endo-tracheal tube removed, they can prevent &/or treat a
"laryngospasm" (vcd attack) that removal of the endotracheal tube
sometimes causes! call me, if you'd like me to teach the maneuver to
you, by phone. check with patient's doctors to be sure that there are
no "contra-indications" to them using the larson / laryngospasm
maneuver". ---------------------------------- 
if
you would like to speak by phone, or send me
an email, i will be happy to try to help you or whoever has or might
have vcd, to
conquer it, as quickly and as easily as possible, by suggesting medical
sources (doctors and speech pathologists) in your area, who know about
vcd, and by answering your questions about what is in my website.
this is a free website, meaning there is no charge, for my trying to help you or any possible vcd patient.
although i am not a medical doctor (md), i am a
former rn/registered nurse, with many years of experience dealing holistically
with various ailments, including conquering my husband's and my previous
vcd attacks (and helping many, many others to conquer their vcd).
the advice i can give you, is not medical advice--it is practical advice.
the practical advice can help you to make a plan, about what you can try doing (and not doing), and
also includes seeing various vcd-knowledgable specialist doctors, to be
safe, and to get fully and accurately diagnosed, and correctly treated
for your specific situation. 
you
can telephone me at 970-726-4440. if i am not home, call my older cell
phone (970-531-5000) or my newer cell phone (970-509-9732). leave a
message with your phone numbers, if i can't answer the phone right away.
my email was fsds@rkymtnhi.com, but stopped working on tues. 6/22/2021. please use my new email, that is cjsidofsky@hotmail.com . if i am
away from the
computer,
and cannot answer your email, you can call me. again, leave a message, if i
can't
answer the phone, when you call. 

remember, for any breathing problems, i urge you to get emergency medical help, right away, to be safe! ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________i
also recommend a very helpful "facebook" page about laryngospasms
(another name for vcd, namely, vocal cord dysfunction), that a vcd
patient told me about recently (2020). to join this group, "google" the
following: facebook, laryngospasms. apply to be accepted into the
group, and start posting, and reading others' posts.
