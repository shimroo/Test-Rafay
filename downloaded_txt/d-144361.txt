about me.





business owner & software consultant
when i was 7, i never considered asking for an allowance so i borrowed my grandparents' lawnmower and started knocking on doors finding yards to mow.  this was my generation's version of "go fund me" and this work ethic carried through my life and i eventually become a business owner.
i've always had a passion for music and film making, which comes from a long line of musicians and artists in my family.  when i was 14, i purchased my first 8mm movie camera when editing was done with tape and a razor, and recruited my neighborhood friends to act in the movies.  my background in the arts, combined with my experience as a formally trained engineer, has given me a diverse background and has helped me in my career.

background story
i first heard about larry walters' historic balloon flight in the late 1990s.  after a little bit of research to confirm the story, i published bits and pieces of what i had learned.  not long afterwards, i began to receive many emails from all over the world.  but simply put, most of my readers did not believe it! so to set the record straight, i went right to the sources who were there when it happened, including larry's family and friends. for several years, i interviewed larry's  girlfriend carol, his mother hazel, sisters kathy and vera, larry's best friend steve gottlieb, former colleagues along with many others.  i also spoke with react, the cb radio monitoring organization, and was given permission by them to publish the audio file of the actual flight from 1982.  for nearly 20 years, i believe i have compiled the most accurate information concerning larry's flight, however, there are many details that i have purposely left out which will be told in my book.

                                this page was put together to give my readers accurate information about larry's background and his infamous flight.  most other articles that you read online never interviewed larry's family and friends as i have. what you are about to read and listen to is a compilatoin of many years of research and interviews. this is probably the most complete and accurate information about larry walters' incredible flight on the internet. a lot of time and effort went into the research and the building of this page and i hope you will enjoy it.

                                (note: i am currently updating this page and should have it completed soon)








the book (coming soon)

                                i am currently working on a book that will tell the entire true story about larry walters and his infamous flight over southern california in july, 1982. if you would like to be notified when the book is published, please send me an email.



history of the flight

                                when larry walters was 13 years old, he went to a local army-navy surplus store and saw the weather balloons hanging from the ceiling. it was then he knew that some day he would be carried aloft by similar types of balloons. this obsession would be with him for the next 20 years. on july 2nd, 1982, larry tied 42 helium-filled balloons to a sears lawn chair in the backyard of his girlfriend's house in san pedro, california. with the help of his ground crew, larry then secured himself into the lawn chair which was anchored to the bumper of a friend's car by two nylon tethers. he took with him many supplies, including a bb gun to shoot out the balloons when he was ready to descend. his goal was to sail across the desert and hopefully make it to the rocky mountains in a few days. but things didn't quite work out for larry. after his crew purposely cut the first tether, the second one also snapped which shot larry into the la sky at over 1,000 feet per minute. so fast was his ascent that he lost his glasses. he then climbed to over 16,000 feet. for several hours he drifted in the cold air near the la and long beach airports. a twa pilot first spotted larry and radioed the tower that he was passing a guy in a lawn chair at 16,000! larry started shooting out a few balloons to start his descent but had accidentally dropped the gun. he eventually landed in a long beach neighborhood. although he was entangled in some power lines, he was uninjured.



lawnchair found

                                anyone who knows the this story has read that larry gave away his lawn chair to a "neighborhood kid" shortly after he landed. for the past 20 years, larry and his family assumed this kid didn't know what he had and the chair was probably destroyed by now. for years, larry regretted giving away that chair, especially after the smithsonian institute requested to preserve it in their museum. however, larry would never see his chair again. then a miracle occurred on march 12th. i received an email from jerry (last name protected) who lives in southern california. he saw my web site and had told me that he was the "neighborhood kid" that larry gave his chair to! my mouth dropped when i read this. it was as if i had found the ark of the covenant! immediately i called carol and hazel to let them the know larry's chair had finally been found and was in the same condition as when he last used it. needless to say, both of them were somewhat emotional when i told them the good news. jerry told me he had kept it in his garage for the past 20 years and has never revealed it to the public. but on march 21st, he was going to unveil it his friends and coworkers at a restaurant in long beach. the media was invited but did not attend. he asked if i would present larry's story to the 30-member audience and i did. at the end, jerry pulled the cover off the chair for everyone to see and touch. here are some photos that i took of the lawn chair in jerry's backyard after he took it out of his garage. it still has 13 of the 35 water jugs still on it, along with the tethering cables.



interviews

                                i spent several years interviewing larry's family through emails and phone calls. but between march 19th and the 21st, i was able to finally meet them in person at their homes near los angeles. on tuesday evening, march 19th, i met larry's former girlfriend carol. she still lives in the same house in san pedro where larry launched from. the first thing i noticed was how small her backyard was. i could not believe they were able to set up all their equipment from this tiny space. carol and her mother ate taco bell while i went through the many photos of larry's flight -- most of which has never been seen by the public. i was fortunate enough to be given permission to scan them on my laptop to keep for my records. if they give me their permission, i will publish a few of them on this web site. however, i will keep the rest of them private and will only show them during my public presentations (which you can read about on this page). backyard of carol's house on wednesday evening, march 20th, i met larry's mother, hazel, and his two sisters, kathy and vera, at hazel's home in simi valley. they offered me some pizza and a coke as we sat down to talk about larry. as i began to leave, hazel gave me a t-shirt that her and larry had made with a screen print of larry's flight on the front. i'll wear it proudly. on thursday evening, march 21st, i met with jerry. he is the one who larry gave the lawn chair to 20 years ago. we unveiled the chair to an audience of about 30 people at a restaurant in long beach. he plans on taking the chair to larry's mother soon.



the landing site

                                on thursday, march 21st, jerry took me over to the landing site located at 432 45th street in long beach. jerry and i found the site based on photos taken when larry landed in the backyard of the house. we had to knock on quite a few doors before finally locating the landing site. here is how it looks today. backyard of the landing site frontyard of the crash site

space cadets





the greatest hoax in tv history
unless youâre from the united kingdom, chances are youâve probably never heard of the reality show space cadets which aired exclusively on channel 4 from december 7-16, 2005, all across great britain.  the controversial show would attempt to selectively recruit 9 british contestants and convince them that they would be launched into orbit in a space shuttle to become britainâs first televised space tourists.  but there would be just one catch.  unbeknownst to them, these space cadets would never actually leave the earth.  the entire illusion would be accomplished in a realistic space shuttle simulator that had been used in hollywood movies such as space cowboys, armageddon and deep impact.  the british media would refer to the show as âthe most audacious hoax in tv history.â

                                i was first asked to join the production in the early summer of 2005 by brick price, president of wonderworks, an award-winning special effects company just outside of hollywood, california.  brick and his team of engineers and technicians had already started preparing the space shuttle simulator to be used in the show but needed someone to help with software for the motion effects.  i owned a small manufacturing business in prescott, arizona, that specialized in developing applications for motion simulators and was honored when brick invited me to join the project.  i had no idea what i was getting into.



the book (coming soon)

                                i am currently writing a book that details my involvement with the show.  in the book, i reveal some crazy behind-the-scenes stories, the psychology behind how we pulled it off and a look at where the cadets are today.

"the least of these"
i've'been involved with various minitries since the early 1980's, including music, street evengelism, bible studies, prison ministry and others.  i've always had a compassion to help the helpless and in october 2020 i started "the lease of these" ministry which provides food and other essentials to the homeless distributed in "blessing bags."

                            in matthew chapter 25, jesus addresses the importance for us to help the needy:

                                34 âthen the king will say to those on his right, âcome, you who are blessed by my father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. 35 for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat, i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, i was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 i needed clothes and you clothed me, i was sick and you looked after me, i was in prison and you came to visit me.â

                                37 âthen the righteous will answer him, âlord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 when did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?â

                                40 âthe king will reply, âtruly i tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.â                            
                            

                            the "blessing bags" contain:

                            â¢ an arizona 211 card (resources and phone numbers)
                            â¢ christian tract or bible
                            â¢ toothbrush/toothpaste
                            â¢ bandaids
                            â¢ socks
                            â¢ wipes
                            â¢ comb
                            â¢ body spray
                            â¢ bar of soap
                            â¢ shampoo
                            â¢ plasticware
                            â¢ chicken salad with crackers
                            â¢ dried fruit (raisins)
                            â¢ granola bar (chewy)
                            â¢ applesauce
                            â¢ vienna sausages
                            â¢ peanut butter crackers
                            â¢ water


                            i am funding this ministry myself, but if you would like to donate, please contact me via email or phone.  thank you and god bless!
