how to find an evil tree:

evil trees can appear in one of 26 forest locations; just keep an eye out for leprechauns and thrashing roots (which might try to grab you). if you have completed the tree gnome village quest, spirit trees will offer you directions, clues and teleports.


requirements to complete evil tree:

there are seven types of evil tree, of varying difficulty: normal, oak, willow, maple, yew, magic and elder.
woodcutting and firemaking requirements are the same as those required for normal trees, with a level requirement of 85 for the elder evil tree.
to nurture the sapling you will need a farming level equal to half the woodcutting requirement of the tree.

you can interact with the evil tree twice a day.

from the runescape site

the power to the players polls:

 firstly, we want to increase emphasis on high-level content. new content from last couple of years has been aimed at quite a wide spread of player levels, so we’re going to focus more specifically at higher level content and activities for veterans.  secondly, we need to increase the number of quests we release. this year we really upped the fidelity and depth of quests, but in doing so sacrificed quantity. so we’re going to have more of a mix: from epic quests full of innovative content and high production values, to traditional, more story-focus quests like we’ve made in years past.  thirdly, we’re going to improve the everyday gameplay experience by having our ninja team focus on fixing niggling issues, implementing quick-win features and listening to your suggestions for small-scale improvements. this should improve everyone's quality of life within runescape.  as always, we’re being ambitious, but with hard work and your help, everything here can be achieved. above all else, we’re determined to make runescape the game you want it to be. i’m sure that you’ve got lots of questions after that little lot. for now, take a look at our power to the players faq, and look out for more info leading up to the launch of the polls in the week of january 13th! thanks for reading. we are in 2014!  mod markrunescape design director

from the runescape web site
in 2014, we're taking runescape back to its roots – making it a truly collaborative effort between developers and the community. i don’t just mean things like picking the results of in-game battles or the occasional content poll – it needs to be more radical than that. i want to give the power to the players to decide what we do and when it happens.
 the new poll system in mid-january, we’re going to launch a new in-game poll system, which will give members at least one new content poll to vote on each week. in total, there will be up to seven guaranteed content polls each month, covering a range of topics including quests, minigames, combat updates, skills, bosses, reworks, core gameplay changes and much more besides. polls dealing with the biggest questions might last as long as a month, whereas smaller polls might run for seven days. these polls will decide which content we work on first and what direction to take while developing them. you won’t need to worry if your favourite option doesn’t quite make the cut – valid content will appear again in future polls. the polls will also focus on things that really mean something to you: high-level content; important game storylines; and the everyday mechanics of the game that you spend much of your time with. it’s not possible to ask all the big burning questions straight away so we’ve tried to get a real mix of things in for each month. so - what are the polls we're launching with in january?
labels: #bosses, #combat updates, #minigames, #poll system, #quests, #skills

strange things are afoot in the woods around runescape. an unusual sapling has been seen sprouting among the trees, and it’s growing at an alarming rate.aided by a familiar-looking farmer, you could help encourage this burgeoning seedling - but keep an axe and tinderbox handy because it could become…an evil tree!for the lumberjacks and fire-starters among you, this distraction and diversion offers a new way of training your firemaking and woodcutting skills; and there are other rewards up for grabs, too, including seeds, logs, birds’ nests, and gold. like the shooting star, evil trees will only stick around for a limited amount of time, so make sure you don’t miss them or you’ll be waiting a while for the next one.and if you find yourself face to face with an evil tree without your axe, miles from a bank, don’t worry!the helpful leprechaun has all the tools you’ll need. he might even bolster your rewards with a special ability that will automatically bank any logs you don’t have the space to carry. this perk will last for between five and thirty minutes, depending on your performance.labels: axe, firemaking, woodcutting
