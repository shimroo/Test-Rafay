 shipping 
						costs...




we normally ship priority mail to california, oregon, 
				washington, nevada, arizona and major hubs of the midwest and 
						certain cities in the east. 
				
average transit times to these areas: 1 to 3 days 
				from the time they leave los angeles but it can take 4 days. 
				becuase we ship large plants they normally arrive safely.
				
priority mail can take 2 to 4 days with no 
				money-back guarantee 
				of transit time.
even if a little haggard when they arrive, in a 
				few days with full sun and water, they perk up beautifully.
				
for longer journeys 
						or to outlying areas, or if you want your plants in 
						pristine condition when they arrive, we highly recommend 
				2 day priority express, and your plants will arrive within 2 days from leaving lax, 
						money back guarantee. 
because 
						we ship large 12" to 18" plants, 
						we have to use large, heavy boxes. this makes express mail expensive, but 
				your plants arrive in pristine condition within that time frame 
						-- guaranteed -- or your shipping 
				cost is refunded. 

when you call to place your order, ask about 
				shipping options and costs.


we do not ship fedex or ups.

order by 
						phone for an instant estimate.  emailed estimates 
						requests will take several days.

black beauty













we are 
			your southern california source for 75 luscious varieties 
			of organically grown heirloom tomato plants, a few carefully chosen great-tasting hybrids, plus a fine 
		selection of gardening products for your garden beds,  containers and greenhouses.
the 2025 
			season will 
			mark our 25th year shipping organically grown tomato plants right to your garden. we grow 
			about 24,000 plants right here -- and ship them 
		during spring and summer to all 50 states and us territories.
my gardening 
		career began in 1954 when i was 4 years old. i dropped a pumpkin seed 
		into grandma and grandpa's bird bath in idyllwild, california. it 
		sprouted. wow, germination. i was hooked forever.
now i'm 74, almost a grown-up 
			-- and still get a thrill watching a seed pop, become a beautiful 
			little plant which grows bigger 
			and bigger, giving us delicious fruit. 
the seeds 
			from those fruits give us teeny plants of the same magical variety 
			and we 
			can grow them year after year! this is the miracle 
		of germination. seed to seed.
our 2024 
			gardens are producing one of our best crops ever and we have 
			tomatoes growing everywhere! 
here are a 
			few: jutland, 
			polish, green giant, black cherry, chocolate stripes, bear claw, 
			thunder mountain, momotaro gold, 
			dirty girl, blondcopfchen, ruby gold, tati's wedding, 
		paul robeson, wee tang shebang, red mamba, black mamba,  blue 
			chocolate, marianna's peace and so many more!  
we've 
			harvested thousands of tomatoes, and they're still goin'!  
seed saving! 
			all summer we save seeds from our yummy tomatoes. on september 
			12th i picked baskets full of tati's wedding, dirty girl, black bear, 
			apricot brandywine, dark galaxy, red mamba. and... some of our new ones to harvest 
			seeds for your 2025 plants!  
seeds for 
			you! this year we will have a few varieties of tomato seeds 
			available for purchase.
we also have 
			sunday plant sales here at our nursery in los angeles every sunday, 
			11:00 to 3:00, from march through july. 
questions?

			blend again for 2024. weather conditions may affect our grower's 
			supply.
golden, 
			mellow, smooth and buttery with a discreet touch of earthiness to 
			complement your heirloom tomato harvest, this 
			superb quality, award-winning extra virgin olive oil was created by 
						our friend and fellow heirloom tomato fan, kevin 
						tazelaar, founder of california gold olive oil co. in 
						oakdale, california.
kevin sent us 
									little bottles of different blends 
			to try in a blind taste test. after many 
									tastings, i chose my favorite; kevin had it bottled and surprised us by 
									naming it 
									laurel's blend. 
in the 
			photograph you will see that some of the oil is missing. while 
			shooting the photographs, i lost my mind, opened the bottle and had some for a 
						snack with fresh-picked tomatoes, greek olives and feta. 
			i couldn't stop myself. you will get a full 
						bottle, we promise.

when should you plant?
 

first, check your region's 
							average temperatures:

to find your average
temperatures click here 
 www.weather.com  
		or another weather site to explore
the temperature graph for your city's month-by-month highs and lows, and
determine your optimal planting time when the average low temps stay reliably above
	50º. that is your best planting time.


 
 



about frost
							dates. don't plant in cold soil!
 

tomatoes are a hot 
							weather crop. hot...not "starting to warm up". you can usually plant safely about
		2 to 3 weeks after your last predicted frost date.  
 

many new 
		gardeners want plant too early. it's exciting to get your plants in the 
		ground. 
 

be sure the 
	nighttime air temperature is reliably 48º to 50º or above and the soil is 
	reliably warmed up to above 50º or your plants will go dormant and just sit there in the cold soil, staring at you and not 
		growing until the weather warms up. this dormancy stage makes your plants 
very susceptible
to disease and insect damage, delays fruit set and reduces yield. 

		 

however!  you can easily warm 
	the soil for a few weeks before planting with clear plastic placed over the garden bed to absorb solar heat 
	from the sun or use our wall 'o' water plant protectors and plant safely 3 
	weeks earlier than usual!
 

be patient; wait until it's warmer. 
		you'll be rewarded with robust 
		happy tomato plants and a good harvest.
the most important thing to keep
in mind is that night temperatures and soil temperatures should be steadily above 
		48º
before planting tomatoes. 
 

about 
	blossom drop during high temperatures 

		 

pollen becomes sterile at 
		continual daytime temperatures 
		higher than about 
		98º and nighttime temperatures above 72º, so don't expect fruit to set 
		during those times. the plant knows that the pollen is not viable and 
		drops the blossoms. when the weather settles down, the blossoms will 
		stay on your plants and produce fruits.  we do have a few varieties 
		that produce at higher temperatures.


                              
				



shipping dates

shipping
is normally timed for when your nighttime temperatures stay reliably above 48º, or earlier if you desire.
		

		 

we have plant protectors -- water filled 18" tall teepees -- which absorb solar heat 
							during the day and release it gradually during the night to keep the air around 
	your plants warm. this means you can plant a few weeks earlier than 
	usual. 

click
here:  

growing tips
  and garden products for detailed
information on planting.
tomato planting here in southern
california, and in many areas of usda zones 10 and 11, or sunset magazine zones
22-24, begins in march depending on our night temperatures. if the 
ground is below 50º, we use season extenders or wait until april. 

		hey, laurel! my garden center is selling plants in early february...it must be 
		time to plant!
yes, i know the 
		local garden centers have plants for sale here in february. why do they 
		do this? well, some folks have greenhouses. most do not. you plant in bitterly 
		cold soggy february soil and here come the wicked winds of march. 
of course the little 
							plants don't make it in the cold weather or get 
		diseased and die so you go back in april for 
							more plants thinking you did something wrong. 

		you didn't. you were tempted. you caved. but that's tomato love. try to 
		control yourself and wait until it's steadily above 48º at night.

		however, there is a solution. if you can't wait to plant, order our 
		early season wall o' water season extenders and plant 4 to 6 weeks 
		earlier than normal. 
		 :)
choose your shipping
time

we ship your plants during a 15 
		day period of your choice.  
	for instance, if you choose the april 10th period as your shipping period your plants 
		will ship between april 10th and april 24th. orders are shipped first in, first 
							out.

		 

we will help you choose the week when your
climate is perfect for tomato planting. for example, if you order in january for
your minnesota garden, we ship your plants at the end of may. 

		 

if you wish
to experiment with growing in cooler temperatures we will ship them earlier with 
		a disclaimer that they may freeze in transit and are not guaranteed to 
		arrive alive.

		about planting tips, soil preparation, trellising, fertilizers,
