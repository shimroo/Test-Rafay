				the next of kin 
              registry (nokr) was established as a free tool for daily 
              emergencies and national disasters. nokr is your emergency contact 
              system to help if you or your family member is missing, injured or 
              deceased. nokr is the central depository for emergency contact 
              information in the united states. 
nokr is a non-profit 
              humanitarian organization dedicated to 
                  bridging rapid emergency contact information. nokr was 
                  established in january 2004, for daily emergency situations.
 






nokr provides 
                  the public a free proactive service to store your emergency 
                  contacts that would 
                  be critical to emergency response agencies. stored information 
                  is only accessible via a secure area that is only accessible 
                  by emergency public trust agencies that have registered with 
                  nokr. 

                  nokr encourages every township, county, municipality, city, 
                  state and nation to take ownership of the nokr. this resource 
                  belongs to you, your citizens and to your emergency agencies. 
                  take the nokr
              
                  registration forms and add your own identifying 

                  symbols.

                  nokr is your trusted safe guarding organization for all 
                  personal emergency contacts worldwide.  



nokr does not own 
                  the registrants information we store, this information belongs to the 
                  registrants and is made available securely to registered 
                  emergency agencies during times of urgent need. nokr is the 
                  protector of this vital bridging resource to reconnect 
                  individuals and families after urgent events.

                                                        click here!the injury or 
              passing of a loved one is a difficult time for families and 
              friends. this sad time is compounded when 
							you're not informed when 
              a loved one is injured or passes on.
					this happens when local and 
              state agencies 
							are unable to locate a family member or

              next of kin. 


why should i register myself or my family with 
							nokr? 

here are just a few scenarios where your 
				information will be useful


○ 
				lack of information about family or contacts.
○ 
				lack of resources available to search for family members, 
              emergency contacts or "next of kin".

				○ missing or injured child, adult or 
              senior.
○ 
lost 
              child.
○ 
those 
              suffering from dementia or alzheimer's.
○ accidents 
              while traveling nationally or internationally.

				○ unconscious person unable to 
              communicate.

				○ natural disasters (hurricanes, 
              earthquakes, tornados, floods, tsunamis, fires).

				○ terrorist acts nationally or 
              internationally.

				○ deceased person used to locate a 
              next of kin or point of contact.





 
 



					 









 

nokr is the only 
				organization globally, that provides a free emergency contact 
				resource of this kind, to both citizens and to emergency 
				agencies. we hope there is never a need but we do know that 
				events in life and disasters will happen.  it's entirely 
				your choice to decide how you will prepare yourself and your 
				family.


				fact: many people think that if they are carrying a driver's 
				license, identification card or credit cards, authorities will 
				know who their emergency contact is. these forms of identity 
				only indicate who you are not who should be contacted in the 
				event of urgent need. to add to this problem, often times your 
				current identification is not updated or readily available and 
				it becomes very difficult and complex to locate emergency 
				contacts. 

              who will speak for you or your family member when they can't? 
				nokr is the solution
