a new attached 'click' cap is coming to volvic
we are transitioning our volvic plain and volvic touch of fruit ranges to a brand-new "click" cap. this cap was designed specially to remain securely attached to the bottle throughout its usage and during the recycling process.
the new cap aims to create a more convenient drinking experience: leaving it attached means you don’t have to hold it in your hand, and don’t risk dropping it.
look out for the image on the cap if you are unsure. don’t forget to ‘click’ it back to drink, and leave it attached when you recycle it.
