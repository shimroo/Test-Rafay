                    modesto, california

                    i recorded the congregation singing about 36 years ago when 
                    i attended church there. i put these 3 tapes together for 
                    everyone to enjoy. i don't charge for it. pastor ray garcia 
                    was the pastor during these recordings. his wife audine who 
                    is now in heaven was the piano player in all these wonderful 
                    songs. the quality is my fault, hopefully good enough 
                    though. pastor ray garcia last i know was a pastor in 
                    oakley,california.

public notice :
we broadcast in multicast and unicast. if you 
              do not receive our multicast broadcast, then the problem is your 
              internet service provider. tell them to turn on multicast so you 
              can receive our multicast broadcast. our unicast servers can only 
              carry a limited number of viewers. multicast opens the door to 
              unlimited viewers to our broadcast, world wide.
isp notice: 
we are isp friendly. we are formated to 
              widescreen mode ( not letterbox mode ). we are formated to low 
              bandwidth only, targeting dialup customers to be included with 
              broadband viewers. our wgn multicast server can be easily 
              multicast without overload on your servers. i don't believe you 
              will know any difference in load at our bandwidth we broadcast at 
              if you enable multicast from wgn.

the end is near
and many false prophets shall rise, and shall 
              deceive many. and because iniquity shall abound, the love of many 
              shall wax cold. but he that shall endure unto the end, the same 
              shall be saved. and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached 
              in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall 
              the end come.

matthew 24:11-14
