long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and 
young adult cancers 


version 6.0 (october 2023)



 
the children’s oncology group long-term follow-up guidelines for  survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers (cog ltfu guidelines) are a  resource for healthcare professionals who provide ongoing care to survivors of  pediatric malignancies. the screening recommendations in these guidelines are  appropriate for asymptomatic survivors of childhood, adolescent, or young adult  cancer presenting for routine exposure-based medical follow-up. more extensive  evaluations are presumed, as clinically indicated, for survivors presenting  with signs and symptoms suggesting illness or organ dysfunction. a basic  knowledge of ongoing issues related to the long-term follow-up needs of this  patient population is assumed. healthcare professionals who do not regularly care  for survivors of pediatric malignancies are encouraged to consult with a  pediatric oncology long-term follow-up center if any questions or concerns  arise when reviewing or using these guidelines. a complementary set of patient  education materials, known as "health links" accompany the guidelines  in order to enhance patient follow-up visits and broaden the application of  these guidelines. more detailed information regarding development and  application of the cog ltfu guidelines and related materials is available by  accessing the documents below.
although the information within the guidelines will certainly prove  valuable to the survivors themselves, the only version currently available is  targeted to healthcare professionals. therefore, survivors who choose to review  these guidelines are strongly encouraged to do so with the assistance of a  healthcare professional knowledgeable about long-term follow-up care for  survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers. 
new to version 6, a comprehensive guidelines document with appendices is available with links to ease document navigation.
