who is edgar allan poe? 



edgar poe was born on january 19th, 1809 to traveling actors eliza and david poe.
when edgar was a baby, david abandoned the family, leaving eliza to support three young children. in a devastating turn, eliza contracted tuberculosis and spent the last few months of her life in richmond. she died on december 8th, 1811 at the age of 24, leaving behind her three children. 

two-year-old edgar was taken in by richmond couple john and frances allan. edgar was never officially adopted, a cause and result of constant tensions between him and his foster father. he did not take their last name, but instead he became edgar allan poe.
