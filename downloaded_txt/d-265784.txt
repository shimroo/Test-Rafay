program (re)designsince 2007, texas a&m university’s center for teaching excellence has worked to develop, implement, and refine the program (re)design (prd) model. the model is a faculty-led, data-informed process aimed to assist programs in creating a more learner-centered curriculum. during the process, faculty conceptualize, design, and implement curriculum at both the program and course levels. a faculty-led program redesign team, supported by an educational developer, helps drive and sustain the iterative redesign process. this synergistic partnership is anchored by faculty input and engagement.

scholarship of teaching and learning (sotl)scholarship of teaching and learning (sotl) is an investigation into teaching and learning practices within the context of higher education to provide empirical support for such inquiries. sotl approaches often include design principles such as emphasizing learning activities in the classroom, grounding the research design in one or more learning theories, conducting multiple iterations of scholarship to determine the evidence-based best practices for teaching and learning, and disseminating the findings in academic venues such as conferences and journals. the center for teaching excellence (cte) supports faculty interested in conducting sotl studies by offering a sotl certificate program called style for faculty interested in sotl. it also hosts the ideate community, a group of faculty engaged in sotl research, and the ideals lab, a facility where undergraduate and graduate students assist in sotl research for classroom applications.
