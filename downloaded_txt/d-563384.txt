documentarywe've put together this little video highlighting our journeys around the world by bicycle. we 
			are seeking a documentary producer or investors interested in the more than 100 hours of video and thousands of photos taken during the past 20 years while traveling on our bikes.
			

			watch our video

follow pat & cat's southeast asia tour!
click here
as you can see on our map, we will take a circular route  through more than 10 countries. 
  we estimate 4,000 miles and will take our time,  hoping to finish in 6 months. 
  we will reorganize our website so that you may  follow along and stay in contact. fewer words, more photos, videos and  interaction, too. 
so, welcome aboard the southeast asian slow but sure tour!
yep, we're off to see the  world, again. well at least a small part of it.
originally scheduled to depart on november 1,  2001 we have been delayed.
  cat's mom had surgery and while recovering she  contracted pneumonia. at age 87 it's not easy but she is making progress. so  we're in a holding pattern, 
  working to get her back to good health and to  help find them a new lifestyle.  
our current  lift-off plans have been rescheduled to december 1, 2008.

so many things have transpired in these past 2 years. yes, pat & cat completed their epic "around the world journey" two years ago on march 11th. they continue to work diligently, writing the stories of the road 
and experimenting with their pictures. 
they plan to have a book in print, soon! also, they're preparing for an 
exclusive exhibition of worldriders2 photography in april.
there's even talk of an appearance on a popular tv show.
and, of course they are completing plans for their next adventure, 
cycling southeast asia. so, if you're not on their 
list of friends,
 get on board, now.




 
our thanks to dany, the young spaniard we met in cuba. 
he made us promise to make the last chapter of our journal the story of returning to normal life. 
an even bigger thanks to sheila, a gal we met in monterey, california in 2002, during the first month of our odyssey. 
her recent e-mail reminded us of the promise. she said, "i've read every entry of your trip. 
you promised us a final installment on returning home, where is it? 
as of now, the journal feels like a book that's had the last chapter ripped from it"!
