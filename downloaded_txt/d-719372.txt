finding a home with bad credit
credit scores are becoming increasingly important in every aspect of the lives of people today. we all need a place to live, even those with bad credit, so what can you do if you find yourself struggling to find housing because of your bad credit? here are some steps to take to find a place to live, though it may not be your dream home, with attacks against you in your credit report.
instructions
finding a place to live with bad credit

check your credit report so you know what you have against you. it is important to know what is on your credit report, both good and bad, so you’re prepared to explain the details to a potential owner.
take all the money you can. being able to make a larger security deposit, pay a portion of the income year in advance or offer to pay more each month can help you get a new home.
ask a reference letter to your previous owners. if you’ve always paid your rent on time and have left your house in good condition, obtain letters of reference is a good way to show your potential new owner that you are a responsible and tenacious tenant who is not looking to cause problems.
ask a close friend or family member if they would be willing to co-sign your lease. an owner can approve you feel better if they have a backup source to collect your car. however, you need to make sure that the person agrees to co-sign must meet income requirements and credit to acquire the rent you do not keep.
think beyond the case of looking for a new home. go the traditional way of looking managed by large real estate companies probably not your best option if you have bad credit apartments. instead, try to find in places like craigslist.com. many of the places that advertise in this type of website are managed by people dealing directly or small developers who may be more willing to work with you.
ask for details of the application process. one way to find out if a potential owner will use your credit report to decide whether or not the rent is just asking what your requirements are hiring process. if not check your credit report, or if you just ask credit references, that means you have more chance of getting the apartment.
search tenants looking for a roommate, or homeowners who have a room for rent. in a roommate situation is more likely than not have to go through the process of application or may not have to be added to the lease. you may also be lucky enough to find a homeowner who is looking for someone to rent you a room in your home, especially if you are not looking for someone to sign a lease, but rather someone who rented the room for months.
join an extended stay hotel, at least until you find another place to live. it can cost a little more per month, but at least all utility costs are included. extended stay hotels generally do not require an application; instead have a rate that is paid monthly in advance each month.
