today, we celebrate the international day of women and girls in scienceðŸ”¬florence merriam bailey (1863-1938) made a significant contribution to ornithology. she authored over 100 articles and 10 books, including some of the earliest field guides that allowed birds to be identified without being shot.her magnum opus, "birds of new mexico," earned her the top american orithologists' union award for ornithology in 1932. she was the first woman to receive it.bailey also played an important role in the banning of wildlife trafficking in the usa, 1900.without trailblazing women like florence merriam bailey, the scientific community would be a very different place indeed! today, we celebrate every woman who came before and gave women and girls the opportunities they have in the scientific community today.
