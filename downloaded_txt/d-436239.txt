pew's one-year case study on philly311



i've been working for the nutter administration for about two years now.  my first big job was being the project manager for the implementation of the 311 system.  the pew foundation just came out with a one-year performance report.  i think the piece is fair and balanced, and i remain very proud of the project and honored to have worked with talented people from all across the city's workforce to bring it to fruition.

another comeback?



i've had this blog for a few years now, but my posting has really dropped off.  is it time for another comeback?  readership was never that high, or my posts too insightful, but i do enjoy my life on the blogosphere.  let's see how it goes.

the fairmount park art association



from their website, "the fairmount park art association is the nation's first private, nonprofit organization dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning. founded in 1872, the art association commissions, interprets, and preserves public art in philadelphia."
just another one of the myriad non-profit organizations in philadelphia working to make the city a more vibrant and excellent place to live, work, invent, or play.

recycling in philadelphia up by 50 percent



part of the nutter administration's greenworks plan is to increase the recycling rate in the city; they've been pretty successful...recycling is up about 50%.  by diverting waste that would have ended up in the landfill, residents and business saved the city nearly $5 million in landfill costs.

is it possible?



i can't believe i haven't had a post during 2009 thus far.  to be honest, my job with city government for the last 18 months has been my busiest professional endeavor, leaving little time for other activities like blogs.  hopefully i will start getting things cranked up again.  hope everybody is well.
