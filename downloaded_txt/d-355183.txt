rand paul begs for federal aid, after denying aid to others

 there is no question that biden and his fellow democrats will approve federal aid to kentucky and to other states that suffered from violent tornados.  it's the right, proper, and humane thing to do.  which is the difference between biden and the callow, callous rand paul, who voted against spending money for the victims of disasters that befell states other than kentucky.

madness

 trump encouraged his heavily armed goons to attack the us capitol today.  he should be charged with inciting a riot, and his thug followers who participated in this assault on democracy and the constitution should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

how can anyone still support this lunatic?

 trump reportedly expressed interest in the bonkers notion that he could impose martial law and overturn the results of the election.  this is simply treasonous.

profiles in cowardness

 republican congresscritteres are craven cowards.  the wapo:just 25 congressional republicans acknowledge joe biden’s win over president trump a month after the former vice president’s clear victory of more than 7 million votes nationally and a convincing electoral-vote margin that exactly matched trump’s 2016 tally.two republicans consider trump the winner despite all evidence showing otherwise. and another 222 gop members of the house and senate — nearly 90 percent of all republicans serving in congress — will simply not say who won the election.what a flurry of snowflakes!

a thought, and a concern

 what frightens me is we are witnessing what happens when a bunch of stupid and incompetent people attempt a coup. what happens 4 years from now, when the republicans nominate another authoritarian (and they will) who isn't stupid and incompetent?

an interesting idea:

 what if biden offers a few republican senators, in the interest of bipartisanship, from states with democratic governors minor cabinet posts or ambassadorships?  especially those not seeking reelection?  send pat toomey to ireland, offer richard burr director of national intelligence?   then the governors of those states get to appoint democratic politicians to those posts until the next election cycle, giving the senate to the democrats and sidelining moscow mitch for at least two years.

i'll type s...l....o....w....l.....y for the maganuts  

 in 2019, the pennsylvania legislature, both houses of which are controlled by republicans, passed a law modifying the commonwealth's election rules to allow "no excuse" absentee, or mail-in voting.  this legislation was passed by both chambers, each controlled by republicans.  it was signed into law by a democratic governor in october of 2019, months before anyone knew there was a pandemic coming.  since then, voting by mail is a perfectly legal way to vote in pennsylvania.  it does take longer to count those votes, because signatures require validation, envelopes have to be opened, ballots have to be flattened, stacked and fed into the tallying machines.  this takes time.  if more democrats availed themselves of this new way of doing things, its not the fault of "the system."  its not some nefarious plot.  counting legally cast votes isn't "cheating."  its just counting.  i'll add that if you're concerned about how long this is taking, those same legislators refused to allow elections officials to tally mailed votes as they arrived, forcing them to start counting over a million mailed ballots on tuesday. also, provisional votes, of which there are tens of thousands, cannot be legally examined and counted until tomorrow.

if i may make a point...

 there is no legal or constitutional requirement that a winner be announced by  midnight  there is no legal or constitutional justification to stop counting votes at 12:01am.  we generally never know who the winner is until the wee hours of the next day, and on occasion, haven't known for weeks afterwards.  any attempt by a campaign to stop counting legally cast votes is voter suppression, plain and simple. labels: voting

the most unsurprising legal opinion of the day

 dork who sued a local grocery store for refusing to allow him to shop without a mask has his case tossed out by a federal judge. josiah kostek, 36, was seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the grocery chain’s mask policy. he contended the policy — requiring all customers to wear either a face mask or full face shield while shopping — goes against the americans with disabilities act. he claimed excluding him from the store was an act of retaliation.giant eagle argued that kostek “presented a direct threat to the health and safety of others, including customers and employees.”u.s. district judge nora barry fischer ruled in the store’s favor, denying kostek’s motion. she found that he failed to meet any of the necessary requirements to obtain the injunction.as the judge noted in her decision, giant eagle offers personal shoppers, home delivery, and no-charge curbside delivery options, and allows people who claim they can't wear a mask to wear a face shield instead.

i'm not in the least bit surprised

 so, it looks like the far right was responsible for instigating the violence in minneapolis, not the blm protesters.  everything from smashing out the windows on an auto parts store to firing on, and burning, the police station. ivan harrison hunter, a 26-year-old from boerne, texas, is charged with one count of interstate travel to incite a riot for his alleged role in ramping up violence during the protests in minneapolis on may 27 and 28. according to charges, hunter, wearing a skull mask and tactical gear, shot 13 rounds at the south minneapolis police headquarters while people were inside. he also looted and helped set the building ablaze, according to the complaint, which was filed monday under seal.
