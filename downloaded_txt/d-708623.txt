                  to encourage the youth and young adults to have more
                  participation in the church activities, the english service
                  chapel was consecrated on may 6, 2017 by h.e. theethose mor
                  yeldo. the vision of the chapel is to build an orthodox
                  community where people find transformation and growth in jesus
                  christ through the faith which has been believed, taught,
                  preserved, defended and died for since the day of pentecost.  chapel
