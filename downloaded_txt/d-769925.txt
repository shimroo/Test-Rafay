 welcome to
abington ale house
something for everyone
 
enjoy our extensive menu, order your favorite craft beer or cocktail while watching a game on one of our many tvs or play keno in the lounge or while enjoying our outside patio.

if you prefer a quieter atmosphere, enjoy the same great food, drink and service in our dining room.

we even have a private function room for large parties and events.

if you can’t come in, we offer a full to-go-menu.

so come in or call us tonight! 

if you are into great food, ice-cold drinks, good service and making memories, the abington ale house is the place to be.  the abington ale house is “good for what ales you” – we have a little bit of everything for everyone.
we would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank you for your continued patronage for almost 50 years.

you have helped us survive and continue to be part of this wonderful community during an extremely questionable time. without you, there would be no us.

we look forward to seeing you soon.

thank you!

best regards,
mary barrett costello
president
the abington ale house team
