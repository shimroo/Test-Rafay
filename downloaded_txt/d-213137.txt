welcome

watch

jamma
      mokhriby

has gone to be with
      the lord 2.20.2008

 
       
       
      

        the unselfish desire of those involved with rapture
      watch is to hold forth in a darkening time the joyous light
      of jesus christ and his soon return to both believers and non-believers,
      and to warn the world of the rebellious that judgment is near
      and certain. the lord is surely coming again to claim what
      is his. 

        "for the earth will be filled with the knowledge
      of the glory of the lord, as the waters cover the sea."
      (habakkuk 2:14).

welcome
    to rapture watch

we invite
      you to participate in our rapture watch messages live, written
      and by telephone. watch as biblical prophecy manifests daily.
      watch as we march and participate in sodom and gomorrah which
      is necessary to fulfill what the bible says.
watch us
      keep you up to date in developments which prove that the bible
      is true. now listen, if that is true then the rapture is also
      true and will occur any day now. keep informed and enjoy our
      biblically based articles and messages.
 
      rapture watch is an independent,
      non-denominational, christian outreach which believes in
      the inerrant and infallible word of god as recorded in the original
      language of the scriptures.

      we unwaveringly believe that faith in jesus christ alone for
      the forgiveness of one's sins is the only way god has provided
      for salvation and that once a person is truly born again by the
      holy spirit they are irreversibly, eternally redeemed.
       
      by god's declaration in ii peter 3:9, that he is "...not
      willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance,"  we
      accept and teach that no person was ever created by god without
      the genuine freewill to make a decision for or against the salvation
      he has provided and offered by the love and blood of his only
      begotten son jesus.
       
      jamma mokhriby's farewell 
      to: r421@earthlink.net 
      subject: homecoming
      date: feb 20, 2008 10:31 pm
      dear rita and all his friends in the lord,
      the lord took jamma home this morning at 6:30. the sun was rising
      and he left his body after i opened the blinds up and let in
      the morning son. the room was filled with a feeling of peace
      and it was a beautiful moment. seems as if the lord blessed his
      departure with a sign in the heavens this evening by the lunar
      eclipse. how's that for a send off. we are very comforted in
      knowing he is free and out of his diseased body. what glory he
      is in. it seems he has beaten us there and gets to rise first.
      praise jesus!
      we love you and thank you for being a faithful sister.
      take care, we should all be home soon.
      keep looking up,
      sharon
