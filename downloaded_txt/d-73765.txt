almost 70 years of christian music royalty


so what more can you do when you possess a mammoth legacy such as that of the kingsmen? the answerâ¦keep singing and ministering the gospel, and keep releasing music with lyrics relevant to the lives of the listeners. the same drive and work ethic that brought the kingsmen to incredible heights more than a half century ago, secures the kingsmenâs continued place among the top male quartets in christian music today.
