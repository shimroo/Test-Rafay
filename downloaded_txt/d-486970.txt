a revolution in acting technique

the three pillarsof our approach

  












effectivenessin every moment, we ask, how can our work improve? as acting artists, we strive for professional, mind-boggling, award-winning, rave-review, goosebump standards of excellence. as coaches and teaching artists, we are just as passionate about brilliant teaching, coaching, and learning. our commitment to innovation in acting technique means, in any situation, if there’s a better way, we’ll find it.














efficiencyrather than rely on pat formulas, exercises, and busy work, we recognize the natural speed and agility of the human system, organize around diagnostics, and help each actor to solve technique problems quickly and easily as they naturally arise. this saves everyone time, energy, and resources. what most acting teachers, coaches, directors, and programs do in weeks, months, or years, if at all, we do in minutes.














safetythough our work is often intense and always challenging, we believe strongly that it is never necessary to compromise anyone’s health, safety, or sanity in order to make great art. no matter what we’re working on, the physical, vocal, and emotional safety, health, and well-being of everyone involved is our primary concern and first priority at all times. our spaces and our ways of working are ever safer, ever braver.

testimonials

























taking ken’s class reminds me of why i wanted to be an actor in the first place.






"i came to his open house over a year ago and was immediately inspired to work. he is energetic, compassionate, and encouraging, and he creates great community. his style is eclectic—drawing from many acting methodologies, and yet the work is specific and organic. there have been times where i feel as though i'm watching a tennis match between ken and his students on stage—they're practically speaking their own language within the world of the scene. i've felt my confidence grow and seen my work improve, and i'm constantly inspired by the work of others in his class." — katie booth (strange angel, tell me how i die)


























ken's class is a game changer!






"he helps you find the nuance, emotion, tone, and texture of anything you bring to class, be it a song, a monologue, a scene, or even commercial copy. and better yet: he gives you the tools of how to get 'there' on your own!" — joel pellini⠀


























working with ken has not only changed the way i approach my acting work, but the way i approach my life!






"he encourages you to take risks and to be the best version of yourself you can be. having this class as a creative outlet has been so important, especially this past year! ken has created a beautiful community of artists that i feel so incredibly lucky to be a part of."⠀— jenny robbins


























the ken studio is comprised of some of the most supportive, talented, and inspiring artists, who show up to class eager to learn and enhance their skills. 






"ken brings such a bright, positive, and encouraging energy into the room. he’s helped me gain a deeper trust in myself and challenged me to put more of my essence into my pieces, creating a more grounded and organic performance experience."⠀— alec ruiz (national tour of tootsie)


























the ken studio is the place where you discover your full potential as an actor. 






“ken offers you a safe environment for training, where he guides you with patience, enthusiasm and absolute kindness. during the time i’ve been part of this incredible community of artists, i’ve felt my confidence boosted, and i’ve felt more willing to challenge myself. even though i’m kilometers away from all of them, the ken schatz studio feels like a second home to me." — alejandra arce


























where do i begin, i could sing the praises of the ken studio all day long.






"ken is an amazing teacher!! he creates an environment where the actor feels totally safe to play, trust oneself and explore! the magic for me is that ken helps actors connect to the little kid inside who’s a brilliant actor. he has given me a new relationship with my craft. when i came to ken, i was a cerebral actor and it was frustrating. his approach to organizing around given circumstances was a real game changer. i learned to trust myself and keep things simple. ken gives each actor the tools to connect their humanity to the story. he meets every actor in class where they’re at and makes it so easy to be vulnerable. ken has taught me to act from the heart and i’m so grateful!"⠀— lauren james


























ken has changed the way i view acting entirely.






"my thoughts as an actor are heard and validated, aka 'actor problems.' this has given me power in any room, on set, or working through any creative process. working with ken, i have cultivated real creative tools that i know i can access at all times. it’s not a guessing game where i wander blindly anymore. no more 'try and see if it sticks. make a choice.' approach." — morgan piner


























ken is the most skilled, versatile, and conscientious acting teacher i've ever had.






"he has a keen understanding of the nuances of each medium and style, which means i'm able to bring him anything from a commercial voiceover audition for cheez-its to a dramatic shakespearean monologue. and most importantly, he always prioritizes an actor's physical and emotional safety, understanding that an artist does their best work when treated with kindness, patience, and support. i highly recommend him to anyone, and after working with him for over seven years i still continue to learn, explore, and grow."— shanta parasuraman (rainbow high, the wolves, helen hayes award winner)
