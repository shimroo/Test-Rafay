        the career connection to teaching with technology consortium, initiated by
        the volusia county school board in florida, proposes to involve outstanding teachers
        from geographically diverse public and private schools in the development of educational
        resources and to guide them in aligning their lessons with challenging state and
        national standards. university partners and software developers will collaborate
        with teachers to create three dimensional software that immerses students in a virtual
        reality learning environment. industry partners have already designed a satellite
        delivery system, named the digital curriculum intranet, which will allow
        software products, lessons, and other resources to arrive at participating schools
        in a reliable, timely manner. the consortium of 30 diverse schools, the american
        psychological association, hughes network systems, adobe, j. weston walsh publishers
        and the university of central florida, and other partners will work together to
        raise student achievement with technology.
