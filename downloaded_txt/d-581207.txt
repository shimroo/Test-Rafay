 







herrin, taylor, lanier, curry family of s.il, ky, tn, nc
 




 
william elisha herrin brought his family to the rushing creek settlement before 1795, making him one of the earliest settlers in what is now benton county, tn. traveling through the cumberland gap along the southern fork of the wilderness road to fort nashboro and then farther west to the tennessee river was no accident. they left the kings mountain area of north carolina to join family members who were establishing a new community at rushing creek. joseph rushing, a founding settler of the new community, was married to william elishas sister, the former emily herrin.  
 
ties between the herrin-rushing families began in the virginia and north carolina colonies. early records from isle of wight county, virginia show both families in that area since 1715. at that time herrin was spelled herring and rushing was russian. past these early connections and the marriage of emily herrin to joseph rushing, three of william elishas children married rushing family members. 
 
william elisha was born at herrins grove or herrins creek in the disputed area of kings mountain, north carolina on july 7, 1730. he is the oldest fully documented patriarch of this family branch. his parents are believed to have come to the colonies from wales even tho the actual family origins are in the black forest region of southern germany around herrenalb. 
 
on may 5, 1765, elisha was married to mary agniss abimlick. mary agniess was born in north carolina on october 2, 1735, but no information is available concerning her parents. the couple had 11 children, all of whom migrated to west tennessee. 
 
following elishas military service with general sumpters south carolina brigrade during the revolutionary war, the couple migrated to the new lands west of the appalachians. they acquired over 400 acres of farm land in humphreys county and land belonging to family members on all sides
