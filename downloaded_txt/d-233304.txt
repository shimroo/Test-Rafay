about the study





health behaviour in school-aged children (hbsc) is a who collaborative cross-national study of adolescent health and well-being. founded in 1982, the survey is undertaken every four years using a self-report questionnaire. hbsc uses findings at national, regional and international levels to:
 

gain new insight into young people’s health and well-being;
understand the social determinants of health; and
inform policy and practice to improve young people’s lives.

what do we research and why?
hbsc focuses on understanding young people’s health in their social context – at home, school, and with family and friends. it aims to improve understanding of how these factors, individually and collectively, influence young people’s health throughout adolescence.
the adolescent years are a critical transitional period within the life course during which rapid physical, emotional, cognitive, and social development occurs. these years mark a period of increased autonomy during which health-related behaviours develop and independent decision-making may influence their current and future health.
behaviours established during this transition period can continue into adulthood, affecting issues such as mental health, substance use, physical activity levels and diet, and longer-term health outcomes. exposure to alcohol or tobacco use, physical inactivity, unprotected sex or violence, presents risks not only to adolescents’ current health and well-being but also their future health.
the adolescent years, therefore, provide a critical opportunity for prevention and intervention to support young people’s healthy growth and development, promote future health and well-being in adulthood, and, as such, underpin the health of the next generation.



how are data collected?
data are collected in all participating countries and regions through school-based surveys using a standard methodology detailed in the hbsc international study protocol. each country or region uses cluster sampling to select a proportion of young people aged 11, 13 and 15, ensuring that the sample is representative of all in the age range. around 1500 students in each hbsc country or region are selected from each age group. around 280,000 young people took part in the 2021/22 survey.

youth engagement





article 12 of the united nations convention on the rights of the child – which enshrines children’s rights to have their views and opinions heard, respected and taken into account – is fundamental to the work of hbsc.
the hbsc network believes that young people are essential stakeholders in the production of science and policy relevant to their lives.



the hbsc network uses a range of methodologies to enable young people to play an active role in the research process. participatory research approaches with young people are employed in data generation, devising new research areas and related questions, data analysis and interpretation, and disseminating findings.
