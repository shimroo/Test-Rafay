mystery of america - book 1: enigmatic mysteries and anomalous artifacts of north america - a connection to the ancient past, a book by tédd st. rain.

												mysterious and often inexplicable remnants of civilization's history fascinate scientists and archaeologists. people travel worldwide to visit such sites, yet some of the most enigmatic artifacts and structures have been found right here in north america. unfortunately, because these records do not fit within accepted academic models of human history, they remain unexplained mysteries, and most people never hear of them.

												• long before any humans were supposed to be on this continent, unknown hands removed millions of pounds of copper from mines near lake superior.

												• giant people as tall as 12 feet were buried in arizona, nevada and the midwest.

												• a three-foot-high adult mummy was discovered in wyoming.

												• sandaled feet made footprints in rock at least 300 million years old in utah.

												• a human-like tooth,three times normal size, was found in coal from a montana mine.

												according to modern wisdom, humans evolved on earth no earlier than two million years ago. yet many of these artifacts were made long before then. how can this be? could any of these anomalies have been the result of an advanced civilization once present on our planet?

												l history, novelty books, occult this book presents the evidence that there have been intelligent beings on earth long before humans are thought to have evolved here. explore these intriguing possibilities and more in this exciting and informative investigation into the mysteries and anomalous artifacts of north america.

												tedd st. rain, author, lecturer, and videographer, he has traveled the world extensively investigating the world’s ancient mysteries and enigmas, actively researching the mysterious, the metaphysical and the mythical. born in long beach, california, tedd is the owner of lost arts media that publishes, markets and distributes fascinating and educational books, videos and multimedia products to help inform, enlighten and inspire humanity.

the legacy of colonel philip j. corso: part 1 and part 2, with william j. birnes and philip corso, jr. one of the most important milestones since the disclosure process began in earnest after the dissolution of the soviet empire in 1991 was the publishing in 1997 of the day after roswell by lt. col. philip j. corso with william birnes (also a speaker). the allegations in this book rocked the foundations of the cover-up. to this day the neither the army nor the department of defense nor any agency of government has formally responded to these allegations. the washington post would not even dare write an obituary for this noted washington insider rather than mention the book. if you plan to attend this conference, it is recommended you read the day after roswell in advance. the life story of col. corso, who died on july 16, 1998 at 83, is extraordinary. col. corso was a decorated officer and a patriot who believed the public should know the truth about the extraterrestrial reality. his son shares this belief and is determined to defend his father's legacy. paradigm research group is pleased to announce philip corso, jr. will come to washington to talk about his father and the family's experience in the aftermath of one of the most controversial books ever published. in his lecture and workshop he will present information never before revealed to the public. the story of col. philip j. corso is not over. it has only just begun. xcon-711d o upc 8 82917 07119 5 o 178 min o 2 dvd disks o normally 49.95 now only $39.95

 forbidden archaeology: the hidden history of the human race, with michael cremo. michael cremo is on the cutting edge of science and culture issues. in the course of a few months’ time he might be found on pilgrimage to sacred sites in india, appearing on a national television show, lecturing at a mainstream science conference, or speaking to an alternative science gathering. as he crosses disciplinary and cultural boundaries, he presents to his various audiences a compelling case for negotiating a new consensus on the nature of reality. michael cremo is a member of the history of science society, the world archeological congress, the philosophy of science association, the european association of archaeologists and associate member of the bhaktivedanta institute specializing in history and philosophy of science. michael cremo’s book forbidden archeology has become a classic in the history of archeology. it is filled with evidence showing that humans like us have existed on earth for tens of millions of years. this stands in stark contrast to the conventional scientific beliefs that humans like us have been present on this planet for only about 100,000 years. in his talk, michael shows some of the more spectacular examples of what have been called out-of-place artifacts and outlines the extreme antiquity of humanity. he also explains how he was inspired by the ancient sanskrit writings of india and other wisdom traditions. nsaw-315a • upc 8 82917 03154 0 • 119 min • audio tape • $14.95 +++ nsaw-315c • upc 8 82917 03152 6 • 119 min • audio cd • $16.95 +++ nsaw-315v • upc 8 82917 03153 3 • 119 min • vhs video • $24.95 +++ nsaw-315d • upc 8 82917 03159 5 • 119 min • dvd disk • $24.95








        


 zero-point extraction from the quantum vacuum, with thomas valone, ph.d. today we face a destabilizing dependency on irreplaceable fossil fuels which are also rapidly dwindling. a real need exists for a portable source of power that can compete with fossil fuel and its energy density. a further need exists for a fuelless source of power which, by definition, does not require re-fueling. one possible source could be zero-point energy (zpe). a major feasibility study by integrity research institute placed its emphasis on the practical potential for zpe energy conversion, especially in view of recent advances in nanotechnology, than in the theory. tesla-606v • upc 8 82917 06063 2 • 72 min • dvd disk • $24.95 +++ tesla-606d • upc 8 82917 06069 4 • 72 min • dvd disk • $24.95



        




 the presidents and the hard evidence: part 1 and 2, with grant cameron. the public's general impression is that of a government which hid away the facts surrounding extraterrestrials and refused to release anything. those controlling the secret have been painted as evil men who have contempt for the truth and for the people's right to know. those who kept the secrets were men of good will who agonized over releasing the truth. concerned over the impact of complete disclosure, they took a middle position of carefully releasing the story of the u.s. government's role without allowing anyone to obtain a critical mass of information. those who controlled the secrets have on a number of occasions purposely released key pieces of the ufo story into the public consciousness through a mixed process of disclosure and disinformation. in part 1 of "the presidents and the hard evidence" this presentation will present evidence that the president did know about hard evidence such as crash retrievals right from the start, and that he took steps to cover up the evidence. there will be evidence presented about the canadian government involvement in the early days of ufology, directed by wilbert smith who ran the official government investigation of flying saucers known as project magnet. also discussed will be smith's contact with the secret mj-12 type group that controlled the most classified ufo evidence, and evidence that smith was read into the crash retrieval program. cameron will talk about arthur lundahl who was considered the preeminent intelligence officer of the 1950s. according to one cia source lundahl briefed at least three presidents on the subject of ufos. he will also look at lundahl's involvement in ufo hardware recovered in 1952 and his successful attempt to communicate with an alien in 1959. lastly he will detail lundahl's contact to the present flood of ufo documents in the ufo community known as the majestic documents. crc-1057v • upc 8 82917 10573 9 • 120 min • vhs video • $24.95 +++ crv-1057d • upc 8 82917 10579 1 • 120 min • dvd disk • $24.95




        














sacred geometry workshop, with drunvalo melchizedek. drunvalo's information was given to him from 1972 through the 1980s by thoth, best known as the egyptian deity of inner wisdom pertaining to science, mathematics, and literature. since the 1980s, drunvalo has been presenting his flower of life workshops (either personally or through his trained facilitators). his work has been spread to at least 40 countries, is taught in many languages (such as spanish, dutch, german, french, japanese), and has deeply touched thousands of people around the globe. when the teachings of geometry are used to show the ancient truth that all life emerges from the same blueprint, we can clearly see that life springs from the same source – the intelligent, unconditionally loving creative force some call "god." when geometry is used to express and explore this great truth, a broader understanding of the universe unfolds until we can see that all aspects of reality become sacred. the ancients such as the egyptians, mayans, and others all knew this truth and incorporated sacred geometry teachings into their mystery schools as a way for anyone to begin to practically understand his or her personal relationship to "god" and the universe. in this presentation, drunvalo speaks on the experience in his life that led him on the path to the practice the flower of life teachings. a full two-hour presentation on the flower of life and sacred geometry. for more information visit www.floweroflife.com signs-105d • upc 8 82917 01059 0 • 118 min • dvd disk • $24.95

 the shadow government, inslaw / promis and the octopus, with kenn thomas. kenn thomas is a para-political researcher who publishes a quarterly zine called steamshovel press, www.steamshovelpress.com in this presentation he discusses the research of danny casolaro, the writer who died in martinsburg, west virginia while investigating an intelligence cabal called “the octopus.” the tentacles of the octopus reach out from casolaro's research to today's headlines. resignations from the current bush administration involve personalities and parapolitical history that casolaro was the first to expose. join kenn thomas as he reviews this history. the inslaw/promis scandal started in the early 1980s, when the department of justice signed a $10 million contract with a company called inslaw, that developed specialized tracking software. inslaw provided the software, called p.r.o.m.i.s., but the government refused to pay the contract, forcing the company into bankruptcy court. the judge ruled against the government, but through appeals it was never held accountable. instead, profits from promis paid off the ayatollah khomeini in the infamous "october surprise" manipulation of the 1980 presidential election. this set a pattern of trading with the enemy that continued through the iran-contra scandal; the build up of saddam hussein and the al-queda (as the mujahadeen); and continues to this day with the bush / bin laden / saudi axis. they all involve the same players and the same parapolitical dynamic that casolaro warned the world about before he, too, fell victim to the octopus. in the backdrop: murders and apparent suicides among the cabazon tribe members in california; the infamous private security/surveillance bureaucracy wackenhut; the government modified p.r.o.m.i.s., sold illegally to unsuspecting governments and intelligence agencies worldwide with a secretly installed "back door" to allow spying on those same agencies, and now enabling the notorious echelon satellite system. another example are the promis-like “spyware” worms and viruses that infiltrate the internet. it is a story that just will not go away. even the courts concluded that through "trickery, deceit and fraud" the us "took, converted, stole" promis through a series of "willful, wanton and deceitful acts" – a description that magnified to assassinations, wars and corruption on a global scale. promis: know about it. it surely knows about you. for more information www.steamshovelpress.com wex-1207v • upc 8 82917 12073 2 • 73 min • vhs video • $24.95 +++ wex-1207d • upc 8 82917 12079 4 • 73 min • dvd disk • $24.95
