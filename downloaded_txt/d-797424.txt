never sacrificing quality
own a piece of history
		



	as you look around the pages of this site, you will discover that, as with the original sharps, our rifles are not intended for the mass market. they are for the shooter, hunter, competitor and collector who wants something special. therefore, we will never sacrifice quality for higher production figures. to do so would compromise the "soul" of this product, and disappoint those wishing today for the quality that was the norm in the 19th century american firearms. we feel that shiloh sharps rifles reflect the extra time and effort that go into their manufacture.
