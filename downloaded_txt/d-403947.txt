customer quotes 


















						“they picked up my rugs, returned them and laid the rugs back where they belong!  the rugs are beautiful. i cleaned my mother’s for the first time in over 45 years!  also had my needlepoint foot stool cleaned – it looks brand new! this was made by my mother! i will hire them again and tell all my friends!”
					


maryellin r. 






						“the carpets turned out amazing.  we were really impressed with the entire sales process – from the estimator to the technician, they both made the experience hassle free and easy.”

					


mercedes dealership 






						“my hardwoods were filthy, even though i mopped them weekly, i was unable to remove all of the dirt. hammondknoll came to my home, cleaned the hardwood and even got rid of a few light scratches. my cleaner was very professional. overall it was a great experience.”
					


sarah a. 






						“when i needed my vintage chairs refurbished, a trusted local furniture shop referred me to hammondknoll. the old black leather cushions were very faded and cracked, and hammondknoll completely brought them back to life. the transformation was dramatic and beautiful. i even gave special instructions to preserve the original stitching, which required a lot of extra time and attention to detail. they did a great job!”
					


lynn s. 






						“we have used hammondknoll for over 10 years. recommend them  without reservation. they are reliable, courteous and efficient.  our carpets and upholstery look wonderful. the care they exhibit in handling our items is terrific. they must have rigorous requirements in their hiring process to find such great employees.”
