welcome to our christ-centered - parish

service of proskomide
since the early church, the office of oblation (proskomide) has been a service of offering gifts to god in preparation for the sacrament of holy eucharist or holy communion in the divine liturgy. the congregation gives the names of the living and dead for whom they want the priest to pray. please present the name(s) to be commemorated to the sexton in the narthex at the beginning of the orthros service.

artoklasia
artoklasia, which means “breaking of bread” is a special prayer service offered by an individual or family typically on a feast day or special family occasion. the service takes place at the end of the divine liturgy or at great vespers. the five loaves are reminiscent of the five loaves that jesus christ blessed in the desert and by which five thousand of his followers were fed. please call the church office at 978-531-0777 to schedule an artoklasia.

memorials
kollyva is an offering of boiled wheat that is blessed liturgically in connection with the memorial services in church for the benefit of one's departed, as (40-day kollyva is traditionally most important) a trisagion is also a brief memorial service read in church or at a  gravesite (without kollyva). please call the church office at 978-531-0777 in advance to schedule a memorial service.
kollyva available for mercy meal

 
 
the office has been asked many times by parishioners who would like to have kollyva for the mercy meal after the funeral.if you would like to order kollyva a parishioner has stepped forward and is willy to accommodate parishioners.if you are interested call niki at 978-578-7292
