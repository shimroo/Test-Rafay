      our consultant/trainer,
 
      dr gina hasircioglu is a sonologist doctor and the first author of  atlas of ultrasound.

      
most medical practitioners own an

      ultrasound machine, but lack the training to utilize their machine

      properly. as a result, either they themselves or their patients suffer

      from wrong or late diagnosis. techno city has been proudly conducting
      diagnostic ultrasound trainings to provide proper training and a hpcsa
      approved certificates in south
      africa since 2000.
