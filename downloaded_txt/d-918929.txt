special thanks go out to our founders whose foresight developed the society into what we are today!

some aquatic plants, especially exotic species, have become an increasing problem in the southeast where they obstruct navigable waterways, restrict water flow, clog water intakes, degrade water quality, and interfere with recreation. in south carolina alone, over 50,000 acres of public waterways and thousands of acres of private waters are infested with aquatic weeds. heightened interest in research and control of nuisance aquatic vegetation in south carolina led to the formation of the s.c. aquatic plant management society in march of 1979. 

actions by the sc aquatic plant management society have led to organized aquatic weed planning and control efforts statewide through establishment of the south carolina aquatic nuisance species program, aquatic plant management council, and the aquatic plant management trust fund in south carolina and development of similar programs in adjacent states.the purpose of the s.c. aquatic plant management society is to assist in promoting the management of aquatic vegetation, to encourage scientific research and promote scholarships to students, to provide scientific advancement and knowledge to its members, and to extend and develop public interest in aquatic plant management activities. scapms is a chapter of the national aquatic plant management society.
