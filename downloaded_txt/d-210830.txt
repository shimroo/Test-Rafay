 joseph murphy
(1898-1981)

prosperity
writer extrordinaire

             
      





dr. joseph murphy wrote,
taught,
counseled, and lectured to
thousands
all over the world for nearly fifty years. born in 1898, he was
educated
in ireland and england. years of research studying the
world’s major
religions
convinced him that some great power lay behind them all: the power is
within
you!
dr. murphy was
minister-director of
the church of divine science
in los angeles for 28 years, where his lectures were attended by 1300
to
1500 people every sunday. his daily radio program during all that time
was immensely popular. he moved to laguna hills, california in 1976,
where
he continued to speak every sunday until he made his transition in
1981.

murphy refused requests
for profiles
and biographies, saying that
his life was to be found in his books. he wrote over 30, including the
amazing laws of cosmic mind, secrets of the i-ching, the miracle of
mind
dynamics, your infinite power to be rich and the
cosmic power
within
you. there is a new edition of the power of your
subconscious
mind,
revised and expanded by ian mcmahan. 
murphy was influenced by ernest
holmes and emmet
fox,
both
well known writers on new thought principles, but his academic
background
was in eastern religion. he spent many years in india, and was an
andhra
research fellow at the university of india. 
dr murphy spent a good
part of his
life studying eastern
religions,
and was a scholar of the i-ching, the chinese book of divination whose
origins are lost in history. joseph murphy, ph.d., d.d., was a
world-renowned
authority on mysticism and mind dynamics. he remains a beacon of
enlightenment
and inspiration for legions of loyal followers. 
“you were born
to be rich. you grow
rich by the use of your
god-given
faculties, by tuning in with the infinite, and as your mind becomes
productive
and full of good ideas, your labor will become more productive and will
bring you all kinds of material riches."
“there is no
virtue whatsoever in
poverty, which in actual fact
is
a mental disease, and it should be abolished from the face of the
earth.
you are here to find your true place in life, and to give of your
talents
to the world. you are here to expand and unfold in a wonderful way,
according
to a god-given potential, and to bring forth spiritual, mental, and
material
riches, which will bless humanity in countless ways. learn how to
surround
yourself always with beauty, and luxury, and realize your inalienable
right
to live, liberty, freedom and peace of mind.
“it is your
divine right to dramatize,
reveal, portray and
express
the power, elegance, and riches of the infinite one.” 
"i have seen miracles
happen to men
and women in all walks of
life all over the world." -- dr. joseph murphy. 
dr. murphy teaches the
simple,
scientifically proven techniques
and
the astonishing facts about how your subconscious powers can perform
miracles
of healing. how lung cancer has been cured and optic nerves made whole
again. how you can use the newly discovered law of attraction to
increase
your money-getting powers. how your subconscious mind can win you
friends,
peace of mind, and even help you to attract the ideal mate. how your
dreams
can help you solve problems and make difficult decisions -- or warn you
of potential disaster. prosperity, happiness and perfect health are
yours
when you use the power of your subconscious mind. 
murphy saw the
subconscious mind as a
darkroom within which we
develop
the images that are to be lived out in real life. while the conscious
mind
sees an event, takes a picture of it and remembers it, the subconscious
mind works backwards, ‘seeing’ something before it
happens (why
intuition
is infallible).
the subconscious responds
to habit and
habitual thinking. being
totally
neutral in a moral sense, it is happy to adopt any habit as
‘normal’ -
good or bad. we blithely let negative thoughts drop into the
subconscious
every minute of our lives, then are surprised when they find expression
in day to day experiences and relationships. while there are some
things
that will happen to us that we had no role in creating, these are in
fact
rare. mostly, the bad that happens is in us already, waiting for the
light
of day.
understanding your
subconscious mind
as a photographic mechanism
removes the emotion and struggle from changing your life, because if it
is simply a matter of replacing existing mental images with new ones,
you
begin to see the ease with which you may change. 
‘the law of
your mind is the law of
belief itself,’ murphy says.
what we believe makes us who we are. william james observed that
whatever
people expect to be true, will be so, irrespective of whether the
object
of their belief exists in fact. in the west we have made ‘the
truth’
our
highest value; this motivation, while important, is weak next to the
actual
power of belief in shaping our lives. whatever you give your
subconscious
– false or true, good or evil – it will register as
fact. be careful
not
to joke about misfortune, as the subconscious has no sense of humour.
‘if thou canst
believe, all things are
possible to him that
believeth’
(mark 9:23). in all the old rituals of ancient times, with their weird
mixtures and incantations, it was the power of suggestion and
acceptance
in the subconscious mind that healed. even today, doctors report the
power
of placebos to produce miraculous recoveries if accompanied by
doubt-free
instructions that ‘this will do the trick’.
miracles of healing, murphy
says, are simply the body’s obeying of the subconscious
mind’s
knowledge
of ‘perfect health’ when the questioning nature of
the normal conscious
mind is silenced.
