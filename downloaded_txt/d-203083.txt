understanding 
						our postgraduate credit system for:  


postgraduate diploma;   


postgraduate certificate;   


postgraduate short courses; 


credit-hours; 


credit-value; and 


accumulated credit-hours. 


 



 


						 

credit-hours are the actual amount 
						of time that a lecturer or tutor spends with his or her 
						students or 
						delegates, in both in-venues  and video-enhanced deliveries. each five-day in-venues , 
						or ten-day video-enhanced (3 hours per 
						day) course consists of 30 credit-hours, while 
						a 6-day in-venues  course amounts to 
						36 credit-hours. because credit-values are calculated in 
						multiples of 30 credit-hours, 60-89 credit-hours have a 
						double-credit (2 credit) value, while 90 credit-hours 
						earn a triple-credit (3 credits).    




						your postgraduate award awaits: postgraduate diploma; 
						postgraduate certificate; diploma postgraduate (short 
						course).



postgraduate diploma award  


a postgraduate diploma award is 
						achieved with a minimum of 360 credit-hours, through 
						continuous study, or an accumulation of credit-hours.  its 
						duration is 12 weeks via in-venues , or 20 weeks' 
						synchronous (video-enhanced) online, delivery.



postgraduate certificate award  


a postgraduate certificate might 
						be gained with a minimum of 180 credit-hours, through 
						continuous study or credit-hours' accumulation.  its 
						duration 


						is
						

						6 weeks intensive in-venues ; or 10 weeks 
						video-enhanced (synchronous) online, tuition.



postgraduate short courses 
						(diploma postgraduate awards)  


a delegate who successfully 
						completes a postgraduate short course of 30 or more 
						credit-hours, but which is less than 180 credit-hours 
						(postgraduate certificate), is awarded a diploma  
						postgraduate. a five-day in-venues , or ten-day 

						video-enhanced (synchronous) online, tuition earns a 
						diploma-postgraduate, 30 credit hours. 
						these awards are assigned credit-values and 
						credit-hours, as are exemplified below:  


diploma  postgraduate  
						in organisational change management, 30 credit-hours;  




advanced trainer-training, for 
						lecturers, leaders, managers, corporate trainers, and 
						consultants, postgraduate course, leading to diploma - 
						postgraduate - in advanced trainer-training, 
						double-credit, and executive management, module 6, 72 
						credit-hours, accumulating to a postgraduate 
						certificate, with 108 additional credit-hours, and a 
						postgraduate diploma, with 288 additional credit-hours. 


property law: conveyancing and 
						property valuation, quad-credit, 120 credit-hours:  


diploma  postgraduate  
						in university and higher 
						education administration, triple-credit, 90 
						credit-hours;  


diploma  postgraduate  in 
						tourism and international relations, 
						quad-credit, 120 credit-hours.   


 









all postgraduate short courses 
						accumulate to a postgraduate certificate and a 
						postgraduate diploma, on a pic and mix or specialist 
						basis. this means that we maintain academic records for 
						each delegate, indicating the courses studied, with 
						their credit-value and credit-hours, as are indicated 
						above, under postgraduate short course awards. the 
						credit-hours are aggregated to accumulate to at least 
						180 and 360 credit-hours, for a postgraduate certificate 
						and a postgraduate diploma, respectively. each short 
						course award (below a postgraduate certificate) 
						indicates both the credit-value and credit-hours.   



accumulated 
						postgraduate certificate and postgraduate diploma award 
						titles 


all specialist 
						postgraduate certificate and postgraduate diploma 
						programmes have predetermined award titles. please 
						click to view and download our list of specialist 
						postgraduate certificate, and postgraduate diploma 
						programmes. delegates who do not follow a 
						specialism, for accumulation to a 
						postgraduate certificate and 
						postgraduate diploma,   receive a generalist, rather 
						than a specialist, award. however, a specialist 
						award is given to delegates who studied at least seventy 
						percent (70%) of their courses in a specialist grouping,
