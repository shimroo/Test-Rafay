ssv series product line update
for modular and monolithic conveyor belts, vdg offers the ssv series drum motor with either the belt profile machined directly onto the drive drum or on an exchangeable profiled sleeve. while vdg will continue to provide replacements for both modular belt drive drum motors and sprockets, the new generation, all-stainless steel ssv series drum motor provides the most hygienic drive solution for sanitary belt conveyor applications.
