welcome to university of california agronomy research and information center

more...





delivering scientific, research-based information, resources, education, and on-line tools on california agronomic crops to growers, researchers, industry professionals, governmental agencies, and the general public.















alfalfa




alfalfa production occurs over about 1,000,000 acres throughout california, with the highest-producing regions in imperial county and the san joaquin valley.
more...





beans




california farmers grow mainly four classes of dry beans — limas (99% of u.s. supply), common beans, garbanzos, and cowpeas — on about 50,000 total acres.
more...





bio-fuels/bio-energy




imported corn and sorghum are currently used to produce bio-fuel in california. however, canola, camelina, sugar beets, and sorghum offer promise as a basis for in-state production.
more...





corn




corn is grown on nearly 600,000 acres in california, primarily in the central valley. it is mainly used for silage and grain, with a small specialty crop market comprised of sweet corn, corn nuts and popcorn.
more...





cotton




uses for cotton fibers range from heavy industrial to fine fabrics. california cotton grows mainly in the san joaquin valley on 200,000 to 300,000 acres.
more...





oil seeds




safflower is the primary oil seed grown for oil in california. sunflower hydrid seeds are grown and exported for oil production. canola and camelina are showing promise as new oil seed crops.
more...





rice




california rice is grown primarily in the sacramento valley on approximately 550,000 total acres. mostly high quality medium grain rice is produced as well as some other specialty rice varieties.
more...





small grains




small grains are an important rotation crop in california and include wheat, barley, oats and triticale planted on over 800,000 acres. wheat is the predominant california small grain crop.
more...





sorghum




sorghum is being rediscovered as a valuable rotational crop and forage that can help california meet future water needs, specialty food markets, and potentially as a renewable fuel crop.
more...





sugar beets




california sugar beet production began in 1870 and beets have been produced in nearly all agricultural areas. beets are now grown only on about 25,000 acres in the imperial valley.
more...





wild rice




in california, wild rice has been grown commercially since the 1970s and is planted in cultivated paddies where yields range from 1200 to 2000 lb/ac.

agronomic crops in california




agronomic crops occupy over 5 million of the approximately 8 million irrigated acres in california, having large impacts on water use, nutrient management, farm profitability and human health.

history of agronomy




in 1904, a division of experimental agronomy was established in the college of agriculture of the university of california, berkeley. by 1906, it was clear that a berkeley location for experimental work could not meet requirements and the division was shifted to the university farm at davis.
