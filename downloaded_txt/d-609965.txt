silicon breakthrough in microscopychallenge:a science team at cornell university was limited by the capability of imaging tools, in their attempt to probe into the atomic structure of sulfur using a transmission electron microscope probe.solution:after sourcing materials from goodfellow, they were able to create an electron microscope pixel-array detector (empad), built on a slab of silicon half a millimeter thick.find out moresolving grounding and electrical interferencechallenge:a student team at the instituto technico at the university of lisbon were creating an electric formula 1 car and were experiencing issues with grounding and electrical interference due to the high operating voltage.solution:with the use of a highly lightweight and flexible copper mesh around the cockpit the team created something similar to a faraday cage preventing any interferences, enabling grounding without the need for of a bulky and cumbersome wire network.find out how we're helping the automotive sectora breakthrough in nuclear fusionchallenge:researchers at california's lawrence livermore national laboratory needed to overcome one of the biggest barriers to producing clean energy from fusion: producing more energy from the experiment than was put in.solutionon 13th december 2022, llnl confirmed they had successfully delivered on this channel, using materials supplied by goodfellow.read our news story
