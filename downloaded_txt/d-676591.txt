	 2008 high school playoff predictions, week five
    


mhsaa class 5asouth panolaintriguing matchup.  the wildcats may just be the toughest team south panola's played this year.  the tigers have had some close escapes (tupelo, madison central), but should earn their 90th consecutive win tonight over meridian.mhsaa class 4anoxubee countygood matchup of unbeatens, and probably the best championship contest on paper.  i think the tigers will beat d'iberville.mhsaa class 3alouisvillewhat with dandy dozen qb clayton moore being dismissed from the team, a lot of people might think that tylertown has a very good shot at winning, and they do.  i'm thinking though that bill simmons' ewing theory might come into play-- giving the wildcats the victory.mhsaa class 2aforestforest has been impressive all season long.  baldwyn beat defending state champion west bolivar on the road.  however, i think that the bearcats from scott county will win.mhsaa class 1apuckettthe wolves are playing calhoun city, which surprisingly won the north half by beating the top two 1a teams in the state (east webster and ray brooks).  look for puckett to win.

	 a consequence of being stir crazy
    


the sinus crud i've had has given me the appearance of being anti-social.  i'm not, but since i've not gone out much over the past couple weeks, i am more than a bit stir crazy.i've even gotten to the point of looking at the personal ads on yahoo and match.com for the first time in several months.   i noticed that a couple of colleagues from the college have profiles; however, i'm no fan of workcest.in general, the profiles were the usual dreck: christian female iso christian male only.  dating prospects online and in real life are still negligible.speaking of real life, i've not been doing much.  i am, after all, stir crazy.  i need to get out and socialize, but not at the risk of relapsing or catching something else while i'm still not quite 100 percent.

	 sinus crud hate
    


i've battled this sinus crud for about two weeks, and i when i think i'm over it-- like i thought i was friday-- the following day, i feel terrible.  and i wanted to go to hattiesburg.i'm disappointed.  i've not felt like doing anything because i've been under the weather, and when i do something-- going to the cherokee and then hal & mal's on friday-- i feel terrible the next day.i feel better now, but what with the wet and cold weather forecast to arrive later this week, i can't help but think that things will be dreary.  i hate dreariness.
