aims and ethos 


what makes a headington rye oxford pupil?



curious 
          

 

         and
        creative,
          

 

confident 
          

 

         yet 
        collaborative, 
          

 

always 
        compassionate 
          

 

        and definitely 
        courageous.
          













curious



            she is curious about the world around her with a natural passion to find out things for herself. she seeks out further information in areas which interest her and extends her learning beyond the classroom.          



 


some of the ways we do this:

offering opportunities, right through the school, for girls to make their own choices about the activities in which they engage including the chance to take the hpq or epq
investigating individual areas of scientific inquiry
providing a broad and diverse programme of trips and activities that encourage girls to engage in the world around them
being alive to the plethora of different career paths and life choice







creative



            she is a highly-motivated creative thinker who approaches problems from a fresh perspective, looking beyond the obvious and bringing in her experience and learning from other disciplines to make connections.           



 


some of the ways we do this:

offering a range of opportunities for open-ended projects and learning opportunities beyond the classroom. these include, for example; robotics, coding, and the duke of edinburgh award scheme
providing opportunities to create their own work and share it, through musical and theatrical performances, creative writing
involving girls behind the scenes in technical drama and musical performances
nurturing learners who take risks, view errors as central to the learning process and produce solutions and ideas that are original and valuable
directly challenging pupils to think about thinking and develop awareness of their own approach to problem solving 







confident



            she is a confident, independent thinker, comfortable in social and professional situations and new environments, able to interact with new people and to take the lead where appropriate.          



 


some of the ways we do this:

encouraging girls to push their boundaries on challenging local and international activities and trips
generating opportunities for lively and informed academic debate and discussion with boys and girls from other local schools
providing opportunities to meet external speakers, to engage in academic debate with those out of their peer groups
hosting and presenting to external visitors
taking leadership roles such as form and sports captains, environmental council, prefect and student leader roles







collaborative



            a headington girl is a truly collaborative individual with a range of interpersonal skills enabling her to work with and from others.          



 


some of the ways we do this:

leveraging digital classroom solutions to facilitate collaborative learning in lessons and beyond
offering a broad co-curricular programme with activities that encourage and reward good teamwork
encouraging collaborative project work
working as a team to lead house events







compassionate



            she is a caring individual with a strong sense of empathy, aware of her social responsibilities, she values cultural, ethnic and religious diversity and the richness this brings.          



 


some of the ways we do this:

overarching christian ethos reflected through prayers and assemblies, chaplaincy programme and other events
supporting and encouraging pupil-led committees such as the charity and eco-committees and giving them the opportunity to make real difference to the way the school works
advocating for equality and global issues
developing emotional intelligence through pshe and similar form time activities
providing strong peer role models and being consistent in our application of school rules and values







courageous



             she will approach new situations in the knowledge that if her first solution does not succeed, she will know how to regroup and try again. she will have a sense of adventure, be prepared to take appropriate risk and ready to ask difficult questions.          










some of the ways we do this:

normalising of failure, addressing the subject in assemblies and adopting positive language in discussions around failure, both in the classroom and beyond
offering the opportunity to take part in trips and activities including combined cadet force and duke of edinburgh awards, in addition to regular competitive team and individual sport activities
encouraging girls to share their views by publishing articles on controversial and topical subjects
allowing individuals to challenge the conventional stereotypes and advocate for change
