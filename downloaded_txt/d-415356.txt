...on holiday for a while, to the sonar festival in barcelona. so, i won't be able to post any sudoku answers over the next week. i'm back tuesday morning, so who knows. if you have any answers you'd like to share with other readers in the meantime, stick them in as a comment to this post.

yes, something a little different for you today, or at least for readers of the uk's telegraph newspaper. this is the solution to yesterdays 'tough' sudoku, completed just before the day was over... 271849365935672418648135279563981724829467153417253986784326591156794832392518647
