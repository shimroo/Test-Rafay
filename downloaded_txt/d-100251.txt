preparing the next thought leaders in medicine, research and patient care


"we're interested in people who are well-rounded, who have taken time to venture outside their own comfort zones to see sides of life very different from what they're used to - people with a strong sense of humanism and service to others. we're interested in the smartest students, who are going to make the most of the resources duke has to offer, who will be leaders in medicine, research and clinical care."
--brenda armstrong, md,
former senior associate dean for student diversity, recruitment, and retention
