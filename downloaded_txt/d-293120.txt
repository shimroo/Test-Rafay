the category winners in the masc 41 have been announced. you can see them here
 
welcome song writers, song lovers, song singers and other casual misfits of the creative rodeo that is modern music. saw hopes to be your best resource for tools, tips, ideas and relationships. if you seek opportuneities to share your gift, come and join us as we make the solitary suffering that is songwriting an enriching community-based experience (or at least try real hard). roam our pages and social media outposts, ask questions, attend functions and otherwise make yourself heard and seen. if we help you find rhyme, that is our reason. saw is a community of volunteers, so we need you to participate. make yourself at home and get to work on your next song.

as part of nerfa (virtual) last year, we produced two showcases the joel pomerantz memorial guerrilla
showcases, featuring 25 amazing local acts. this is a cooperative effort of saw,
focus music, tpff, institute of musical traditions, wfma, and moore music in
the house. please support all these fine efforts at making our local music
scene thrive  and stay tuned for where to
watch the showcases after nerfa.

congratulations to this year's masc winners. you can listen to the winning songs here. and congratulations to everyone who entered. this songwriting thing we do is often a solitary practice. the many ways the you share your work help to make the dmv area such a great scene.
you have added
your voice, your music, your words and in some cases your video to the
collective conspiracy to commit art in an entertaining way. saw wants to make this experience as real and worthwhile as we can and we are always looking to hear from you what we can do. 

where (else) can you find saw online?
