evangelization

this area of our non-debate  discussion forums is dedicated to teaching the catholic faith.  catechists  as well as students of all ages  are invited to ask about the catechetical process.  make recommendations on certifications, methodology, or activities.  ask about course content.  share your ideas, ask for advice, review teaching and adjunct materials for youth, adult and rcia programs, as well as bringing the faith to others in every day living.  tell us what worksand what does not or simply ask for help in any area.

please note that opinions expressed in the debate forums may differ from authentic catholic teaching. these forums are provided for free exchange of ideas and debate; please visit our non-debate forums when searching for orthodox catholic doctrine.  responses are geared around church teachings, disciplines and actions, not around secular (i.e., political) values.

challenges are to be addressed in a properly stated question or thesis.  all inputs require charitable interaction!  

proselytizing is not debate!
