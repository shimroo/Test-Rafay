how to find the cheapest auto insurance company

 july 16, 2020july 16, 2021  dora stanley



the best car insurance company is the one that covers you when you need it most. this means that your insurance company must have the resources to be able to pay out to you in the event of an accident. a lot of auto insurers do not have this kind of financial standing and are forced to pass the cost of coverage onto their customers in the form of higher rates. this kind of situation can be very detrimental to anybody that has a good amount of money riding on being insured.

if you find yourself in this situation then there is help waiting for you. there are some things that you can do that will help you get the best auto insurance policy that you qualify for. some of these things include comparing quotes from different car insurance companies. for example, check out this progressive insurance review. the quotes that you receive will be based on many factors, including how old of a driver you are, and what kind of driving record you have.
some people believe that having a clean driving record is something that they can’t get discounts for. this is not true. although you may not think that it, there are many driving courses that are designed to teach good drivers how to drive. these courses usually last anywhere from eight to twelve weeks and they can teach you the basics of automobile safety as well as the laws that affect the country. having a clean driving record is something that many auto insurers look at when they are calculating a person’s rate, so it is important that you make sure that you keep your driving record clean for the sake of your wallet.
another thing that will affect your rate is the amount of coverage that you need. if you only need the minimum liability insurance that is required by your state then it is possible that you will not be able to obtain discounts for multiple cars. however, there are plenty of insurance companies that offer discounts for multiple cars if you can provide proof that you have enough coverage for all of them.
there are also a few things that affect the amount of insurance that you pay as well. for example, if you have added anything to your policy since you purchased it then you might be paying more than you should. there are plenty of things that will increase your car insurance rates, such as adding a driver or a non-owner’s auto insurance policy to an existing one.
allstate and esurance are two of the most popular insurance companies in the country. allstate offers one of the best rates on auto-owners insurance. esurance is available to anyone who has an active checking account. both of these companies cover a wide number of different types of car owners in the united states, so if you want to add another car to your policy then you should have no problem finding one that will fit your requirements. if you already have allstate then you are going to receive a discount for purchasing your auto-owners’ insurance through them.
you can also choose to go with just collision or comprehensive coverage on your car insurance policy. the first type of coverage protects you in case of a car accident. comprehensive coverage premiums are going to be more expensive because they cover you for damage caused by natural disasters and vandalism. in many cases, these types of incidents will happen in outlying areas that may not have as much crime in them. therefore, your premiums will be higher for comprehensive coverage. if you only need collision on your car then you will want to make sure that you are using a company that provides this option to you.
the cheapest car insurer in your state will probably be a company that only provides insurance in a few states and the district of columbia. this is because these insurance companies do not have any other requirements to be included in their quotes. the reason why they are the cheapest is that the companies must spend a lot of money advertising in order to get people to contact them. when you contact an insurance company that only insures a few states and the district of columbia, you will be getting the lowest prices available to you. they will also be able to pass any discounts that you qualify for such as good driver discounts.










deciding if you are going to buy a prize for your solitaire cube rewards

 july 4, 2020september 2, 2020  dora stanley



if you have a solitaire cube, odds are that you have also acquired a collection of other solitaire themed items such as matching sets, chess sets, and the like. these types of themed collections are great for those that like to play games, or those that would love to have a fun piece of furniture or home decor in their home.
solitaire for cash games are especially easy to understand and can provide hours of fun. if you are looking to purchase a new set of puzzles for your cube, you will want to pay close attention to what type of prize you are getting. while there are several different options available for prizes in a cube, it may not be a good idea to give away money, or other types of goods, as a means of winning.
when you are choosing between a variety of different types of prizes, there is a need to think about the theme of the entire cube. if the cubes are based on a certain country or time period, you will need to determine if you want to offer a prize from the past, or the present. if you do not have a clear idea of how many solitaire cubes are going to be purchased, or what theme you are looking for, then you may not be able to come up with a prize that will work in all cases.
one type of prize that may be considered is a prize based on a particular type of puzzle. if you are choosing a prize based on a solitaire cube that is a traditional design, you should consider providing a prize that is based on a particular type of puzzle. some examples of these types of puzzles include the following: solitaire on a cube, the three-card game, and the classic four-card tie. you should know how many players will be playing, and how many pieces of the cube will need to be placed to complete a puzzle before you start counting the number of wins required for the prize.
if you are going to give away a prize based on a traditional type of cube, you will need to decide how many of the squares of the cube you are going to offer. if you have multiple cubes, you may want to offer the prizes to the player that has the most solitaire squares in each cube. this is a great way to give a prize to each person that wins.
if you are purchasing a chess set themed puzzle, you will need to make sure that you include all the pieces that will be used in the puzzle. since you will need to count the number of wins for prizes, you may want to consider offering a prize based on each chess piece set.
there are many different items that you can choose from when you are looking to buy prizes for your cube. while some people may opt to purchase different items each year or every few years, you may choose to make these types of purchases based on a theme or simply as an investment.
while some of the prizes may not be a good idea to give away, other prizes may work out just fine. many times, if you are choosing something inexpensive, such as a card game, or a book, you may not be concerned about the fact that someone may lose the prize. most of the time, you can find prizes at local toy stores, or online auction sites that are relatively inexpensive.

how to edit a novel: practical tips for first-time editorsworking from home

 october 2, 2019october 2, 2019  dora stanley



if you’re a self published author, editing is often one of the responsibilities that would normally be handled by a traditional publishing company but which now transfers through to something that you might have to take on yourself. editing is a natural part of being a writer, and there’s no reason why writers shouldn’t take on editing their own manuscripts – or why keen editors like can’t offer our skills as freelancers. 
if editing sounds difficult, it’s not: here are some unbeatable practical tips for first-time editors. 
editing: the second step
editing your book should be the second step of the writing process. the first, of course, is actually writing your book to begin with. don’t think about the editing process during the writing phase: if you do, your brain can get stuck on a bunch of questions that are much better suited to the editing process. 
when you write, write freely and don’t worry about how to edit a book later. this even allows you as a writer the freedom to let the occasional spelling mistake slide: you can fix it later in the process.
once you’re confident that you have the skeleton of the story written down, it’s time to move on to the editing phase. 
using grammarly for better grammar
one of the first things that any author should do even before they start the official edit of their manuscript is to run it through a reliable spellchecking tool. many paid and free ones are available: grammarly is one of the best, used by thousands of freelancers, writers, journalists and industry professionals every day. 
it can help you to spot any spelling and grammar mistakes (as well as repetitions) that you might have missed. once this is done, it’s time to start the first part of your edit to find things you’d like to change. 
online dictionaries and thesauruses are your friend
online dictionaries and thesauruses should either be installed on your computer or marked in your browser’s bookmarks. when you’re editing, it’s easy to realize that you’ve used the same word more than once – or that you’d like to say something in a different way. refer to online dictionaries for this rather than dragging any heavy books closer. 
use a secondary reader
once you’ve started the editing process, it’s going to start to feel like you have no idea what you’re doing anymore. it might feel like you’re hacking off the wrong parts of the story – or like you just can’t get your head around a specific chapter. this is normal and often something that every editor and writer will wrestle with. 
how do you fix this? reliable secondary readers (sometimes called beta-readers) who can read your manuscript in the editing process. this is useful, especially where you need feedback to keep moving the editing process forward. where something doesn’t work as well or could be said better, beta-readers are quick to say it. 
let your manuscript stew
never rush straight from writing to the editing process. it’s always a good idea for writers to let their manuscript sit for a while after they are done writing it: the writing process can often be so exhausting by itself that editing can create “blind spots” for writers if it’s done to soon. give it time before editing your manuscript – whether it’s a few days or weeks – and by the time you’re reading it again,  it will feel like a  new and fresh work.  
this can be the key to avoiding decision fatigue, a very common condition whereby the brain is exhausted by – literally – thinking about too much in a short amount of time.
