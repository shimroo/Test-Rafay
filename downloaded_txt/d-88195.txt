at dr speron plastic surgery, we believe that your comfort and trust are paramount. we respect your personal space and your decisions. that's why, once you've had a cosmetic consultation with dr. speron (includes unlimited followups & consultations for life), we keep our follow-up communications minimal and non-invasive. we do not want to be pushy and do not want to feel like used car salesmen.
after your visit, you can expect just three follow-up emails from us. the first one will be a thank you note, acknowledging your time and interest. the second will be an informational message, offering helpful advice related to your consultation. the third, and final email, will be an open-ended invitation for you to return, should you need further assistance or wish to continue exploring our services. we wonât text you or call you. of course, if you request otherwise, we will be happy to follow up with you or provide additional information.
this is our promise to you - no incessant calls, no obtrusive texts, no unnecessary emails, no pushy and unrelenting follow ups! 
we're here when and if you need us, but we understand the value of your personal space and peace of mind. your comfort and complete satisfaction are our highest priority. we're here to provide assistance on your terms, fully respecting your time and decision-making process. take your time.  we are not going anywhere. we are always here for you.
