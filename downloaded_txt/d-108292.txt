                                        not only is the arrangement stunning, but it was carried all the way to the table for the elderly recipient who could not lift it. ms. delivery went above and beyond her job by sprinkling salt on the icy porch and fetching the mail. eckert florist is definitely a full-service business!!

                                        both my recipient and i were most pleased with the results. since this was a memorial for a recently deceased, the florist graciously incorporated a different color for the flowers/ribbon and even added a slim, graceful branch to balance and to expand the vertical, visual space. this original composition was thus both consolation and pleasure for recipient and sender.

                                        i'm a guy who rarely buys/sends flowers...bad on me.  my reluctance is due to several factors, mostly though, due to reviews from unhappy customers (not at this florist, just at some florists in general).

well, let me tell you, i am definitely a happy customer.  the arrangement i picked was even more beautiful than the website's picture.  all the flowers appeared to be fresh (no brown edges or wilting), there were plenty of them (no skimping on the quantity), the delivery was prompt, and the recipient was thrilled.

i oughta do this more often!
