testimonials




schuler cues have been a part of my family for years. my grandfather played with a schuler, my father plays with a schuler, and now i have just purchased my first schuler cue. i could not be happier with my new cue!



timothy christal





super excited about my new schuler cue! i love the joint style and overall design of the cue.



james dickey





wanted to give a special shoutout to jacoby custom cues for keeping the schuler cues legacy moving forward! you guys do amazing work and i can not think of another cue maker who would be able to build the schuler cues like ray schuler would have wanted.
