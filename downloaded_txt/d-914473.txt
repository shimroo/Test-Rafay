just wanted to mention that doug hovan alerted me to some important information today regarding the progress on a project that i have been managing. had he not informed me when he did, i would have learned about it well after there was an opportunity to act upon it. over the past week, he has been extremely helpful to me and today has served as the eyes and ears for a major endeavor that we are pursuing. it’s great to have doug as part of our team here in elyria.

middough engineers displayed an outstanding level of engineering knowledge and experience.

i have worked with several engineering firms over the last 20 years and found that middough has delivered the best engineering and construction coordination work.

i would highly recommend hiring middough and their project managers for any power engineering projects.

i just wanted to thank middough for the excellent work the company did on the emergency power project. there is no question in my mind that we selected the right ae firm for this project. the success of this project was due largely to the design and the attention to details middough put forth on this project. the service we received and the professionalism in which it was delivered is a testament to middough.
