products
praxsoft’s assetactive™, sensoractive™, and weatheractive™ products enhance the capabilities of those responsible  for security and critical infrastructure protection, improved operations, and  asset management.  
local sensor networks deliver real-time environmental,  identification, weather and status information from local and remote sites.  praxsoft’s identification is more than just the id of the asset—it includes full  position, health and well-being reports. data is transmitted in real-time simultaneously from multiple sensors  for significantly improved situational  awareness. 
 alarms alert users of  changing conditions, sensor variance, or positional data via e-mail, cell,  pager, or even direct audio. with the praxsoft active series, data can be collected from any analog or digital  device and integrated into popular applications, models and gis-based decision  support programs.
