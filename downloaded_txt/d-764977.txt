erraid



a small island community on the west coast of scotland














welcome to erraid!the tiny hebridean isle of erraid has been home to a small community living the principals of the findhorn foundation for over 40 years. living life on a remote scottish island brings us to the forefront of experiencing nature at its rawest, which allows us to hold a deeper connection to the land, the ocean, the weather and the spirit that encompasses us all. our vision for our community and the island is to live in as eco-friendly and sustainable way as is possible whilst practising our spiritual values and living consciously.we seek to follow and inspire a spiritual approach to life by connecting people to nature, to their inner wisdom and by making work a sacred act which we call love in action. our community is open to guests and you are welcome to join our small community for a week or more. many people have been called to erraid to engage in community/alternative living, to be part of learning how to live more sustainably and to live off the land, whilst experiencing its outstanding stillness and beauty.































if a retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life sounds more appealing, erraid can be the perfect setting for this. if you are looking for a new direction in your life we will give you the space and time to reflect amidst the island’s raw beauty, with the freedom and the sense of adventure it brings.

erraid’s gardensour gardens have been lovingly tended and nurtured by the erraid community for over 40 years. we grow our crops organically and also have a stunning herb garden. all year round we look after our gardens – in all weather.in the springtime we sow seeds and plant out. in the summer there is lots of weeding, watering, and harvesting to do. in the autumn we enjoy more harvesting and preserving whilst putting the garden to sleep for wintertime. in the winter we prepare the beds for the coming spring by enriching the soil with lots of seaweed from the nearby beach, manure from our hens and compost made from our organic waste.throughout the year our meals are made with fresh organic produce from our gardens whenever possible. depending on the season they provide us with a variety of salad leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers, courgettes, brassicas, onions, garlic, legumes, potatoes, herbs, rhubarb, blackcurrants, blackberries and much more. we also use the gardens to grow beautiful flowers that bring pleasure in the gardens and also adorn our gardens and houses.


























animals and wildlifepart of our lives here on erraid is looking after our animals. the relationship we have  is one of loving respect, as we explore conscious cooperation with the animal kingdom.the chickens live in the byre and we have plenty of eggs to eat.our community cats moonlight and shadow have lived with us a long time.  they were found abandoned on mull by one of the members of the community and were small and malnourished. thanks to the loving care and patience of the residents they have grown up  to be loving, loyal cats.there is a herd of black face sheep on erraid belonging to the local shepherd, which the community helps with throughout the year. sheep round-ups are a favourite with some guests, who are invited to join in.we have lots of wonderful wildlife on erraid too – from birds of prey, herons, deer and hedgehogs.







































woodwood is the source of heat and for hot showers for all the houses on erraid and so the cutting and splitting of wood is an essential part of life here all year round.  all the wood (mainly larch), is locally sourced from the isle of mull.  the wood burning stoves heat the hot water for radiators and showers. the scraps and bark go back to the gardens as mulch, and the sawdust from using the chainsaw helps keep our compost toilets fresh, meaning that nothing is wasted.at low tide we use the tractor to bring the wood across the beach, before it is cut into logs with a chainsaw, then split and stacked.  then about once a week most members and guests on erraid help with a wood run from the wood shed up into the houses with a chain of people to load and unload the trailer. this process is a team effort of residents, guests and volunteers, all playing a vital role in helping keep this cycle turning.
