history















preservation






































in 1996, congress designated eight counties in the shenandoah valley of virginia as a national battlefield site - the shenandoah valley battlefields national historic district - which preserves and interprets the region’s significant civil war battlefields and related historic sites. the effort is led by the shenandoah valley battlefields foundation, which works with partners to preserve the hallowed ground of the valley’s civil war battlefields, to share its civil war story with the nation, and to encourage tourism and travel to the valley’s civil war sites.
