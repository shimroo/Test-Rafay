tip line - safe schools






our district is now using safeschools alert, a tip reporting service that allows students, staff, and parents to submit safety concerns to our administration five different ways:

 app:    search for “safeschools alert” in the app store to download for free 
 phone:     855.502.6924 
 text:        text your tip to 855.502.6924 
 email:     1759@alert1.us 
 web:        http://1759.alert1.us

you and your child can easily report tips on bullying, harassment, drugs, vandalism, threats of violence, or any safety issue you're concerned about through safeschools alert. when you submit a tip, be sure to use our district’s identification code: 1759 in your communication.
