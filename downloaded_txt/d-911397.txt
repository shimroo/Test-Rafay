university of bmx



bmx magazine & periodical index




	this is a bmx information database with emphasis on the old school era. it is collaborative and member driven, but has a bit more structure than "wiki" style information sources typically have. this is more like an old school bmx campus, where you can "sit in" on classes taught by authorities on the subject matter. the information is vetted by the members and moderated for submission by the dept. of bmx science.
