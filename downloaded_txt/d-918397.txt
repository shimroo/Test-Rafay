	 marching.
	 
    


 chaman - mana
iba andando en el camino del desierto
de zulu
hacia el norte del real.
iba buscando entre cactús que iluminan
con su luz,
que iluminan la verdad.

this morning, a black car preceded by rows of marching, mounted soldiers in red-feathered hats made their way towards plaza de la provincia. (i believe the ministry of foreign affairs is there.) i know this because that plaza is the closest to my house and stands between me and the train station. i had to slip through the parade to get to school on time. i am truly a ninja.

shopping for classes is a little like marching in that it requires stamina: i was in class from 10.30 to 18.00, with a 15 minute break. but, i found some choice cuts. first, derecho diplomatico, where i learn about how cool it would be to be a diplomat and meet other law intercambios. second, derecho canonico, which confuses me because i am pretty sure it's a 3hr/week class about the laws of marriage. third, and best, tecnicas de expresiones escrita y oral, in which a 70yr old man on the verge of retirement orates in a style akin to hair! the musical, frequently running up and down and into the aisles and grabbing students on the shoulders to emphasize his point; he promises to teach me to bellow, and assigns weekly diary entries in which we must opine on the class, the world, and recently experienced art. i love him, a little bit. he seemed distinctly delighted that i would choose to take his last class ever. (i am the only intercambio in it.) 

after an almost 8 hour day on coffee and fruit, i deliriously assured myself that a bikram yoga class was exactly the way to finish. i was wrong. i was dizzy. i would have killed the instructor to get out of the 100 + degree classroom but i was too weak. i liked the part i was upright for though; and the part i watched... i'll return tomorrow fortified with a hearty breakfast, a large lunch, and maybe, like, a small whale in my stomach, too. 

i stumbled home to skype with family (yay!) and to find the plumber not only fixed my clogged sink, but cleaned it, too!

	 what i should have been blogging about for the last 8 weeks, or, a month of travels. part i: the motherland, or, austria.
	 
    


(duh) the sound of music - rodgers & hammerstein 
the hills are alive with the sound of music
with songs they have sung for a thousand years
the hills fill my heart with the sound of music
my heart wants to sing every song it hears


we began in austria since mom was still vacationing there after throwing herself a grand birthday-in-austria bash the month before (which boo missed to film house). we stepped off the plane to spend the first morning sleepily walking around salzburg. we visited the house where mozart was born, and boo was moved to tears when he saw the tiny wanna-be piano on which mozart composed his first symphony at the age of eight. through the tears, boo mumbled something about pure envy but then covered his tracks by claiming profound fatigue. to his credit, he supported his claim by managing to fall asleep immediately in the car on the way home; and despite being woken up by my mother every 10 minutes with a command to look at the mountains, he would always promptly fall asleep again.

we had dinner at the local gasthouse (inn + beer garden). usual fare: beer, cabbage salad, smoked fish with horseradish, dumplings the size of softballs, and kasespeatzle (aka mac n´cheese). we spent the next two days swimming in the cold but drinkably clean lake and bicycling through farms. 




oh those hills? alive.

friday, we drove to vienna to stay with my cousin for a few days. we arrived, peed, and immediately went to the statehouse plaza where the government was showing an enormous projection of an opera. there was also an international food fair in the square. beer + poppyseed-sugar-gnocchi dessert + opera in the center of town = those austrians know how to have a good time! afterwards, cousin took us on a nocturnal walking tour of the center. well done, cousin. well done. 

saturday we visited a few museums in the museum quarter and decided that some modern art just isn´t art. case in point: cy twombly. my barley-there head cold decided to take over that night and so we did not join in on vienna´s annual citywide pub crawl. it´s called something else but, let´s be serious, what else would you call live bands playing at every single bar on the ring-road in vienna´s center all night long. 

because we were not stupefyingly hung over the next day, we managed to make it to schönberg castle before our flight. schönberg was the hapsburg´s summer castle. you know, because one castle in vienna is certainly not enough. the garden there rivals versailles´. ok maybe it doesn´t rival it, but in the european world of enormous, splendid, luscious-but-dammit-you-will-bend-to-man´s-will gardens, it´s probably second. and the entire garden is free to the public. unlike versailles (see upcoming gripe fest). 



schonberg, from like 1/10 of the way into the gardens.



1/4 of the way into the gardens, i could finally fit the entire castle into my frame.


main fountain in gardens. we were halfway to the end. but it was too far. i was sick!

then we got on a plane to venice. but not before my mom managed to park in the diplomat parking only zone.

oxford comma - vampire weekendwhy would you lie about how much coal you have?why would you lie about something dumb like that?why would you lie about anything at all?first the window, then it's to the walllil' jon, he always tells the truthi love me some quicken online. it is a ridiculously easy way to monitor both your income (mine, none) / spending and your stocks. the first section allows you to create your own labels and set up reminders about recurring bill payments. it also give you automatic  charts and graphs (whee!). (my pie chart looks awesome this month because i put a bunch of money in my savings account.  i'm not looking forward to december though - moving, gifts...) plus, the website offers articles, podcasts, youtubes and other didactic programs. the portfolio section offers tips and in depth analyses and charts about your portfolio and any stocks you want to watch.  this is so much easier - and more accurate than me doing this myself.  i love it.

	 down the rabbit hole, and other exercises in divergence .
	 
    


this time - john legendthis time i want it all.this time i want it all.following a late-night music binge, today has been one of those [down the rabbit hole] days where i procrastinate on one imperative project by working on another that is necessary but not as important and/or as time-sensitive. this behavior is successful given that it's design is to alleviate the guilt of not working on the imperative project.today's imperative project is to outline for my patent law class, which has been a struggle, to say the least. i'm pretty sure the class reiterates the same policy everyday and just adds new jargon in an effort to preserve or increase it's self-importance. i blame it all on the author of the book, who likes to repeat himself over and over, and a little bit on thomas jefferson, who is largely to blame for the existence of us intellectual property laws. i will, of course, stop begrudging tj the existence of ip law as soon as this final is over...  to his credit, he has a nice quote that justice scalia probably wishes had not survived the test of time:   i am certainly not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions. but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. as that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy ... .inscription on the thomas jefferson memorial in washington, d.c., taken from a letter from thomas jefferson to samuel kercheval (july 12, 1816).in any case, my procrastination-project, which is searching for a note topic, is proving fruitful and is at least within the same topic as the class i should be outlining. i started with the google book search project, which i understood to be a project with the goal of digitizing all books.  (i also thought it was a completely original project but apparently it is  inspired by other digitization projects already underway such as the library of congress's american memory project, project gutenberg, the million book project and the universal library.) i had heard of the google book project, and always believed it to be an incredible and noble project both preserving and spreading knowledge worldwide through increased ease of access. still, i never looked into the project because i don't really want to read an entire book on a computer. (if i could read german, i might make an exception for grimm's 20 stories.)   then i stumbled upon it when fact-checking for my journal. i couldn't find a hard copy of john locke's two treatises of government. i typed a quote from the journal paper into google and up popped the digitized book - not only are the books scanned and readable, they are search-able, just like web pages! google's first "crucial question" was apparently "how long would it take to digitally scan every book in the world?"; attending college during the napster litigation, my first question was, what are the copyright ramifications of this project?! of course, i am behind, and there is not only litigation - which has just been settled out of court this week - but also a small amount of scholarly discussion (see, e.g., proskine, emily anne, intellectual property: copyright: note: google's technicolor dreamcoat: a copyright analysis of the google book, 21 berkeley tech. l.j. 213.)i am not close to finishing my research on  this topic, but i suspect that with this recent settlement, and changes in the way music has been digitized and subsequently marketed in the last few years, there is there is a paper in here somewhere.another related subject that serves for interesting fodder is internet archive, is nonprofit organization dedicated to building and maintaining a free and openly accessible online digital library, including an archive of web." ia's web archive project, the wayback machine, is a digital time capsule. it's archived web pages bring up issues when used as evidence in court.  so far the patent office has accepted it's archived pages as prior art, but courts have come to different opinions.  see wikipedia internet archive. where do archived web pages fall under the 6th amendment's right to confront one's accuser? would the courts feel more comfortable if ia were regulated by statutes or monitored by some organization?  how would such measures confer reliability on an organization, especially given that it doesn't seem to have an agenda other than the classic librarian goal to preserve and provide access to information?maybe i'll have some answers in a few months.

	 lei: the bad seed by william march
	 
    


i picked this up for 50 cents at the shelter island library book sale. i read it in about 3 days. partially because the language is simple, and i could voraciously inhale pages in seconds like a teenage boy at any meal. largely because it was engrossing.a 9 year old girl who is almost too perfect. a mother who slowly comes to understand what her daughter is hiding, and, too, from whence such behaviour and emotional vaccuum is derived.  the question of nature v. nurture is finally, if uncomfortably, answered. (and pray the gods - yes all of them - help you if you cross her.)i particularly enjoyed the ending. the mother's conundrum of how to deal with her child's psychopathy kept me on edge. and once she finally decided, the way she executed it... well, let's just say i'm still scared.i read somewhere that this book is an example of 1950s american paranoia about secret communists: anyone can be a psychopathic serial killer, even a perfect angelic child, even your own perfect angelic child. keep your eye on everyone, and contemplate what you will do if and when you find out your own family has betrayed you.psnetflix for books!  yippee!!  http://www.bookswim.com/labels: book

you may write me down in history 
with your bitter, twisted lies, 
you may trod me in the very dirt 
but still, like dust, i'll rise. 

does my sassiness upset you? 
why are you beset with gloom? 
'cause i walk like i've got oil wells 
pumping in my living room. 

just like moons and like suns, 
with the certainty of tides, 
just like hopes springing high, 
still i'll rise. 

did you want to see me broken? 
bowed head and lowered eyes? 
shoulders falling down like teardrops. 
weakened by my soulful cries. 

does my haughtiness offend you? 
don't you take it awful hard 
'cause i laugh like i've got gold mines 
diggin' in my own back yard. 

you may shoot me with your words, 
you may cut me with your eyes, 
you may kill me with your hatefulness, 
but still, like air, i'll rise. 

does my sexiness upset you? 
does it come as a surprise 
that i dance like i've got diamonds 
at the meeting of my thighs? 

out of the huts of history's shame 
i rise 
up from a past that's rooted in pain 
i rise 
i'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, 
welling and swelling i bear in the tide. 
leaving behind nights of terror and fear 
i rise 
into a daybreak that's wondrously clear 
i rise 
bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, 
i am the dream and the hope of the slave. 
i rise 
i rise 
i rise.
