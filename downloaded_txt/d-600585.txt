what our athletes are saying




						“i’m kind of envious of the kids today that have the opportunity to train at a place like this and see the kind of coaching –because it can make you quicker, stronger, faster and a better athlete.”
						- peyton manning



						“d1 understands that its job is to make the athlete the best they can be. not just physical, but emotionally and mentally. d1 pours into their athletes and each individual is going to get trained to their best and be better because of the coaches and environment they are in.”
						- jason witten



						“if you’re looking for a place where you can come and get everything you need, the training, the nutrition, the rehab, the weight training, the skill training – d1 is the place for you. d1 is the place for the athlete to come and get better each and every day.”
						- ladainian tomlinson
