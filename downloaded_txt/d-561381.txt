sports writing and editing



this is still mostly about sports writing and editing, and i've returned the name to the original to reflect that, but i reserve the right to stray from the main topic now and then.

chris jones doesn't read gary smith ... and then he does



first, chris jones writes about why he had never read gary smith, considered by many to be the greatest "sports writer," (consider the quote marks bold) of the era. and then he writes about how he finally did read read him in gary smith and me, the sequel. the whole notion of one writer not reading another so as not to be influenced by him is an interesting one, and being debated at length at sj.com. some people say they don't understand it. some say they don't believe it. i personally both understand and believe it. left unsaid: the idea that one great writer simply must read another as a matter of course. i'm not sure i understand that thinking.

writers and 'brand'



gene weingarten writes a great column about the whole concept of writers as brands, and this has generated a lively discussion on a sj.com thread: weingarten: "brand this!". take a look, the different points of view are interesting.

the finger and offending



i could see why this would be offensive to some readers, but some days, a photo that pushes the envelope tells the story best. so i think the toronto star did the right thing here: newseum | today's front pages | toronto star

yep, i'm still here



visual evidence that i left back in 2009 to the contrary, i'm still around. this blog hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, and the thing is, i've been getting email interest in this blog, including one a couple of days ago. so i'm going to start trying to reactivate this page and seeing if i can make it worthwhile to read. stay tuned to see if i can pull it off.

farewell, mike



i got the phone call from somebody at the office who had seen it on the wire: mike penner had died in southern california at age 52. the los angeles times obit, written by keith thursby, is here.former timesman ross newhan remembers mike here. and mark whicker of the orange county register writes about him here.pretty much everybody in the business knows mike's story, and it's literally a "i'll never forget" moment when he wrote the column heard round the world. i was on the golf course and got about 10 calls to my cell phone. not much point in rehashing it.i just remember mike as one of the finest writers i have ever worked with, an extremely creative mind who came up with some of the best lines i've ever read or heard. but they were never forced in his columns; they always worked. and he was a good person.i'll also remember mike's annual holiday gift to some of his friends, his kpen compilation of that year's best alternative (i'm hoping that's the right word; some of it was admittedly beyond me) music. i was kind of sad the first year i didn't get one after moving back to florida, but i understood. i was kind of out of the circle.i can't really even begin to imagine what he has gone through in the past few years -- well, i guess it's more a lifetime -- and to me, saying "perhaps he has finally found peace," while well-intentioned, doesn't quite fit. i wish he had found it while he was still with us instead.

doyel on the media and michael vick



gregg doyel on cbssports.com says the coverage of michael vick is proving all the bad things people believe about the media.i love this business and always will, but his premise is hard to argue with.
