"listen, doc... it's nothing personal. i just hate dentists."





we get it. the dental office isn't your favorite.
do you identify with any of these thoughts and feelings?
spoiler: you're not alone! 9% to 15% of americans avoid seeing the dentist.
that's between 30 and 40 million people.




i am anxious & fearful
we are pioneers in dental sedation, and our caring team bends over backward to ensure visits are positive.



iâve had a bad experience
a bad experience at the dentist as a child or adult can be traumatic. weâre ready to gain your trust back.



my teeth arenât in the best of shape
weâll never judge or lecture. our only concern is helping you achieve and maintain excellent oral health.



i can never find the time
we offer both early and late appointments, and you may even be able to get all treatment done in one visit.



i canât afford it
we maximize dental insurance and offer an in-house savings plan + financing for those without.



i hate all the noises
sit back, relax and put on a pair of our noise-cancelling headphones to enjoy music, audiobooks or meditation.



waiting rooms irk me
our reception area is not a âwaiting room.â weâll be standing by, ready to see you promptly and on-time.



it hurts
weâre gentle and always handle you with care. we donât want you to feel anything... even an injection.
