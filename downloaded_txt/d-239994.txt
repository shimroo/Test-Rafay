anchored in our vision, a new home in newark for dodge foundation 



        december 14, 2023
      

transformation’ no longer feels appropriate to describe where we are and how we got here. after spending the last few years listening and learning but also steadily moving our funding to support racial justice organizations, we are strongly anchored in our vision and mission. we set an ambitious goal at the beginning of this year – to move the majority of our funding to support racial justice organizations by the end of this year. we are thrilled to say that we not only met that goal, but we exceeded it. we now allocate more than 60 percent of our funding to support this work.

        october 25, 2023
      

in may 2023, we announced our first-ever open call for racial justice organizations, looking to fund and support organizations across our state that have not previously had access to dodge foundation funding. more than 120 organizations from across the state answered that call, and today, we are thrilled to announce the ten organizations we are supporting from our first-ever open call process.
