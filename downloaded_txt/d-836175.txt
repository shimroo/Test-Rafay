								welcome to 10th planet events
					
							

		welcome to 10th planet events and autographs. over the years we have built up a vast archive of celebrity, film, tv, sport and historic genuine signed autographs, meeting actors and guests personally at our, and other events including many private signings. we have been able to work with amazing guests, actors, writers, producers, and historic figures including astronauts, wwii pilots and many more. during this time, we ran many conventions, monthly signings and had the joy of taking guests to shows throughout the uk, new york, and la.
hope you enjoy looking through our new website there will be regular updates.
