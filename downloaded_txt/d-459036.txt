since 1913 we have been working with animal lovers like you to protect dogs and cats in our community. together, we’ve saved animals from homelessness, illness, and abuse. we’ve provided these services while being completely funded by private donations like yours. we are not an affiliate of the aspca and do not receive an allocation of money from them each year, nor do we receive government assistance. so your support is critical in helping the tulsa spca to continue providing these critical services to our community.
