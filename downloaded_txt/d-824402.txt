koh larn, a picturesque island located just off the coast of pattaya in thailand, is renowned for its stunning beaches, crystal-clear waters, and vibrant marine life. often referred to as coral island, koh larn is a tropical paradise that attracts visitors seeking a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. with its powdery white sand beaches like tawaen, nual, and sangwan, the island offers a perfect setting for sunbathing, swimming, and snorkeling.
beyond its natural beauty, koh larn provides a variety of activities, from water sports to exploring local seafood restaurants. the island is easily accessible via a short ferry ride, making it an ideal day trip destination for travelers looking to experience the allure of thailandâs coastal charm. whether youâre an adventure seeker or simply looking to relax, koh larn promises an unforgettable experience amidst its serene landscapes and vibrant culture.



 now is a great time to visit koh larn. prices of many things from motorbike rentals to lodging have gone way down. the beaches and water are much cleaner now, and the big tour groups have all but disappeared. all this leaves you with a fantastic tropical island experience the way it was meant to be.

the best 4k drone footage ever. must see.
glass bottom kayaks for rent see the ocean floor

the koh larn ferry is back on the regular schedule as before. the fare is still 30 baht.
samae beach and the main village (naban) have new floating piers which are by far easier to keep your balance on, you hardly know they are floating on water.
motorbike rentals are now at 200b for all day and include fuel.












this floating pier at samae beach and another in the main village is very easy to keep your balance on.

nice website, i love the dogs. i visit koh larn about once a week, i go to samae beach the most, but i like to go to tawaen beach also. i usually go by myself and on average i spend about 500b all in, for an all day activity i think that is a bargain. i eat what ever i like, mostly sea food. i donât drink alcohol when i am out there maybe thatâs what saves so much money. i could get by spending less out there if i wanted but my koh larn days are what i consider a treat to myself. sometimes i will take a friend and that makes the trip even better.   keith, 2016-03-04
 
thank you keith, it was nice talking with you. i think my favorite beach is samae too, but in all fairness they all have their own qualities.




a nice pleasant way to spend the day, almost like stepping into another world. we will come back again and again.
