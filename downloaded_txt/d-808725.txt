travels with towhee
travel allows me to see new things, taste different kinds of food, meet
all sorts of wonderful people, and enjoy the pure fascination i have
with all of that. this rv trailer that i now own is a
perfect way to travel on land.
chapter 3 travels
we are kevin and laura. we’ve
been on a mission to see as much of the united states as possible. realizing that we could walk our own path,
we came up with a plan to turn our dream of full time travel into
reality.



t r
bowlin
i am a photographer and
naturalist traveling about photographing and observing the world.

the rolling steel tent
wandering but not lost. yrt. a
van, because owning an rv, with all its mechanical complexity, is too
much like owning a house. too much to go wrong. besides, the larger the
vehicle, the fewer places i would be able to go. and stop. so, stay
tuned. and discuss the craziness of my decision amongst yourselves. 


wandering his wonders
all of our married life we have enjoyed
traveling together. we have lived in western oklahoma all of our lives,
and we're really looking forward to living all over this grand
country--staying in places long enough to get a feel for the culture
and way of life
of our neighbors around the usa!
