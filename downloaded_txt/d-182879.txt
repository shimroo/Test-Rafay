welcome to music folk.
the st. louis source for folk and old time instruments!
we are currently in need of a new fiddle, guitar and banjo (bluegrass) teacher! if you are one, or know of one please contact us!
since 1973, we have been helping the community with their musical needs.  we have taught, inspired and nurtured local musicians. we have repaired and restored their instruments.  we have been a “go to” place for traveling musicians, collectors and historians. what’s more, is we have no plans to slow down! we are here to assist our clients, old and new. whether you are on the hunt for an instrument, have one in need of repair or want to learn how to play, think music folk first!
we still have a few open time slots for hammered dulcimer lessons with mickey sweeny, the 2023 national hammered dulcimer champion! she has the knowledge and skills to take your playing to the next level, whether you are new to the instrument or are a seasoned player, looking for a challenge.
we recently held our 50thish anniversary concert at the focal point in maplewood. music folk staff, teachers and members of the boyer family performed for this fun celebration of music!
photos for our 50th anniversary concerts are here:
 link to 5oth anniversary concert photos

we have started a scrapbook page (scrapbook of memories) if you have old photos, newspaper clippings or a nice memory you would like to share with us, please send them to musicfolk@musicfolk.com
