	the common questions people ask about xml. if you are seeking
	answers to questions about related areas such as sgml, html,
	cgi scripts, php, jsp, asp, javascript, java, databases, or
	penguins, you may find some pointers here, but you should

	authors, developers, as well as publishers and the interested
	reader. details of its organisation, contributors,
	availability, translations, and revisions are in the admin
	sections. updates to the faq are notified to the mailing lists
	and newsgroups listed in where can i discuss implementation and development of
	    xml?the full document is available for download in several
	formats: see availability
	for a list.organisationthis faq was originally maintained on behalf of the world
      wide web consortium's xml special interest group. it is divided
      into four sections: basics, users, authors, and developers. the questions are
      numbered independently within each section. as the numbering may
      change with each version, comments and suggestions should refer
      to the version number (see revision history) as
      well as the section and question number. see cite for details of citation and
      reference.please submit bug reports, suggestions for improvement, and
      other comments about this faq only to

	newsgroup. comments about the xml specification itself and related
      specifications should be directed to the w3c.availabilitythis xml document is at http://xml.silmaril.ie/. it is written
