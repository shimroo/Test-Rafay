we protect and sustain the unique lands, waters, and biodiversity ofwest marin through advocacy, education, and engagement.the environmental action committee of west marin (eac) is a 501(c)(3) environmental nonprofit centrally located in point reyes station, california, the gateway town to the only national seashore on the west coast. it was started by a group of local citizens who wanted to protect coastal marin county (affectionately known as west marin) from immediate environmental threats. our work strives to provide long-term protection and conservation of unique ecosystems and serves as a foundation of environmental protection for future generations. we provide an essential voice on behalf of the area’s priceless natural resources before boards, commissions, and county, state, and federal agencies regarding environmental issues facing our coastal communities. these communities are gateway towns to three national parks, three state parks, open space, agricultural lands, and private land that require intimate knowledge and understanding of policy, science, and law to help protect wildlife, habitat, watersheds, wilderness, and the coastline so future generations and can experience and enjoy them for years to come. thanks to people like you, we are able to protect our precious coastal resources.
