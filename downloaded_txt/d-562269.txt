the impact of homeownership



we created a homeowner impact survey that measures the impact our program has made on homeowners over the past 35 years.



.




the results show just what we’d hoped, our homeowners feel safer, more financially secure, and their children are healthier and accomplishing more than when they were renting.



.




we hope you take some time to read through this report and understand the profound impact that affordable and equitable homeownership has on families in our community.

help revitalize the richmond community, today
we help as many families as we can, but the lack of affordable, safe housing remains a critical problem in our area. habitat for humanity in the richmond metropolitan area is committed to making affordable and safe housing a reality for low-income families. and with the help of donations, volunteers, proceeds from our restore, and hard work from our home buyers, we’re making that dream possible for hundreds of residents in the richmond metropolitan area.
