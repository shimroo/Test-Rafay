twitter
yeah, perhaps it’s obvious that i never blog on here anymore.  my vox blog only gets updated sporadically as well.
just in case you are interested in what i’m up to, twitter is the best way to follow me.  it’s filled with all kinds of randomness that i used to post here, only twitter is updated much more frequently.

how my winter vacation started out
so, it started out with me being hungover from drinking too many frozen screwdrivers at the front porch.  i finally drag myself up and out the door to go get my eyebrows waxed for the new year and, as i’m approaching my car, i see that my driver’s side window has been smashed and there is glass everywhere.
i look inside and see that the radio is still attached (i guess they couldn’t figure out how to get it off) but everything in my glove compartment has been pulled out - my glove compartment where my ipod was.  the ipod is, of course, gone as is my blackberry phone charger (wtf?) and, worst of all, my fucking cheap sunglasses that i’ve had for five years or so and love.  see that picture of me in the banner?  those are the sunglasses that they took.
i filed a police report, mentioning that there’s actually blood in the car on the door, the radio, and on the trunk (yeah, they looked through there too), but the cops never even came outside to look at my car, which sort of pissed me off.  i get that it’s a small crime, but shouldn’t they do something about it?
so, now i need to get the window replaced (1:30 appointment today to do so), buy a new ipod and fm transmitter, and find a new fucking pair of sunglasses which will be impossible since i can never find sunglasses dark enough.  i’m guessing that will cost about $600.  bah.  maybe christine’s idea of a new ipod fund for me will take off or something.  the timing on this sucks even worse since i got hit by some lady a few weeks ago and have a $375 estimate on the work.  yay for needing to spend like $1,000 on my car.  :-p

amazon price watch
if you’re anything like me, you spend a large chunk of your money at amazon.  most of the stuff that i buy online comes from here and it’s not unusual for me to have several packages delivered from there within a week (i should really buck up and get amazon prime, but i hate to pay for shipping).
while some of you may know that amazon does a pre-order price guarantee, did you know that they do a post-order price guarantee as well?
what this means is if price of an item you ordered in the last thirty days goes down, they’ll refund you the difference.  i’ve already made about $5.00 this week since immortal beloved and sting’s songs from the labyrinth both have dropped in price since i bought them about a week ago.
i’ve been meaning to see if there’s a way to set up an rss feed or something to track changes on individual items, but it keeps slipping my mind.  however, i was thinking about this tonight, so i figured i ought to do a search first and see if anyone has something like this already made.
sure enough, there’s a site - amazon price watch - that allows you to enter up to four items at a time in a form.  then, for the next two months you’ll receive an e-mail notifying you of any changes to the item’s price.  that means that not only is this a great way to watch for any money due you on already purchased items, but it will alert you to any sale prices on items you want to buy.  from now on, any items i purchase will be automatically added here so i can keep an eye on their prices.
i hope this helps others as much as i bet it’s going to help me!

you can add items to your cart and then click "save for later" and every time you go into your cart it'll tell you if the price changes.
it's great for items you're just not sure if you want to buy and then you see it drops in price...

kymberlie's collections
a few weeks ago i blogged that i was coveting collectorz.com’s special bundle which i went ahead and bought after thinking about it for a day or two.
last week the scanner came in, so i after an initial problem with some movies not loading into the scanner properly, within a couple of hours i’d scanned about 320 movies (and manually entered about twenty movies that had the bar code covered by stickers) and created this site.  pretty slick, huh?
i’ve got about thirty or forty dvds at ben’s house that i need to pick up and scan and i’m missing about another dozen movies or so (arsenic and old lace, the day after tomorrow, shrek, the evil dead 2, etc.) which is driving me nuts, but except for any new movies i purchase, you can see my full movie collection, here, which is currently 341 movies.
i needed some help to figure out how to edit their scripts so that my own amazon associates id was used, but now when you click through to one of the detail pages (like this one), any thing purchased through there will generate me a referral fee.  feel free to make your amazon purchases through there.  ;-)
i also scanned one book shelf of my books and ended up with this collection of 144 books.  it’s mostly the ones that i’ve purchased over the last six months or so and still need to read, so this is far from complete.  if i had to guess, i’d say that i probably have around 500 or 600 paperbacks.
i’ve also got the software for cds, but i really wanted to get the movies and my recently purchased books scanned, so that’s a project for another day.  i’ve got this page - kymberlie’s collections - set up as an index for these sites, so i’m sure once i start scanning cds, they’ll end up there as well.
so, i’d definitely have to say that the scanner and the software was well worth the $200 i spent.  the only thing i would really like to see different is some better documentation for their templates since right now i’m having a hard time bending them to my will.

firefly: gold deal box of the day
i didn’t start watching firefly until it was cancelled, but i rented the show, became a huge fan, and promptly bought them from amazon.
while a lot of the amazon gold box deals are kind of lame, today’s deal is the complete series of firefly on sale for only $19.99!
i know these deals sale out, so if you were planning on ever adding this to your movie collection, now’s the time!

harry potter and the deathly hallows
i can’t believe i haven’t mentioned this yet, but i am beyond excited for the next - and final - harry potter book, harry potter and the deathly hallows.
i’ve loved all the books since i read harry potter and the sorcerer’s stone back in late 1997 or 1998.  i remember finishing it on my lunch hour in the kentucky fried chicken that was very close to my office and wanting to cry, it was such an amazing book.
while i didn’t love the fifth book, harry potter and the order of the phoenix, as much i’m planning to go back and reread it (or at least most of it) before starting harry potter and the deathly hallows.
however, at least part of the reason that i was blogging this was to let people know that amazon is offering a free $5 promotional gift certificate to spend in the store if you pre-order harry potter and the deathly hallows before july 20, 2007.
since they also offer a pre-order guarantee where price decreases between your order time and release date, you’ll receive the lowest price, you can’t really lose out from ordering from them.  plus, select standard shipping, you’re guaranteed the book on its release date or it’s free. i actually didn’t choose this option last year, but ended up getting my book anyway.
what are you waiting for? go place your pre-order!

thanks, stephen!
a nice guy named stephen from dorval, quebec sent me a book off my wishlist, claimed by shadow by karen chance.
i’m assuming that this was a birthday present, but since i don’t know who you are (or i’m not associating your online persona with your real name), i just wanted to say thank you!
i just finished the first book in the series, touch the dark, a few weeks ago. i really enjoyed reading it and was thinking to myself that i needed to see if the new one was out, so this was definitely a pleasant surprise.
again, thank you, stephen!

it's my birthday, bitches!*
i thought that st. patrick’s day was going to be kind of mellow at least for the first part.  i went to bed at about 5:00 am (i spent a lot of time reading, taking a bath, watching movies on tbs, and just generally fucking around), so i didn’t get up until around 2:00 this afternoon.
i had just heated up some pizza and was watching major league (i love that movie) when foxy called.  the conversation went something like this:
her: “guess who’s going to the rodeo with me and shelly tonight to see brooks & dunn?"
me: “i don’t know.  who?”
her: “you!”
a friend of ours is on the rodeo committee and was able to get a bunch of awesome seats to the show, so i got to go along with them.
i hadn’t been to the rodeo in about two years (the houston livestock show and rodeo is the biggest rodeo in the world) and was supposed to go on tuesday to see rascal flatts, but the lead singer had bronchitis, so the show was cancelled.  the weather really sucked that day and ben wasn’t feeling well (which meant i would have had to sit alone), so it wasn’t a big deal, but shelly and foxy have been to like six shows this year and were always talking about it, so i kind of wanted to go.
the rodeo was fun.  my favorite part - aside from the concert - was the calf scramble where twenty-eight kids race to get calves to raise the next year for the show (all animals sold at the show raise scholarship money).  one girl had the last calf and had him roped and almost in the ring when he got loose and another boy got him.  i felt so bad for her since she had really wrestled with that calf, but they announced later that since she had worked so hard, she was going to get a cow of her own anyway.  it totally made me happy.
brooks & dunn were awesome, though they didn’t play “you’re going to miss me when i’m gone,” which is just about my favorite song of theirs.  i’ve been a fan for years and saw them back in 1992 or 1993 when martina mcbride opened for them, but i didn’t realize until how awesome ronnie dunn’s voice is until last night.  it’s easy to sound good on the radio, but much harder to sound good live in front of almost 75,000 people.
after the rodeo, we went to sherlock’s on westheimer to hear my brother russell’s band adrenaline play.  they’re really good, doing mostly covers, but they’re recording some originals now, which you can hear on their myspace page.  it’s really good.
after we left there, satyajit had texted us to see where we were, so we went and met him and lambo at 59 diner for some food.  i love 59 dinner and was so happy when it went to being open 24/7.  the nice waitress emily even comped my oreo shake since it was my birthday and satyajit paid for all of our meals.  it was a great time and we laughed at everything.  omg.  it was so much fun.
so, it’s a few hours until my birthday dinner at lupe tortilla (mmmmm) and i am so excited.  i love birthdays!  yay!
* quote from shelly when we went to new orleans this year for new year’s/her birthday.  i’m supposed to say this at least twenty-five times today.

random stuff since i haven't blogged in forever...
i can’t believe i haven’t blogged for like two and half months.  i have no idea why, except work has been so busy lately, so i might be burned out on blogs by the end of the day.  ;-)
so, here’s some random stuff:
i finally - for the first time ever - bought a cell phone.  it’s not that i haven’t had one for the last eight years or so, but my first one was a christmas gift and my second one i got through a marketing program and they left the service on for three years for free to boot.  after seeing that most of my minutes are spent talking to ben, i switched to t-mobile’s myfaves plan and bought a blackberry pearl.  i absolutely adore it.  it’s so shiny and pretty and new.  i’ve named her josephine.
i spent a bajillion hours playing fairy godmother tycoon.  that game was absolutely addicting.  it needs more levels, though, since i’m already done with it.
i’ve been reading a lot (well, i always read a lot, but i digress) and i’ve read some great books lately - pompeii, touch the dark, the secret life of bees, you suck: a love story, and more.  i list all the books i’ve read the last few months in my sidebar, but my all consuming profile has everything i’ve read over the last few years in case you ever want to check out my reading list.
this week a post i wrote for everything typepad went live.  i actually wrote this post too, our first in a series highlighting the typepad knowledge base, but since i didn’t blog about it then, i’m blogging about it now.  ;-)  it’s always so surreal to have something that i wrote up on an official six apart blog.
red, my camera that i’ve had for about four years, has got a dirty sensor that’s going to cost about $100 to repair, so i bought a sony cybershot dsc-h5 today.  it’s 7.2 megapixels, has an image stabilization feature, and looks cool.  it’s essentially an updated version of red which i love, so hopefully this camera will be just as awesome.
cindy came in from canada for my birthday party last weekend and it was amazing to get to see her again.  when you count mac and don, she’s the third out of town blogger i’ve seen in just a few weeks.
there was more stuff that i wanted to say, but everything else has totally slipped my mind.
dude, i can’t believe my birthday’s sunday!
