about us
waynesburg long term
greenbriar treatment center now offers long term residential options at our location in waynesburg, pa.  long term residential treatment used to be referred to as a 3c program.  if you, or someone you know has an alcohol or drug addiction problem and experienced severe social, financial, occupational, and/or educational problems, let us help. greenbriarâs long term residential program utilizes individual and group therapy covering social, occupational, financial, and educational symptoms while simultaneously helping our patients overcome addiction.
the long term residential program focuses on promoting self-care with the goal to permanently improve daily living and re-integration into society. the length of stay (los) for this program is up to 100 days. this longer length of stay allows patients to establish a solid foundation for greater success when they re-enter back into their everyday life. our ultimate goal for the long term residential program is habilitation â learning new skills to support a sober way of life. patients in this program can also use all levels of services offered by the greenbriar treatment center.
the location for the long term residential program is 350 bonar ave, waynesburg, pa 15370.  we are located inside the washington health system greene hospital.

our team
upon admission into the halfway house, each resident is assigned to a greenbriar therapist skilled in the treatment of drug and alcohol addiction and dual disorders. treatment planning from admission to discharge is a combined effort between the resident and his therapist.

the house manager is available on a daily basis to assist with the development of life skills, such as shopping and meal preparation, personal well-being and the overall management of the house.

residents will have the benefit of a full-time psychiatric nurse monday through friday for medication consultation and education. greenbriar treatment centerâs director of psychiatric services will provide treatment and consultation several hours each week and medical doctors will be on site to address any medical concerns.

treatment technicians will round out our 24-hour staff and will bring with them years of recovery experiences to share with the residents, as well as being available to assist them with assignments, offer support and serve as a positive role model for recovery

i am the clinical supervisor at greenbriar treatment centerâs lighthouse for men. we are a six month halfway house for men that have difficulty with not only co-occurring disorders, but also  have challenges with the legal system, family, finding support, and life skills.  i am honored to have the opportunity to lead a skilled, talented, and compassionate team of professionals that excel at exploring and eliminating the barriers that have led to the inability to really practice and succeed in the 12- step program.
