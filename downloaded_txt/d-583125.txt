herbalist apprenticeship program

the ancient practice of herbalism is re-birthing itself as a contemporary healing art, in our homes as well as in hospitals and clinics. herbal medicine, used wisely, is an effective response to many acute and chronic conditions. you will learn specific, practical skills and do much of your work outside with the plants themselves. these programs provide a solid foundation for developing your knowledge and competence as an herbalist, whether you plan to become a practicing herbalist, or simply desire to be better able to care for yourself and your family.

would you like to:grow your practical skills in order to confidently identify, gather, prepare, and use herbal medicine for yourself, your family, and your community?connect to the cyclical mysteries of the earth, moon and stars? feel like you belong here?




















regardless of where you are on your path, if you have found your way here, nature is calling you to come home to being ever more fully alive.the plants are calling you to learn more about them and from them.your inner wisdom wants you to remember who you really are, and that you are already whole.the plants are our elders, teachers, healers and allies.anishinaabeg herbalist keewaydinoquay (woman-of-the-northwest-wind) said, “of all the creatures on earth the plants have remained truest to their original instructions from creator. they give generously of themselves for the wellbeing of all.”i am honored to be called to connect people and plants for the healing of individuals and the benefit of all peoples, the human and the more-than-human beings on our beautiful, beleaguered, and beloved planet earth.



i have been answering that call for over three decades, and am committed to supporting you on your path of becoming you. for i have seen, without exception, that when a person commits to becoming who they truly are, their path becomes clear. mythologist jean houston said: my heart breaks open every time i witness another tragedy or crisis. i have to call on resources i never knew i had and prepare myself to transform the sadness into resolve.whether you meet your own feelings of powerlessness with grief, rage or resignation, we are here to make a difference and the time is now. everything in nature - the plants, the animals, the insects, the stones, the waters, and the winds are ready to guide us. it is only we humans who have forgotten that we are all connected.




















reconnecting to the earth and the mysteries of the cosmos will give you access to resources you may not have known you have. the green ones can help you find and claim your unique path of service to the wider community, in this pivotal time of rapid shifts and profound opportunities for the evolution of our species. they will support you to live a life of loving connectedness, natural magic, and infinite possibility every day.














 the secret of lifethe secret is not hidden.it’s right here.love, and the world cracks open.~ haiku by robin rose


































“i initially purchased this book as an addition to my herbalism library, thinking it would be a great reference book, but i literally ate up every page and read through it like a novel. robin’s combination of medicinal applications, real life stories, and spiritual experiences with the plants (along with beautiful illustrations!) made this the first 400+ page book i read nearly cover to cover. not too heady for the light reader, plenty of scientific facts for the skeptical, and fully engaging for those wishing to immerse themselves in all aspects of plant study.” — c. j.

love notes










"this book is a great compilation of herbal wisdom! it is full of easy "tried and true" recipes, meditations, rituals & instructions that are not typically found in other herbal books currently on the market. a must read for all aspiring herbalists, healers, and those that simply seek directions on how to heal the body, mind and spirit. i have taken courses with robin rose bennett, the author, and know that this comes from the heart." - arlene b.






"we got engaged yesterday. i realize you, and i aren’t super close... however, since i've connected with you my entire life shifted. every day i’m learning to love, and understand plants more and more. right now i’m watering our butterfly and bee garden. a garden i wished for, and this dream came true." - vanessa l. 






"there are no words to describe what a gift this herbal practice has been to me. the herbs helped me to get drug free and moreover to change my attitude about drugs. doctors only prescribe medications to block symptoms, but never get to the cause of the problems. real healing is occurring." - gayle s.






"i've just finished a herbal training program in salt lake city and i feel like i would really like to go deeper into the spiritual medicine of the plants. your program seems perfect, and i've really enjoyed both of your books. you have such a fantastic way of teaching from stories that really helps me to learn. i would be deeply honored to study under you." - michelle taylor






"robin rose bennett is an impeccable teacher who masterfully weaves her in-depth clinical experience with her profound knowing and connection with the natural world. her teaching comes from the heart and feels like a healing balm to receive. robin’s teachings have been an inspiration to me and a joy to share with others." - kathleen m.






"this is the most phenomenal book and has helped so many find wisdom and knowledge by helping to take healing back into our own hands. by learning the wise woman ways of old we realize we have plant medicine all around us growing in own back yards and alleyways. i recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about plant medicine." - lynne m.






“beautiful — thank you for always giving of yourself so fully and with total abandon. miss you, love you… hope to see you soon!!” xoxo - chrissy b.
