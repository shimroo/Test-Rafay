future of the digicamhistory.com camera collection?
when we began the collection many
years ago we naively assumed that a future organization or museum would
be happy to obtain it for our out-of-pocket costs (now about $65k) and
without renumeration for the thousands of hours spent researching and
amassing the collection, especially as the original msrps of the items
in the collection exceeds $1.4 million when adjusted for
inflation.  in actuality, only one museum (located in england) has
shown interest in the collection.  mr.winkleman, who is opening a
digital photography exhibition in south carolina, has given
no indication that he wishes to have a digicam collection as part of
his museum.

since we humans have a limited
lifespan, it will be necessary to eventually find a new home for the
collection or leave it to our heirs who will most likely place it up
for sale piecemeal on ebay thereby negating the years of effort spent
building it, a collection which contains many rare and even unique
items.  if you are aware of any organization that might be
interested in obtaining such a collection for a fraction of its true
cost, please have them contact us.  unlike some others who have
have purchased rare digicams over the years with a profit motive, it
was never our intent to do so, but only to save early model digicams
for the enjoyment of future generations.  all items in the
collection are securely boxed and labeled with the name of the
manufacturer, model number and date of marketing.  individual
cameras in the collection are shown on our site with the yellow icon,
"museum collection".

why stop at 1998?  except
for a few  cameras we purchased after 1998,  this site 
is dedicated to those digicams that came before 1999.  there are
several reasons for this.  the first is that current popular
photography sites such as dp review are not historical sites, thus do
not have a section devoted to the very early digicams, nor to the film
cameras that came before them.  the second reason is that,
beginning about 1998, there was an explosion in the popularity of
digital photography and sites such as dp review have covered all new
digicams of significance since that time.  of course, they do not
cover minor brands or very inexpensive models that are of no interest
to serious historians as some sites do.     


a
word
about dates. 
when known, the
earliest
applicable date is shown.  this is usually the date of
introduction,
announcement, or when the camera first appeared at one of the various
technical
shows.  since any particular digicam took some time to engineer
and prepare even in prototype form, a date of one year prior to an
announcement date is also appropriate in many cases.   dates shown
on other web sites are usually the market
introduction
date in a particular country and sometimes fall into a calendar
year following the date shown on our site.



  camera obscura - 1490. 
leonardo da vinci wrote the first detailed description of camera
obscura in his atlantic codex, a 1,286 page collection of drawings and
writings. the principle of camera obscura involves punching a hole in a
dark box and putting a piece of light-sensitive material on the other
side thereby providing a photo-like image, but upside down. the first picture of a pinhole
camera obscura is a drawing by gemma frisus' de radio, an astronomer
(above left). he used the pinhole in his darkened room to
study the solar eclipse of 1544. viist the web site of stewart lewis
woodruff at users.rcn.com/ stewoody/quote.htm  and learn how to build and use pinhole cameras (camera obscuras).

1800s


first
permanent camera photographs - 1825-26. 
photographic history has recently been rewritten following the
discovery
of what is now considered to be the world's oldest photograph. 
the
image, a reproduction of a 17th century dutch print, predates by one
year
frenchman niepce's previous heliogravure of the
view from his window at le gras, regarded until now as the earliest
surviving
photographic image.

in
the early 1800s, joseph nicephore niepce experimented with lithography
at his home near chalon, france.  nicephore explored
light-sensitive
varnishes, trying to find a coating that would record drawings after
exposure
to light.  in 1816, he took photos using a camera and paper
sensitized
with silver chloride.  he had some success, but was dissatisfied
because
the images were reversed (negatives) and could not be made
permanent. 
he had tried to produce a positive print, but was unable to do
so. 
he did find that nitric acid helped to preserve images for a while, but
would not prevent eventual fading.  niepce's breakthrough came in
1822 when he made a permanent image using a camera obscura.  after
exposing coated pewter plates to a camera image, he used the vapors
from
heated iodine crystals to darken the silver and heighten
contrast. 
the method would later inspire louis daguerre's successful mercury
vapor
development process.  within a few years the two inventors would
become
partners.  niepce was able to produce a copy of an engraving by
passing
light through the original photo onto a piece of glass coated with
bitumen
of judea, a type of asphalt.  light hardens bitumen of judea, so
when
niepce washed the plate with solvent only the unexposed portions were
removed,
leaving a permanent image on the plate.  he named this process heliography
or sun-writing.  he made numerous heliographs
during
the next
several
years and continued his attempts to produce a permanent camera
image. 
in 1825, he was successful.

 
oldest
known photos, 1825 and 1826.  click on images for enlarged views.

the
first image is a reproduction of a 17th century dutch engraving showing
a man leading a horse.  the photograph was sold at sotheby's in
paris
on march 21, 2002, to the french national library for  $443,000.  the niepce correspondence that
accompanied
the print gave a step-by-step account of how niepce made his
discovery.
the print is the only surviving testament to niepce's
achievement
in the summer of 1825 using light alone to make a plate from which an
image
could be printed.

the
world's second oldest known permanent camera image, bitumen on pewter,
is a view taken from niepce's second floor window.  the exposure
took
approximately eight hours.  the third image was reportedly also
made
in 1826.

william henry fox talbot first negative - 1835.  
the inventor of calotype process, the precursor to most photographic
processes of the 19th and 20th centuries. he was also a noted
photographer who made major contributions to the development of
photography as an artistic medium. his work in the 1850s on
photo-mechanical reproduction led to the creation of the photoglyphic
engraving process, the precursor to photogravure. talbot is also
remembered as the holder of a patent which, some say, affected the
early development of commercial photography in britain. 
talbot's original contributions included the concept
of a negative from which many positive prints can be made (although the
terms negative and positive were coined by herschel).   talbot's
negative/positive process eventually succeeded as the basis for almost
all 19th and 20th century photography. the daguerreotype, although
stunningly beautiful, was rarely used by photographers after 1860, and
had died as a commercial process by 1865. 
the photograph on the left is of talbot in 1864 by
john moffat. the photo on the right is a print from a talbot negative,
the oldest known negative in existence.

alexander s. wolcott - first photography patent - 1840. 
alexander simon wilcott was born in 1804, in new york.  he was a dentist
by trade and machinist.  on may 8, 1840 alexander wolcott, with the
assistance of john johnson
sr., received the first american patent for photography (us patent no.
1582) for their daguerreotype mirror camera, which did not have a lens.
the camera was based on a concave reflecting mirror built by an
associate mr henry fitz, similar to those used for making celestial
telescopes. the wolcott & johnson patent camera enabled the
successful taking of life portraiture by significantly reducing the
subjects sitting time from 30 minutes to only 5 minutes, while still
using daguerre's chemical formula. mr johnson sr. paid daguerre 150
pounds for the use of his process.  wolcott and johnson patented the camera which became known as
"wolcott's camera" and the "mirror camera".  in march 1840, they opened what is
considered to be the world's first portrait studio. it was called the
daguerreian parlor.  wolcott died at the age of 40.

first photographs of the moon, female face, people - 1839-40. 
daguerre himself is believed to be the first person to take a
photograph of the moon, using his daguerreotype process, on january 2,
1839. unfortunately, in march of that same year, his entire laboratory
burnt to the ground, destroying all his written records and much of his
early experimental work and that historical image of the moon. a year
later, john william draper, an american doctor and chemist, took his
own daguerreotype of the moon.  john william
draper (1811-1882) was an american scientist, philosopher,
physician, chemist, historian and photographer. he is also credited
with producing the first clear photograph of a female face when
he took a photo of his  sister and assistant, dorothy. 
daguerre is credited with the first photograph of people as seen in the
lower left of the photo above.  in the spring of 1838 louis
daguerre made a photograph of the boulevard du temple in paris.
the long exposure time made everything that was moving vanish from the
frame.  two people, a man having his boots shined and the shiner,
remained still long enough to be recorded in the photo.

first selfie - 1839.
this image is considered to be the first intentional portrait of a
human being. the subject and photographer is robert cornelius, an
american who worked in metal polishing and silver plating. in 1839,
cornelius stood outside of his family's store and made what would be
the first selfie. this photo was the first time a person was
intentionally imaged using light.

bain's
  telegraph - first facsimile (fax) - 1843.  in
  1843, scotsman
  alexander bain patented a design for a mechanical device which used a
  stylus
  attached to an electromagnetic pendulum to send typed words over a
  telegraph
  line.  the first commercial fax service was opened between paris
  and
  lyon, france, in 1865.  popularity of facsimile machines increased
  significantly in 1906 and thereafter when they were employed for
  transmitting
  newspaper photos.  for many interesting photographs and a complete

ponti
megaletoscopio -
1859. 
the interesting device, built by carlo ponti, allowed the owner to view
his photographs in black and white in the daytime and in color at
night. this was accomplished by coloring the back of photographs and
then viewing them when lit from behind during darkness (one wonders why
they didn't just color the front of the photographs rather than build
such and elaborate device). the model shown is unique in that almost
all other similar models made by ponti were of plain design while the
above model was inlaid with ivory as was the photo storage stand. this
model was in the thurman naylor collection and on 19 october 2007 was
auctioned off for $42,500.

first
color photo - 1861.  the first known color photograph was produced in
1861 by thimas sutton, an english photographer and inventor. the photo
was made by stacking three black and white images which were themselves
each exposed using red, green, and blue filters. the image could then
be viewed in coloras a superimposition from three separate projectors
which each used a corresponding green, red, or blue filter.  this method was first described by james clerk maxwell.

paul
nipkow - 1884.  nipkow, a german
inventor,
developed and patented the world's first electromechanical television
system,
however, he had no method of amplifying the very weak signals (produced
by a selenium cell) needed to build a workable receiver.  nipkow
used
a rotating disk to send pictures over a wire in 1884.  this early
idea of "cable television" was abandoned as impractical since the
receiving
screen couldn't be any bigger than one square inch!  additional

eastman coined the slogan, 'you press the button, we do the rest,' when
he introduced the kodak camera in 1888 and within a year it became a
well-known phrase.  he designed and patented the camera in 1886. it
was a box-box with a roller cassette designed for 48 (100 when it went
on sale) negatives of 4 x 5 inches format, with a focusing
optics.  after several improvements, in 1888 george eastman
released the revolutionary amateur camera kodak number 1. the
camera lens transmitted a circular image of 2.25 inches in diameter
onto the film (1888 photo, girl on a couch).  at $25 it was much
cheaper than other cameras of the time. after the film was full, the
buyer mailed the device along with the roller to eastman company in
rochester, new york, where the film was taken out, developed, printed,
and the device was recharged, for which the client paid $ 10.

boutan-chauffour
flash bulb - 1893.  the first flash
bulb
was designed by frenchman chauffour for use by underwater photographer
louis boutan.  it contained magnesium inside a glass bulb filled
with
oxygen under pressure.  a platinum wire heated by passing an
electric
current through it ignited the magnesium.  additional information
concerning louis boutan can be found at:

the
cathode ray tube (crt) - 1897.  
electronic television is based on the development of the cathode ray
tube
(the picture tube found in television sets until led came along).  cathode rays
were first identified in 1859 by julius plucker, a german mathematician
and physicist, but it was not until 1878 before william crookes, a
british
chemist, would confirm the existence of cathode rays by building a tube
that displayed them.  english physicist ambrose flemming, working
with crookes' tube, would discover that cathode rays could be deflected
and focused.  this was accomplished by wrapping the tube with wire
and passing an electric current through it creating a magnetic
field. 
in 1897, german physicist karl braun developed the first cathode ray
oscilloscope. 
braun illuminated the cathode rays by placing fluorescent materials at
the end of the tube.  as time passed these developments would be
applied
to the scanning system for the first television sets.  additional
information
concerning the cathode ray tube can be found at:

poulsen
telegraphone - 1898.  on december 1st
1898, valdemar poulsen filed a patent in denmark for the telegraphone,
the first device in history to use magnetic sound recording.  an
extract
from his patent reads: "the invention based upon the fact that when a
body
made of magnetisable material is touched at different points and at
different
times by an electromagnet included in a telephonic or telegraphic
circuit,
its parts are subject to such varied magnetic influences that
conversely
by the action of the magnetisable body upon the electromagnet the same
sounds or signals are subsequently given out in the telephone or
recording
instrument as those which previously caused the magnetic action upon
the
magnetisable body."  at the 1900 paris exposition poulsen recorded
the voice of emperor franz joseph, creating what is believed to be the
earliest surviving magnetic recording.  additional information
concerning
valdemar poulsen can be found at:
