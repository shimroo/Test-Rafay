resilience & resourcefulness for birth






































for over 20 years, parents and professionals have trusted birthing from within to prepare them for the transformational experience of birth. 






































this is because we know that preparing for birth involves more than data and techniques. our childbirth educators and doulas address the deeper needs of birthing families… …and our trainings address the deeper needs of birth professionals……by guiding them to unlock their inner knowing and access maps for coping with whatever birth brings.

we are committed to listening to and elevating the voices and lived experiences of black, indigenous, people of color, disabled, and lgbtq+ birth professionals as a means to help end systemic oppression in perinatal care.

“birthing from within offers such a powerful set of approaches to help people tap into their intuitive selves as they become parents.”




“this training has given me the framework i need to bring my truest self to birth work, so i can work with parents on a deeper level through the transformative process of giving birth.”














sign up below to receive a free six page guide and introduction to labyrinth meditation. 



we use the labyrinth as a metaphor for the transformative ordeal of birth, which requires us to step into the unknown and into enormous physical and psychological intensity.



unlike a maze, a labyrinth has only one path in and out, which means that there are no wrong turns – as long as you keep going, you’ll reach the center, and as long as you keep going, you’ll emerge again.




the labyrinth is an ancient, universal tool for self-reflection, inner exploration, and navigating transformative experiences.
