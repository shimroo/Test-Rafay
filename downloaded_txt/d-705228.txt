these are some questions we have asked ourselves:
do we understand that we have no real control over drugs?do we recognize that in the long run, we didn’t use drugs—they used us?did jails and institutions take over the management of our lives at different times?do we fully accept the fact that our every attempt to stop using or to control our using failed?do we know that our addiction changed us into someone we didn’t want to be: dishonest, deceitful, self-willed people at odds with ourselves and our fellow man?do we really believe that we have failed as drug users?
