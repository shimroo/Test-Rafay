how to donate to mesothelioma research
mesothelioma is a type of lung cancer that currently doesn't have a cure, nor are there many effective treatment options available today. however, doctors are working on new therapies to provide better options to treat this disease in the future.
donate to the mesothelioma research foundation of america
the mesothelioma research foundation of america has funded the opening of the mesothelioma laboratory in california. dr. gill supervises the research facility, and he has already gotten the green light to begin clinical trials on a new medication called veglin. these trials have gone well. this promising development gives researchers hope that mesothelioma may be conquered soon.
why consider donating to this organization? this foundation already has their operating expenses funded. many volunteers also donate their time. this means that your donation will only be used to pay for cancer research. you can visit the organization's website at mesorfa.org to make a donation.
types of donations: 
 gifts in memory: donors can make gifts in honor of a loved one who has passed away. gifts in honor: you might make a gift to commemorate a special event or anniversary. general donations; of course, you can simply make a donation because you want to help find a cure for this dreadful form of cancer.
the organization also accepts donations by phone and by check. you can also donate an old vehicle or boat. typically, cash or asset donations can be deducted from income taxes too.

malignant mesothelioma
	malignant mesothelioma is a very rare form of cancer that forms from the protective lining of the body’s internal organs. the primary cause is exposure to asbestos. as the mesothelium is attacked, doctors divide malignant mesothelioma into four types depending on its location. 	pleural mesothelioma is the first type as this is where tumors form in the pleura or abdomen. the pleuron is the membrane that lines the lungs and chest cavity. it is important to point out that pleural mesothelioma is different than lung cancer because it solely effects the pleura while lung cancer originates in the lungs.	the second type is peritoneal mesothelioma. this is where the cancer attacks the lining of the abdomen. in the abdomen, there is a fluid that allows organs to work properly. mesothelioma simply destroys this fluid. the third type is pericardial mesothelioma, this is where the protective membranes surrounding the heart are attacked. luckily, this is the second rarest form of mesothelioma.	the last malignant mesothelioma type is testicular mesothelioma. this is the rarest form of the cancer and develops in the areas that surround the testicles.

benign mesothelioma information
mesothelioma is also known as fibrous or multicystic mesothelioma and is categorized as a non-cancerous tumor that inside the pleura, the lining around and in the lungs. benign mesothelioma is not related to asbestos cancer. the pleura are composed of cells known as mesothelial cells, which prevent the lungs and other organs from rubbing together by secreting a liquid substance. with benign mesothelioma, there is no pleura effusion production. it develops in the lungs more frequently than in the stomach, reproductive tissues, and heart and occurs more in men than it occurs in women it. the most important difference between the cancerous form of mesothelioma and the benign form is that with the benign form, tumors do not spread to the other tissues in the body. both the benign and malignant tumors are a result of asbestos exposure. this happens when airborne asbestos fibers travel and reach the linings of the lungs and while there cause cell damage in the lining resulting in abnormal cell growth. who is at risk?•	workers in occupations where asbestos is used or produced•	exposure to fertilizers and pesticides that contain vermiculite•	 drinking of contaminated water•	living with a person who brings asbestos home on their clothing
at least 50% of those affected with benign mesothelioma do not even know they have it and is usually made aware of the disease through things such as x-rays. those who do have symptoms can experience;•	chronic coughing•	chest pain•	fever• the most common symptom, clubbed fingers.in papillary mesothelioma other areas not affected by most forms of mesothelioma are sometimes affected here. this includes areas such as the membrane covering the sides and front of the epidedymis and testicles in men and the ovaries in women.

mesothelioma facts by diane quin
mesothelioma is a malignant disease that grows on the sac lining of internal body cavities, known as the mesothelium. the mesothelium is composed of two membranesã¢â¬”one that protects most internal organs of the body, and the other which forms a sac around that layer. 
there are different types of mesothelioma, which are named for the tissue where the tumors originated. pleural mesothelioma appears in the chestã¢â¬”in the pleura (outer lining) that surrounds the lungs and lining of the chest cavity. peritonal mesothelioma starts in the lining of most organs in the abdominal cavity. 
mesothelioma, which is cancer of the mesothelium, is a malignant disease causing cells of the mesothelium to become abnormal and uncontrollably divide. as with other types of cancers, these malignant cells may cause damage to nearby tissues and organs. these cells may also metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body.
these mesothelioma facts may help you to gain further understanding of the disease:
1. working with asbestos is a risk factor for mesothelioma. once widely used in industrial products including roof shingles, flooring products, textiles, and insulation, asbestos exposure is an unfortunate circumstance of many job conditions if it is inhaled.
2. according to the national cancer institute, mesothelioma is relatively rare, with 2,000 cases diagnosed in the united states.
3. symptoms include shortness of breath, a dry cough, fever, abdominal swelling, and pain under the rib cage. these may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

mesothelioma cancers
mesothelioma cancers occur when the lining of the lungs, heart or abdomen are affected by asbestos. this cancer can only be malignant or benign. however, if a benign form of mesothelioma occurs, one can still become very sick. if benign it can be localized but if malignant, it will diffusely spread. 	it is important to point out that malignant mesothelioma is a rare form of cancer. the victims are those who are exposed on a consistent basis to vast amounts of asbestos. it develops when the protective lining that covers the body’s internal organs are exposed by asbestos. it typically results in a tumor in either the chest or abdomen and is typically caused by the ingestion of asbestos particles.	even though meothelioma is rare it is almost always fatal. this is because of the extreme negative impact it has on the lining around the lungs and inside of the ribs in the section referred to as the pleura. it also affects the peritoneum of the body which is around the abdominal organs. asbestos should be avoided on all levels.
