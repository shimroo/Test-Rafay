  all the photos    over 300 photos, large and small. this is a directory with the names of the photos as a filename. look at the sizes of the various photos. you will notice that the photos with the "-sm" which means small, are quite small viewing photo sizes. the originals with the same name are usually between .5  and 1.5 megabytes big. download the large one if you want a really nice 8x10 print of it. they are very high resolution. but if you just want to browse the photos and see everybody and everything, only click on the "-sm" photos since they are small and quickly downloaded.

 10 questions for m.d. smith, iv  - terry heaton's donatacom.com on-line interview with mds iv on february 25, 2005. terry said in his intro: "the bottom line tv people of today don't have a clue about any of that, of course. and i suppose they'd call a guy like m.d. "foolish" or "eccentric." but m.d. smith iv grew up in broadcasting and understood it like few others. it was his life."
