students on bench



a rewarding education by every measure.
uam students benefit from experienced professors, developing a broad knowledge of
                              the world as well as a deeper understanding of their chosen field. little surprise
                              then that so many uam alumni get accepted to graduate programs and recruited by employers
                              around the country.

testimonials


“i chose uam because of the baseball coaching staff here. i knew what the culture of
                              the athletics was like – it’s more than just winning; it’s about learning, growing
                              and being better people.”

haley smith
junior, criminal justice major and creative writing minor


“i chose uam because it was a fresh start. i met my lifelong friends and i also created
                              a foundation for my graduate studies and professional career. as a student, i met
                              professors that simply became role models and mentors by teaching us to reach our
                              goals.”

daniela delgado
class of 2020, political science major


“i chose uam for many reasons – it’s close to home, there were many academic opportunities
                              available, and it has a great atmosphere. plus, it’s full of amazing people and beautiful
