each year the mascot roller mills and ressler family home welcomes more than 12,000 visitors to this historic site nestled in the heart of a thriving amish community in eastern lancaster county. the remarkably preserved water-powered grain mill sends visitors back in time to learn about milling history along the banks of scenic mill creek.

the adjacent 1855 miller’s house, once home to three generations of resslers, offers a charming look at early 20th century housekeeping and family life. the home is preserved just as it was when siblings franklin and anna ressler offered their neighbors the finest flour, along with neighborly hospitality.
we invite you to visit us and journey back to a simpler time when milling was a staple of the lancaster county farming community.
