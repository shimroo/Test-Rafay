we have asked our eapa representatives;  what will be the next major innovation drivers for the industry?



 “ “we have to reduce co2 emissions and the asphalt industry shall play an important role in that fundamental change. it will demand hard work and creative thinking in the whole chain – from raw materials overproduction to re-use. roads are a basic requirement for cars and when they come to run on clean electricity, the industry becomes a valuable part of the green future.” anders hundahleapa directors' group ceo, dapa, danish asphalt pavement association
