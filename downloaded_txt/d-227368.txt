some things to consider...





what has your website done for you?





is your website the âsilent salesmanâ it could and should be?

 many businesses have had their websites created years ago and they just sit there providing no business advantage at all.
 you should be able to have potential customers find your website and all of the information that they seek  to help you close the sale.
 a poorly-maintained or -designed website impedes the flow needed to move around your website causing visitor frustration and leaving your website without getting the information they sought.






ask yourself these questions...






are you embarrassed to send people to your website?
 can your website close sales by itself?
 is your website an integral part of your sales force and marketing?
 does your website draw in new prospects?
 has your website been updated  to accommodate the changes and benefits your company offers?

 in many cases, the website and the internet have become the only cost-effective method to create sales. people depend on going to a website to learn about you and the things they are interested in, at their convenience.





we can help!





graphic studio will balance all factors to meet your objectives. we will create or refine your website that will work because we take the time to understand your business, your visitors, and what makes them decide to buy. your website has to be designed for your visitors, and weâll show you how to look at your business from their perspective.
 an important aspect of your website is that it be kept up-to-date. we  provide a maintenance program that allows you to simply email revisions, modifications, or new content for a 24-hour turnaround in updating your website so that changes are made immediately.
 simple: it all starts with a conversation, so why not contact us today to find out what we can do for your business. an initial, free consultation over coffee is usually all thatâs required to determine if we are right for each other.





we will make your website accountable!





we will show you...

how to read website statistics
 how many visits your site gets each day, week, month, year, or even hour
 how visitors got to your site â how your website is being found â or not!
 what pages are viewed the most â and the least!
 which search engine, key-phrases and keywords are used to find your site
 how long visitors stay on your site

 unlike conventional advertising, you will always know how well your website is working and what areas may need modification to bring more interest and keep you in control!





looking for bells & whistles?





you wonât find them here! while some may be entertaining, it adds little to the purpose people visit websites in the first place â to get information. in fact, depending on how such flash and html5 javascript animation are used, it could work against you by taking your visitors away from their goal and/or denying your listings in search engines! (read more).
 ours is a no-nonsense approach to web design: disseminating information professionally, quickly, and succinctly. weâre all busy and in this fast-paced want-it-now-world, we only have a few seconds to tell our story. good web design will bring your story to those who are seeking the products or services you offer.
 a well-defined web design is essential in todayâs marketing and advertising effort â its purpose should be clear and focused. just having a âweb presenceâ will only allow your competition to make advances but good web design provides an unprecedented and inexpensive medium for immediate dissemination of the latest happenings within your industry and your company specifically.
