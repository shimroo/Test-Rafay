mortgage rate news this week - feb. 13, 2025
mortgage rates rise slightly
mortgage rates edged up this week, with 30-year fixed-rate loans averaging 7.03 percent, according to bankrate’s latest lender survey.
hopes for lower mortgage rates took a blow on wednesday when the labor department said inflation is back up to 3 percent. stubbornly high inflation boosts the odds that rates remain higher for longer. the federal reserve announced no change to its benchmark federal funds rate at its first meeting of 2025, coming off three consecutive rate cuts that started in september.
even the long-awaited fed cuts didn’t play out as expected. when the central bank first started cutting, housing economists fully expected the fed’s policy to bring back sub-6 percent mortgage rates. instead, 30-year rates are hovering around 7 percent. despite the fed's decision to hold rates steady, it does not control the direction of mortgage rates — that influence comes mostly 10-year treasury bond yields.

"i expect mortgage rates to increase. today's cpi report showed inflation increased more than expected last month. this has led to a jump in the 10-year treasury yield and will likely delay future fed rate cuts." - feb. 12








michael beckers
branch manager, sierra pacific mortgage




"today’s cpi report showed inflation accelerating in january, both at the headline and core levels. this is not something those wanting lower mortgage rates wanted to see. we won’t know for several months whether this is a new trend in inflation or if this was a one-off report. arguments could be made for both. but for the next week, mortgage rates will be higher because of this report." - feb. 12

how to compare mortgage rates
getting the best possible rate on your mortgage can make a big difference in your monthly budget — not to mention potentially thousands saved in interest over the life of the loan. you won’t know what rates you qualify for, though, unless you narrow down the best type of mortgage for your situation and comparison-shop. here’s how to do it:

decide on the right type of mortgage. consider your credit score and down payment, how long you plan to stay in the home, how much you can afford in monthly payments and whether you have the risk tolerance for a variable-rate loan versus a fixed-rate loan. our mortgage calculator can help you estimate your monthly mortgage payment in various scenarios.
shop around. mortgage rates change often and vary widely by lender, loan type and term. when comparing lenders, pay attention to the apr, not just the interest rate. the apr, or annual percentage rate, reflects the total cost of the loan, including the interest rate and other fees.
see what others have to say. check out our mortgage lender reviews and other testimonials to uncover the lenders with attractive rates and top-notch customer experience.

    why compare mortgage rates?
    


it’s been proven: shopping with multiple lenders can save you up to $1,200 a year. our mortgage amortization calculator shows how even a 0.1 percent difference on your rate can translate to thousands of dollars spent or saved over the life of a mortgage.







factors that determine your mortgage rate
your mortgage rate depends on a number of factors, including your individual credit profile and what’s happening in the broader economy. these variables include:

your credit and finances: the better your credit score, the better interest rate you’ll get. the same goes for the size of your down payment and the amount of debt you carry: generally, if you have more money to put down, you’ll get a lower rate. if you have additional debt, your rate might be higher.
loan amount: the size of your loan can impact your rate.
loan structure: your rate varies whether you’re obtaining a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loan. it also depends on the length of the loan (for example, 30 years or 15 years).
location of the property: rates vary depending on where you’re buying.
whether you’re a first-time homebuyer: many first-time homebuyer loan programs include a lower-rate mortgage.
economic factors: broadly, mortgage rates are impacted by forces like the federal reserve, inflation and investor appetite.
the lender you work with: lenders set rates based on many factors, including their own supply and demand.
mortgage points. mortgage points, also referred to as discount points, help homebuyers reduce their interest rate and monthly mortgage payments. each point typically lowers an interest rate by 0.25 percentage points. for example, one point would lower a mortgage rate of 6 percent to 5.75 percent. the cost of a point is typically 1 percent of the total amount borrowed. for more details, see bankrate’s guide to mortgage points.
the size of your down payment. if you put down less than 20 percent of the purchase amount, you may pay a higher rate.

how to compare mortgage offers



how does the federal reserve affect mortgage rates?
like any other financial product, the cost of a mortgage fluctuates with the happenings of the economy, including federal reserve decisions. the central bank doesn’t set specific mortgage rates, but its policies set the tone for what banks and other lenders charge for loans.

how the fed impacts mortgage rates




how to refinance your current mortgage

as interest rates fall, you might choose to refinance your mortgage to a new loan at a lower rate. the process isn’t much different from your original mortgage application, and you’ll likely pay less in closing costs this time around compared to when you first bought a home.
while most borrowers today have mortgages with already-low rates, there are still some instances when refinancing might make sense — especially with rates expected to trend down in the next year or two. if you’re considering refinancing, think about your goals. do you want to save money? take cash out? pay off your mortgage faster? get a fixed rate? borrowers refinance for these and many other reasons. compare refinance rates and do the math with our refinance calculator.

what is a mortgage and how does it work?


caret down icon 




a mortgage is a loan from a bank or other financial institution that helps a borrower purchase a home. the collateral for the mortgage is the home itself. that means if the borrower doesn’t make monthly payments to the lender and defaults on the loan, the lender can sell the home and recoup its money. a mortgage loan is typically a long-term debt taken out for 30, 20 or 15 years. over this time (known as the loan’s “term”), you’ll repay both the amount you borrowed as well as the interest charged for the loan.

should you lock in your mortgage rate?


caret down icon 




a mortgage rate lock guarantees (with a few exceptions) that the interest rate offered to you will remain available for a set period of time. with a lock, you won’t have to worry if market rates go up between the time you find a home, submit an offer and close. most lenders offer a 30- to 45-day rate lock free of charge. often, you’ll need to pay a fee to extend the lock period. some lenders also offer a “float down” option, which allows you to lower your locked rate if prevailing rates fall — though you’ll likely have to pay a fee for this perk, too.learn more: what is a mortgage rate lock?

how much are closing costs on a mortgage?


caret down icon 




the closing costs on a mortgage encompass all of the fees associated with the loan, including the lender’s charges, typically an origination fee often equal to 1 percent of the loan principal and optional points. closing costs also include third-party fees like the cost of an appraisal and title insurance. all together, these usually run anywhere from 2 percent to 5 percent of the amount you’re borrowing, above and beyond your down payment.learn more: mortgage closing costs
