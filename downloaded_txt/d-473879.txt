quality assurance







our quality assurance program is your assurance of dependable performance from every fastener you purchase from coburn-myers. here’s how we do it:
vendor qualification:
our reputation — and our business success — depends on the quality of the products we sell. that’s why we insist on impeccable credentials from the manufacturers who supply us. if we are unfamiliar with a manufacturer, our technical staff will conduct an on-site inspection of the factory to ensure that the supplier is capable of meeting our quality standards.
consistent quality:
when a manufacturer’s shipment hits our receiving docks, the quality assurance process continues. shipments are subjected to a physical inspection which weeds out items that fall outside prescribed tolerances, such as thickness and length.
