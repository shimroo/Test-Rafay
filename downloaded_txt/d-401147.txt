physiological chemistry and physics and medical nmr is an open access, peer-reviewed journal publishing recent findings 
      in a broad range of subjects including biophysics, biochemistry, and cellular physiology. manuscripts containing material relevant to both basic science 
      and direct applications to human medicine are invited. 
examples of direct application to human medicine would include studies on conventional mri imaging as it relates to human 
      physiology and disease. article types include original research reports, case studies, and literature reviews. read
