mixminion: a type iii anonymous remailer






mixminion: a type iii anonymous remailer

mixminion is the reference implementation of the type iii anonymous
remailer protocol.


note: mixminion is not under active development,
and probably will not work if you try to use it.  i'd love for somebody
to resurrect mixnet remailer r&d, and have some thoughts on the topic which
i'd be more than happy to share.  mixminion might serve as a good basis for
such an effort.  but for practical use, it is not currently recommended.
it may not build on your system of choice; if it builds, it may not work.
it is not currently supported.  probably only developers, researchers,
and anonymity enthusiasts should be trying it out.  good luck!  â€”nick mathewson, august 2013.

documentation
the design document gives our justifications
and security analysis for the mixminion design:

postscript version
pdf version
latex source
bibtex file
roger's design overview slides (pdf)

the specification aims to give
developers enough information to build a compatible version of mixminion:

part 1: mix protocol specification
part 2: end-to-end encoding and delivery 
part 3: mix directory specifications
addendum: unresolved specification
    issues


draft nymserver specification
  (preliminary version)
draft c client api specification
  (preliminary version)

the manual pages describe how to use the
mixminion command-line interface to run and configure mixminion.  they're
included with the standard unix distribution, and you can also view them

design and anonymous communication in general.
resources
the mixminion-dev mailing list is where
a lot of the discussion
happens. please look
at its archives and consider subscribing. there's also a list for
cvs commits.
i've migrated the code to github
  recently, since cvs is moribund.  have a look
  at the mixminion organization page.
  development is
  still pretty stalled.


you can see current network
  reliability/uptime stats
here and
  here.
we've got quite a few nodes already!
