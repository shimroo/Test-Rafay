a personal 
observation about gripe sites


only after 
you've been sued, or threatened with a lawsuit, for expressing yourself do you 
truly appreciate the precious worth of "free speech."

prior to the advent of the web, most speech could reach only a limited 
audience--family, acquaintances, neighbors. the web has dramatically changed 
that. now, a single voice can reach a potential audience of millions, and those 
who are discussed are painfully aware of it--and may be willing to devote tens 
or hundreds of thousands of dollars in an attempt to silence a voice of 
complaint. 

important precedents have been established in the past few years, with several 
advocacy groups working diligently to preserve free speech rights on the 
internet, of which some would seek to deprive us. the battle is ongoing and 
undoubtedly will continue locally and nationally for years to come.

free speech is a "right" but that doesn't mean somebody else won't challenge it. 
this site was established to promote awareness of consumer issues, free speech 
issues, some of the combatants, and to provide links to online resources.  

so you're thinking about establishing a gripe
site?

observations from somebody who's been there.

 page and cites (court decisions)


about this 
site:


after being sued in federal court for my own gripe site i decided to
revitalize and "maintain"
this site.  my experience taught me the value and benefit of gripe sites to us all, and the 
effort sometimes required to keep them from being shut down. this site will
serve as a directory, of sorts, of gripe sites, and as recognition 
to the many individuals who have often resolutely sought to exercise and defend 
their free speech rights--legal battles involving websites or blogs can become demanding 
and arduous ordeals for website publishers.

if you visit some of the gripe sites we provide links to, please consider taking 
a moment to send the website publisher an e-mail of support--sometimes even one 
such e-mail can lift the spirits of an embattled website publisher. i also 
encourage you to support those organizations such as public citizen, eff, the 
aclu, and other advocates for their efforts in defending and preserving our 
rights.
