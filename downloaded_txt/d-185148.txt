short scale specialistssince 2004 - it’s what we do! texas made, world played.

    birdsong history
  



























benchcrafted



in a world where less and less is actually how it appears, birdsong instruments are still hand crafted in a small workshop in the texas “hill country”, on real work benches with wood shavings and sweat, by experienced hands attached to real people who care. it has been this way for over 20 years.that logo means something to us, and it’s burned into every headstock. crafting these is our passion and service, and we’d love to make one for you.
