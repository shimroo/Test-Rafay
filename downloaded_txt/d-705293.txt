        national association of postal supervisors




        on september 7, 1908, 50 postal supervisors from post offices in 13 states met in louisville, ky to establish an association that comprised members dedicated to the welfare of supervisors
        within the then-united states post office department. more than 100 years later, the national association of postal supervisors (naps) continues to work toward this same goal.
