a 25-minute documentary exploring the beat poets in india and the emergence of the hippy culture



bob holman releases 2 books the (un)spoken  & life poem written 50 years apart















 



bob recently released two books—life poem  and the unspoken —written fifty years apart; his shift from a hippie kid from kentucky to pursuing an alternate existence in new york city to a preeminent groundbreaker in the spoken word poetry movement, which, as you can see from the book cover, is now — the unspoken!  the books’ release via ybk/bowery books was celebrated on 12/6 in new york with an sro party at howl happening that found holman taking his performance through the audience, out onto 1st street and back onstage, the wireless mic poemizing all the while.life poem is a recently discovered book-length poem bob wrote at age 19, new to poetry and first in its thrall. filled with “jounce and pounce,” as gwendolyn brooks wrote at the time, it’s a hippie diary full of communes, vietnam, romance, and a driving love for language that has lasted a lifetime (so far). the unspoken is a collection of recent works, finding holman, now a grandfather in his 70s, still devoted to poetry, but with decades of experience, memories, joy and loss to inform it. there are poems of all sorts: personal, confessional, performance, “shorties” (every word/in a poem/is a poem), poems set to music, poems to be danced to, poems to be shouted, whispered, chanted, sung. there are  poems addressed to his late wife, the painter elizabeth murray; to their children and their children’s children; and praise poems, based on his work with west african griots, to many of the artists and poets he’s encountered over the last half-century.the books serve not only as bookends to a lifetime immersed in words, performance, and the avant-garde, but also show the evolution of an artist, an art form, and a neighborhood: a spoken word scene that’s gone from allen ginsberg to lou reed to eileen myles to mahogany l. browne.read more about the  unspoken and life poem’s party at the howl arts official website and watch a full video of bob’s live reading below.

poetryspots.com created by new york poet bob holman in 1987, poetry spots was a series of short poetry recitations committed to vhs tape and produced for wnyc-tv. the "non commercial-commercials" were builtaround a poet performing a single poem in a location of personal or conceptual significance,from tiny kitchens to coney island. active until 1993, the series was the first of its kind andintroduced new yorkers to a wealth of poets in their midst. as the idea of poetry films spread,"poetry spots" would become a compendium of filmed poems from across the country.the website is a comprehensive poetry spots archive drawn from holman's digitized tapes. click here for a 2020 interview with the series creator about the project's history and legacy.
