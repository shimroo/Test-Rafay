scca runoffs | vir 2023






















spin & win! after trying and coming up close for two years, chip found his way to victory lane with his trusty audi a4 at vir. chip pushed a little too far on cold tires into turn 3 on lap 1. the a4 slid off track, making contact with the tire wall after a few rotations. chip dropped it into gear and proceeded to go on a charge from last to first, making the race-winning pass on the last lap. a memorable race he and his crew will remember forever!
