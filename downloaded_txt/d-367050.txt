day 9 i am still in pain, but i’m at least not taking oxycodone any longer.  at least not most days.  most days i stay on a routine of tylenol every 4 hours, along with gabapentin and cyclobenzapene 3 times a day. this morning i made a mistake.  i was hopping down the stairs on one foot and i lost my balance and landed full on my surgery foot.  it zinged and shot pain up my leg.   i really hope i didn’t do any damage.  i’ve read that the people who do best on this surgery are the ones who truly do stay off their foot for the first two weeks.  i’ve done so well until now and i’m hoping this one incident doesn’t hurt my progress. i’m going to be real.   bunion surgery hurts.  i mean hurts.  there is no question about that.  i do feel this is the longest lasting pain i’ve ever experienced. i’ve taken all the pain meds this morning that i can, and i still have a nagging pain in my big toe and my ankle.  if i wiggle my toes, the toe...

4 days ago i had bunion surgery. i have known i needed this surgery for years.  but i put it off because i knew it would hurt and quite frankly, it wasn’t worth the pain. however, 10 weeks ago i was walking and overflexed my foot.  i stretched a ligament in the metatarsal area and it wouldn’t stop hurting. a quick visit to an orthopedic surgeon revealed that my foot would likely not get better and surgery was necessary to provide more structure to my foot. the surgery was for four things: 1. fusion of foot bones 2. correction of hallux valgus 3. removal of bone for graft 4. revision of calf tendon apparently all of this is necessary because of the severity of my deformed foot. a bunion (hallux valgus) is apparently measured in degrees of deformity.  45 to 50 degrees is considered serious.  my right foot measured in at 50 degrees before surgery. the fusion of the bones allows the bone to heal together, the bone graft apparently enhances bone healing in severe cases li...

 it's saturday morning about 5:30am. i got up early, showered, got a cup of coffee, started the laundry, and turned on the fireplace, with max curled by my side, to spend some time in my own thoughts.  my mind drifted to balcony people. you may have never heard that term but i hope you've known it in your life. years ago, i read an old book by joyce landorf heatherley.  it was a tiny book, published in 1984.  i don't remember when i bought the book, but it was during a season in life when shawn was buying books from half.com - new books, used books, all books at a good price (i have since introduced him to this thing in modern day life called a library).   this particular book is less than 70 pages. it was used and it came with a handwritten note inside that said "sue - you are definitely a balcony person and i love you! vicki 1/06". the book begins by telling what it is about.   "this book is about the lethal poison of rejection, and the healing ...

since i just posted about my need for silence a couple of days ago i thought i'd update. first - i've not successfully made it 24 hours.  i hope today will be the first full day i can make it without talking. second - thank god for technology.  i had an online meeting today about reports i need for my work.  it was interesting.  the trainer asked me questions and i typed them into the chat.  it was frustrating to say the least. third - i never realized how much i talk to myself.  i catch myself saying things out loud to myself.  uh.  hello.  no need.  so stop it, self. fourth - i get bored easily.  i have to stay busy.  and for some reason, it seems amplified when i can't talk.   it really has no bearing on what i'm doing.  but, for some reason i feel like i'm bored a lot when i'm not talking.   perhaps this is the season i'll actually get to blogging.........

this is miles. he’s 2 1/2.   and he needs naps .... but he likes to fight them. today i won the nap battle.  it was a grueling battle but i prevailed. after he fell asleep i watched him breathe deeply and twitch as he dreamed.   and i prayed.  that he would grow in stature and wisdom and in favor with god and man.   that he would believe in jesus and be a light in a dark world and that he would be strong. and brave. and kind. ❤️

s ilence is golden.  silence is the true friend that never betrays. the tree of silence bears the fruit of peace. silence speaks when words fail. i read an article today on one persons experience when they took a vow of silence.   many say this is one of the most challenging experiences of their lives.  when challenged with being silent, they go through the stages of grief and finally come to terms with themselves. aye aye aye. in a world of people demanding communication and discussion, silence seems unnatural.  it feels unnatural.  i dare you to try it.  you’ll see what i mean. yesterday i went to a doctor appointment.  my voice has been “off” since i had a surgery in december. i couldn’t get any volume and the pitch was different.  i didn’t sound like “me”....and it wasn’t getting better.   so off to a specialist i went.   snapped a photo while i was there. this photo was taken before he brought in the long (very long) tube with a cam...

today is national rescue dog day.  hey if there can be a national potato chip day why can’t there be a national rescue dog day? the story of max. (this is the story all about how my life got flipped- turned upside down) for a very long time, i’ve wanted a lap dog.  a loyal, happy, sit-on-your-lap dog that takes great care if it’s owner.  i have had dogs before.   after my last dog died tragically in a car accident, it took a very long time for my heart to heal enough to want a dog again. max was purchased by a woman who wanted a yorkie. she thought she could handle a dog and then realized very quickly that she couldn’t keep him.  she needed to find a new home for him. my friend melanie heard about max from her brother, and the two of them decided that max needed to find a forever home. so one cold november evening melanie told me to stop over to her house because she had a christmas gift for me.  ok but hold on.... who does that?  either someone who is...
