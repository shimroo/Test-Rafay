cemanahuacsuperseding the doctrine of discovery ten years since the first dismantling the doctrine of discovery international conference held at arizona state university west on april 1920, 2013, the continental commission abya yala will advance into the next cycle of intent and engagement towards the objectives and goals of the local-regional, continental-global initiative which has remained active across the continent throughout this most recent chapter of our collective history as original nations of indigenous peoples of the great turtle island abya yala.since 2020, in the fall and the spring, these actions of cultural indigenous self-determination have continued to mature and develop. now, in 2023, with this foundation, the izcalli abya yala echoes the call of the original continental encounter of 1990 in quito, ecuador and all of the subsequent summits and diverse initiatives of the original nations of indigenous peoples to proclaim the superseding of the doctrine of discovery of christendom as the objective of the next cycle of the work of the continental commission abya yala.

community~calpolliorganized in kinship systems of extended families that are built around traditional obligations of respect for the land, inclusiveness, complementarity and self-discipline, the calpolli identifies the basic unit of community identity in the mexica culture.  having survived over 500 years of colonization and genocide, the calpolli nahuacalco is but one more expression of the responsibility and right of self determination as nican tlacah, original nations of indigenous peoples of cemanahuac, our sacred mother earth -tonantzin.regenerated a generation ago by the founding families of tonatierra, the calpolli nahuacalco of izkalotlan represents a link to the ancestral forms of self-governance that guides the work of tonatierra, and brings to the forefront at the community level on a daily basis the realization of the path of tradition and liberation, resistance and regeneration. self determination for the original nations of indigenous peoples!tehuan nican titlacah ipan inic chicuace tonatiuh!
