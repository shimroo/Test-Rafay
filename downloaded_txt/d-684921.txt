announcements



2024 board election results



congratulations to dr. evan glazer, president, illinois mathematics and science academy, on his re-election to the iagc board of directors. 
dr.  glazer has served on the iagc board from january 2021 to the present date.  his current term concludes dec 31, 2024. his term will run from january 1, 2025 to december 31, 2027.as an iagc board member, dr. glazer supports the education committee and worked with a team of students to develop the learning enrichment engine for iagc, which provides information about access to free or scholarship-based enrichment programs throughout the state of illinois. 




goals for the iagc




"my core interests are to make learning enrichment more accessible to students and families around the state. that includes spreading awareness of free or scholarship-based opportunities, writing grants to create free outreach programs at imsa, and making programs available in new locations around the state. the most recent has been an imsa hub in carbondale, and we aim to create an access point in chicago. i believe these priorities will serve the iagc community well because we are creating these access points for students throughout grades k-12, and are purposefully identifying locations where there is a need to offer enrichment services."

acceleration support and guidance for schools, educators, and parents

in may 2024, the iagc and isbe collaborated in producing the iagc leadership summit: unpacking the accelerated placement act, a day long virtual workshop for illinois administrators and program coordinators.    the summit presented updates, details, and best practices and addressed numerous questions from attendees. while the accelerated placement act provides guidance and requirements intended to open higher level learning opportunities to more kids, we know that it can also be confusing, overwhelming, and open to some interpretation and choice.  it is from the expertise and advisement offered at the summit that the iagc collected the key points, questions, and advice into the acceleration policy and procedures clarifications, support, and guidance document.the iagc offers this document to the many educators, administrators, and parents who are working to support advanced learners across the state of illinois.  we hope it will provide you with tools that will help your community build a strong and supportive program for advanced learners at any age, and at every stage of their education.download your copy here
