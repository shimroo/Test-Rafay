welcome to saint sarkis armenian apostolic church

pari yegak! st. sarkis armenian apostolic church parish was established in 1932 in detroit, michigan.   our current location on ford road, dearborn, mi was dedicated on october 14, 1962 and since then we have satisfied the spiritual and national needs of the armenians in southeastern michigan.  we are one of the churches of the eastern prelacy of the armenian apostolic church of america under the jurisdiction of the holy see of cilicia.
st. sarkis armenian apostolic church is located on a campus which also includes the armenian community center, a parochial school and the armenian senior citizens towers.
today, armenians can boast of a community that is highly educated, professional and prospering. armenians are continuing to preserve their rich culture and identity and are loyal citizens. awareness and remembrance of a proud and fantastic history have bound the armenian people as their language, culture and tradition still thrives.
god bless!

spiritual reflections


















 has there been a times when you have struggled with prayer? questions like âwhat do i do?â or âwhat do i sayâ or âwill god say anything?â. jesusâ disciples had similar struggles and wanted to learn from the master. so jesus taught them in what we call âthe lordâs prayerâ or âhayr merâ.  this prayer can be a great help in growing our communication with god and our prayer life, both listening and talking. so be sure to open your bible on matthew 6:9-13 and pray âthe lordâs prayerâ by giving attention to each word and its meaning to you. . - rev. fr. hrant kevorkian
