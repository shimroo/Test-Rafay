are we alone?
it's a fundamental question, which has haunted humankind since first we realized that the points of light in the night sky are other suns. the seti league, inc. developed technology to seek a definitive answer! founded in 1994, we focused on participatory science, as the preeminent international grass-roots organization dedicated to privatizing the electromagnetic search for extra-terrestrial intelligence. together, we worked in five dozen countries on all seven continents to keep alive the quest for our cosmic companions. after thirty years, we are now shuttering our virtual doors - but many of our 1500 members are continuing their independent research. you can read about their efforts on this website, which we are maintaining for educational and historical purposes.



seti is a science, not simply a screensaver!
