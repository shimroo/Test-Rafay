florida quilt network
welcome to the florida quilt network, the most comprehensive listing of all that
  is good about quilting in the sunshine state!
my name is mary-jeanine ibarguen, and i have been publishing the florida quilt network newsletter since 1999.
         it is my goal to give quilters a quick and easy way to find quilting resources right here in our state.  this
         website came about as a way to let quilters access the current and past newsletters without me having to email
         them out one by one.
in addition to the newsletter, this site now includes list of shops, guilds, longarm quilters as well as my
         own popular  classes, lectures, and recipes.  take a tour using the menu above to find out what other
         quilters in our state are up to.  you may find an event near you, or see an opportunity for a road trip!
quilting is not just a hobby.  it is sharing your gifts with friends and family, neighbors and newcomers.
         join with your quilting friends by subscribing to the florida quilt network newsletter, taking a class, visiting a
         shop, or joining your local quilt guild.  and, if you need to bring something to a quilting pot luck, there is
         even a page with some of my favorite recipes.
