our mission
the land loss prevention project was founded in 1982 by the north carolina association of black lawyers to curtail epidemic losses of black owned land in north carolina. land loss prevention project was incorporated in the state of north carolina in 1983. the organization broadened its mission in 1993 to provide legal support and assistance to all financially distressed and limited resource farmers and landowners in north carolina.
land loss prevention project’s advocacy for financially distressed and limited resource farmers involves action in three separate arenas: litigation, public policy, and promoting sustainable agriculture and environment.
activity in the litigation arena typically involves debt restructuring for farmers in crisis and other legal work. on the public policy front, land loss prevention project monitors agricultural policy and the impact it has on north carolina’s small family farmers. finally, land loss prevention project helps family farmers and landowners develop sustainable agricultural practices that are environmentally friendly and economically viable for their rural communities. land loss prevention project is committed to working alongside state, regional and national coalitions who support sustainable agriculture practices, development and policy innovations.
it is part of land loss prevention project’s organizational strategy to integrate policy and programmatic work into the issue areas addressed in litigation.
