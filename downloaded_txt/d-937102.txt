our work culture
we are teachers, administrators, and staff members committed to a common goal: student
                        success. we believe that fulfilling lives are grounded in self-awareness and continuous
                        learning. we embrace bold ideas, lead by action and example, and recognize that more
                        can be accomplished together than alone. we believe that a community college needs
                        to look like the community. with that in mind, we are a proud reflection of the demographics
                        of central ohio, and we leverage the collegeâs rich diversity to strengthen our community
                        and increase regional prosperity.
