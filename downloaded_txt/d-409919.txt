	 storage solutions
	 
    
there is a growing trend in markets large and small to convert former grocery stores or other vacant retail space into secure, climate controlled storage centers. this new market model is a win-win for everyone. strip mall owners are able to get long term leases on retail space that was sitting idle. the self storage center is able to get a great price on existing space that is already under roof and has hvac. plus,can be converted less expensively to storage units then if they were starting from scratch. the big winner is the self-storage consumer.since these new storage centers are in retail areas they tend to be more conveniently located than newer, free-standing self storage centers. because the overhead is lower the rates for individual storage units are often less expensive per square foot. these centers also offer a wider variety of space options since not all of their storage units are the same cookie-cutter size. this is really handy if you have something that is over sized or an odd shape that needs to be stored. the biggest plus is this new generation of climate controlled storage is an added level of security. the converted retail stores to self storage centers have limited access, either through the front doors or the shipping bay doors. these are easy to monitor both by humans and by video security cameras. this is much better that hundreds of feet of chain length fence – often with blind spots that are not monitored – and the risk of someone breaking into your storage unit undetected.   for more information on this subject visit ea storage or awesome storage or practical storage solutions.

	 great landscaping
	 
    
great landscapingis your house and your lawn an eyesore for the neighborhood? do you want to improve the value and beauty to your home?  nothing will have greater impact than a well groomed landscaped yard.  instead of being the guy the folks next door and down the street complain about because you are the primary source of weeds for everyone.  be a hero instead.  a little effort, a few hours and a few dollars can make a major difference in the appearance of your landscaping -- and your relations with the neighbors.

fixtures

fixturessay you have a broken fixture in your house.  the big question is always do i attempt to repair it or simply replace it?  the decision is usually determined by the nature of the fixture in question.  generally, a replacement is the obvious choice unless it is an antique or solid brass,  a replacement eliminates the hassle of rewiring or working with small, soft screws that are easy to lose or misplace.  in most cases, replacement fixtures come with the correct hardware included and usually require little more that a screw driver to install.here is a safety tip.   if you are changing anything electrical, be sure to trip the circuit breaker before you even consider reaching for your tools.

custom cookware

custom cookwarewe've in the middle of gutting the old kitchen and starting over from the sub-flooring up.  when its done we will have granite countertops, cherry cabinets and a dual fuel viking.  with that kind of kitchen, obviously the old cookware has got to go.  i've looked at copper cookware, aluminum cookware and -- judging by the price -- solid gold cookware.  during my hunt i came across a great site:cooksware guideif you're looking for cookware, this is the place to start.
