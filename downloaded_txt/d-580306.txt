recycle cardboard
posted july 29, 2024 by admin & filed under uncategorized.
 

transfer station employees would like to remind wallingford residents zero sort can only accept cardboard 36 inches or less. larger than 36 inches clogs up the unit. transfer station employees would appreciate it if residents cut down cardboard to the appropriate size before you arrive at the facility as it will help operations flow smoothly and employees are not given that task.
your cooperation  is very much appreciated.
