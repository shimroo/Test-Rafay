well, it's that time of year again, time to renew the web hosting. and for those of you that don't know, that has become a lot more expensive than it used to be. fifty dollars a year is now several hundred. not to mention the price of domain names has gone up ten-fold.
and i just found out that the nice folks at paypal disabled all my support buttons, and i never got a notice (although that may be my fault.) in any case, it is all working again now, so if you would like to make a small donation to help defray these costs, it would be greatly appreciated.

we have all watched television and marveled at the presentations of renowned underwater explorer jacques cousteau, or the movie fiction of peter benchley's "jaws" or "the deep." they have given us a glimpse into the strange underwater world that few of us get to explore. yet how many of us have sat along the water's edge and wondered what mysteries must lie beneath the waves?

shark river inlet



low tide, winter. beach replenishment has all but filled in the "l".

type:
smallish tidal river inlet with stone jetties or bulkheads on both sides
depth:
15 ft

this inlet has an l-shaped jetty on the north side and a longer straight jetty on the south side. both jetties are made of loose stones - hardly any concrete - and the bottom is sandy and usually clean. you can walk over the bridge from one side of the inlet to the other in about five minutes.
