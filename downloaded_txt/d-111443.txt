about us
the halifax area advertising authority (haaa) is an 11-member board appointed by members of the volusia county council. haaa is charged with promoting tourism offerings within the greater daytona beach area and does business as the daytona beach area convention and visitors bureau (cvb).
the mission of the cvb is to contribute to and enhance the overall economic prosperity of the halifax taxing district and all of volusia county through the successful promotion of the area as a preferred tourism destination. the cvb works with area lodging, attractions, restaurants and other tourism and hospitality-related businesses to represent the area to potential leisure and business travelers, tour operators, travel agents, meeting planners, and the travel media.
in volusia county, these efforts are funded by the 3% convention development tax (bed tax) which is paid by visitors (not residents) and is collected on overnight, short-term accommodations. the halifax taxing district, one of three such taxing districts in volusia county, includes the cities and communities of ormond by the sea, ormond beach, daytona beach, daytona beach shores, wilber by the sea, ponce inlet, holly hill and south daytona.
the cvb offers a variety of services to help local tourism and hospitality industry partners reach potential visitors and successfully market their businesses. it also operates two official visitor information centers located at daytona international speedway and teddy morse's daytona harley-davidson at destination daytona in ormond beach.
