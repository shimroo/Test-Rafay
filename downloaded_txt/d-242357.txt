#3
great teaching“our students graduate knowing how to ask the right questions, knowing how to challenge ideas, thoughts, and thinking. they will understand the connectedness of all of the sciences. they will know how to collaborate, respectfully. they will know how to share knowledge and information. they will be high-level, critical thinkers who are unafraid of numbers and data, and they'll want to go into a science field.”—dalia aidoo, head of the science department
