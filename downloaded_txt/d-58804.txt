testimonialsthe jacobsen homes experience









  



 “when we decided to build a new home, we did our research and confidently chose to purchase from jacobsen because of the superior quality that goes into each and every home…the way they care about their customers is evident from the moment you walk through their door. they believe in not only building great homes but also great relationships,”” mike and barbie stottsriverwoods plantation, estero






 “"...we bought your jacobsen home and had it erected on pilings...by leecorp. what i would like you to know is that our home went through the eye of hurricane charlie with winds up to 155 miles per hour and the only damage we had was a couple of ripped screens. i just want to take this opportunity to thank you for building the strongest home in my neighborhood which includes many large dupleses that were completely destroyed by charlie. you and leecorp should be proud of yourselves for building a super structure that i call my home."” ron welcom & rob andersonislander's landing, bokeelia, fl






 “i have been a champion of manufactured and modular home living for many years. i think the concept, the product and the cost, truly produces great alternatives for first time home buyers as well as retired and downsizing home buyers. i have been impressed with the increases in quality construction and the innovative ideas to maximize comfort while always keeping a good eye on expense.” james e "jim" king, jrpresident, the florida senate
