	welcome to the 
										brevard station museum website



 



the brevard 
								station museum was begun in 1991 as a repository 
								for historical artifacts and information 
								pertaining to the region around the town of 
								stanley, north carolina. the museum moved, in 
								2004, to the present location, with an abundance 
								of space for displaying collections, as well as 
								affording space for a research and genealogy 
								center for visitors to peruse the many reference 
								books of vital records, and family histories, 
								sit at a table and work on their own 
								genealogical research.

								through the generous support of local businesses 
								and individuals, the museum provides a 
								varied array of exhibits for visitors. permanent 
								displays begin with a representation of the 
								coming of gold miners to the area, and the 
								discovery of a rare, wild magnolia by french 
								botanist, andre michaux´. other exhibits depict 
								the advent of the railroad, the actual 
								origination of the small town; information and 
								artifacts regarding the textile industry; past 
								businesses; town government happenings; farm 
								life; vintage clothing and other articles 
								showing early domestic life; culminating in a 
								large collection of military artifacts. 
								additionally, one display cabinet is reserved 
								for changing exhibits featuring personal 
								collections.
