welcome
where experience meets excellence
at joint venture estate jewelers, we specialize in the consignment of fine antique, vintage, and modern estate jewelry as well as pre-owned, high-end watches such as rolex, patek philippe, cartier and many other fine brands. because our inventory is on consignment, joint venture estate jewelers offers two unique benefits to our customers. first, we have a diverse array of jewelry from across the country, and second, we provide exceptional value because, unlike traditional jewelry stores, we do not own our inventory.
