 why photoevo pro?
photo evo pro is a large portrait and commercial photographic lab. established in 1952 in grand rapids, michigan, we offer high quality printing of photographic images by investing in the most advanced technology and by employing industry qualified technicians and knowledgeable customer service representatives.
our volume pricing structure leads the industry. we do not require volume ordering from one image or file, but allow multiple images or files to be added together in one order to qualify for volume pricing. our mixed units are also another reason photographers partner with photo evo pro.
offering you the most value for your dollar is very important to us as a company. we post monthly specials on our website for your future planning and savings. both the photographic and press printed specials have been very popular for ordering studio samples as well as being incentives for scheduling special photographic events or marketing new products.
we have heard many times that our large prints and competition prints are the best in the country. we take pride in our systems which include numerous daily calibrations for consistent quality.
photo evo pro was the first to offer free test prints for calibrating your monitor to our systems so you may place your orders within our direct output classification, our least expensive option for printing your images. we are also the first to offer color correction and layout tests for press printed products. photo evo pro is proud to service portrait and commercial clients from around the world. if you have any suggestions for products or services that we do not offer at this time, we will be happy to listen to your thoughts and ideas. we want to be your photographic partner and we appreciate your business.
