maintaining business hours 

            providing reliable customer service is key to a successful business; maintaining business hours is part of that service.
            anytime a dealership is closed outside of the posted business hours, you must notify the mvdb preferably by email at dboard@mvdb.virginia.gov


                    submit the closing date and time as well as the return date and time by completing the mvdb 40 (dealership notice of temporary closing).
                

                    the mvdb 40 or alternative notice is to be posted at or in close proximity to the front entrance to be visible to the public.
                
do not forget to include the dealer name and certificate # on the mvdb 40 


 dealer records compliance 

 § 46.2-1529       requires all motor vehicle dealers to keep the originals or a copy of all original records at the site (dealership) of origination for five (5) years.
             mvdb field staff will ask you to produce many different types of dealer records. these records include the following examples:
        


w-2 records: for all your licensed salespersons.

                    vehicle safety inspections: proof of state safety inspections for retail sales.
                

                    d-tag insurance: certificate of liability insurance
                
vehicle: purchases, sales, trades, and transfer of ownership

                    transport plates and temporary certificates of registration
                
  dsd 27   (permission for use of dealer's license plates)



proper use of pod tags
our field representatives have uncovered multiple instances of dealer misuse of print on demand (pod) tags.

            when a licensed dealer sells or conditionally sells to a purchaser a motor vehicle, the dealer may issue temporary license plates.
        

            records associated with insurance of a temporary license plate shall be maintained by the dealership for no less than (5) years.
        
what's wrong with this picture 

 
            not for use on the family trip!
         

            in this season of vacations and boating, you may not pull your boats and rv’s
with a vehicle using a dealer tag. § 46.2-1550 states in part; “it shall be
unlawful for any dealer to cause or permit dealer's license plates to be used on:
2. vehicles used to deliver or transport (i) other vehicles; (ii) portions of
vehicles; (iii) vehicle components, parts, or accessories; or (iv) fuel;…”
        
transfer of salesperson license

            to transfer a salesperson license, you have one of two options available. 


                    complete and submit an mvdb 61 for each salesperson and mail to the mvdb office location with a check in the amount of $50.00 for each license.
                    if mailing, please keep in mind this could take up to 7 days before we actually receive your mailing.
                

                    to expedite the process, complete, scan and email an mvdb 61 to
                    mvdb61@mvdb.virginia.gov using
                    virtru encryption.
                    you must provide the following information in addition to the mvdb61:
                    
dealership name
certificate number
payment contact person and phone number





            when submitting personal or private information through email, you must use
            virtru encryption
            for data protection.

 legislation hb316, regarding recertification takes effect july1, 2022


           this legislation makes changes to the ido recertification program that independent dealer-operators are already accustomed to. below outlines the main changes of the new law effective july 1, 2022 vs. the prior regulation.
        


independent dealer-operators will recertify every 24 months instead of every 36 months.

                  the dealer-operator recertification course will be instructor-led (in person or virtual) for 4 hours in duration instead of 6 hours digitally.
                

                    an exam will be given at the conclusion of the course instead of each “chapter”
                
the motor vehicle dealer board fee for recertification is $50 instead of $25, and will be collected by the vendor at time of registration

dealer plate insurance

            having insurance on your dealer plates is not only to protect you, but to protect other motorist on the road in case of an unfortunate accident. proof of liability insurance must be submitted with new applications and renewals. 
            
            mvdb main office staff will not issue dealer tags without verifying sufficient insurance coverage.
            
mvdb field representatives conduct dealership inspections, and part of those inspections is to determine if your dealership has insurance coverage on each and every dealer license plate you posses.

                    every dealer plate you possess is required by law to have liability insurance coverage. 
                






                avoid penalties and unsatisfactory inspections… get insurance on your plates!
