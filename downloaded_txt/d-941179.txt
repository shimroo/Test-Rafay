"make no mistake about it, bl is a great game. i really wish i could go over 100 words lol, i could write a novel about bl. only thing i wish there was more of is that the staff interacted with the players more. i think that would bring them closer together so they could understand one another more."

"bootleggers is the only maffia-based game that keeps me playing, due the community, the forums, crews. and of course the whole bootleggers team. i like every aspect in the game, and recently we went through alot of changes, i didn't liked it both until i got used to it, it were some pretty good updates. i just want to see some more missions, and maybe a whole new state or what-so-ever. but all in all. bootleggers rocks!"

"i think this is a fantastic game which is continuously improving. the admins listen to the public and do a really good job. the bootleggers public also make the game more enjoyable as most have some level of maturity and common sense and like to help. keep up the good work."

"bootleggers is indeed one of the best games on the internet. recently we've seen the admins suddenly become more active then they were before and a lot of changes were made! i really loved that. i still gave the rating a 4.999 as that nothing can be perfect. not even bootleggers! i love the game how it is and i will probably keep on playing for another 5 years, if that's possible "

"an online game that takes you back to the 1930's and turns you into an old school mobster! it's fun to use mind games and strategy to make it from a low scum to a don of the nation. the community is full of great people from around the world and the staff is helpful, down to earth and fun. my favorite feature is the missions, but it needs a good amount of updating that will add a whole new aspect to the game if done right. i've been playing for nearly 4 or 5 years and i wouldn't miss a day logging in. plus, the game is addicting.

"i think bootleggers is one of the best game on internet, fully active and making fun with other players. why did i give it a 4 and not a 5. i think the eg must be a little bit more active. they must more listen to players future suggestions in my opinion! happy gaming and gambling  "
