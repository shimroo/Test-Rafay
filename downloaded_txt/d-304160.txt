a message from our pastorwe are glad you found our website.  jesus regularly greeted people with hebrew word, shalom.”  “shalom” often gets translated into “peace be with you” in english. shalom is a bigger, more powerful word. shalom implies wellness, goodness, justice…and…peace in nation, peace within family and peace in the soul. at gloria dei, we call it,  where neighbors become familyjoin us as we follow jesus in worship, as family and in service. give ‘em heaven! pastor tim
