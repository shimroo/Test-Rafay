                    our story 
launched in 1997, prairie craft was the first online store to serve the polymer clay enthusiast. at that time, we saw a need in the market for better clay, tools and products, and have since pioneered the development of bestselling products like the nublade, marxit, and kato polyclay. 
before a product is offered on prairie craft, it’s tested and put through its paces to ensure it meets our highest standards in terms of performance and design. thank you for being our customer. we sincerely appreciate it!
