about quicksilver
software that's built to last, done right the first time.








how many technical teams do you know who have been in continuous operation for forty years? there's a reason we are still around, stronger than ever.
quicksilver was founded in 1984 by some of the world's first video game programmers, and is still headed today by industry standout william fisher -- designer, programmer, and award-winning technology leader. the company seeks out challenging projects that push boundaries and invent entirely new and visionary technologies in fields ranging from games to surgical devices to military training. and, last but not least, humanoid robots.
how can we excel at so many different things? because we make complicated things simple. we build clean, elegant user interfaces. we build tools that automate and streamline tedious tasks. we get to the root of how people learn, and write software that teaches them without being dry and boring. here are just a few examples:

 our award-winning army logistics trainer turns bullets and water bottles into challenging puzzles with a purpose
 our video game graphics background led us to design a cutting-edge breast-cancer surgery device
 we helped design, build and then run one of the world's fist ipad-based restaurants
 we built a 300-player live poker game show in las vegas -- in only eight months
 we built a microsoft excel-based game that was so much fun to play that we had to pry people away from it

let's talk. what are your biggest challenges? what's blocking you from reaching your full potential? find out for yourself why quicksilver has been a trusted partner across so many industries.
