after thirteen years online, this website is being retired.
        

        in the "contents" page you can find links to some of the more interesting
        and relevant topics covered over the past few years.
when we started this website in 1998, there was very
        little information online about the jewish population of cuba. our initial
        purpose
        was simply to provide historical information. soon, with the help of
        june safran, stan cohen, and others, we began to provide information
        for individuals and groups
        who wished to visit
        a congregation in cuba.  
        now there are dozens of trips annually, and dozens of websites on the
        topic of jewish cuba.
but we were the first, and we are proud of that. we also
        helped set up the first website for an individual in cuba, and still
        provide hosting for cuba's 
        only orthodox synagogue. 
below are links to the contents page and the photos page.
        some of the information is outdated and we will be reviewing all of the
        articles,
        almost 100 pages of them, in the next few months.
 in the meantime we
        encourage you to visit a site we helped create, and initally sponsored.
        it has now grown in sophistication and relevance and 
        we refer you to this site with confidence:
