we acknowledge that the greater sacramento area lies within the ancestral homelands of the nisenan, maidu, miwok, me-wuk, and patwin peoples, who have been the indigenous stewards of this land since time immemorial. trinity episcopal cathedral sacramento gathers, worships, and serves on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the nisenan people. we recognize and thank the original peoples of this land, whose stories have been and continue to be marginalized. with god's help, we agree to hold ourselves accountable to forming new and ongoing relationships of honor and respect with these lands and peoples.
