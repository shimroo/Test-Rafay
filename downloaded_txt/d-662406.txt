announcing the autocrosser's handbook: a guide for all levels





after nearly 25 years of autocrossing, iâ€™ve accumulated a wealth of knowledge through experience, observation, and learning from others in the community. autocross is a sport that keeps you on your toes, no matter how long you've been competing, and thereâ€™s always something new to learn.thatâ€™s why iâ€™m excited to share the autocrosserâ€™s handbookâ€”a resource designed for everyone, whether youâ€™re a first-time racer or a seasoned pro looking to sharpen your skills. this guide is the culmination of years spent in parking lots, paddocks, and grid lines, and itâ€™s my way of giving back to the sport thatâ€™s given me so much.whatâ€™s inside the handbook?the autocrosserâ€™s handbook is a growing, evolving guide covering all aspects of the sport. while itâ€™s still a work in progress, here are just a few of the topics iâ€™ve started to include:getting started: what to expect at your first event and how to prepare.car preparation: essential maintenance and upgrades to get the most out of your runs.driving techniques: from basics to advanced tips for attacking the course.event etiquette: navigating the grid, working corners, and understanding the flow.beyond the basics: strategies for improving consistency and breaking through plateaus.as i continue to develop this handbook, iâ€™m regularly adding new sections and refining existing ones based on feedback from fellow autocrossers and my own experiences.a community resource: your feedback mattersthe handbook isnâ€™t just a one-way streetâ€”itâ€™s a living document that thrives on community input. i believe the best way to make it truly valuable is to include insights from racers of all experience levels. if you have ideas, suggestions, or topics you'd like to see covered, iâ€™d love to hear from you!your feedback will help shape this guide into a resource that benefits the entire autocross community.explore the handbook and share your thoughtsi invite you to take a look at the autocrosserâ€™s handbook and join me in building a stronger, more informed community of racers.ðŸ”— visit the autocrosser's handbookletâ€™s make autocross more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. together, we can ensure that newcomers feel confident and veterans continue to push the limits of their performance.

dotnetnuke training announcements





iâ€™m pleased to announce that dotnetnuke corporation has a new partnership agreement with engage software which will allow us to leverage the valuable engage training materials developed over many years to offer groundbreaking new training to dotnetnuke users. i am also pleased to announce that the first of our new training programs is available now on the dotnetnuke training page on dotnetnuke.com.as some of you may know and many may not, after many years of being a dotnetnuke core team member, i recently became an employee of dotnetnuke corporation. i have picked up my family and relocated from colorado to the bay area here in northern california. if youâ€™ve seen any of my posts in the forums you likely have noticed my title, director of training programs. this blog post is to talk about what exactly that entails, as well as an announcement that we are making today in terms of training. my role here at dotnetnuke corporation is to develop a training program for the software that i have been using personally and professionally for over 7 years. for the past 5+ years i worked for a long time dotnetnuke services provider and dotnetnuke fusion partner, engage software, out of st. louis, missouri. training at engage started out as an added service that was provided to existing clients as they were delivered projects that had been implemented using dotnetnuke.over time engage decided to invest a lot in terms of time and resources to develop materials for a full slate of training courses as well as a partnership with dotnetnuke corporation to be an official training partner. this partnership was beneficial for both parties as it provided dotnetnuke corp in its infancy with a resource that wouldnâ€™t have been available due to the commitment and cost involved in developing such materials. for engage it provided a great way to provide additional services to the dotnetnuke ecosystem in a matter that allowed the company to leverage the level of knowledge the business and employees had been able to acquire about the dotnetnuke platform with their many years of work.today dotnetnuke corporation has announced a partnership with engage software to leverage the rights to the materials that engage has invested so much time and effort into developing.the idea behind this partnership, and the creation of the role i am now filling at dotnetnuke corp is to provide an even wider range of training opportunities for the ecosystem. the goal for this new program and my role is simple, to make learning dotnetnuke easier. while my role will include working with the developers within dotnetnuke corp and the various teams of developers outside of the bounds of dotnetnuke corp to make the platform easier to use, the primary goal for my position is to push the envelope on the further development of training materials and resources for the community to learn and utilize the platform.dotnetnuke corporation will be leveraging the materials from engage to develop a number of different training offerings. we arenâ€™t quite ready to announce all of those offerings just yet, but i can announce one of those items here today. the first offering we are going to be providing is a series of dotnetnuke training webinars. these webinars are starting in just a couple of weeks and will provide a wide variety of topics for users with all levels of experience with dotnetnuke. be sure to check out the dotnetnuke training page for more information about the webinars, along with a schedule of the upcoming sessions.as of right now you might notice that there are a collection of paid webinars but that will be changing here shortly as we are going to be offering a number of free webinars as well. these will start up in june 2010 when we will be offering 2-3 free webinars a month with the possibility of offering more depending on the demand. stay tuned to the dotnetnuke training page and dnncorp on twitter as we add more to the webinar schedule.another item we are working on from a training perspective is to create training materials that can be used by fusion partners to provide training services for dotnetnuke around the globe. we are in the planning phases for this program so the implementation of this program is still a ways off. if your company is interested in providing feedback in a partner training program please be sure to join the fusion partner program. we will be reaching out to those partners who have expressed an interest in being part of a training program as we continue to build up this program.i have been involved with dotnetnuke since january of 2003, just a few short days after the first release in december 2002. i am very excited about what the future holds for dotnetnuke as well as myself, and i look forward to hearing from you on our new training.if you have any feedback on the training offerings or any questions that i may answer please feel free to email me at training@dnncorp.com.
