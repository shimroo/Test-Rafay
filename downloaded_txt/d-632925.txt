"the customer service is exceptional. i visited there and sindi one of the associates assisted me. she was wonderful, she knew how to answer my questions, and she was just helpful. i wanted something custom. she got me the quote and she was just exceptional to work with. i couldn't ask for a better representative to assist me.  thank you sindi"






monica grover




"i own pet ranch inc. in kingwood, tx and we had just received our new check out counters custom made from fixtures international before getting hit by the harvey flood and loosing all of the counters. several months after our clean up and return to business i called on fixtures international and sindi and their wonderful staff and designers to again build a new set of check out counters. our 40 year anniversary was coming up on the 26th of may and they completed and installed two weeks before the deadline! i could not be any happier with the service or the quality of the products! the pictures donât begin to show the quality! prices are always well within reason!"
