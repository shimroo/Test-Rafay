about spiderbait
rock royalty, noise trio spiderbait, come from humble beginnings in the rural nsw town of finley. janet, whitt and kram’s unique musical alchemy has taken them on a ride to the top of their game- from their very first single circle k released in 1991 to aria #1 songs and the #1 spot on triple j’s hottest 100.









about spiderbait
recounting their very first session together kram recalled

a very weird but awesome rehearsal we had on janet’s rice farm surrounded by giant tractor… we jammed cosmic psychos and dinosaur jr covers. we definitely had no idea then that we would become the band we have. we were kinda cool but kinda crap too, but didn’t care. it was such fun to play together. still is!

australia thought they were “kinda cool” too and has since bought over half a million of their records, sending their singles into the top 10, albums to double platinum status and winning them multiple throughout their career, they’ve played all of australia’s iconic festivals including splendour in the grass, falls festival, big day out, groovin the moo, homebake, livid and meredith as well as countless headline dates in venues across the country, some more memorable than others…

that night at macquarie uni in sydney when the guy swung from the exposed ceiling water pipe and burst it about four songs into the set. there was water gushing everywhere followed by a flash of electricity and a loud bang and i can still hear kram yelling over the mike ‘everyone get outta here, this place is gonna blow!’

said whitt.
one of australia’s most celebrated live acts, spiderbait has continued to own every stage they haveplayed on, from the 90s right through to the present.
asked what they have most loved about being in spiderbait, janet’s reply says it all…

the humour, the rock n’ roll, the friendship and the fans who’ve shared it with us.
