compliments of the season to all!
 as the year comes to a close we want to thank all of our friends and customers who have been so patient and supportive; your kindness has made such a difference.
we wish you all a joyous and peaceful holiday season and our best wishes for a happy, healthy and music-full 2025.

final run of 2024 

we are finishing up our final run of the year and will be taking some time off towards the end of december to recover physically--shop work is doing a significant number on robert's back making it difficult to work for more than a few hours each day. 

waitlist temporarily suspended
for the time being, we are no longer accepting orders to be placed on our waitlist.  we arestill at least a year out to complete the orders already in place and we don't want to keep adding orders at this point.
we are not able to work as long in the shop as we used to and it is taking longer to complete a production run due to health factors well beyond our control.  
we've had several people contact us saying that they had heard we are no longer building dulcimers; this is not correct. we have not retiredand we are not planning on closing blue lion anytime soon.  we just need some time to catch up and to give our bodies some time to heal.
for those of you already on our waitlist, rest assured we are still planning on building your instruments.
