applications & publications
























































what is large particle flow cytometry?
union biometrica provides flow cytometry for objects that are too large / too fragile for traditional cytometers and offer an alternative to manual sorting (under a microscope). these systems sort and dispense objects based on size and fluorescent parameters. automating this process offers increased speed, sensitivity, quantification, and repeatability of experiments.
systems for the automated analysis and sorting of viable multicellular organisms, cells and other large “particles” sized from 10–1,500 microns.

what is vast bioimager™ for zebrafish larvae?
vertebrate automated screening technology is a new modular, expandable platform for automated high throughput / high content screens of 2–7 day old zebrafish larvae. based on technology from mit (cambridge, ma), vast bioimager will allow zebrafish handling and cellular-resolution imaging tasks to be automated. learn more »
