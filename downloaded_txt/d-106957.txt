as the weather becomes cooler and the fall harvest moon shins bright, we would like to discuss some great bay area activities. activities that are not only fun, but can be done with proper social distancing.
starting in september, santa cruz, half moon bay and watsonville become awash in orange as the local pumpkin patches ready their goods for the spookiest of the holidays.
