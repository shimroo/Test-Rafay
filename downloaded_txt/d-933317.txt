(a kovel agreement involves extending the attorney-client privilege from your attorney to an accountant.) we will seek to prevent a referral to the criminal investigations division, while also limiting or preventing penalties for civil fraud.criminal tax defensecriminal charges brought by the tax division of the justice department should be taken seriously. these may be based on a failure to file a tax return, a failure to report all income, false statements, false tax returns and other documents, or overstated deductions, among other crimes. meanwhile, the criminal investigations program that forms part of the california franchise tax board handles cases related to false returns, failing to file returns, or refund fraud. we can help you fight the government’s case at every step of the way so that you can avoid the devastating consequences that can result from a conviction. for example, cooperating with the authorities can help a taxpayer avoid an indictment in some cases. however, anything that you say in these situations can be used against you, so consulting a tax attorney in the los angeles area is a critical step to take.tax appealstaxpayers who are unsatisfied with the results of an irs audit can appeal the outcome to the irs appeals office in their area. the goal of the appeals division is to promote compliance with the tax code by resolving these disputes fairly and avoiding the need for litigation. an appeals officer will try to settle your case at a conference. they will assess the chance that a court will agree with the irs upon review and adopt a position accordingly. if you do not reach a settlement at a conference, or if you want to bypass this process, you can bring your case to federal court. we can also assist you with appealing the outcome of a california franchise tax board assessment by filing a written protest and bringing your case to the state board of equalization, as well as a state court if needed.tax litigationif you cannot reach a reasonable resolution to a tax dispute, going to court may be necessary. our los angeles tax lawyers can represent you against the irs in the u.s. tax court as well as trial court and appellate court. if your dispute arises from a california franchise tax board assessment, we can help you develop a strategy and prepare for a hearing before the state board of equalization. pedram ben-cohen can bring insights to tax litigation from his previous experience with two international tax defense firms, as well as the tax division of the u.s. attorney’s office. he will try to obtain a favorable settlement if possible while remaining ready for administrative hearings and trials.employment taxesthe distinction between an employee and an independent contractor can be challenging to understand. the irs and the california employment development department use a 20-factor test to determine which designation applies. sometimes the irs or the edd will decide that an employer has inappropriately classified an employee as an independent contractor. as a result, they may pursue tax assessments and retroactive penalties from an employer that failed to withhold employment taxes for that individual. sometimes the employer can avoid these assessments and penalties by passing the reasonable basis test, the position test, and the tax return test under section 530 of the revenue act of 1978. we can help you argue that your business satisfies these tests.residency auditsa taxpayer may be subject to a residency audit by the california franchise tax board. whether they are a resident, a part-time resident, or a non-resident will affect the amount of their tax obligation. this process may take years to complete and may involve documents related to a taxpayer’s home or lease, travel documents, employment agreements, bank statements, credit card statements, and voter registration information. a residency audit may also involve matters related to a taxpayer’s income, deductions, and credits. we are experienced in the complexities of this process and can fight for you to achieve the best possible outcome.tax collection defenseif you need to fight an assessment of a deficiency after a tax audit, the tax lawyers at our los angeles firm can guide you through the collection defense process. you may be able to request a reconsideration of your audit. if the irs does not grant a reconsideration, which is at its discretion, you may have other arguments that you can make. perhaps the irs violated the statute of limitations for assessment or the statute of limitations for collection. or perhaps you can make an offer in compromise or arrange for an installment payment agreement. you can also file a due process appeal, which will pause collection efforts and provide for an independent review of the collection.consult a knowledgeable tax attorney in the los angeles areawe recognize that, to a client, his or her case is the only case.
