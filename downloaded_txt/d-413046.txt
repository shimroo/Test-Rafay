 dog training and boarding 



it’s common for dog owners to feel frustrated when trying to correct unwanted behaviors. often, the root cause is a lack of clear communication.our training goes beyond simple commands. at certified canine services, we view obedience training as a vital language between you and your dog. when mastered, this language allows you to express what behaviors you want from your dog and, importantly, those you don’t.

how certified canine services will help you and your dog
 



the key to having the kind of unique relationship that you have only dreamed of is by creating a way to communicate clearly and fairly with your dog the behaviors that you do and do not want and in a way they can understand.we believe the best way to achieve this with your dog is through true obedience training. we look at obedience training as a language for dogs. and when you understand this language and use it properly you will be able to bring out the best in your dog and bring to life your dreams.many times owners try to fix behavior that they don’t want but fail only because they don’t have a clear way to communicate with their dog. 









 










whatever your problem, our expert trainers can help! 



our camp-style programs near watertown, oswego, and syracuse, ny, offer owners and their dogs personalized training catered to the dog’s individual needs, personality, behavioral issues, and the owner’s goals.just like humans, every dog is different. we recognize the six distinct personalities found in dogs and adjust our training accordingly. our approach is designed to help you work effectively with your dog’s individual personality.we begin by building a strong relationship with your dog through daily interactions. from there, we patiently teach them the language of obedience. many professional dogs, including service dogs, military dogs, and seeing eye dogs, are trained using this same method—by a professional trainer with extensive experience, followed by placement with a handler or owner. it’s a common myth that a dog won’t respond to its owner if they haven’t trained them themselves.
