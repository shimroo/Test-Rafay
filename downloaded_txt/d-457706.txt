statement









emma bonino




through its global political campaigns and initiatives, no peace without justice aims to focus on those situations where universal and fundamental principles are often cast aside in the name of political stability and supposed cultural incompatibility. no peace without justice encourages awareness raising, promotes public debates and stimulates political mobilization of activists, parliamentarians and governments to promote human rights, democracy, the rule of law and international criminal justice. with its small resources, but with the strength of its resolve.
