some memorable poker hands
july 2009 - by paul kammen
   



ok, i admit it, i occasionally will yell at the tv as i watch poker, both in surprise at an excellent play, and in amazement at a play that is painful to watch. because im not phil hellmuth and there aren't any cameras where i play, i can't yell at the table, but there are times id sure like to. from my times at and away from the tables, here are some of the poker hands over the years that have really stood out.

violette vs. mercier
world poker tour
protect those tens! the world poker tour decided to add a ladies night during its first season, and followed it up with another special featuring women players during season 2. in this match, many of us were amazed at one play that cost wpt champion isabelle mercier a pot. mercier is a great player, but this hand left us scratching our heads.

hellmuth vs. varkonyi
2002 world series of poker
sorry phil. love him or hate him, phil is good for tv, as he does the things that many of us would like to do when sucked out. he was also involved in one of the most memorable hands from the 2002 world series of poker, that goes to show you that while you must have skill to win a poker tournament, the winners going to need some help from the poker gods, too.

chan vs. seidel
1998 world series of poker
poor seidel, kid doesnt know what hit him. you may remember that line from the film rounders, when mike mcdermott (matt damon) and petra (famke janssen) are watching a tape of the 1988 world series of pokers main event. seidel is one of the best professionals out there, with 7 bracelets, yet is often remembered for this unfortunate hand where he got run down by the orient express, johnny chan.

henry gondorff(paul newman) vs. doyle lonnegan(robert shaw
the sting (1982 movie)
you owe me 15 grand, pal. while not an actual hand, this is my favorite poker scene from any movie. con man henry gondorf aka shaw (paul newman) and shady banker doyle lonnegan (robert shaw) are playing high-stakes poker on a train. both know how to cheat, but gondorf knows how to put a man on tilt. after making snide comments and pretending hes drunk, having taken plenty of lonnegans money in the process, lonnegan decides hes had enough and tells his bodyguard: im going to bust that bastard bookie on one hand. fix me a cooler!

me vs. the environment. or is this man vs. himself?
canterbury club
my own seidel moment. this memorable hand had me shaking my head, and goes to show you that even after playing countless hands, its still easy to get tunnel vision and think your hand is good. i was playing at canterbury park in a low-stakes game recently, and was dealt pocket rockets (pocket aces).

conclusion

whether you're under the lights of the espn camera crew or the 60-watt that hangs above your felt at home, all poker players have one thing in common: each has his own good and bad-beat stories to tell, and hands seen and gasped with amazement about on tv wondering how on earth these people play poker for a living. with more and more poker on tv, there are bound to be many more fantastic plays, horrible beats, and meltdowns in front of the camera, making memories enough for all our lifetimes.

poker rules - 
rank of hands

the ranking of poker hands, from top to bottom and best hand to worst, is as follows. keep in mind that winning poker hands is not difficult - you just have to have a hand that is ranked higher than your opponents.:
 
        1- royal flush
        2- straight flush
        3- four of a kind
        4- full house
        5- flush
        6- straight
        7- three of a kind 
        8- two pair
        9- one pair
        10 high card 






royal flush:
	ten, jack, queen, king, ace of the same suit.
    
    as nothing beats a royal flush, it is the most desirable of  hands in poker. 





straight flush:  
	five cards in sequence makes a straight. 
	the straight flush poker hand has all five cards in the same suit.
    
    examples - spades: 2-3-4-5-6, clubs: 3-4-5-6-7.





four of a kind:  
	four cards of the same number or face value ("quads").
  





full house:
three cards of one number or face value and two cards of another number
or face value. if more than one player has a full house, the full house
with the highest ranking three of a kind ("trips") wins. 





flush: 
	five cards of the same suit. if there is more than one flush, the hand with the highest card(s) wins.
  





straight:	
five cards in sequence. cards can be in any suit. an ace can be used in
the highest straight (10, j, q, k, a) and the lowest straight (a, 2, 3,
4, 5). 





three of a kind:
	three cards of the same number or face value ("trips").
  





two pair:	
if two players have two pair, the hand with the highest pair wins. if
they have the same high pair, whoever has the second highest pair wins.
if they have the same two pair, whoever has the highest fifth card
("kicker") wins. 





one pair:	
	two cards of the same number or face value. if two players have the same pair, the highest outside card(s) wins.
  





high card: 
	the hand with the highest card(s) wins.
  


that is the conclusion of the ranked hands
