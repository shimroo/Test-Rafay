important safety information and indication 










warning: severe hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-associated reactions, and risk of acute cardiorespiratory failure in susceptible patients
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis
			if you are taking nexviazyme, you should know that severe and potentially life-threatening allergic-type reactions known as anaphylaxis and severe hypersensitivity reactions have occurred during and after nexviazyme treatment.you should seek immediate medical care if signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reactions occur. if such a reaction is severe enough, your doctor may decide to immediately discontinue the infusion and provide immediate medical care. appropriate medical support measures may be administered during your infusion, and you may require close observation during and after nexviazyme administration.
infusion-associated reactions (iars)
			if you are taking nexviazyme, you should know that severe iars have occurred during and after nexviazyme treatment. if severe iars occur during your nexviazyme infusion, your doctor may decide to immediately discontinue the infusion and provide appropriate medical care. if you have an acute underlying illness at the time of nexviazyme infusion you may be at greater risk for iars. if you have advanced pompe disease you may have compromised heart and breathing function, which may put you at a higher risk of severe complications from iars. 
risk of acute cardiorespiratory failure in susceptible patients 
			if you are likely to develop fluid volume overload, or have acute underlying breathing problems or compromised heart or breathing function that may require fluid restriction, there may be a risk of worsening of your heart or breathing status during nexviazyme infusion. your doctor may decide that close observation during nexviazyme administration may be necessary.










warnings and precautions
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis: see boxed warning. your doctor may decide to give you antihistamine, anti-fever and/or steroid medications before your infusions. your doctor should consider the risks and benefits of restarting the infusion if you have a severe hypersensitivity reaction (including anaphylaxis) to nexviazyme. if a mild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction occurs, your healthcare provider may slow the infusion rate or temporarily stop the infusion.
infusion-associated reactions (iars): see boxed warning. your doctor may decide to give you medications before your infusions to decrease the risk of iars; however, iars may still occur after receiving these medications. if mild or moderate iars occur, your healthcare provider should consider decreasing the infusion rate or temporarily stopping the infusion which may help improve the symptoms.
risk of acute cardiorespiratory failure in susceptible patients: see boxed warning.
adverse reactions
the most common adverse reactions (>5%) were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, joint pain, dizziness, muscle pain, itching, vomiting, shortness of breath, rash, “pins-and-needles” sensation, and hives.
indication
nexviazyme (avalglucosidase alfa-ngpt) is used for the treatment of patients 1 year of age and older with late-onset pompe disease [lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) deficiency].
please see full prescribing information for complete details, including boxed warning.
