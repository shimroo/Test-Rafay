                  jossey-josey website! this beautiful site was originally 
                  designed and created by jackie josey helfrich, beloved 
                  secretary-treasurer of the house of jossey-josey for many 
                  years. we are proud of this special place and appreciate very

a little history about our the 
          house of jossey-josey web-site.

           

                      it was originally composed by the hard work 
          and self taught work of jacqueline ann "jackie" josey helfrich in 1999 
          - 2005. when i took over the ( job ) in 
          2005 of updating and putting new information on bud 
          josey's corner. marion & i had discussed putting the large amount 
          of information that we had collected over the many years on the 
          josey's, on the web-site so that everybody would be able to see the 
          info. not everybody could afford, or take the time to go out through 
          the country and find the info. we would go to the court house in 
          various states and take photos of early wills and deeds and marriages 
          of the josey's, because the early wills would name the children, go 
          home and have the film developed, have large prints made so we could 
          read what it said. like everybody that is interested in genealogy, i 
          have made plenty of mistakes, just doing the josey's, (bad 
          mistake) because the girls lose their name, and you don't know who 
          they married. you read some info and think you can remember everything 
          instead of taking a photo (# 1 wrong, always take photos). you 
          think you can remember in what county you saw that info 3 months ago, 
          (at our age wrong, i was born 8 
          sep 1933 and marion 30 
          may 1931). marion and i found out the hard way that it 
          is easier to take photos of everything the first time than having to 
          go back and do it all over again. (thank god for digital camera's) to 
          make a long story short, marion and i have taken over a half million 
          photos ourselves, that we have put on the web-site. we have stopped 
          taking cemetery photos as it just gets too hot and hard to clean the 
          stones before you take a photo. in the past few years we have just 
          taken court house photos of marriages, births & deaths (air 
          conditioning) and our son john has made a table so that marion can 
          sit down while she turns the pages, and i can take the photo. we have 
          been blessed to still have pretty good health to be able to do the 
          amount of traveling we do and still take photos. we have taken over 
          88,000 photos so far this year, march & april, 2013, and have put them 
          on the web-site. it is our goal, to keep on getting more info but, we 
          have to look to the future to make sure that there is new info for 
          everyone to enjoy on the web-site, 

                      so from the humble beginnings of this 
          web-site in 1999, to the 671,222 hits we had in the month of 
          april 2013, and 7,191,130 hits 
          over the past year 2023, who knows what the future holds for the 
          house of jossey-josey web-site. we are glad that you have 
          decided to be a part of our past, and will continue to be with us in 
          the future.

           

          it has come time to pass the torch to someone new
 

we wish for you

           

enough happiness to keep you sweet;

enough trials to keep you strong;

enough sorrow to keep you human;

enough hope to keep you happy;

enough failure to keep you humble;

enough success to keep you eager;

enough friends to give you comfort;

enough faith and courage in yourself,

your business, and your country

to banish depression;

enough wealth to meet your needs;

enough determination to make each day a

better day than yesterday;

          with love
