pope francis grants 'nulla osta' for medjugorje!september 19, 2024



 mladifest usa - july 18-20, 2025










the medjugorje web is the very first web site created in 1995 about medjugorje, and is still the largest, most comprehensive, and visited medjugorje web site on the internet. since 1981, in a small village called medjugorje, in bosnia-herzegovina,  (map) the blessed virgin mary has been appearing and giving messages to the world. and that these years she is spending with us are a time of special grace granted by god. in her own words she tells us, "i have come to tell the world that god exists. he is the fullness of life, and to enjoy this fullness and peace, you must return to god".
since the apparitions began in 1981, over 40 million people of all faiths, from all over the world, have visited medjugorje and have left spiritually strengthened and renewed. countless unbelievers and physically or mentally afflicted, have been converted and healed. you owe it to yourself and your loved ones, to investigate with an open mind and heart the events which are occurring in medjugorje. i invite you to explore the over 4000 pages of information contained on this web site, and decide for yourself whether you will answer our lady's call to prayer, and conversion.  more...
