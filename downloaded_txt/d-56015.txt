night of 100 pumpkins
 





thank you to the awesome new paltz community for including the bakery in your 2023 halloween festivities. you patiently waited with hundreds of others to view pumpkin creations delivered by talented individuals. the entries were creative and impressive, we’re looking forward to seeing what you bring next year. pumpkins were selected by a seasoned panel and awarded prizes donated by local businesses. thank you to all of the merchants and judges for their time and generosity. the drumming started after the parade passed by and kept the rhythm of the night going. we couldn’t do all of this without our hard-working staff, thank you all for everything you do to make smiles happen. thanks to lydia our face painting artist.every halloween since 1990 the bakery has hosted night of 100 pumpkins. people of all ages carve or paint pumpkins and a panel of artists choose the winners. petrifying pumpkins - peculiar pumpkins - painted pumpkins - pretty pumpkins - panoramic designs - and of course classic jack-o-laterns. see all the pumpkins from 2019 here: pumpkin photos 2019on halloween night we light all the pumpkins and everyone is invited to the party.
