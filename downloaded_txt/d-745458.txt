    why shop at mmusa? get to know us - get to know why! the accordion businessimporting, designing, selling and servicing accordions is a tough business.buying an accordion can become somewhat overwhelming, as well.music magic usa makes it easy - with an enjoyable no-pressure experience that will leave you feeling informed, understood and most satisfied with your purchase - guaranteed!  having a technically knowledgeable owner with a long-standing relationship with over ten italian manufacturers, mmusa has been responsible for helping to design and develop a number of unique new models with exclusive features and offering them (and many other hand-crafted models) to our discerning clientele.   with a professional accordionist, educator and designer, a certified in-house roland v-accordion factory authorized technician and service center, along with the skills of one of america's most highly acclaimed accordion repair and restoration experts, we can assure you that we are equipped to serve, advise and support you in every phase of your joining our mmusa musical family - keeping your music magic purchase in perfect condition for many years to come.morals before moneya number of our well-known competitors have been "educated" by music magic, although we would prefer to educate you, our customer!  although it sounds a bit incredible, one large dealer/proprietor used to call mmusa or sit next to us on the aaa festival bus tours (before starting his own business) asking many questions about the brands we were carrying and also all about features of the new roland v-accordions.  soon thereafter, he opened shop and became one of our biggest competitors.  another veteran musical business owner did not like the pricing he believed we were quoting on v-accordions and actually phoned us and threatened to call his "friend", the president of roland corporation, to get our license pulled unless we stopped undercutting his high prices.  even early in our history as an accordion importer, some of the officers of large accordion associations tried to block music magic usa from exhibiting at their annual festivals because they had financial interests in a competive dealership and used all sorts of misinformation and strong-arm tactics to keep their customers from even browsing our product booth, doing as much as to physically pull customers away and direct them to the competitive booth!  one year, they went as far as actually "banning" the display or sale of accordions at the accordion festival because the venue that year was located in massachusetts, close to mmusa's rhode island accordion roots so they preferred to unofficially quietly sell out of their hotel rooms rather than risk a public accordion vendor display where attendees as well as local media might lend visibility or take an interest in our new accordion models.  so that year there were no accordions displayed at an accordion festival - by an organization supposedly interested in promoting the instrument.  these are just tips of the iceberg we needed to melt as we shook up the american accordion market with more italian quality brands, unique models and fair pricing than had ever been seen since the instrument's heyday.breaking barriers by pushing, pulling and shaking up the industryso we know what tough is, and nobody appreciates the importance of treating a client sincerely, honestly and without prejudice more than we do at mmusa.do you really know what you are looking at?today, more accordions are being made at least partially out of inadequately aged and warp-prone softer asian wood (bodies), thinner gauge and more porous cardboard (bellows) and plastic rather than wooden or metal keyboard, body panels, valves and poorly constructed springy key/button mechanisms.   how do you know which models or manufacturers contain such cost cutting components? the best way is to find a dealer who knows and whom you know you can trust.  in fact, this is the only way to ensure that your musical investment is as good as gold and does not turn out to be simply "gold-plated".you'll know we're differentunlike most accordion dealers today, mmusa has been in the business of retailing, importing and designing brand new, pro and semi-pro italian accordion models - acoustic, midi, or 100% digital - for over 25 years.  our accordions have been "inducted" into the polka hall of fame in cleveland, oh, an accordion museum in italy, seen on tv on such programs as the jimmy sturr show as well as several network game shows.  we have supplied many top name musical venues such as madonna, u2, ludovic beier and bruce springsteen - to name a few.accordion specialistswe don't sell primarily pianos or other musical instruments with just a fraction of the business related to accordions.  we do not have a fat-filled pricing structure that some dealers employ to allow what appears to be a 'generous" trade-in towards an over-inflated new accordion price. we don't play games - we play accordions. you'll feel & hear the difference - your goal is our goala quality accordion of known origin and components, chosen from a curated selection of models featuring optimized playing characteristics, acoustic or digital, as well as unique lightweight amps with heavyweight sound and other accessories we feel are worth your consideration is what music magic usa is and has always been about.  we invite you to enjoy the mmusa experience for yourself! shop our online specials for great deals
