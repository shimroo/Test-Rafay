reenactment 
events through dramatization

reenactment is an activity in which people recreate or immortalize historical eras and events through dramatization, costumes, props, staging, and/or authentic environments. real-time role-playing, abbreviated to larp, can have a modern or fictional setting, but is often based on historical periods. here, people improvise and immerse themselves in their roles rather than playing from a pre-written plot. the focus may be on adventure and fighting or more social interaction. the plot can be inspired by various historical or artistic genres, such as sci-fi or military history.

about
both the civil war society of england and the sealed knot are societies that reenact battles (some of them fictional) from the civil war era in england. many historical reenactment groups exist with the national association of reenactment societies acting as an umbrella organization.







the heyday of the reconstructionist movement came in the period between the two wars. it was no longer the small ancient cities that were involved in this process, but the large cities with significant populations - birmingham in 1938, manchester in 1939. these were important industrial centers that were struggling with their present economic crisis.
