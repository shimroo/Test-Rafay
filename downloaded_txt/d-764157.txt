what are they saying? 






rev. douglas lofton

we have used the faith leader material in two churches.  all i can say is that it changes lives and it changes the churches where the students live out their ministry plans.







rev. helen enari

we now have leaders who are not afraid to talk about their faith, who are not afraid to lead, who are excited about ministry, and who are not afraid to speak of the transforming power of god in their lives, in the church and in the world.  







rev dr. donna scott

here is a resource for a church committed to spiritual formation.  this material grows from the contemplative stream of the christian faith and includes all of richard foster’s streams.  it moves beyond education of the faith to formation of the faith by focusing on the individual’s deep growth by experiencing the spiritual practices.  







rev. clover beal
