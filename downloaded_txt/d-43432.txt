missouri association of
teaching christian homes, inc. welcomes you to our home on the web.
in todayâs world, many families find themselves unexpectedly considering home education.

families may find themselves overwhelmed with where to begin. it is our goal is to encourage you along the way and provide you with valuable helps and resources that will help you make the best decision for your family.

what about virtual school options?

k12, mocap, and several other virtual schools are viable, school-at-home, public school options for many families. but by definition, they are publicâ schoolâ options. therefore they operate and are subject to different laws and guidelines as home schools (nonpublic, non-accredited).
