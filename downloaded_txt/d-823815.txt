your generosity supports our meals on wheels and seniors at lunch programs.
meals on wheels allows senior adults to live at home when they are no longer able to cook for themselves. trained volunteers visit each weekday around noon, providing brevard seniors with a hot meal, a friendly visit, and a safety check. they can refer participants to additional services and can even initiate an emergency response if necessary.
meals on wheels delivers meals to over a thousand homebound individuals in brevard county, with a waiting list of hundreds! rising cost of food and gas, challenges our ability to serve our current clients and it makes it impossible to help the seniors on the waiting list. your monthly contribution will allow us to face these challenges and continue to provide this critical service.
seniors at lunch is held at nutrition centers within the north, central and south areas of brevard county every weekday and provides hot meals and activities to hundreds of brevard‚Äôs aging citizens.
participants will enjoy food, friendship and activities. this program is vital for the social and emotional well-being of the seniors we serve.
