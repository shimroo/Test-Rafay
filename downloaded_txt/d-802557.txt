2024 community health assessment 










as the result of the recent temporary federal funding freeze, rocky is remaining vigilant.on monday, january 27, 2025, rocky mountain development council, inc. (rocky) faced an unexpected challenge when the federal government announced a temporary pause on grant funding that rocky programs rely upon to support vulnerable individuals and families across lewis & clark, broadwater, and jefferson counties. while the memo announcing the funding pause was quickly rescinded, rocky remains vigilant, knowing that ongoing federal program evaluations could lead to future uncertainties.rocky is the community resource for vulnerable individuals and families. rocky is committed to improving quality of life, especially for low-income citizens in the tri-county area. with rocky’s programs being approximately 70% federally funded, any disruption - however brief - has the potential to impact essential services. once the original scare passed, rocky staff got right to work coming up with plans to provide for our customers. rocky is financially stable, and we will keep providing for the people in our communities.this year marks rocky’s sixtieth year of addressing senior services, childcare and early childhood education, energy services, and housing. in 2023, 177 children aged 3-5 received free early childhood education from rocky head start, and 58 children aged 0-5 received care and education from rocky mountain preschool center. nearly 1,000 seniors in the tri-county area received meals in senior centers, 82,010 meals were delivered through rocky’s meals on wheels program, and rocky agency on aging provided mediations or customer advocacy interventions for 1,710 seniors. close to 3,000 individuals were assisted by the low-income home energy assistance program, rocky provided safe housing for 382 individuals, and 179 people received valuable information at rocky’s first-time homebuyers classes.if you feel compelled to give in this uncertain time, please visit rocky's donation page!
