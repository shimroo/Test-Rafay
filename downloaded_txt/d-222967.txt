team zr-1 was started in 1990 for hardcore corvette owners, who enjoy supporting this american made sports car, in any way that would foster a better view to the public.




team zr-1 corvette racer's core business is custom performance tuning.




team zr1 believes the car belongs on the road / track and not buried in a history book, and will help show, that the nameplate was correct in designing such a high level sports car, even with all the state and federal policies that clearly make it difficult to design such a sports car, but meet all those policies and the public view of what a sports car should be.
