travel guard – helping our customers around the world























helping our customers around the world
our team was able to help a husband and wife during a medical situation that occurred while they were traveling in antarctica. we’re incredibly proud of our medical assistance coordinators, and the invaluable work they do every day to help our customers around the world. 



















why customers love travel guard











"the process was fast and efficient. i managed to get coverage on the same day of departure. we decided at the last minute to go for a ride across the border and got the medical insurance immediately. we truly appreciated this. all went well but it was reassuring to know that if anything happened‚ we were covered."
- jacinthe, niagara falls, on













"the day i arrived in puerto vallarta i injured my foot. travel guard offered to arrange transportation home for me‚ further medical treatment, or whatever i needed. thankfully the injury was not that bad and we were able to continue our holiday. i was very impressed with the speed in which i was helped and the extent of help available. i will never travel without a policy from this company. thanks again."
- sharon, alberta
