academics

sanford offers all the advantages that make an independent school education so valuable. our bold approach to learning offers every student a rigorous, engaging, well-rounded, college-preparatory curriculum. sanford students delve deep into core subjects, music, visual arts, world languages and cultures, and athletics. led by our stellar faculty, sanford students become critical thinkers, adept problem-solvers, independent learners, powerful self-advocates, and effective leaders. our expectations are high, but so is the genuinely caring, developmentally appropriate support we provide at each level. as a result, sanford students leave as articulate, creative, self-assured, caring, and responsible young people who return to tell us how well prepared they feel not just for college but for life.

logan herring, sr. '00, chief executive officer, the wrk group
"i only spent two years here, transferring in my junior year, and chose sanford because i simply wanted to attend a school where i felt comfortable. little did i know the profound impact the sanford community would have on my life in such a short time as it supported and pushed me out of my comfort zone into a pursuit of excellence in my journey. i return every year to coach and re-invest in the next generation of warriors as they pursue their journeys and go on to change the world."





mesha mosley '16, young alumni board member
i've had the privilege of being a part of the sanford community as both a student from 2012-2016 and as a faculty/staff member from 2020-2021. once i returned in 2020, many things had changed since i was a student, but the heart and identity of sanford remained the same inclusive, compassionate, and student-focused environment that i had left. stepping back on campus, i felt like i was back at home, but it had been renovated! now, i am happy to serve on the young alumni board, working to connect the past and present community. sanford will always remain close to my heart.





peter walpole '11, young alumni board member
i attended a different school in third, fourth, fifth, and sixth grade, but when my family found sanford, i was finally home. sanford is certainly the best school in delaware, but it is so much more than that. the school sets students up for success, yes, but it is not simply a launching pad for some imagined future endeavor; it’s actually enjoyable to attend! i reflect on things i learned at sanford every day and am proud to count so many of my classmates, teachers, and coaches as friends more than ten years later.





jen nightengale '82, sanford faculty member & alumni parent
"i have many fond memories of being a sanford student. whether participating in sports, performing on stage, or focusing on my studies, my teachers and coaches were always there to support me. today, as a middle school faculty member and coach, i'm excited to help prepare my students for high school, college, and life."





clint williams, sanford parent & faculty member
"it took just a few days for me to realize i had hit the jackpot with this teaching job, and now, over a decade later, i still feel this way. the support we as teachers get from our administration is unheard of in the world of education, and we are fortunate to teach at a school that is student-centered. my wife, noel, and i are the proud parents of our son, elliott, who loves sanford as much as we do. we are excited about his future and look forward to someday watching him walk across the stage in the quad as a sanford lifer."





laura jezyk, sanford faculty member & parent
"when i began teaching at sanford, i knew i was joining a wonderful school community, but i did not anticipate how quickly it would become like another family to me. teaching and learning are my passions, and i feel honored to be a part of an institution that celebrates, honors, and inspires its educators every day.”





lisa lloyd-washington, sanford parent & trustee
"jana thrives at sanford. she is getting an excellent education and she loves to go to school every day. i give sanford credit for her love of learning and for her desire to pursue any and all interests. members of the sanford community have similar values to those of our family, and jana will continue to be a great citizen thanks to those aligned values."

lauren downs '22
caught storming down our hilly campus during a school event with mix-match socks (because her sock philosophy is—life is too short to wear the exact same sock on each foot), lauren arrives with a cool energy that is inviting, humble, and down to earth. she is a change agent, someone willing to take a stand and speak up for what is right— especially on environmental matters. teachers point to lauren's work ethic, natural intellectual ability, and enthusiasm as the determining factors in lauren's success. she has painstakingly selected her courses each year to provide extremely high rigor with balance, so she can meaningfully engage in her extracurricular activities with energy and purpose. she has done a commendable job in managing her strenuous workload, and her thoughtful approach to all she does makes her quite successful and beloved by her faculty mentors.












nnanna njoku '21
