what we do

making games is a lot of fun, but there's dirty work that needs to be done to get them into your customers' hands. we've learned how to do those things through experience, and we want to use that experience to help you do it too. we've seen a lot of good projects and even more bad ones and can help you either way. every game is a different beast. we will give you a custom quote and a custom delivery schedule. we will use your repositories and your tracking systems and your communication services and keep you informed of everything that happens - and if you don't have those things - we can help you with those too. contact us today to get a personal consultation and find out what we can do for you.

porting

we know porting games. cross platform engines can get you part of the way there, but thereâs still a lot to be done. we can integrate the frameworks and features that the other platforms need. we can replace the api's that don't work, and fix the broken shaders. you make your game in unity or unreal or your own custom engine, and we'll help you get it to your target platforms.

psychonauts in the rhombus of ruin - from unreal psvr to steam and oculus vr.

submission

we've built and published games on every major platform you can think of: nintendo, sony, microsoft, steam, oculus, apple, google, amazon, facebook, and others. there's a lot of differences between the platforms and we've navigated them all. we've gone through submission requirements successfully the first time, and helped resolve submission failures when things didn't go as expected. we're experienced in the processes required to set all of the services up and meet the submission requirements.

super dungeon bros - for xbox one, windows 10 store, ps4, steam mac/pc.
carnival king - for nintendo wiiware.
winning kick - for ios and android.

programming

for those that just need some help getting your game finished, or adding a new cutting edge feature to an existing product, we can help. we've been there when there are zero google results to an error message. we've interfaced directly with the engine builders and os builders and gotten things that weren't working fixed. we've used languages new and old. we've butted our heads against improbable problems and we've found the solutions required time and time again.

built an xna game engine that ran a subset of unity on windows phone 7.
configured and built ffmpeg to create movies on an android phone.
wrote a custom mini server to handle pvp facebook challenges and store results.

r&d

the market is constantly evolving. we've implemented systems that have been built on alpha game engines, using pre-production hardware running on experimental os's. we've brought vr and ar systems to life, using the latest devices on the market, from custom vr glasses for your phone to the hololens. we've used game engines that aren't out yet, and we can figure out the systems that aren't fully documented. if it's possible, or maybe even slightly impossible, we can get it done. we can help you be first to market.
built a distributed video/audio capture system with automated movie generation.
built a simple hololens demo to show an animated model on a table.
helped unity harden their unet libraries for networked gameplay.
