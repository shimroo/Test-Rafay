welcome to jane reichhold's world of poetry that will make you say, "ah ha!" as you discover and explore the many short form genres of poetry. may your time on this site be blessed. 
the bulgarian translation of the bare bones school of haiku has a new home with maya lyubenova on her website. (http://mayalyubenova.wix.com/jane-haiku-lessons)
thanks to maya for finding a better home for all the work so many did with the translation.

dear lynx readers,
thanks to your good wishes and prayers, my tail bones are knitting nicely so that i have been able to exchange the walker for a cane. however i still do not have the ability to sit in a chair for as long as it would be necessary to compile an issue of lynx. we do have a full issue!
so, werner and i have decided we should skip the june issue of lynx to try for the october one. this is the first issue we have missed in 24 years, so it is with great regret that we ask your cooperation with this. please hold your submissions until we do get an issue out. all the materials accepted for the june issue are now being held for the october issue.
if this a problem for anyone, let us know so we can work it out.
jane & werner
  may 2014

on tuesday, march 11, president obama signed into being the point arena -stornetta national preserve. that is about 12 miles up the road from us, but this is just across the road.     
  
aha books is proud to announce the publication of
symbiotic poetry
      multi-genre / multi-media in action 
      by
      jane and werner reichhold 
 as a backup and a reinforcement to the idea that we need a  new term for the poetry inspired by or based on genres from other cultures,  jane and werner reichhold have compiled works that prove the richness that  results from symbiotic poetry as already represented through their magazine mirrors and then from lynx for over 20 years. here you can  discover and read poetry freed from imitation but still closely inspired by  other cultures that appear mixed in startling ways. poets and writers will be  stimulated by the combination of solo works from these two authors plus the  unification of their poetry, creating a new kind of multi-genre, multi-media  anthology.
list  price: $14.00, 7.5" x 9.25" (19.05 x 23.495 cm), 282 pages, 2014.
      isbn-13:  978-1494422776; isbn-10: 1494422778; bisac: poetry / anthologies
available  from createspace store $14.00   https://www.createspace.com/4529473 
      amazon.com  $12.27; amazon.de: €9.44; amazon.co.uk  £7.33

  aha books announces two new books that are very special and yet have no haiku or tanka in them. in 2001 jane became interested in a system of daily prayer known as a "divine office" - getting business-like and serious about prayer. inspired by jim wilson's zen book of hours, jane created for herself a book of hours for the grateful heart that is non-denominational; it is for the spiritual. this project is now available for others in  
  
an 8 x 11  coil-bound book of 118 pages. it is like a workbook so that the prayers are completely individualized with your concerns and your friends and family.
  because doing the liturgy or divine office usually involves the use of the psalms, jane found she could not pray  them because of the ideas of violence and retribution given to the idea of god. also knowing that the psalms are some of the most magnificent  poetry, she set the lines free of chapter and verse to return them to being verses as they were intended. in psalms as new testament god is returned to the new testament idea of being loving and compassionate part of our lives.
  
psalms has 300 pages in 6 x 9 perfect-bound, cover - by heidi vetter!. both books are available at lulu.com  
  blessed be!

    this  second book represents a continuation and an extension of the collage series  presented in book 1. the collages in book 2 include more social aspects  important to artists during the past centuries. also new and therefore  enlarging the former aspects of collage is the integration of picture and  poetry in some of the works. if you liked the first book, band 2 will continue  the surprise and delight.
