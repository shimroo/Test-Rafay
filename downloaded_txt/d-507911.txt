listen
-to your website business concerns
having an online presence for a business is its lifeblood. when primary hub starts a project for a client first and foremost we have a conversation with the business owner listening to
every aspect of his/her concerns of what, when, where, who, how, why do they need a website. the function of a website is help the business owner keep their finger firmly on the pulse of their sector. primary hub will outline all aspects of the business owners goals and projections. with this crucial information only then can primary hub proceed to the next steps of the web presence project.
 
 
 


learn
–your business and online competition
primary hub will learn the aspects of your business, the value of your product/service, its features and benefits and uniqueness against your competition. your customer segment: who will buy/use your company’s products/services. your channels: how will your company deliver its product/services to your customer. finally, the tasks your company needs to succeed. primary hub will apply what it learned in designing/building your web presence to achieve your company’s goals and expectations.
 
 



 
 




 

analyze
-strategy to give your business the best online presence
the internet market for your product/service is always changing a competitor may have launched a new website and is flooding the market with the keywords your website is promoting and this may make your website disappear from the search engines. on a weekly basis you have to analyze your website marketing statistics: how many people looked at your website? where did they come from? how long did they stay? what did they do- buy? did they schedule an appointment? did your storefront get more visitors? all this is part of what primary hub will do in maintaining your website once it’s operational.
 
 
 


build/design
-your digital marketing website
attracting a potential customer is hard enough. grabbing their interest and retaining them is even more difficult. it’s important to design your site so that user frustration is kept to a minimum and user experience has high unique value proposition (uvp). uvp is the primary thing that determines whether users leave or stay on your site. primary hub’s website design will be high value uvp. uvp is the determining factor in all of primary hub’s website design.
 
 



 
 




 

tell the world
-how  wonderful your company is to do business with.
this is the most important aspect of the website. the website has high value uvp (looks fabulous). telling the world all has to do with your market segment. are you a restaurant and want to target a radius of 10 miles from your location. do you do on-site service calls and want to cover a radius of 100 miles from your office. do you sell product online and want to reach a national audience. all these different aspects have to do with digital marketing and keyword analysis in telling the world about how wonderfu it is to do business with you. primary hub will utilize all aspects of the internet to make your phone ring, create foot traffic, make more appointments, make product leave your warehouse faster.  primary hub’s commitment to you  is to see you succeed with your web presence.
