                               the village of north palm beach 
								(fl) adopted a citizens master plan in 2017. a major recommendation
								was to update the village's codes to authorize and 
                               encourage redevelopment that would implement the master plan. 
                               a major code update for commercial and mixed-use development began in 2018; spikowski planning 
                               worked with dover, kohl & partners on that update. the updates were adopted

collier county, fl


							the collier mpo (collier county fl) updated
							 the previous (year 2040) long-range transportation plan (lrtp)
							  to a new planning horizon year of 2045. spikowski planning
							   assisted jacobs engineering and collier mpo staff
							    in this effort, primarily by creating two detailed land-use scenarions
							    for collier county for the year 2045 so that travel needs can
							    be simulated for each scenario. this revised lrtp was adopted in december 2020.




building types



						despite the diverse palette of buildings found in our most beloved neighborhoods, 
						zoning codes typically use a blunt system 
						 that regulates buildings by their current uses and setbacks.
						  a coding technique found in some form-based codes
						   applies pre-defined âbuilding typesâ to enable a finer-grained mix of
						   âmissing middleâ housing types. bill spikowski and tony perez recently published a 
						     guide on how to use building types in zoning.

                              urban areas. a new zoning code was then adopted to 
                              incentivize redevelopment; however, the code was 
                              overly rigid and remained unused. spikowski

                              spikowski planning was retained by the town to 
                              negotiate this agreement on behalf of the town.

planning for rural areas often

fort myers beach, fl


after 
                              forty years of zoning administered by lee county 
                              (fl), the town of fort myers beach retained 
                              spikowski planning in 2004 to create a entirely 
                              new zoning map to accompany the new land 
                              development code. this map contains conventional 
                              zoning districts for its stable neighborhoods, 
                              form-based zoning districts for its redevelopment 
                              areas. obsolete zoning actions 
                              were transferred to a separate "historic" zoning 
                              map for reference purposes. 
 





fort myers beach, fl


in 
                              2006, fema released preliminary flood insurance 
                              rate maps that would replace maps 
                              that had regulated development at fort myers 
                              beach (fl). the new maps would have precluded 
                              sidewalk-level commercial uses in much of the 
                              townâs pedestrian core. spikowski planning, the 
                              townâs general planning consultant, commissioned 
                              tomasello consulting engineers to peer-review 
                              femaâs models. once all errors were corrected, the 
                              revised maps were far less damaging to downtown.

in 
                              just five decades, cape coral (fl) has gone 
                              from uninhabited to one of the largest cities in 
                              florida. yet much of downtown is still single-story buildings in 
								strip 
                              format. spikowski planning assisted dover, kohl & 
                              partners in preparing design downtown, a 
                              2002 cra master plan for downtown cape coral (fl), 
                              and a form-based code to implement that plan. a 
                              later plan for downtown cape coral, the south 
                              cape vision plan, was prepared by zyscovich 
                              architects in 2011. 


 

form-based codes


the
                              form-based codes institute (fbci) is a 
                                think-tank that develops standards for 
                              form-based codes, a type of zoning that can 
                              achieve community visions based on time-tested 
                              forms of urbanism. fbci promotes the widespread 
                              adoption of effective codes, develops  
                              standards, and educates public officials and 
                              professionals on coding principles and practice. 
                              bill spikowski is a founding board member of fbci 
                              and has taught every level of code courses

                              1994, bill spikowski wrote farmworkers in lee 
                              county: the housing challenge to identify 
                              housing needs of migrant farmworkers. this study 
                              was instrumental in the formation of the 
                              non-profit group partnership in housing, inc. 
                              this group used the studyâs findings to obtain 
                              federal grants to construct pueblo bonito, 130 
                              units of affordable housing for families in bonita

fort myers, fl



                              floridaâs great recession scuttled many of the 
                              high-rises proposed for the waterfront in downtown
                              fort myers (fl). six redevelopment parcels 
                              surrounding centennial park suddenly became 
                              available and could be used to expand this 
                              riverfront jewel for a small fraction of their 
                              cost just several years earlier. centennial park 
                              is a busy venue for political, entertainment, and 
                              religious gatherings, as well as a daily 
                              playground for city residents and host to a weekly 
                              farmerâs market.

                              plater-zyberk & co. to update a 1986 downtown 
                              master plan. the new 2003 plan was based on the 
                              principles of new urbanism, focused on pedestrian 
                              connectivity to the built environment, streetscape 
                              improvements, increased residential densities, and 
                              restoration of the historic structures. this plan 
                              was updated in 2010 by acquest realty advisors.

								collier county (fl) integrates 
								planning at the front lines of battles over 
								sprawl, traffic, ecology, and equity. the 
								public realm is defined as not only streets and 
								urban open spaces but also systems of habitat, waterflow, and traditional 
								rural patterns. examples are provided to retrofit 
								introverted subdivisions and transform

                              beach (fl) are fiercely loyal to their quiet 
                              neighborhood and feared that unchecked commercial 
                              expansion of the townâs primary tourism district 
                              would overwhelm them. in 1999, spikowski planning 
                              was retained by the town to conduct a 
                              santos/palermo circle planning study. outcomes 
                              included a street-tree planting program, new

                              (fl) promoted the revitalization of the downtown 
                              core area, centered around old san carlos 
                              boulevard and crescent street, the historic 
                              nucleus of commercial activity. in 
                              1999, the town retained dover, kohl & partners and 
                              spikowski planning to create a master plan that 
                              focused on high-quality public spaces that would 
                              promote walking and neighborliness and encourage 
                              reinvestment in private properties. 





lee county, fl


population and housing projections
							are the basis for expanding public water supply wells and treatment plants.
							spikowski planning prepared separate projections through 2030 for cape coral,
							fort myers, and sanibel/captiva, and for all of lee county (fl).
							the lee county regional water supply authority used this data as part of its water
							supply master plan. these projections were closely coordinated with planning for
							future roads by the metropolitan planning organization. 





lee county, fl


in 
                              1986 florida required all counties to adopt 
                                comprehensive plans. lee county (fl) had 
                                just created a new plan but it had to be 
                              revised to meet the new requirements. as a 
                              principal planner for the county, bill spikowski 
                              coordinated this major plan update. innovations included a reduction in the  
                              amount of land designated for development, a water 
                              resource designation protecting the public 
                                water supply, and a privately funded 
                              infrastructure program for newly developing areas.





greater pine island, fl



                              in 1982, bill spikowski drafted an early planning study for
                               greater pine island, titled "pine island at the crossroads."
                              this study examined road access, hurricane evacuation, 
                              potable water supply, and island character. an overall plan
                              was proposed for greater pine island, reflecting a historic community
                               with distinct residential and shopping areas, an important waterfront,
                                and valuable natural resources.
