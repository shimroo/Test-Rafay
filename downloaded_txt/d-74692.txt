if you live in or work for a company in mississippi, you might have to file a state income tax return. mississippi has a graduated income tax rate, meaning your income determines your tax rate.

source: mississippi department of revenue




residents can take advantage of the deductions and exemptions the state offers. single filers can claim a deduction of $2,300, while married taxpayers can receive $4,600. for exemptions, single taxpayers receive $6,000, married households claim $12,000, and the state grants $1,500 for each qualifying dependent.
who has to file mississippi state taxes?
if you lived in mississippi or worked for a company based there, you must file a tax return if your income exceeds the deductions and exemptions. for single taxpayers, your gross income must be more than $8,300, plus $1,500 for each dependent. married taxpayers must make more than $16,600 plus $1,500 for each qualifying dependent.
you should also file if you had mississippi tax withheld from your pay but do not fall under the guidelines for filing. doing so enables you to receive a refund.
companies residing in mississippi must also file a state income tax return. the mississippi department of revenue allows you to register for a tax account online. while there, you can file your tax return and pay any balances owed.
