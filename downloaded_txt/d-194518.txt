over 50,000 satisfied customerscustomer commentsi thought the package was great. i was having difficulty putting into writing my duties and responsibilities. it really helped having many resumes in my profession to copy. i surfed many sample resumes on the net but most had a very simple format giving little valuable information. certainly nothing that i would spend any time looking at to hire someone. i am very impressed with my resume thanks to you. thanks for your interest in my opinion!!l.s. (computer programmer - boston, ma) i am sending this brief note to say how impressed i was with this service and for giving me specific ways to change my resume to enhance my skills and experience to attract future employers.   after using your examples, i have been pursued by recruiters and i am receiving offers for top companies that would not have looked at me any further on my previous resume. i would recommend this service to any one who is interested in presenting themselves to a company in a top notch professional manner and who wants to receive immediate results. thank you.   s.m. (senior vice president - houston, tx)the resumes i purchased online were exactly what i was looking for. they gave me great ideas for tailoring a resume to fit my own educational and work history in an eye catching manner. i finished my own resume in about an hour and received an interview from each and every one of them! thanks to the professional quality of the resume sent, i was able to find my dream job in only two weeks.  thank you so much for offering this service.c.w. (sales representative - portland, or)
