welcome to buckman pta!
 
 
upcoming events & important dates
 
annual art show & sell fundraiser!
date: saturday, march 10th, 10 - 5pm
our biggest fundraiser of the year supports our annual pta budget, allowing us to do all the things we do at our arts focused school. volunteer, sell your art, or come support local artisans from around the city. 
 
call for artists! submit request by november 15th!
learn more and sign up to volunteer
 
 
who we are:


we are a group of parent and family volunteers who dedicate time to create an inclusive and enriching community where students, teachers and families feel supported, valued and respected.


 


what we do:


fundraise to support our teachers and classrooms, support arts and library integration, and create community events throughout the year.


advocate for increased school funding from both portland public school district and the state of oregon. this is done through writing letters to state representatives and other elected officials, attending pps and pat board meetings, attending town hall sessions with elected officials, participating in lobby days in salem, supporting local public school coalitions, and much more.


volunteer at the local pta clothing closet each year, which provides clothing and basic necessities to pps students.


coordinate  events throughout the school year to help build community, safety, trust and belonging.


family fun nights in collaboration with our school sun program


fall festival


art show & sell (our biggest fundraiser!)


family dance


teacher appreciation week




 
how you can help:


you can support us by becoming a paid pta member through oregon pta. purchasing a membership allows you to vote at general meetings, and supports us in continuing to be recognized as a nonprofit organization.


sign up to volunteer at one of our many events throughout the year. we are always in need of volunteers and can’t do all we do without them!


make a tax deductible donation to our pta


join a pta committee! if active committees don’t interest you, we always welcome volunteers to create their own committees to accomplish something they want to do at buckman!


consider donating food at one of our evening meetings or morning coffee chats.


join konstella - our online communication platform for all things pta! konstella is a great way to keep up to date on school and classroom happenings, and to connect with other families.
