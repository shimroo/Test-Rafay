				our mission is powered by you
your arpf is honored to have collaborated this year with many great people to share the benefits of our 4 pillar program.
with our pink brain™ project at ucla, we have completed very important research on preventing alzheimer’s disease in at risk women; those in menopause who are noticing a drop in their memory. moreover, this critically important research has practical applications to help women thrive in their busy lives caring for their family, parents, and others.
men have also benefited from our research and when you think about the fact that we designed and funded this work, it’s really amazing.
it’s also amazing that we couldn’t have done this and our other cutting-edge research at leading medical schools without your support. 
beyond that, we have worked with people from all areas of research and healthcare and social work and yoga therapists and facilitators and educators who dedicate their lives to sharing their work as well, to help you prevent and reverse memory loss, through our world-renown brain longevity® therapy training.
this year alone, we’ve hosted incredible webinars to share many aspects of alzheimer’s prevention, participated in major conferences, issued new publications and presented two sessions of our delightful meditation challenge.
with your help, we continue to serve humanity with our monumental movement of hope and change.   
all of this tireless work requires financial support so at this time of the year we are asking for your assistance.  please consider donating before the end of the year so this amazing work can continue and grow.
donate today!
thank you for inspiring us to do more.

welcome to the leading voice on the integrative medical approach to the prevention of alzheimer’s disease.
most baby boomers’ health priority is “staying mentally sharp as i age.”
beyond that, their #1 fear is developing alzheimer’s.
we all know the frightening statistics, but arpf’s mission is to empower you to take action because, yes, you can prevent cognitive decline and dementia

testimonials about brain longevity therapy training






“this training was a great opportunity to integrate my diverse professional background into a cohesive, prevention-focused, research-based approach for brain wellness and dementia support. i appreciated the varied topics and presenters, self-paced design, and ease of assimilation upon completion of the training. i feel prepared to take this important information out into the world to improve the quality of people’s lives with or without a diagnosis.”
– trudy r., bltt graduate








“this is my second time taking this training and it is even more enjoyable than the first time. i find that my attention span and focus at age 64 has actually increased. i am happy to say that after a year of daily practice of kirtan kriya, there is no doubt a direct correlation to these factors. one of my brain exercises is to enjoy walking and memorizing challenging mantras while walking in nature.”
– karen g., bltt graduate








“you have been generous and incredibly supportive. our whole community has benefited from your shared research and wisdom. i’m grateful to be part of this vibrant, positive, important community!”
– denise b. bltt graduate
