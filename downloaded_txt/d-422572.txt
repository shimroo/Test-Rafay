mayor daley, cta officials celebrate the completion of the brown line capacity expansion project


officially marks the completion of renovations to fullerton and belmont stations


 


1/9/10 -- mayor richard m. daley, chicago transit board chairman terry peterson   and chicago transit authority president richard l. rodriguez joined   federal, state and city officials today at the fullerton rail station   for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the completion of 18 station   renovations as part of the cta’s $530 million brown line capacity   expansion project. 

belmont and fullerton – the final two stations to complete construction –   were rebuilt in the same locations and now include elevators for   customers with disabilities making 91 of the cta’s 144 rail stations now   accessible.  cta preserved the two historic stationhouses at each   station and relocated them across the street to serve as secondary   entrances.

“the completion of these two stations and this entire program represents   a great enhancement of our transportation system and moves us closer to   our goal of bringing accessible, reliable service to riders of the   brown line and to riders of the cta system across chicago,” said mayor   daley.  “this project is a good example of how essential capital   investment projects are to the economic growth and development of our   region. i am also happy to report – especially in these difficult   economic times – that this project was completed on time and on   budget.”  

the brown line capacity expansion project was designed to relieve   congestion, provide for future growth by increasing capacity, and   improve service delivery, safety and customer comfort. the project also   made the brown line accessible to all cta customers, in accordance with   the americans with disabilities act (ada) guidelines.

"cta continues its efforts to make its system easier to navigate for everyone who uses buses and trains to travel throughout the cta service area," said cta president richard l. rodriguez.

the new auxiliary entrance/exits  provide more convenient access  for customers transferring to/from westbound buses on belmont and  fullerton. customers must have a valid farecard to enter through the auxiliary  entrances. staff assistance is available at the main entrances located  across the street from the auxiliary entrances.
with the elevators at belmont and fullerton, a total of 91 out of the 144 cta rail stations are accessible to customers with disabilities.  all cta buses and trains are accessible.
the elevators at belmont and fullerton were installed as part of the cta’s larger $530 million brown line capacity expansion project, which is designed to increase capacity and accessibility and bring 18 stations along the line to a state of good repair.
belmont and fullerton are the last of 18 stations renovated through the project.  the two stations have remained open during construction and they are scheduled to be fully complete by the end of 2009.

as a
                          result of the
                          resumption of four-track operations at the belmont
                          and fullerton stations, a new rail schedule also will
                          go into effect on december 28, 2008 that will improve
                          travel times along the red, brown and purple express
                          lines.
                            with the recent completion of three-track operations
                              at the belmont and fullerton stations, red, brown
                              and purple express trains have resumed normal operation
                              on all four tracks. as a result, customers will
                              have improved rush-hour travel options, faster
                              travel times and more frequent service.
the frequency of brown line trains operating during
                            the morning and evening rush periods will increase

                            40 minutes.
during the morning and evening rush periods, red
                            line trains will run every three-and-a-half to four
                            minutes. with red line trains operating eight minutes
                            faster, a trip from the howard terminal to downtown
                            will take approximately 32 minutes compared to an
                            average of 40 minutes during three-track operation.
and the frequency of purple express trains to the
                            loop will increase from every 15 minutes to every
                            eight minutes during the rush periods.  a trip
                            on a purple express train from howard to downtown
                            will be 35 minutes compared to 40 minutes during
                            three-track.

                            december 29, purple line express trains will return
                            to the direction of travel used before the three-track

escalators
                          added to fullerton and belmont renovations




                        the construction work to realign the tracks at the belmont
                        and fullerton brown line stations will be accelerated,
                        allowing the cta to restore the southbound
                        track to service                        by the end of 2008, six months earlier than previously
                        announced. 
southbound brown, red and purple express
                          trains have been limited to one southbound track at
                          belmont and fullerton since march 30 while the platforms
                          are being rebuilt and tracks reconfigured to allow
                          room for the installation of elevators at both stations.
                          as a result of three-track operation, cta has supplemented
                          bus service near the stations and added personnel and
                          signage in an effort to assist affected customers. 
                          in addition, the cta announced that it will add escalators
                          to the belmont and fullerton stations. the original
                            plans provided space for future installation of escalators
                          but because the project remains within its budget and
                          on schedule the cta has determined that there are sufficient
                          funds to install two escalators at each station. the
                          escalator installation is scheduled to be completed
                            by december 2009.

                        operation at the belmont
                        and fullerton stations has started.
                        
effective march 30, 2008, southbound trains are
                          limited to one  track at the belmont and
                          fullerton stations due to construction for the brown
                          line capacity expansion project.  to
                          help ease the impact, the cta is operating
                          eight-car trains on the brown line during morning and
                          evening rush hours.   the introduction of eight-car
                          service has  occurred nearly 18 months earlier than
                          originally planned. 
paulina and
                          wellington stations
                           closed for renovation on march 30.   while
                          the stations are under construction, brown line trains
                          will bypass both stations.
also on march 30, the cta  reopened the southport station
                          and opened a temporary station at diversey.
                          both stations had been closed for construction and
                          are now able to accommodate eight-car trains.  using
                          a temporary station at diversey  makes it possible
                          to reopen for service nearly three months earlier than
                          originally planned.  work
                          to install elevators and complete the stationhouse
                          at diversey will continue throughout the spring.

                        cta updates three-track service plan  providing
                             more brown line service during rush periods



after evaluating travel patterns, ridership and
                            service over the past six weeks of three-track operation,
                            cta president ron huberman said today that both bus
                            and rail ridership have increased compared to pre-three
                            track levels. rail service has performed well through
                            the construction zone and the signaling systems have
                            been accommodating trains as planned, with capacity
                            for additional trains to be added back into operation.
                            as a result, a total of seven brown line trains—three
                            in the morning and four in the evening--have been
                            added
                            back to the schedule and adjustments will be
                            made to bus service beginning tomorrow to support
                            routes that have experienced the most ridership growth.

                        three-track operation begins april 2 at belmont and fullerton
                            stations



effective monday, april 2, 2007, red, brown and
                            purple express trains are operating on three tracks
                            instead of four at the belmont and fullerton stations
                            on the city’s north side. 
although trains will continue to stop at the stations
                          during three-track operation,
                          one of the four tracks along the platforms at each
                          station must be taken out of service while the platform
                          is rebuilt and tracks are reconfigured to allow room
                          for elevators to be installed. the specific track to
                          be taken out of service will vary during the course
                          of the project. 
the construction is a phase of the brown line capacity
                          expansion project which, when completed at end of 2009,
                          will allow the cta to accommodate more customers in
                          this busy and growing corridor and will make all brown
                          line stations accessible to people with disabilities.

a new northbound platform and tracks have been built
                            at the fullerton station. the new platform and tracks
                            are located east of the current platform and tracks.

                            slightly differently.
brown and purple express trains will use the new track
                          and customers will board from the newly constructed
                          platform.  customers should board trains on the
                          east side of the new northbound platform.

                          be used for boarding northbound red line trains only.
                          customers should board trains on the west side of the
                          platform.
boarding for southbound trains will not be affected.
