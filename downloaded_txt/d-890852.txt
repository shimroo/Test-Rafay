god’s plan of salvation
the most important decision that any of us can ever make is to accept god’s gracious offer of forgiveness and eternal life in heaven by placing our faith and trust in his son, jesus christ, who died on the cross to pay the full and complete penalty for all of our sins. for more information: god’s plan of salvation
