know how
we’ve heard from over 12,000 of our fantastic customers lately, and guess what? they’ve let us know some of the areas they’d love a bit of help with you understand how to use the bus. so we decided to create a few know how tips to lend a hand. enjoy!







zero-emission mission
it goes without saying that we care about the impact we have on our planet. we’re not one to blow our own trumpet, but *cue trumpets* we’re a leader in decarbonisation, investing £250m in transitioning toward a zero-emission bus fleet by 2035 with over 650 electric buses on the road, cutting down emissions. how’s that for a breath of fresh air?
