the ultimate pass thru entity



people
                  engaged in computer consulting and working as independent
                  consultants know that there are many organizations claiming to
                  function as low cost pass through entities. 
the llc is the ultimate
                  no cost pass through entity. with your own llc, you own the
                  contracts you get. this site provides resources for creating
                  and managing the free agent llc (tm) (free agent llp (tm)) and also provides an
                  interactive directory of temp agencies and consulting firms
                  specializing in information technology .
with a limited
                  liability company, computer consultants, programmers and other
                  it professionals can also compete for outsourcing deals and
                  contracts.

relationship,
                      l.l.c. (a delaware limited liability company) publishes a number of websites
dedicated to temping, consulting and self-employment.
in general, our hot temp jobs (tm)
sites (http://htj.rllc.net,
http://www.hottempjobs.com
and http://www.hottempjobs.net)
will primarily be interactive directories of temporary help agencies and
consulting firms that hire temps and consultants/freelancers.
hot
contract jobs.com
(tm) will be similar to the hot temp jobs (tm) websites, but will allow for
discussion tailored more to consultants.
our tempcity (tm) websites (http://tempcity.rllc.net,
http://www.tempcity.com, http://www.tempcity.net)
will serve as a resource center for people who create their own llcs to
market their labor and on self-employment in general. the tempcity (tm)
websites will, in general, list employers and indicate contact info for
getting contracts with those companies.
if you are in need of work and you are
turning to temping in new york city nyc, you have to just start registering with
temp agencies until you find some that give you work.
there is no real way to know which
agencies will give you work and which ones won't.  i once registered with
this agency at about 1:00 pm and i was convinced that i would never hear from
them. the agency called me at 4:00 pm that day asking me if i could work that
night.
if the agency forces you to go through
very elaborate registration rituals, they either don't have any work or they
don't like you, for one reason or another. sometimes it is advisable to keep
calling into an agency asking if there is work available, but in general, if
they are not calling you, you need to keep registering with more agencies until
you find ones that do call you. knowledge of microsoft office is a required
basic skill, but if an agency really needs people they will train you in
whatever it takes to send you out on jobs.

the
                    limited liability company 

the
                  limited liability company (llc)" is an exciting new
                  business structure that has the pass-through tax benefit of a
                  partnership and the "limited liability" protection
                  of a corporation. we believe that the llc will revolutionize
                  relationships (see relationship llc) and the workplace.


limited liability companies are not taxed
    when classified as a partnership, rather the members pay tax, at the personal income rate,
    on the money which they receive from the limited liability company. an llc can be viewed
    as a partnership which has the advantage of a corporation in that the members/partners are
    not liable for the debts of the llc, nor are they liable to each other.

llcs are recognized by all fifty
    states, the federal government and internationally.
"the origin of this
    relatively new institution is generally attributed to the german law of 1892, authorizing
    the gesellschaft mit beschrnkter haftung...once established in germany, the concept of the
    llc had a very active and fast growth... within a short period of time after enactment in
    germany, the following countries joined the limited liability bandwagon: portugal (1917);
    brazil (1919); chile (1923); france (1925); turkey (1926); cuba (1929); argentina (1932);
    uruguay (1933); mexico (1934); belgium (1935); switzerland (1936); italy (1936); peru
    (1936); columbia (1937); costa rica (1942); guatemala (1942); and honduras (1950). 13 univ
    pitt l rev 193 (1952)."

infrastructuring (tm)



employers have many
                  labor options available to them. employers may hire employees
                  directly as "permanent" at-will employees,
                  employee-leasing, use temporary and contract labor and
                  outsource functions entirely. we believe that outsourcing work
                  to an in-house independent employee-owned labor pool or
                  support llc (tm) is the best possible labor solution. in
                  addition, by way of an equity stake in the support llc, your
                  company can have a shared investment in the success of this
                  independent labor pool and achieve additional cost
                  savings. 
so called
                  "permanent" employment is legally classified as
                  employment-at-will. legally this means that the employment
                  contract can be terminated at any time by either party for any
                  reason (more or less). in other words "permanent"
                  employment is minute to minute (or second to second) and there
                  is no contractual guarantee or implication of a long term
                  relationship by either the employer or the employee.
the republican party
                  has made it its mission in life to preserve employment-at-will
                  and to protect the employer's right to fire employees-at-will
                  at any time for any reason; the federal government only
                  requires that if an employer is going to fire a lot of
                  employees-at-will, that it give legal notice in advance. as
                  far as we know, every court in the country has refused to
                  allow statements in employment handbooks and/or oral promises
                  by the employer to be used to transform employment-at-will
                  into employment for a specified duration (i.e to transform the
                  employment relationship from being at-will into the employment
                  being a property interest).
you are not an employee
                  at will if you have a contract to work for a specified
                  duration or you are a government worker. in these types of
                  employment, your job is considered a property interest. what
                  this means is that your job is property (something you own)
                  and therefore your job cannot be taken away unless your
                  employer first accords you due process of law.
temps are
                  employees-at-will just like "permanent" employees,
                  both types of employment are minute to minute and there is no
                  implied guarantee of long-term employment. permanent employees
                  are merely suffering from a grand delusion, whereas temps know
                  that they may not have a job tomorrow. health benefits,
                  retirement, etc. are merely part of the compensation (and
                  should be taxed as such). i doubt that anyone would say that a
                  permanent secretary making $12.00 per hour with benefits is
                  better off than a temp making $50.00 per hour with no
                  benefits. the fact is that temps and consultants are
                  subsidizing "permanent" employees because
                  "permanent" employees get compensated in the form of
                  employment benefits which aren't taxed.
an employer on long
                  island once promised to pay new hires $5,000 a year as a
                  signing bonus. the $5,000 was to be reduced by a certain
                  percentage a year until it became zero. it was argued in court
                  by a discharged employee that it would have taken more than
                  200+ years for that $5,000 to become zero and that therefore
                  the employment relationship was not "at-will", i.e.
                  that the employment was for a specified duration and a
                  "property interest". a federal judge refused to
                  allow this argument and held that even with the promise of
                  compensation for 200+ years, the employment was still at-will. this
                  is typical of courts in the us, employment-at-will is a us
                  institution, it is sealed in stone and the us is the only
                  major industrialized county in which the majority of workers
                  are employees at will.
employment for the
                  majority of workers in the us is government by their state's
                  master servant clause. the master servant clause holds that
                  employment, unless contractually stipulated to otherwise by
                  the parties in a written contract, is at-will and that the employment contract may
                  be terminated at any time for any reason by either party.
as a result, the
                  unemployment rate in the united states could technically be
                  nearly 100% in 90 days because there is no legal barrier to
                  employers firing all at-will employees if they choose to.
                  clearly, employment-at will is a threat to the national
                  security interest of the united states.
