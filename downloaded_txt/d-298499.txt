    love, rest, and adventure: why couples need to prioritize vacation time


 by alicia demo
•
january 10, 2025

there's something magical about waking up in an unfamiliar place, the morning sun streaming through curtains that aren't yours, with the person you love beside you. no alarm clocks, no rushing to meetings, no everyday responsibilities—just the promise of adventure and connection stretching out before you.                                                                                            the modern world seems designed to keep us perpetually busy, constantly connected to our work emails, and forever chasing the next deadline. this reality is starkly reflected in a recent                                              expedia annual vacation deprivation report                                  : 32% of americans wait at least a year or more between vacations—nearly double the rate of other countries. even more telling, 65% of americans feel they don't have enough time off, despite 86% believing that vacation time is critical for their health and wellbeing. in this endless cycle of productivity, we often forget that humans aren't meant to operate like machines. we need periods of rest, reflection, and rejuvenation—not just as individuals, but especially as couples. the science behind this is compelling: studies have shown that taking regular vacations can reduce stress, lower the risk of heart disease, improve sleep quality, and boost mental health.                                                      but beyond these physical benefits, vacations offer something even more precious for couples: the opportunity to rediscover each other. think about it—when was the last time you and your partner had an uninterrupted conversation that wasn't about work, household chores, or daily logistics? vacations create a sacred space where we can step away from our roles as employees, parents, or caregivers and simply be lovers again.                                                                              the shared experience of exploring new places together creates neural pathways in our brains associated with joy, adventure, and connection. when couples travel together, they're not just accumulating instagram-worthy photos; they're building a reservoir of shared memories that strengthen their bond. whether it’s trying a new restaurant or learning about a different culture, these experiences become the stories we tell for years to come.                                                      vacations also provide a unique opportunity for couples to grow together. when you're navigating an unfamiliar place or culture, you're forced to work as a team. maybe one partner is better at reading maps while the other excels at striking up conversations with locals. these complementary skills create a dance of mutual dependence and appreciation that can reinvigorate a relationship that might have fallen into routine.                                                                              from a mental health perspective, the benefits of vacation time are profound. the physical distance from our everyday environment helps create mental distance from our stressors. this break from chronic stress allows our bodies to reset, our minds to clear, and our emotional batteries to recharge. for couples, this mental refreshment often translates into increased patience, better communication, and a renewed capacity for empathy and understanding.                                                                                           the physical health benefits of vacations shouldn't be understated either. the reduction in stress hormones like cortisol can lead to improved immune function, better cardiovascular health, and more restful sleep. the impact extends to professional performance too—research published in the                                              harvard business review                                               found that for every 10 hours of vacation time used, an employee's year-end performance improves by 8%. perhaps this explains why 89% of workers tell the                                              pew research center                                               that they consider paid vacation time extremely or very important in their job benefits. couples who vacation together often find themselves naturally more active—walking through new cities or hiking through natural landscapes. this physical activity, combined with better sleep and reduced stress, creates a powerful cocktail of health benefits that can extend well beyond the vacation itself.                                                                  the investment in vacation time is really an investment in your relationship's future. couples who regularly take time to travel together report higher relationship satisfaction and better communication. they're also more likely to stay together long-term, perhaps because they've learned the importance of prioritizing their connection over the endless demands of work and daily life.                                                                               ﻿

 




   

    the history of berlin


 by alicia demo

december 20, 2024

the history of berlin, ohio                                                      berlin, ohio stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of early american settlers and the amish community that would later make this region famous. while the town's name might evoke thoughts of its german counterpart, this quiet village has its own unique story to tell. in fact, berlin is the oldest existing village in holmes county.                                                                               a name with two histories                                                      the settlement of berlin began in the early 1800s, when hardy pioneers first carved their way into what was then the northwestern frontier of the young united states. john swigert (from berlin, germany) and joseph troyer (from berlin, pennsylvania) were both integral players in the creation of the town. the town was officially established in 1816, taking its name from both berlins. the original design included 108 lots spread over two streets. a majority of the earliest residents came to berlin from pennsylvania but were of german or swiss descent.                                                                              the amish influence                                                      the arrival of the amish in the mid-1800s marked a significant turning point in berlin's history. these industrious farmers, seeking religious freedom and fertile land, found both in abundance in holmes county. the amish brought with them not only their distinctive culture and agricultural expertise but also their own traditions of courtship and marriage, which continue to fascinate visitors to this day.                                                                              a rise in importance                                                                   for many years, benton was the most important commercial center in holmes county. two important developments helped berlin surpass its neighbor five miles to the northwest. the first development was the completion of the national road. the major highway connected the potomac and the ohio rivers. around the same time, wagon access to zanesville was improved with enhancements to zane’s trace. berlin saw a period of exponential growth as a business center. the village was the proud home of machine shops, a foundry, dry goods stores, hotels, tailor shops, blacksmith shops, a tannery, and distilleries.                                                                  the second big development was a thresher factory. berlin holds the distinction of having the first real factory in holmes county. built in 1847, the factory brought jobs and increased berlin’s economic foothold in the county.                                                                               a prominent family                                                      the pomerene family is one of the most notable families in berlin history. dr. peter p. pomerene was born in holmes county and moved in berlin in 1855 to practice medicine. dr. pomerene was married twice and had 12 children. four of his sons became doctors and two became attorneys. the most famous of his children was atlee. born in 1863, atlee attended princeton university and then cincinnati law school. he served as u.s. senator and assisted in the creation of the federal trade commission and the federal reserve system. in 1928, atlee was a candidate for the democratic nomination for president. the pomerene house stood as a beacon in main street in berlin until it was torn down in 2021.                                                                              the oldest restaurant                                                                   visitors and locals can still partake in a meal at the oldest continuously operating restaurant in berlin, ohio.                                              boyd and wurthmann                                               has been open since 1938. it started as a grocery store but the demand for home-cooked meals and community kept growing. within two years of opening, the green counter (which still stands today) was built so locals could enjoy lunch and pie. boyd and wurthmann is now open six days a week for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. when you go, be sure to save room for dessert. there are 15 to 20 different pie options available each day.                                                                                             berlin today                                                      perhaps one of the most remarkable aspects of berlin's history is how it managed to preserve its small-town charm while adapting to changing times. the arrival of electricity in the early 1900s brought modern conveniences, but the town retained its connection to simpler ways of life, largely due to the influence of its amish population.                                                                              today, berlin has approximately 1,500 residents yet it stands as one of ohio's most visited small towns, drawing thousands of tourists annually. holmes county, ohio sees four million tourists each year. the town center, with its mixture of traditional architecture and modern amenities, tells the story of a community that has managed to embrace change while holding onto its core values and traditions.                                                                              the romance of berlin's history continues in its present-day charm. local bed and breakfasts housed in historic buildings attract couples seeking to experience the town's nostalgic atmosphere. the clip-clop of horse-drawn buggies, the aroma of fresh-baked goods wafting from local bakeries, and the sight of rolling farmland create an atmosphere that seems drawn from a simpler, more romantic era.                                                                              as berlin moves forward into the 21st century, it remains a unique testament to the enduring appeal of small-town america. its history, woven with threads of pioneer spirit, cultural preservation, and quiet romance, continues to captivate visitors and residents alike, making it much more than just another dot on the ohio map.

 




   

    a tale of two theaters: entertainment in ohio's amish country


 december 9, 2024

the                                              ohio star theater                                               in sugarcreek and the                                              amish country theater                                               in berlin offer visitors unique entertainment experiences in the heart of ohio's amish country. these venues showcase different aspects of local culture and family entertainment, each with its own distinct character and charm.                                                                                            the ohio star theater, housed in a historic building in downtown sugarcreek, has long served as a community cornerstone for live entertainment and performances. this intimate venue specializes in family-friendly musical productions. the theater regularly features local talent alongside touring performers, creating a warm, hometown atmosphere that perfectly complements sugarcreek's nickname as "the little switzerland of ohio."                                                                              throughout its history, the ohio star theater has been known for hosting holiday specials, particularly during the christmas season, when the venue transforms into a festive destination featuring seasonal music and performances. the theater also serves as a gathering place for community events and occasionally screens classic films, maintaining its traditional role as a small-town movie house while embracing live entertainment.                                                                                           the ohio star theater often offers a combined show and buffet ticket option. with one of these tickets, guests can enjoy dinner at the                                              dutch valley restaurant                                               (conveniently located next to the theater),                                              berlin farmstead restaurant                                               in berlin, or                                              der dutchman                                               in walnut creek. it’s a full date night in ohio amish country with one ticket.                                                                                            meanwhile, the amish country theater in berlin takes a different but equally entertaining approach. this venue has built its reputation on family-friendly comedy shows that playfully celebrate and gently poke fun at the unique culture and lifestyle of ohio's amish country. their productions often feature a mix of music, comedy sketches, and variety acts that appeal to visitors eager to experience local culture. the amish country theater is a great place to see tribute band concerts in ohio amish country.                                                                              the amish country theater's shows frequently incorporate local themes and characters that have become audience favorites over the years. their performances typically blend traditional values with contemporary humor, creating an experience that bridges the gap between amish culture and modern entertainment. the theater is known for its clean comedy approach, ensuring that shows remain appropriate for audience members of all ages.                                                                              one of the distinguishing features of both theaters is their commitment to maintaining strong connections with their communities. while the ohio star theater often collaborates with local schools and community groups for special performances, the amish country theater works closely with area businesses and tourism organizations to provide authentic entertainment experiences for visitors to the region.                                                                              both venues have become important parts of ohio's amish country tourism landscape, offering evening entertainment options for visitors who have spent their days exploring the region's other attractions. they serve as cultural bridges, helping tourists better understand and appreciate the area's unique heritage while providing quality entertainment that brings people together.                                                                              these theaters demonstrate how traditional venues can maintain their relevance in modern times while honoring their communities' values and traditions. whether you're seeking musical performances at the ohio star theater or comedy shows at the amish country theater, both venues offer memorable experiences that capture the spirit and charm of ohio's amish country.
