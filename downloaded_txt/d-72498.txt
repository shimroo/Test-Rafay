i have been using your educational software for years now and am really glad for a chance to say how fab they are. they are better than any other i've found for educational purposes and a fraction of the price. all the kids who have used them at my school love them and i think you are a very very clever man!!

3d printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file. the creation of a 3d printed object is achieved using additive processes. in an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. 3d printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine.

mary beth, usai've been a happy olltwit user for years - i downloaded several of your programs back in '04, for my older son to use. now it's time for my younger son to use them, and i've come back to your site to find 1) i owe you, and 2) you have more great stuff. i'm happy to pay up because i know the quality of your programs.

much easier. thank you for the wonderful work you are doing.

thank you for adding a personal touch and much value to your software programs.  i have shared them with young and old and professional too, to find that everyone loves them for the same reasons . . . they are effective, easy to use, uncomplicated and family oriented.  qualities that are so very hard to find these days.
