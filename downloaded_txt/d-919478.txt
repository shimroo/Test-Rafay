schedule my intro


     a white background with a few lines on it



we train at guardian primarily because of the family atmosphere. everyone there treats us as family and cares about our jiujitsu journey, our health and our well-being. we have some of the best instructors and competitors in the region right here to work with us.we have grown so much in the past 18 months as a family. discipline and mental strength have made a huge impact in our son’s progress both on and off the mat. we train to get strong mentally and physically and the guardian family has been there for us the whole way. it helps so much to know they support us.the guardian team has exceeded my expectations in many ways. they truly care about us beyond just jiujitsu. it’s really a wonderful team to a part of it.

the staff is wonderful and the structure, amazing! the way this gym becomes more like family is incredible to witness and be a part of! my daughters joined with my husband and after seeing what it has done for them i joined in january! it is a great time, you learn a lot and the coaches are super supportive, and great with my kiddos! they also have great merchandise, great after school programs for kids, womens’ only group, sometimes they host a parents night out and they truly just want the best for all of their students. i recommend guardian and always will!

i started going to guardian to help gain some self confidence and learn how to defend myself. this school has given me that and so much more! i always feel welcome here and i couldn’t recommend this school enough! the instructors are knowledgeable and very helpful and are always open for questions.

rising star berlyn gamlin looks to claim gold at the biggest kids competition in the world the “kids pan american championship” on july 21st. 

taking 40 gold medals in her early career already she has a great shot of winning. what’s even more impressing is that she has accomplished all this with only two and a half years of training.

 berlyn took second place at the kids pan american championship in 2021. she also has a very impressive submission win record. winning almost every match she’s been in via submission. 

we look forward to seeing her crush it this year! #guardianmma
