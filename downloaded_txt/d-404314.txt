welcome to the cyberworld of "deepsea dawn"














































































                    dawn wright (aka "deepsea dawn") is chief scientist of the environmental systems research institute (aka "esri") and a professor of geography and oceanography 
                    at osu, where she has been on the faculty since 1995. prior to joining the osu faculty, she was a seagoing
                    marine technician for the international ocean drilling program and a 
                    post-doctoral research associate at the noaa pacific marine environmental 
                    laboratory in newport, oregon. a few years
                    after the deepsea vehicle 
                    argo i
                     was used to discover the wreck of the 
                    rms titanic
                     in 1985,
                    dawn was presented with some of the first geographic information system (gis) 
                    data sets to be collected with
                    that vehicle while a graduate student at ucsb. it was then that she first 
                    became acutely aware of the challenges of applying gis to deep marine 
                    environments. she has since
                    completed oceanographic fieldwork (oftentimes with gis) in some of the
                    most geologically-active regions on the planet, including the east
                    pacific rise, the mid-atlantic ridge, the juan de fuca ridge, the tonga
                    trench, volcanoes under the japan sea and the indian ocean, and american samoa. dawn is also an elected member of both the national academy of sciences and the national academy of engineering.
