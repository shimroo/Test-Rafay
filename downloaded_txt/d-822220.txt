biglerville historical & preservation society


national apple museum


				founded in 1990, the national apple museum is housed in a restored pre-civil war bank barn and is owned and operated by the biglerville historical and preservation society. the museum's mission is to preserve and exhibit the history and attendant artifacts pertaining to the apple and tree fruit industry's history and contributions to the development and growth of adams county. exhibits include early picking, packing, and shipping of fruit, pest management, commercial fruit processing equipment, early orchard photographs and a recreated 1880's farm kitchen and a general store. the museum also features collections of farming implements, apple peelers and fruit labels and much more apple memorabilia.
