who we arefounded in 1971, h & h has been happily serving the bay area for almost 50 years.



as an adolescent, dave hawes worked part-time for his parents. but in 1971, he launched his own business after signing on his first service account.a casual observer might assume that the two h’s in h & h pool services, inc. stand for hawes & hawes – after owner david hawes and his wife, paulette. actually, they stand for his & hers, a title passed on to hawes by his parents, who started working in the pool construction business in the 1960s.
