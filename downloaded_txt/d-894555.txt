                incarnate word, 
                in whom all nature lives,
                cast flame upon the earth:
                raise up contemplatives among us,
                those who walk within the fire
                of ceaseless prayer, 
                impetuous desire.
                set pools of silence in this thirsty land.
            
australian poet - james mcauley 1917-1976
