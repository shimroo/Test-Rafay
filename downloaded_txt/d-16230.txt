											where can i find used auto parts
									 	

where to find used parts
now, more than ever, people are rebuilding vehicles from the ground up and used auto parts are a must in when they cannot be bought new. just about anytime you buy a part from your local parts store, its going to be refurbished, rebuilt or re-manufactured. when buying used auto parts anywhere other than your local parts store, always see the part before making your purchase. ask for pictures if they are unable to show it first hand. specialty stores usually carry a wide range of used auto parts that couldn't be used, too.

											how do i find good used foriegn auto parts
									 	

foreign auto parts
used foreign auto parts are sometimes extremely hard to find, especially for older makes and models. most foreign auto makers do not make parts that interchange as often as american made cars, trucks, vans or suvs. one of the best ways to find good used foreign auto parts is to visit online auto forums. at these forums, people who are building or have built vehicles just like yours or very similar will be able to help you find good used foreign auto parts.

											how doi i change the oil filter and what oil filter wrench should i use
									 	

changing your oil filter
when removing an oil filter, always make sure the engine and the filter has cooled. 
after the engine is cooled and if the oil filter can easily be accessed (sometimes you may have to loosen or remove parts to get to the oil filter), with a oil filter wrench, loosen the filter. if it feels like it's not moving and you can reach the filter with both hands, use both hands. once the filter is removed, take a look at it to see if there is excessive or unusual wear or metal shavings around the opening. if there are metal shavings or a question about what you see, consult your local mechanic for advice. if you have already drained all the oil from the vehicle and are ready to replace the oil filter, fill the oil filter about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way full with motor oil. install the oil filter, hand-tighten only, but firmly and do not use your oil filter wrench to tighten the oil filter. make sure you remember to install your oil drain plug and refill your crank case with motor oil.

											what does a harmonic balancer do
									 	

harmonic balancers
harmonic balancers, vibration dampeners or torsional dampener are used on an engine to stop or disrupt a vibration caused by the crankshaft. the vibrations give off a harmonic frequency and the harmonic balancer, made of both rubber and metal, is tuned to cancel out those frequencies, specifically. since the crankshaft has to twist every time it rotates, its gives off a harmonic frequency, and the harmonic balancer helps to control that twist and the vibration. the harmonic balancer serves a second purpose, as well. it helps the engine by adding weight to the front of the engine, which allows it to runner smoother.

											what precautions should i take when installing an aftermarket exhaust system
									 	

aftermarket exhaust systems: things to remember
when switching to an aftermarker exhaust system, there may be other changes that need to be made, as well. not only are you using an exhaust system that is possibly larger or may give your engine better back pressure, but it's also different than what the car manufacturer installed. 
many times, aftermarket exhaust systems and kits exceed the manufacturers suggested oem (original equipment manufacturer) exhaust. one of the main concerns when switching to an aftermarket exhaust system is the oxygen sensor. sometimes these sensors need to be replaced for top performance of the exhaust system. also, consider the location of exhaust when installed. changing the location of the exhaust pipes and muffler may interfere with other working components of the undercarriage or may deplete the exhaust's ability to perform as needed. using accessories, such as aftermarket exhaust or silencers, can also effect the exhaust's performance.
