dear friends, students & subscribers,
we have, after much consideration, and with  great 
regret, decided to retire from teaching ballroom dancing.
beginning in 1962 and till now, it has been a 
great ride!
we really appreciate 
being allowed to participate in your dancing lives
while we will 
no longer be conducting classes, we are not giving up our connection to the 
ballroom dance community. 
we will continue to maintain the ballroom chicago web site and will also keep 
sending out the weekly updates to all our subscribers.

we have missed and will miss seeing all of our students and friends. 
hopefully, we might see you on the dance floor sometime.

sincerely

bob & penny urbon

popular dance magazine
"dancing usa"

"the comprehensive magazine about dancing in the usa"
the april/may 2000 issue contained wonderful article about this web site, a copy of
which is printed below with the permission of the author:


reprinted from the article "our
favorite websites" 
by michael fitzmaurice

bob urbon does not meet the 
standard profile of internet entrepreneur. 
bob is not a twenty-something computer geek with no business experience 
and a hacking background. 
the proprietor of ballroomchicago.com is the former owner of the renowned
studio, chicago dance, and has taught dance for thirty-seven years. 
at the start of the year 2000, bob and his wife, penny, sold their studio
to world champion dancers gregory day and tommye giacchino, and began 
to focus their efforts on their fledgling website.

ballroomchicago.com provides information to dancers who are looking for 
what is going on in the local dance world. 
the information provided is very detailed and up-to-date. 
it includes information about local dance clubs, studios, ballrooms, 
and special events. 
ballroomchicago.com does not maintain a passive site waiting for visitors
just to log on and explore the site. ballroomchicago.com sends out a 
regular stream of e-mails each week delivered to an ever-growing list of 
area dancers.

for the social dancer, ballroomchicago.com makes finding a place
to dance on any night of the week as simple as counting to the music. 
every city should be so lucky to have an internet service like 
ballroomchicago.com.
we wish to thank michael fitzmaurice & dancing usa for the wonderful
article

this site has had millions of visitors
thanks for stopping by!!    

dear friends, students & subscribers,
we have, after much consideration, and with  great 
regret, decided to retire from teaching ballroom dancing.
it seems to be good time to stop while we are still able to dance 
and teach, rather 
than waiting until we are 
no longer able. 

beginning in 1962 and till now, 
it has been a 
great ride!
we really appreciate 
being allowed to participate in your dancing lives
while we will 
no longer be conducting classes, we are not giving up our connection to the 
ballroom dance community. 
i will continue to maintain the ballroom chicago web site and will also keep 
sending out the weekly updates to all our subscribers.

we have missed and will miss seeing all of our students and friends. 
hopefully, we might see you on the dance floor sometime.

sincerely

bob & penny urbon
