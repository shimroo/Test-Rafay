important updates for 2022 at renaissance kids! 

dear renaissance families,renaissance kids is currently open for online group and private classes! please contact us via email for the fastest response.
renaissance kids is excited to announce that we are currently searching for a new location that will allow us to open safely in-person as soon as possible. after 30 years of serving you from our 11911 san vicente blvd. location, we realized that the space did not meet the new covid-19 reality. central air, public bathrooms, and lack of fresh air are just not safe.  we are looking at spaces in brentwood village as well as in the brentwood corridor. (if any of you know of a space with an outdoor patio and windows that open for ventilation-please let me know!)you can email us at renaissancekidsinc@gmail.com or fromthefrontdesk@rkids.com. for texting, please use: (941) 900-4980for phone: (310) 207-4225in the meanwhile, along with our individual tutoring programs, here are a small selection of our upcoming group classes (please visit the individual class pages for more information):

temporary online home of renaissance kids enrichment center 

as the online memes have identified, “crisis schooling” provides neither the best of traditional schooling nor of homeschooling. whether your child is learning from 8 am – 2 pm on zoom or absorbing a collection of brainpop and khan academy videos, your work as parents has doubled. even parsing through the list of free educational opportunities available can be overwhelming.
however, while the details of the future may be uncertain, educational enrichment for your children is within your control. renaissance kids has been providing online and distance education for the last decade. for the last month, we’ve been helping families transition to distance learning, supplementing school schedules and preparing students for the future. business is not *as usual* for any of us, but the education of our children is still paramount.
we currently offer virtual group and private classes to support or replace school curriculum. moreover, our june group offerings for k-8th grade in mathematics and reading/writing are intended to reinforce the essential knowledge expected for each grade level. at the elementary level, the erb is adapting by providing online testing options to member schools and our ongoing erb courses continue to provide our proven, knowledge-based curriculum.
if your child is at one of those nerve-wracking transition points, which necessitate jumping into an admissions process, we have your back. as private schools determine how to navigate admissions for the next year, we are confident that our knowledge-based isee preparation course continues to provide the dual use of helping students prepare for the isee and excel in 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. many of our group classes begin this summer or you can enroll your child in private sessions.
while our website is currently under construction, and all of our educators and staff are working from home, we are including a short list of our current and summer offerings here. please email us at renaissancekidsinc@gmail.com with any questions.
