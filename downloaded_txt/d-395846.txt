what we do 



what makes us authentic? 



 


 
grown in mother nature






 nothing can replace mother nature, that’s why our tomatoes grow in the earth’s soil and sunshine. 






 
vine-ripened






our tomatoes are left on the vine to ripen because that’s how to get the best potential taste and flavor in a tomato.  we never use ethylene gas, only mother nature. 






 
non-gmo seeds






the santa sweets grape tomatoes are grown from non-gmo (non-genetically modified organisms) seeds.
