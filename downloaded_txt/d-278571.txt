marissa & damany


“after years of trying to conceive on our own and through other fertility programs in our area, we knew something was different from the moment we walked into irh. our hope and faith in our ability to become parents was rekindled. dr. awadalla and every sweet nurse made us feel like our journey was important to them. today we are the parents we prayed we’d become and we didn’t hesitate to return to irh for the help conceiving our second child… coming soon!”
