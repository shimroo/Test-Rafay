your child’s faith in god is our top priority!



immanuel lutheran school is a christ-centered family where students grow in faith, experience individual academic excellence and prepare to use their god-given talents now and into the future.growing in faith | together as family | preparing for a bright future


























faith



your child’s faith in god is our number one priority. our faculty and staff look forward to partnering with you to teach your children about jesus and living a christian life. each day at immanuel, students study the bible, pray, and learn about jesus. considering a christian school is a step in the right direction for your child and your family.
















family



all families have challenges, no matter what their makeup: traditional families, blended families, single moms/dads, grandparents, and extended family. immanuel lutheran school is not a "shelter", but rather an environment led by christian adults. when your child enrolls at ils, they become a welcome part of our school family. 
















future



you think, dream, plan, and prepare for your child’s future. your child has unique gifts and abilities. your child may excel in math, science, art, athletics, language, or music. it is our joy as educators to develop those strengths while also teaching them all the skills necessary for a successful future.
