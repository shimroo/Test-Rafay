i moved to nyc a year & nine months ago because my editors at b/r took a chance on me. today, @foliomag named me a rising star in media. can’t express enough how lucky i feel today. big thanks to my editors @sullduggery & @tapperific for everything. #foliorisingstar pic.twitter.com/hge5wrk21b— joon (@joonlee) october 9, 2018



everything moves too fast but there is a need of time to go back to the source and find out what is true or not. the enemy of reporting is the lack of time and wanting to be first. @kenauletta #folioshow @foliomag pic.twitter.com/zlurlo0fpk— rachael wolensky (@rachw522) october 9, 2018



you are not normal. if you’re at #folioshow or you work in media, you are consuming more content and adopting new marketing models like #contentmarketing earlier than the average marketer or professional in other industries.
