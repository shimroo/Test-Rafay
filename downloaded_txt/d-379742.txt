      acknowledgement of country
  





unsw sydney’s kensington and paddington campuses are built on aboriginal lands.
we pay our respects to the bidjigal and gadigal peoples who are the custodians of these lands. we acknowledge the aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples, the first australians, whose lands, winds and waters we all now share, and pay respect to their unique values, and their continuing and enduring cultures which deepen and enrich the life of our nation and communities.
as a community, unsw arts, design & architecture acknowledges that aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples have survived and thrived through centuries of systemic injustice, exclusion, and erasure. as a new faculty, it is our priority to develop an indigenous strategy that is collaboratively developed, productive and purposeful to affect long-term change in the educational outcomes of indigenous students and the intellectual and cultural integrity of indigenous teaching and research across the faculty. 
read more about unsw’s indigenous strategy. please get in touch to be part of these developments and stay tuned as we share more information about our indigenous strategy.
