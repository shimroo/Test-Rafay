treating casually creates casualty – lisa enebelli

the holy spirit has been speaking to me about how familiar people are with god and how casually they treat him. many treat god so casually they decide whether they want to obey god or not; they choose how they want to treat people created in god’s image; they decide if they want to raise their hands, sing or not in church; shoot they decide whether or not they even want to pray. the spirit of familiarity has bred a generation of people who have treated god causally.

i heard the lord say ‘deeper depths, deeper depths, deeper – lana vawser

‘my people, the shaking is increasing. my people, the fire is about to increase in intensity in ways that you have not known before, and i am calling you, my people, deeper into the depths of my heart and my word. i am calling you into deeper consecration to hear and perceive that which i am speaking and what my spirit is doing.

the light of life – ron mcgatlin

the major transformation now taking place in our world is a change from the controlling influence of spiritual darkness to the loving influence of the spiritual light of god.  god’s light is the light of life. when we only have a part or color, all our life and understanding are colored by the color we have. when all the parts come together in love with god and one another, all the colors together become the whole clear light of god. we become the true bride of christ, fully restored into our god family.

yeshua speaks – what is it that i am doing? – nathan french

“i will expose, shake, test, and restore. i will continue to expose hidden darkness on a grand scale. many leaders will be tested, and those who pass the test will be increased. i am shaking every mountain so that what remains can be a new foundation made solid for building. the schools will be tested; those who are teaching falsely will be exposed. many false teachers are calling my true teachers false.  “i will make known false doctrines—the doctrines of demons that hinder real faith. i will restore families like never before. i will restore the fortunes of those who suffered loss. “i will…

a call to stand! entering kingdom authority and dominion! – faith marie baczko

the call to stand is a place of god’s recognition and the invitation into his counsel and the councils of heaven. with lessons learned from time spent in the secret place of the most high, ministering before the lord in the service of the priesthood, we have arrived at this extraordinary moment in time that demands god’s people now take their places as kings representing the kingdom of god. god is now securing his faithful servants in the position of kings to enforce the will of god and to rule under the authority of the king in this historic time.

putting the “super” into your “natural” – daniel pontious

over the years i have been getting instructions from the lord about the differences between natural laws and supernatural ones.  jesus constantly operated under and displayed the supernatural laws while operating in the natural realms of this earth. “and having seen that they were troubled and tormented in [their] rowing, for the wind was against them, about the fourth watch of the night [between 3:00–6:00 a.m.] he came to them, walking [directly] on the sea. and he…

do we always really know what is right or wrong? – ron mcgatlin

god is revealing deeper realities of his wisdom and his design of all things heavenly and earthly in this season of increased intimate love communion with his people on earth. the direct short answer to the title question is simply no; we do not always know what is truly right or wrong. but let’s look further into that answer. god is the only source of perfect, absolute righteousness or rightness.  therefore, only perfect alignment with god is right at all times and in all occasions of life on earth or in heaven.  all things that are not aligned with the will of god are wrong at some level. there is no middle ground between right and wrong, just degrees or levels of disorder.  these are deep and all-inclusive true statements of reality. however, let’s begin now to take a closer look at the more practical reality of attempting to know and do rightly.

prophetic insight week 1/20/25 – costly oil, masked spirits, & the era of divine justice – nate johnston

over the last few days, as i was praying about what to release for this week’s prophetic insight, the lord began to speak to me about those who had felt like they had given everything for the call in this past season but were finding themselves here in january still struggling to break through mindsets of disappointment and hope deferred. many felt like they had given everything, yet it seemed like nothing had come to fruition or had come to pass. i’ll even be bold and say that many have even felt disappointed in the lord.

holy ghost invasion (holy ghost ship) – by ron mcgatlin

originally published in january 2014, this prophetic article is even more meaningful today than when it was first published. we are currently seeing further fulfillment and greater significance of this prophetic word in this season of world transformation. this extreme world-changing move of god will not be on the national news media. for the most part the traditional church systems and large denominations will not be aware of this mostly unseen mighty move of god. unlike previous moves it will not be recognized as a separate identity or stream or denomination but will flow unseen to affect every heart of every person who is willing and obedient to…

the spark that ignites the world – ron mcgatlin

wow! this is one of those times! when i asked god what he wanted to say to his people in this article, he first gave me the title only. to put it mildly, i was astonished. he did not elaborate further at that time. i was not ready to ask him for more because it seemed too big and too awesome to hear suddenly. i felt that i needed some time and space just to be ready to hear. i know if i hear, i must move with it as he leads and that can have major repercussions in my life and relationships.  he said the spark, and not “a spark” and he said ignite the world not a part or portion…

holy spirit structure and gatherings – by ron mcgatlin

can there be truly spiritual family love experiences of gatherings with christ jesus as head in this world today?  the restoration of apostles and apostolic kingdom networks and gatherings are important areas of concern that are in the process of being understood. the natural minds of most people immediately erroneously consider networks to imply structure and organization.  the term apostolic is erroneously construed as an office of authority within the church system. major restructuring of the order of god on earth from heaven…

the great transition – by ron mcgatlin

what does the big shift look like?  god’s goal for the ministry of the church. the love of christ flowing from a pure heart is the most powerful world-changing force.  the primary goal is not a bigger group, more activities or better services, it is not even benevolent acts, nor greater prosperity, and not even more and better evangelism, neither is it healing or emotional healing and deliverance. all of these and more are the results of the goal of the “ekklesia” (assembly of called out ones). the goal is christ formed by the holy spirit in a people becoming his character and his nature in the world producing the kingdom of god and his righteousness.

the end of the age – ron mcgatlin

in this current season, god is revealing more about himself, his heaven, and creation. the deeper revealing of spirit reality is correcting and expanding man’s view of what the bible is really saying about the “end times.”  god’s universal laws, regarding the workings of spirit and natural or physical creation, never change. however, our view of the things of god continues to be adjusted, especially in this latter portion of the “end of the age” and in the beginning portion of the next age.

www.openheaven.com/2024/09/13/love-is-greater-than-all-creation-ron-mcgatlin/love is greater than all creation – ron mcgatlingod is love!love invading hearts and lives in the deep darkness of culture is a burning light igniting explosions of love, destroying the darkness of death with the glorious light of love. christ jesus, son of love, is exploding into the world in the hearts of this generation of change!true life in love with god is replacing the darkened culture with the culture of heaven. the past culture is smoke and ashes, and ahead is a living garden.the sons of god supernaturally empowered by love, righteousness, peace, and joy, are more than conquerors dissolving the darkness of death with the light of life.father god in christ jesus from heaven, within his living sons by the holy spirit, will do nothing outside of love.love is the foundation of all creation.all things from god, whether physical or spiritual, seen or unseen, were created in perfect order to work together in the harmony of love.returning to the order of godany action outside of love is out of order, and the whole creation is affected by it to some degree. god’s design of checks and balances press it back toward the perfect order of love. a small action of diversion from god’s plan by mankind will cause a small natural disorder, which in turn causes a response toward rebalance. a large diversion will cause a large disorder and response.these corrective responses are part of the natural systems designed into creation by the love and wisdom of god. god does not judge each disorder personally from the throne. adversity is a natural response from the created world’s systems to correct imbalance.  things such as adverse weather, sickness and disease, wars, psychological issues, and many other disorders in the natural world are caused by the lack of man’s intimate relationship with god.this does not mean that every personal issue of adversity is directly caused by the actions of the person or small group individually.mankind are all linked together overall and by groups such as the world, nations, tribes, families, and other groups. all the people, even the unguilty in a group, may suffer to varying degrees from the disorder and its resulting adversity.every adversity has a progressively decreasing effect from the original source of the disorder flowing out to the entire world. however, god knows how to protect and deliver those in love with him. (2 peter 2:6-9).god designed planet earth and all its systems through love to provide for the continuing life of mankind and all the needs of mankind and the world in the perfect order of the love of god.our in-love experience with god causes our willing obedience to his word, such as “you shall love the lord your god with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” luke 10:27.“come out from among them, and be separate, says the lord. do not touch what is unclean, and i will receive you.” 2 corinthians 6:17.mankind’s purpose and partthe reason for our creation and existence is first to be in love with god. god loves everyone, but only those who love him back are in love with him.  our part is to be his bride and produce sons of god in love, to take care of the world and all its created systems to the glory of god!being in love with god, we become of his nature, his love, wisdom, and power, bringing his righteousness (perfect alignment with god), peace, and joy on earth as it is in heaven.all will bow to love in christ jesus“that at the name of jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth.” philippians 2:10.love is the key to the power and wisdom of god from heaven on earth in his bride, overcoming and annihilating all evil darkness on earth and releasing righteousness, peace, and joy to the glory of god on earth as it is in heaven.  for it is written:“as i live, says the lord,every knee shall bow to me,and every tongue shall confess to god.so then each of us shall give account of himself to god. 13 therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother’s way.” (romans 14:11-13).love is mass destruction to evil darknessno mass destruction weapon of mankind can match the power of the natural earth’s giant earthquakes or even massive hurricanes or cyclones. and none of these can equal the unlimited, massive, destructive power of love against all that is not from god. love penetrates and dissolves darkness with light.only smoke and ashes are left of evil to fertilize or feed the growth of the new life of love in communion (or common union) with almighty god in pure holy love. the beautiful and fruitful garden of the culture of heaven prospers the earth.all of this is happening now and is spreading from the remnant out to the church and the world.families that have been estranged by the confusion of political and religious corruption and family line generational curses are being set free of their bondage to love one another and be rejoined as one family in love with god. thousands are coming to jesus in open-air-gatherings across the world.many smaller open-air revival gatherings of hundreds to a thousand or more are now seeing hundreds coming to christ.even in the small town that i live in, this week, over 300 people, including many young, received christ jesus as their savior in open-air meetings in veterans park.more people truly in love with god are living on earth now than ever before.yes, there is great darkness invading western culture and taking over governance, threatening to eliminate god and his people from life on earth.however, into this great darkness, the light of god is now shining brightly. the contrast is undeniable; people sitting in the darkness are beginning to see the light and are coming to god’s light and love.arise, shine;for your light has come!and the glory of the lord is risen upon you.2 for behold, the darkness shall cover the earth,and deep darkness the people;but the lord will arise over you,and his glory will be seen upon you.3 the gentiles shall come to your light,and kings to the brightness of your rising. isaiah 60:1-3.this is happening in our day and the days to come. awaken and praise god with all your heart and life. (psalm 57).come alive now. awaken, go all in, and all the way, with all god has laid upon your heart to do. as an old saying says, “make hay while the sun shines.”take it outside the walls now!find god’s way for you to sincerely take that which god has given you outside the church. do not take the church system or structure outside with you. the smell of religion is death to the starving people. they are starving for love and real life with righteousness, peace, and joy in the spirit of christ jesus. they want to give their lives to something real and of significant, lasting value.if you are gifted by god and can pray with people or inspire people in the love of god with music or speaking of the love of god, consider having your group gatherings in the park, the parking lot, the vacant lot, a rented space, the living room in the home, the business office, or buildings, open-air in good weather, or stadiums, and auditoriums or wherever. any suitable location will do as long as it’s not associated with religion in the minds of the people. (romans 15:9-11).among the love-starved people in the world is where the miracles and great works of god that demonstrate his love and power are done. whether rich or poor, the people are hungry for the real love of god that satisfies their hearts and souls.sincere actions of loving kindness are comforting expressions of god’s love that open hearts to the reality and goodness of god.this season could be a good time to pray earnestly in love groups seeking god’s leading of our part in this great time of world-changing presence of god. it may be a great time to gather in groups growing in love with god and one another, seeking our part in this mighty move of god.now is the timewe may not need to look back at past revivals or moves of god either in our lifetime or in biblical days and certainly not to some unknown day in the future. now is the time that really matters and makes the difference between moving in reality or waiting in hope.there is a time to wait, and there is a now time to hear and obey the blasting trump of the trumpets of god to be transformed and to transform the darkness of the world to the glorious light of the one true god of the eternal day.love never fails andhis kingdom never ends!ron mcgatlin

tear open the heavens & come down – elainetavolacciaug 9, 2024 | archived articles, articles, recent articlesawis brownaugust 3 2024tear open the heavens & come down – elainetavolaccii was reading the book of isaiah 64:1 where the prophet isaiah cried out to the lord in desperation, saying, “oh that thou would rend the heavens and come down.” the passion translation says in isaiah 64:1-2 tpt “oh, if only you would tear open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would tremble at your presence. then the mountains would quake and the hills would melt before you.”as i was reading this i heard the holy spirit say, “i am about to visit my people once again. their cries have been heard and they are about to experience the open heavens that they’ve longed for. i am about to release my glory across this nation and around the world. many will begin to experience extraordinary encounters in their personal lives and ministries.some of you may be thinking, but in the natural there are wars and rumors of wars. yes, darkness shall cover the earth, and deep darkness the people; but the lord will arise over you, and his glory will be seen upon you.” it’s imperative that you keep your focus on jesus at all times. don’t be moved by evil reports. be led by the holy spirit in these trying times. come up to a higher place above the turbulence and turmoil.even though circumstances in the natural world seem to be against you, remain steadfast and stand on the promises of the word of god. a spiritual awakening is underway, and many of you are discerning the intense battle raging in the heavenly realm. this is not just your imagination. it’s a real confrontation between the forces of darkness and the forces of light.some of you will begin to receive visitations and revelations such as paul experienced when he said that he didn’t know if he was in his body or out of his body.”he said in 2 corinthians 12:1 tpt, “i must boast, but it doesn’t do me any good. let me tell you about the visions i’ve had and the revelations i’ve received from the lord.”then the lord brought me to the story when jesus was water baptized by john. you could find it in all four gospels.matthew 3:16-17when he had been baptized, jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting upon him. and suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, “this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased.”everywhere that jesus went after the holy spirit came upon him, he experienced an open heaven. he touched and fed multitudes supernaturally, healed the sick and raised the dead. he has given us the same authority, power and anointing to walk and live under an open heaven. the same holy spirit has come upon us.that word “opened” is anoigō which is the same word that was used when jesus died and the temple veil was torn in two. it is the same word that was used in acts 16:26 when the prison doors were opened and paul and silas were set free. it’s the same word in john 9:17 where the blind mans eyes were opened. there is an open heaven available to you, but you have to contend for it. the forces of hell don’t want you to discover it.the lord is showing me that some of you are looking back to mighty revivals of the past and asking him to resurrect them, but the holy spirit is saying that he is no longer there — but he’s coming with something new! when jesus was raised from the dead, the angel went to the woman at the tomb and said, “he’s not here, he is risen.”in the same way, we need to seek the risen jesus who is going to send a fresh revival which may be unfamiliar to us, and appear different from the past revivals. he’s raising up a new generation who knows how to touch heaven and create portals to access the heavenly realms. he’s raising up new generals and a new body of believers whom the gates of hell will not prevail against. they will overcome and annihilate every evil assault that comes against them.many will begin to have angelic encounters as they seek the living jesus from among the dead. it is time to raise your vision higher. jesus is looking for those who will demonstrate his kingdom on this earth as it is in heaven with miracles, signs and wonders following. he is calling us to a higher level of fasting, praying and seeking his face in the secret place. this is the place where he will equip and empower us.some of you have grown weary from the journey. but the lord will meet you where you are, and ignite all the sacrifice’s that you’ve made to him. he will rekindle your faith once again and you will find the strength to pursue the vision that he’s given to you. you will run with the horses once again, and finish the race that is set before you, looking unto jesus the author and finisher of your faith.mark 1:9-11“one day, jesus came from the galilean village of nazareth and had john immerse him in the jordan river. the moment jesus rose up out of the water, john saw the heavenly realm split open, and the holy spirit descended upon him like a dove. at the same time, a voice spoke from heaven, saying: “you are my son, my cherished one, and my greatest delight is in you!” elaine tavolaccipo box 60414staten island new york 10306

our specific parts in kingdom life now – ron mcgatlinin god’s design, we are all created as individuals different from all others for specific purposes.each of us is unique by design and was never meant to all think or believe exactly alike. though we may agree in spirit, when examined to the core there are distinct differences in each of our hearts. this is god’s order of design to carry out our purpose or part in his kingdom in this life.“there are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit. there are differences of ministries, but the same lord. and there are diversities of activities, but it is the same god who works all in all. but the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for the profit of all.” 1 corinthians 12: 4-8.“for as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is christ. for by one spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether jews or greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one spirit. for in fact the body is not one member but many.” 1 corinthians 12:12-14.god has provided for all needs of mankind and all things in his creation on planet earth. he also provides in mankind the ability to administer and care for all things as his agents for oversight or dominion.god is concerned for all parts of mankind’s life on earth, whether spirit, soul, or body. the same holy spirit guides us in all fields of service and supply to meet the needs of mankind and the world around us.   father god by the holy spirit uses different languages, melodies, rhythms, tones, and terms of speech to communicate truth with different empathies to speak to the unique purpose or calling of the individual.religion and natural mindsall the thinking of natural unredeemed mankind is without the holy spirit and void of spiritual understanding and must interpret everything heard or seen only intellectually or with the influence of spirits of darkness.“these things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the holy spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. but the natural man does not receive the things of the spirit of god, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” 1 corinthians 2:13-14.the mind of man without the holy spirit tends to think and believe that their interpretation is always right. if they knew it was not right and something else was right then they would change and believe that, and then they are again right in their own limited thinking.similarly, all religious systems and denominations believe they are right, and if you believe differently, they believe you need to be taught. religious systems that are not truly led by the holy spirit will also lean toward the human mind’s intellectual interpretations, along with the influence of spirits of darkness. (1 timothy 4:1-2).this all leads to great division, separation, turmoil, and confusion. there is no natural human solution to this morbid condition of the world. the greatest natural minds and the most powerful artificial intelligence can never fix the world’s situation. all human efforts to fix it will only worsen it. it is like the old saying of putting the fox in charge of the hen house.god’s spiritual discernment and guidancethe greatest news ever is before us today. over two thousand years the solution to the world’s issues was provided in the birth, life, death, and resurrection of christ jesus, messiah, lord, savior, and king of the world.for the past two millennia, father god has been working on mankind to establish a people in christ and christ in them to release the full power and wisdom of father god’s unchallenged rule of love on earth as it is in heaven.in this season there is for the first time a strong and increasing remnant of seed people abandoning the traditions of lukewarm religious systems and truly falling in love with god and seeking his kingdom now in this life. the kingdom of god is within his people affecting the world around them. the manifested presence of god is stirring the love of god in and around them changing the atmosphere to be as in heaven on earth.through the in-love relationship with god, wisdom enables the people of his kingdom to discern that which is really of god and that which is not. his guidance through the holy spirit provides specific strategies to navigate the situations of life in the world.the death of the old and the resurrection of the newmany systems of life generated by mankind without the guidance of the holy spirit are unsound at the core and are not repairable. these must be reduced to ashes and new systems and ways of life from god raised up to bring forth the order of god as it is in heaven on earth.every person involved in life as it has been now at this time still has the opportunity to turn away from the past way of ungodly life without the love and wisdom of god. even those who are called by his name but are yet entrapped in the old systems can now turn from the old ways to the pure love and guidance of father god in christ jesus by the holy spirit.many will turn as they see the love life of god manifested in and with the remnant who are overcome and transformed by the all-consuming fire of the love of god. this is the great harvest.those who are truly saved but not willing to make the change will be taken to heaven prematurely.no one will remain alive on earth who opposes the love and rule of god in and with his people. nothing that man has built that is not of god will remain.the remnant is the seed of the new worldspirit jesus is discerning and dividing the sheep and the goats. the sheep are those who have been in love with god and served him by serving his people in whom jesus lives. the true body of christ jesus on earth now.the goats are the nations of people who are not in love with god and did not serve jesus by serving his people.the sheep enter the fullness of the kingdom of god on earth as it is in heaven and the goats are sent to perdition. (matthew 25:31-46).the new world is the kingdom of god on earth, the garden of eden lifestyle and order. the manifested spirit christ and spirit father god dwelling with mankind without the hindrances or damages of sin and death.natural mankind will be as one with god. there will no longer be a great transition or separation between the spirit realm and the natural realm.it is becoming as it was with adam and eve in the original garden of eden. they walked and spoke with god with no separation and no special preparation for entering the spirit realm. the spirit and the natural realms were one to them.however, when sin entered, they were afraid of god and hid themselves. then subsequently they were put out of the garden and separated from the spirit realm to abide only in the natural realm.now after two millennia of the provision for the restoration of the two realms as one, this is being revealed and believed by the remnant seed that are becoming one in love with god in spirit and truth.mankind is now entering the reality of walking in the spirit realm with god as we are beginning to grasp the reality of “live in the spirit and walk in the spirit.”“if we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit.” galatians 5:25.ron mcgatlinopenheaven.combasileia@earthlink.net
