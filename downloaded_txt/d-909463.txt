thanks to the wonderful work of brian denker a new site has been launched which is now the new home of the oversight of souls blog.

the new site has allowed me to bring together things i had in several places. in addition to hosting this blog it hosts links to audio, articles, syllabi, etc. i hope it will be useful. if you want to keep following this conversation, please update your book marks or feeds.

the value of testimonies





at our church each person who wants to join the church shares their testimony with the church in our prayer meeting as part of the process. it is wonderful to hear about the work of god in another person’s life whether the account be long or simple. yet, when i have commented on this here, many people have been nervous about the use of ‘testimonies.’ such ‘sharing’ may have in certain places taken precedence over direct revelation, but that does not mean there is no place for believers to praise god by sharing how he has been at work in their lives. we have found this to be a very useful way for members to begin getting to know new members.
my friend and fellow pastor, eric smith, has written a useful explanation of the value of such testimonies and i commend it to you.

gill on the pastorate





in john gill’s exposition of matt. 13:52, he gives a good description of the work of the pastor:
“…of which indeed christ is properly the householder and master, but gospel ministers are deputies and stewards under him, and under him preside over the household, and have the government of it, provide food for it, and protect and defend it; all which require large gifts and abilities, great love and affection, both to christ and his people; much wisdom, prudence, and knowledge; and great faithfulness and integrity, courage and firmness of mind.” (john gill’s exposition of the old and new testaments: volume 7, matthew to john, [1809]. reprint. the baptist commentary series, volume 1. paris, ar: baptist standard bearer, 1989, p. 157).

the church- conduit of the power of god





hezekiah harvey was a prominent baptist preacher, teacher and author in the 19th century. his comments here on the importance of the church are strikingly relevant today.

“the gospel becomes a permanent and aggressive power on earth only through the church, the divinely constituted organization, to which god has committed it, and through which it is appointed to act on men. the pietism which, in the professed interest of spiritual religion, undervalues the outward institutions of the gospel, finds no sanction in scripture; on the contrary, the church, with its heaven-given ministry and ordinances, there stands in the foreground as god’s agency for the conservation of his truth and the conversion of the world.”--h.h. harvey, timothy to peter, an american commentary on the new testament (philadelphia: american baptist publication society, 1890), 129.
several of harvey's books can be found online here.

rescue the perishing






rescue the perishing, care for the dying,snatch them in pity from sin and the grave(fanny crosby)
‘christ had the good of souls in his eye. he came to seek and save that which was lost …follow christ in this, o my soul, that thou mayst be a fisher of men. when thou studiest thy sermons, let the good of souls be before thee; when thou preachest, let this be thy design, to endeavour to recover lost sheep, to get some brands plucked out of the burning; to get some converted, and brought in to thy master. let that be much in thy mind, and be concerned for that, whatever doctrine thou preachest.’ 
(thomas boston, the art of manfishing, 79-80).

value of studying greek





from time to time here i comment on the value of greek for ministry. though many today seriously doubt the real, practical value of greek study for day to day ministry, i want to encourage pastors to discover (remember, or maintain) this value.

here is an astute comment from a current greek student:
“enriching our studies, however, is only a part of the value that is wrapped up in learning the biblical languages. for me, studying greek has been an incredibly beneficial process because of the discipline it requires and cultivates. a.t. robertson points out that learning the biblical languages is an enriching process for the mind [referring to this book]. an hour of study a day is crucial. not only it is required, but it is also a necessity for all of the understanding and memorization that is involved in the study. i can honestly say that learning greek is the most difficult thing i have been involved in, but it is a good challenge. i am more disciplined than i ever have been before, and i firmly believe it is due in large part to greek. it requires motivation, intentionality, patience and discipline. and not only does it require these things, but it cultivates them as well.”

faithful not flashy





years ago, while in college i read a few entries from oswald chambers’ my utmost for his highest. one entry really struck me and has stayed with me these last 20 years or so. in preparing to preach tonight for a student event, this came back to mind, and i was able to find it on the internet. there is much humbling and empowering wisdom here:

discipleship is built entirely on the supernatural grace of god. walking on the water is easy to impulsive pluck, but walking on dry land as a disciple of jesus christ is a different thing. peter walked on the water to go to jesus, but he followed him afar off on the land. we do not need the grace of god to stand crises, human nature and pride are sufficient, we can face the strain magnificently; but it does require the supernatural grace of god to live twenty-four hours in every day as a saint, to go through drudgery as a disciple, to live an ordinary, unobserved, ignored existence as a disciple of jesus. it is inbred in us that we have to do exceptional things for god; but we have not. we have to be exceptional in the ordinary things, to be holy in mean streets, among mean people, and this is not learned in five minutes.

philips brooks on knowing your congregation





“philips brooks presented three rules to students, introducing them with due solemnity:
‘i beg you to remember them and apply them with all the wisdom that god gives you. first. have as few congregations as you can. second. know your congregation as thoroughly as you can. third. know your congregation so largely and deeply that in knowing it you shall know humanity.’ ”
(geoff thomas, “find a place to settle,” 362, in thomas ascol, dear timothy: letters on pastoral ministry; thomas is quoting from philip brooks, lectures on preaching, 190)

john angell james on keeping watch





“the friends of evangelical doctrine, and the advocates of orthodoxy, have the following objects to keep ever in view in this age; they must take care of their bibles, that they be not mutilated or curtailed by lawless criticism; they must take care of their theology, that it be not perverted by false philosophy; and they must take care of their pulpits, that they be not occupied by heretical, unspiritual, or incompetent ministers.” - john angell james, an earnest ministry: the want of the times (xx)
"keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers" - 1 timothy 4:16

itching ears





this powerful warning from john angell james in his valuable book, an earnest ministry, still applies today:
“the prevailing disposition, therefore, to do such homage to talent, rather than to moral excellence, is only another species of idolatry, more refined and subtle than the worship of stocks and stones, but scarcely less guilty… but when the christian public is so enamoured of talent, as to admire it more than he message, which it is employed to set forth; when no preacher can be heard with pleasure or even endurance, however sound his doctrine, clear his statements, impressive his manner, or earnest his address, unless his discourse is radiant with the light of genius, and gay with the flowers of rhetoric; when truth itself is unpalatable unless it is sweetened with the honey of human eloquence, and even error so sweetened is swallowed for the sake of its luscious accompaniment; when the hearer of a sermon turns from it with disgust, because it fails to regale his fancy by the brilliancy of its images, or to lull his ear by the smoothness and harmony of its periods; when this is the state of the public taste, and it is to be feared that to a great extent it is the state of it now, surely it is time to call the attention of our congregations to something higher and better.” (250-251)

tolkien’s rangers as pastors





reading the return of the king (third volume of the lord of the rings) to my boys a comment from halbarad, a ranger and kin of aragorn, struck me as paralleling pastoral ministry. speaking of the shire, the peaceful land of the hobbits, he said:“little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet i grudge it not” (971).one of the words for pastors in the new testament is episkopos, typically translated as “overseer.” this word also has the connotation of “guardian.” this is part of what is in view in hebrews 13:17 when pastors are described as those who keep watch over the souls of their people.
if we do our task well, our people will often not know the labor that has gone into their safekeeping. but the true shepherd will not begrudge this. he will be satisfied to see his flock make it safely home to the celestial city.

singing psalm 127





psalm singing continues to be a great joy in my family having a standard place at our evening meal. we began a little over a year ago with psalm 128, and have added a few more along the way. as we began 2010 we introduced psalm 127 the other really strong family psalm. the version of psalm 127 found in the trinity psalter was pretty rough and awkward, so i worked on editing it seeking to follow the biblical text and to achieve more clarity in expression. in the end i still wanted to do more, but decided it was time to start singing with what we had- lest the pursuit of perfection mean the actual practice of nothing.

so, here is my edited version. it is still not as smooth as the version of psalm 128, but it has been useful to us and we all now know it by heart after singing it a few months. it is in the common meter so we have sung it to the tune of “amazing grace.”

psalm 127

1except the lord shall build the house
the builders work in vain;
except the lord the city keep
the watchmen watch in vain.

2‘tis vain for you to rise ear-ly,
or late from rest to keep,
to eat the bread of anxious toil;
he gives his loved ones sleep.

3lo, children are the lord’s good gift;
rich payment are men’s sons.
4the sons of youth as arrows are
in hands of mighty ones.

5who has his quiver filled with these
o happy shall he be;
when foes they greet within the gate
they shall from shame be free.

i believe singing verses 4 and 5 have particularly hit home to my sons. they are reminded of the future god envisions for them. what an encouragement for my children, also, to sing regularly together a scriptural reminder that they are blessings from god. it has been helpful to me, also, to have verse 2 running through my head from time to time, reminding me not to fall for the frenetic lifestyle but to rest in god.


perhaps some of you will be able to work on this rendering even further.
