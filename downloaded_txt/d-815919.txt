ozzie the octopus is ready to say farewell and thank you, tucson






since 1974, our family has owned and operated octopus car washes in tucson, arizona. during the past 48 years, two generations of our family were proud to serve the tucson community as tucson’s only locally owned and operated full-service car wash and express detail chain.  while it is bittersweet to announce our retirement, the new ownership blue whale car wash who is taking over is also a family-owned operation that plans on continuing offering full-service car washing and detailing, and they are excited to serve the tucson community.
we cannot thank our customers enough for the decades of patronage and friendships we have built in the community. we will miss you all, please continue to support local small business. it is very important to the tucson community.
