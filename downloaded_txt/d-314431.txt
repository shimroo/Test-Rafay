striped bass fishing on the chesapeake bay





this past december, when elizabeth and i visited my parents on the eastern shore of virginia, i got out on the chesapeake bay for some striped bass fishing and sight seeing with elizabeth, my friend, edward, and my father. we didn't catch any stripers we could keep -- all were under the minimum regulation size -- so it was a catch-and-release trip, but being on the water was a treat, as it almost always is.

"presidio sites"







laurie halsey brown (senseofplacelab)
"christopher reiger at quadrat site #1;  presidio, san francisco, ca; october 2013"

in december 2013, i led a walking tour to three of the four sites in the presidio that were the focus of nomadic nature in situ, a collaborative art project curated by senseofplacelab. at each stop, i read a short reflection on some aspect of the site, and the walking tour concluded with a reception where recent photographs of mine were on view. in the course of 2014, i'll lead more of these walks as part of my “presidio sites” project.

see photos from the december outing and read about the “presidio sites” project here.

archival inkjet print on bamboo paper8" x 10"2013

i've been swamped with various projects these last few months, and i'm very belatedly announcing the terrific project below. it officially launched in november 2013.

i'm honored to have a recent photograph featured as one of the two prints kicking off the tribute, and it's a treat to be in the good company of jonathan woodward.

rock dove on a rock







christopher reiger
"pigeon (rock dove); mountain lake; presidio, san francisco, ca; august 2013"

because so many people think of pigeons as "sky rats," i like to emphasis their more "proper" common name, rock dove (columba livia). they're fascinating birds and, although ubiquitous in urban landscapes, shouldn't be viewed with such disgust.
