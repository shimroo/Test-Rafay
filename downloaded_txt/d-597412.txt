    life to the fullest



 the gospel delivers a profoundly hopeful and loving message that begins with god. out of his deep love, he sent his sinless son, jesus, to redeem and save you. jesus lived a life free of sin, offered himself as a sacrifice on the cross for your transgressions and resurrected after three days. he conquered sin and death for you. jesus came that you may have life, and have it to the fullest. 

  i have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.

 john 10:10b
