put ed pollâs expertise to work to reach your goals for increased billings, improved profits, and reduced stress.

wouldn't it be great to have a personal coach?
practicing law without a coach is like riding a bicycle without handlebars - you have momentum, but no direction. and you can't afford to crash.

                in the old days, we used to call coaches "mentors." wouldn't it be great to have a coach to call, who would advise you when you're about to make a business decision? someone who has years of experience - and has been in your position. that person is ed poll and he can be your personal coach.
you may think that you don't need a coach. but famous athletes like golfer tiger woods, bicycle champion lance armstrong and basketball star shaquille o'neill have coaches to assure their continued success. so do corporate ceos. why shouldn't you be as successful as they are?
perhaps you believe you can't afford a personal coach. but you can - for less than $25 a day! wouldn't you invest $4,000 in your law practice if it increased your revenues by many thousands of dollars? of course you would, because investing in yourself is smarter than investing in the stock market. for a reasonable investment you can get personal coaching every week for six months.

lawbiz® clients say:

"ed helped me assess my situation and cut to the core issues that needed to be dealt with to improve it. ed's no-nonsense approach to setting and achieving goals helped me get on track. i can recommend ed to anyone who's ready to come to grips and take charge of their practice or career." 
jrl, atlanta, ga
"i have been working with coaches for the past couple of years concerning my business, and the thing that i particularly like about working with ed poll is his 25 years of legal background. he has a keen insight into the ramifications of practicing law and he seems to be genuinely concerned about my business."
                        fsb, birmingham, al


think about this story.
six months ago, ben called ed to inquire about his coaching process. he was worried that he had little revenue stream of his own to justify remaining in a partnership. with two children getting ready to go to college, he was anxious. if he were asked to leave the partnership, ben would be left with little income, many expenses and nowhere to turn.
ben started working with ed as a coach. each week, ben accomplished at least one or two of the tasks assigned by ed and agreed upon for the following session. by the end of the six months, ben made a major presentation to his target industry, connected with several key referral sources who promised to send new business and was invited to write articles for his target market.
ed showed him how to:

establish long-term strategies
improve his revenues
focus his energies
accomplish key goals

now the picture looks much brighter for ben. he is so pleased his progress - including a new attitude about marketing - that he signed up for another six months' coaching segment.

ed's coaching worked for ben and it can work for you. you know it would be great to have a personal coach. you also know that there is no better investment than yourself. stop riding a bicycle without handlebars and call ed poll today.

"on a personal level, i'm not scared any more. the recession reduced my wife and me from a comfortable two-income family to a one person income and a capital drain. when i first called ed, i truly was counting the months until we would have to put the house on the market... the things we have put in place and will continue working on guaranteed my business picking up."
fw, northern california
"ed was coaching me during our firm reorganization when disaster hit! key personnel departed and i was panic-stricken. not only did he honor his commitment to 24/7, but his advice enabled me to refocus my priorities. now, i'm eating, i'm sleeping, and i'm smiling thanks to his guidance." 
kh, england
"i worked with ed for a year while working to become a partner in my law firm. with ed's coaching, i was able to achieve that goal at the end of the year. through his coaching techniques, ed showed me how to communicate assertively and confidently with the partners i needed to persuade to vote for my promotion into the partnership and to convince them of my abilities. i can honestly say that without ed's help, i would not have made such an excellent impression on my partners."
kr
"i'm gradually learning, through my weekly coaching sessions, how to get in touch with what i like to think of as my 'inner ed.' with 'ed in my head' between coaching sessions, i have been able to negotiate better fees and attract more work and a higher quality clientele. with ed as my ally, the stress of being a sole practitioner is greatly reduced."
as, new york
