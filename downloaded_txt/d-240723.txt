krakow is special.  
there is no match for 
				krakow 
				in poland and few places elsewhere may equal 
it in attractiveness for a visitor. its historical glories, numerous landmarks, 
colorful festivals, and atmospheric scenery make krakow a
premier destination in central and eastern europe. 
also, the city is rich in fine restaurants, myriad clubs, and other 
metropolitan joys. the place has been settled since 
the stone age at least. in 1038 krakow became the capital of poland and polish 
monarchs took up their residence in its 
wawel royal castle.

the city’s old town historical district, initially a 
medieval municipality set up in 1257 by duke boleslaw v the chaste, features 
high among the earliest entries on the unesco list of the world cultural 
heritage. its well preserved original grid of streets with the huge central 
rynek glowny square, europe’s largest in the middle 
ages, proves the last stage in the perfection of medieval city planning. and the 
intervening centuries have filled it with architectural beauties: churches, 
aristocratic palaces, stately burgher houses, public buildings.

nearby kazimierz district, once a separate city king 
casimir iii the great founded in 1335, boasts its own set of marvels, together 
with its famed former jewish quarter. the present-day bustling metropolis of 
near million sprawls around engulfing still more landmarks, from prehistoric 
mounds to ancient monasteries and convents to the world-famous subterranean 
realm of the wieliczka salt mine - another of the unesco world heritage sites. 

gateway to poland.  
krakow is the gateway to 
poland, notably the southern half of the country. day trips from the city 
include such popular destinations as auschwitz, warsaw, tatry mountains, ojcow 
national park, and the vast kalwaria sanctuary. 

a holy city.  for centuries 
				krakow has been labeled as “rome 
				of the north”. a well-deserved nickname, bearing in mind 
				krakow’s multitude of churches, monasteries, and convents, its 
				famous sanctuaries attracting crowds of pilgrims, its renowned 
				religious festivals, and its numerous holy relics as well as 
				miraculous images. 

a joyful city.  krakow is 
				full of entertainment. concerts take place every day, from pop 
				to jazz to contemporary classical music, sometimes thirty or 
				more one night, with star acts pretty regularly descending on 
				the city. the krakow opera company produces a couple of operatic 
				performances a week as well as operetta and ballet shows. krakow 
				boasts nine repertory theaters in addition to travelling 
				companies of players. cabaret and stand-up comedy are fairly 
				popular - inaccessible, sadly, to english speakers. yet the 
				city's five multiplexes as well as other cinemas screen most 
				recent american and british films with original soundtrack.


krakow for christmas.  
				krakow may well aspire to the title of the world capital of 
				white christmas by virtue of its climate, spectacular 
				architecture, and rich traditions that enliven the holiday 
				season. also, yuletide in krakow lasts longer than elsewhere: 
				the festive season starts in the late november with the opening 
				of the christmas market and the advent of street and shop 
				decorations, and next christmas trees glitter and carols resound 
				till the end of january. and since krakow is one of europe’s top 
				tourist attractions anyway, visiting the city on christmastime 
				comes as a double advantage. 


easter in krakow 
				is also exceptional, thanks to its profound spirituality as well 
				as rich local traditions and time-honored fiestas of emaus and 
				rekawka, not to mention the lively easter market in central 
				square. 


				krakow versus kraków and cracow. 


the original polish name of the city is kraków, pronounced "krakoof", and - 
fingers crossed - maybe foreigners will also adopt it some day. for the time 
being, the standard english spelling is krakow, while cracow is dated form 
nowadays.
