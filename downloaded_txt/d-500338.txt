what our clients say


sensitive/combinationi had always had red, rashy, sensitive skin that i did not take care of when i was very young. when i was 30, i decided to ditch the safeguard soap and try to take care of my skin. i used a lot of the high end brands like clinique and dr payot ( which was “the best” of the times from neimans). they all left my skin rashy. i stumbled upon some
“help” moisturizer from blue calla and thought i had found heaven.that’s when i started exploring and using all of the products in the blue calla skin care system and it was 30 years ago. part of the routine when i get home after a long day is not only to take off my bra- but to take off my minimal make up and do my skin routine with blue calla, which takes just a minute. to not do that would be like sleeping with my bra on! i use the entire line of blue calla and love them all.best of all, people stop me to tell me how nice my skin looks and to ask me what i use. patricia is a genius and a life saver. she truly cares about her products, you and your skin! love her and blue calla. try it–you won’t be sorry.susie foley fort morgan, alabamaread more
