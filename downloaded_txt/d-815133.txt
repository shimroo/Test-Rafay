 cape town vs gansbaai vs mossel bay?
shark diving in cape town takes place in false bay out of simon’s town: all year, unfortunately there are no sightings of great white sharks this year but we are cage diving with bronze whale sharks and seven gill cow sharks
gansbaai, was the undisputed home of the great white shark until orcas displaced the population out of this hotspot. since then bronze whaler sharks are here in large numbers and are excellent to dive with. gansbaai is also the best place to come and view the whales when in season (june – december) prices are lower and there’s the additional attraction of whale viewing trips. view our gansbaai summer special offer
mossel bay is a 4 1/2 hour drive from cape town, so not a day trip option, but definitely worth considering. the water is warmer than gansbaai & cape town, and mossel bay is also a year-round white shark diving destination. this is the only location currently that does have great white sharks but it is worthwhile checking with us prior to booking what the sightings are like at the time.

about shark cage diving

shark cage diving in cape town and gansbaai and great white shark cage diving in mossel bay, south africa is the number 1 for most on their bucket list! this is one of the greatest experiences that you will ever experience being only inches away from a great white shark protected by a steel cage.
shark bookings has a selection of the best shark dive trips in the world. easy to browse and book we specialise in giving you the dream dive with your preferred shark.
since 2017 the great white sharks along the cape have been impacted by the appearance of 2 male juvenile orcas hunting them. many white sharks have been killed and when the roaming orcas pass through the area the great white sharks quickly relocate and move from the area. we have seen a huge decline in white sharks in the historical hotspots along the coast in cape town, gansbaai and mossel bay. mossel bay however is still seeing white sharks but are not here all of the time so it is best to book (no pre-payment taken, we only guarantee places on the boat with guarantee using a credit card. the card is not debited when booking to allow you to cancel within 24 hours before the day should the sightings be poor. in cape town and gansbaai we are enjoying diving with many bronze whaler sharks which are large up to 3.5m long and very active around the boats and cages. people are loving diving with this beautiful species. 
what was the best place in the world for the shark cage diving is gansbaai at shark alley which is a channel of water between two islands dyer island and geyser rock, 4 miles offshore from kleinbaai. this has seen a decline in white shark populations as well as at seal island in cape town in false bay from simons town . fish heads, pilchards, anchovy oil and other fish products are used to entice the sharks to the boat to encounter these beautiful sharks.
the sharks are already in the area and the crew on the boat work hard to attract the sharks and keep them interested in the boat and the divers in the cage rather than looking for prey.
