	 mindex in silonay
    


nag-rally daw ang mga pamangkin ko noong isang linggo. ang isyu, balak daw gawan ng pier ang silonay. sabagay, sa kasaysayan naman ng silonay, ito talaga ang daanan noon ng mga sasakyan galing naujan, ang karatig na munisipalidad ng calapan.pero hindi lamang ito simpleng pagpapaunlad ng sistema ng transportasyon. may mas malaking interes na isinusulong. ang pasimuno, ang kompanyang mindex na sobrang tigas ng ulo. me 25-taon na moratoryo na nga na ipinatupad ang probinsya ng mindoro laban sa pagmimina pero nagpupumilit pa rin ito.ito ay sa gitna ng malawakang promosyon o pagkatig ng pamahalaang arroyo sa mga malalaking kompanya ng mina na pag-aari ng mga dayuhan. eto ang kaugnay na istorya tungkol dito.hindi na bago sa silonay ang isyu ng mindex. dati, bilang bahagi ng panliligaw ng mindex sa mga komunidad, sinimulan nito ang shrimp and mud crab production pero wala ring nangyari. ngayon naman ay itong planong magtayo ng pier.ang mas masakit pa rito, ang pangunahing nagsusulong ng proyektong ito ay taga-silonay rin. pinsan ko pa. matagal na syang consultant ng mindex. panigurado, hati na naman kami sa isyung ito.tutulan ang pier! tutulan ang mindex!shirley
