what people are saying... 



























our reviews 














						i've been getting botox for years, but my recent experience at arbutus laser was exceptional. dr. eichhorst is incredibly knowledgeable and took the time to thoroughly discuss my concerns and goals. this was my first time getting filler, and i was initially nervous about the results. however, i'm absolutely thrilled with how natural the works looks and how painless the procedure was. dr. eichhorst's extensive experience is evident in the quality of his work. i highly recommend arbutus laser and will definitely be returning in the future.					
â€” samantha 











						i have been a patient at arbutus laser for over 20 years. the last treatment i had was coolsculpting. in my mid 40s, my stubborn waistline needed help (despite a healthy diet & exercise). amy walked me through the process of how coolsculpting works, she answered all my questions, and she made me feel comfortable throughout the two treatments. i am beyond thrilled with my results (i can fit into my pants again)! i feel very fortunate to have found a non-invasive treatment that works. thank you, amy & arbutus laser!					
â€” lori 











						in town from hawaii for the month and needed to get something taken care of around the eye. i was able to get an appointment quickly, received friendly service from reception staff, and enjoyed a successful procedure from dr. laura riley. dr. riley was affable, enjoyable to talk to, and made getting a needle (etc.) below the eyeball a surprisingly easy experience.					
â€” marcus 











						i had an amazing experience from booking to through to treatment. the moa staff was very helpful in scheduling and advice about procedures. my treatment with mimi was done with care and professionalism. i highly recommend arbutus vein and laser.					
â€” alison 











						amazing service, such incredible and informed people, i've been very happy with my experiences here. i love their approach of providing treatments that make you look and feel like yourself (and not like someone else!).					
â€” becca 











						i have been getting botox for many years at arbutus laser and have always felt the staff warm and professional.  dr. eichhorst is knowledgeable and takes the time to evaluate and discuss the procedures beforehand. recently, i had filler for the first time and although i was nervous and a little skeptical about how the results would be, i am more than happy with how it turned out. the results are very natural looking.
i will definitely be coming back in the future.					
â€” eleanor 











						arbutus laser was highly recommended so i went this february for a consultation.  i have so far had one fraxel dual 1550 treatment by miko and i couldn't be happier with the results.  i also have had one coolsculpting session so far with amy and after 3 weeks am already seeing results whereas i didn't see results with another provider back in 2020.  i work in the film industry and have visited numerous reputable providers for a variety of treatments and i will never go anywhere other than arbutus laser.  there is a special 'energy' of true caring and total professionalism.					
â€” lisa 











						just finished my laser hair removal treatments with juli. she is amazing, professional and knowledgeable. she took the time to explain the whole process and answered all my questions.  i am super happy with my results!					
â€” elizabeth 











						my experience at arbutus laser was life changing.					
â€” jessanya 











						iâ€™ve  been going to arbutus laser clinic for just over  2 years. first apt i met karen,  she was so informative, so efficient, really knows what sheâ€™s doing. all around sheâ€™s just a wonderful person, i  felt and still fell so comfortable. having procedures done are not only costly but can be a little scary. so for me, having that familiar face along with all her years of experience make it all that much easier. thank you so much karen ðŸ’–ðŸ’–
