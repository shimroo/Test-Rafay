a tale of two wayne manors


hit the deco




a special evening in los angeles? try cicada, in the gorgeous art deco oviatt building, a former 20s haberdashery store on south olive street, downtown. with elegant wood-panelling and lalique glass, this is the luxury restaurant in which julia roberts had a hard time with those slippery little snails in pretty woman. its not surprisingly a screen favourite: more recently, angelina jolie and brad pitt had a bit of a spat here in mr and mrs smith, it's the site of viola davis' briefing at the opening of suicide squad and it becomes a 'roman' restaurant for tarantino's once upon a time in hollywood.
cicada, downtown los angeles


sheer torture...




yes, eli roth fans, there really is a museum of torture â and it is the one seen in hostel. it's not in slovakia, though, but in the beautiful medieval village of äeskã½ krumlov, in the czech republic, where much of the film was shot. it's not tucked away down a creepy staircase (hello, this is a major tourist attraction!) but on the village's main square.
