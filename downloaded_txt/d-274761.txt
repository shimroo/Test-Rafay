welcome to jim booth art gallery




shop all
at jim booth art gallery we are focused on giving back while both protecting and growingthe value of jim’s art for all of our loyal customers. after working side-by-side at the gallery with her father for over 20 years, jim’s daughter diana booth now continues jim booth art gallery with a focus to uphold the quality of jim’s art and how it is handled as well as maintaining the value jim created for his work.
we support charities in these three ways:  1 – a portion of every jimbooth.com sale is donated to charity, 2 -we donate framed, environmental edition prints (which jim had specifically earmarked for donating to charities) for auction or raffle, 3 – we donate to charity from the sale of jim’s original paintings.  we also donate jim’s original paintings for public display and enjoyment.  we continue with not wholesaling any prints or posters.  after galleries close, art reps pass, and businesses redecorate it is often wholesaled items that end up being mishandled/damaged and missing certificates of authenticity.  buyer beware on the secondary market – check for damage often covered up under shrink wrapping!

our current charity partner is the patriot art foundation  who offer programs that provide free education and materials to veterans seeking to use art as a pathway to a healthier and more meaningful life. via hands-on workshops and online classes, the patriot art foundation gives veterans a means of self expression, connection and purpose.
