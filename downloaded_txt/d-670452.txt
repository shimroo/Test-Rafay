titan moves the world














                    lsw technology
                











                                low sidewall (lsw) assemblies feature a larger rim diameter and smaller tire sidewall than conventional tire and wheel assemblies. lsw technology is helping to eliminate problems that farmers face including road lope, power hop and soil compaction. titan is the only company able to design, test and produce both wheels and tires for the agriculture markets.
