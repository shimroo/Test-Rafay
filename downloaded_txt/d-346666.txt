vacation in beautiful playa del carmen, 
			riviera maya, yucatan peninsula, mexico.
			we at seamonkey business can act as your travel agent and we can 
			book any hotel, condo, tour or activities. we are here to share our firsthand 
			knowledge about sightseeing, accommodations, 
			

			hotels, 
			

			condos, scuba diving, atv jungle tours, skydiving, and other 
			activities along the coast of mexico between cancun 
			and tulum . this area between cancun and tulum is called the riviera 
			maya (also known as the mayan riviera): 
			it includes 

			isla mujeres, puerto morelos,  playa 
			del carmen, puerto aventuras, akumal and 

			tulum.

			playa del carmen is centrally located 
			in the riviera maya, making it a perfect starting point for your 
			vacation plans. this area is paradise for those who are seeking the 
			infinite beauty of the crystal blue caribbean sea without the fast 
			pace of cancun. a quiet 
			romantic getaway, tours of ancient mayan ruins, a ferry ride to 
			cozumel for the day or a nightly stroll down 5th avenue where you 
			will find handicraft stores, sidewalk cafes, international cuisine 
			and local live music...whatever your 
			pace, you can find it here. you can even learn spanish here in 
			paradise. the once small fishing town and quiet beaches have 
			certainly maintained a special allure and charm.
