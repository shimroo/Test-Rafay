farming for over 150 years
passion for growing good food and bringing families together to enjoy it

for over six generations, the trax family has passed down the importance of quality, tradition and family. thatâ€™s probably why weâ€™re one of the oldest and most-awarded fruit and vegetable farms in pittsburgh and the south hills. although weâ€™ve been farming for over 150 years, we still have that passion for growing good food to eat and bringing families together to enjoy them. from our perfectly grown sweet corn to our fresh-baked, homemade pies or our delicious selection of convenient homemade deli salads, nothing brings the family together like great-tasting food. in the fall, your family will love our fresh-pressed cider, the best apple cider in pittsburgh. we make sure your family will find something to love at trax no matter the time of the year. as farmers, we never get tired of the simple but satisfying pleasure of knowing what we picked this morning is what youâ€™ll be serving this evening.
