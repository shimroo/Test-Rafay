hobby coin exchange is an exclusive mail order company - 
			buying and selling usa coinage 1/2 cents through gold.
 
			thomas edison said, "there is a better way! find it. then 
			do it." hobby coin exchange says, "there is no 
			better way to build a powerful coin legacy than to purchase your 
			coins using our 36 month interest free layaway program. 
			
			twenty some years ago we found that our customers wanted higher 
			priced coins...and that higher priced coins required cash up 
			front... and sometimes was just too much. so together we built a better way...by 
			just 
			saying "lay-em-away." 
advice from the king of layaway


find a coin that you really want


buy it using our interest free layaway


for example, you can purchase up to $1,350.00 at @$37.50 per 
					month


for purchases over $1,350.00 merely divide by 36 to find 
					you monthly payment


be sure your monthly payments are 
						in your coin budget


it is that easy.  so just do it.  you will be glad 
					you did









no other coin dealer in the world will let you 
			purchase... an unlimited amount, for 36 interest free 
			payments.
