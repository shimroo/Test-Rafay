stewart home - radically inauthentic since 1962
stewart home is the most out there writer on the planet -  the only person on earth who is visible to the naked eye from outer space! he really does burn that brightly. the london review of books has praised home by saying: "i really don't think anyone who is at all interested in literature has any business not knowing the work of stewart home." however, this notorious egg bagel eater prefers to liken himself to "a proletarian comedian with tourette's spewing obscenities". he much prefers standing on his head and reciting sexually explicit passages from his work at public events to courting the literary establishment.
