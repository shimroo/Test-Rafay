father's day with dad





 time is a precious thing. ray and i took the first flight out we could get to go see my dad. things were not looking good and we need to get there asap. there was times dad just slept and yet throughout the week we took the time to enjoy any time he was awake to talk, cry together, and some how he had bursts of energy to play games. this was dad talking on the phone with his sister.this moment was memorable...dad had a burst of energy and said he needed to show me something important downstairs. i said, tell me what it is and i'll get it, but he refused and said he needed to show me. we carefully went downstairs and he showed me something in the office but right way he asked "where's ray". ray had stayed upstairs so i called for him and low and behold, dad had wanted to play pool. he was like a boy in a toy shop getting away with something. it was so fun to see him light up with joy as he played with ray. as soon as he heard carolyn's footsteps he got silly and joked that he was going to get in trouble. carolyn didn't mind when she found out it was more that he needed to know his own strength - it's one thing to go down the stairs and a whole different thing to go up. it was a memory we will cherish. while we were there dad watched a lot of golf...the greens were not so harsh on his eyes then watching something like hockey. it was the stanley cup games though, so there was some hockey that we watched as he had 2 bc fans with him.cherished moments with his sister alma who came all the way from texas. they spent time talking and alma took good care of the pets while she visited there too. moments awake were cherished and appreciated. times talking and remembering.just being there with carolyn. talking and supporting her. time to sit and talk and help that seem so hard from far way. and let her know how much we appreciate all she is doing for our dad.thursday morning dad woke up and remembered that it was thursday - his bible study morning. although he wouldn't be going it was great to see his alertness and knowing people were praying for him. alma anointed him with oil as we prayed over him. a moment of tears and powerful prayer. dad also turned and prayed with ray. a shared heart for india and a testimony to see two men have a heart for god, family and missions.another surprising moment was when dad was feeling good enough to drive to the store with us and drive the cart around to pick up some food. since he wasn't eating much it was good to see him picking out somethings he wanted and getting out of the house for a bit. a change of scenery for anyone can make a big difference.melissa, marianne and don arrived to visit also. it had been along time since the group of us were together so it was great to get out for breakfast and recap. my blondie moments were the brunt of a few jokes but otherwise it was great to catch up. we took some time to as girls to get out and have our toe nails done. time spent with mikeala was meaningful and great to all be sisters together. don had the "privilege" to carve the cow heart for carolyn - a job she wasn't sure what to do with. a gift from a local for nana and the cats. the funny thing was watching how nala got so excited with the smells and waited - i don't think i would say patiently but excitedly for anything to drop or be given to her. the cats on the other hand were less enthusisaic about it all. animals lovers and pet owners will appreciate all the time and work and love these pets receive. we enjoyed the treat of being served by our own family at the icecream parlor. that was the best dark chocoate icecream i have ever had. thanks for the treat.all in all, the moments with family was amazing. time spent with dad was more than words can express. we went thinking the worst and left with cherished moments that will hold us through this time. time to talk face to face and say goodbye, read letters writen to eachother, pray together, remember the past and bless eachother with the love of quality time.i love you dad!

fun at the fat cat festival





the fat cat festival is full of so much to see and do. this is the second time the school has taken these kids to go, and each year they love it. performances to watch and workshops to participate in. the class signed up for two performances and one drumming workshop. it was a great day to be a parent volunteer and watch these kids explore. there were booths for daycamps and tanks to climb into and time to ask the soldiers questions. there were craft stations and science experiments to try. bounce houses and facepainting, clowns and a fairy godmother. what a great day!

twins





when the boys showed up this morning, i just had to take a picture of kaden and mark. two cousins dressed as twins...was it planned or not neither will tell.every wednesday morning through the school year the four cousins and i walk to school together. this 7 minute walk from our house to the school can take anywhere from 7min's to 20min's depending on the day.some times it involves races, or picking up of rocks. we stop some mornings and watch the garbage truck go by (this started so they would stay back and to be safe- but now it's a habit to stop and wave). to the yield sign and stop for everyone to catch up, then it's down the dirt and over the bike jumps (it's a pile of dirt that is so much fun), through the field and there we are. often the big kids are in the lead but during their last habitat project they have been in such debates and discussions that simon and kyla lead the way. it's often better to leave early and avoid starting something at home to arrive to school on time. you never know what might transpire during a 7 minute walk.

baseball





this year mark is a red robin tadpole. baseball has brought a new time schedual to our lives working around practices and games, as well as tournaments. this year the kids are each getting a chance to try being a new position - back catcher. the coaches have been this position up until this year. the fun part of watching your kid in a sport is seeing how each year they improve their skills as well as watching them being a part of a team. mark's favorite position is now back catcher - a toss up between that one and first base. luckily this year mark has a few friends on his team. lucky for him, as wells as for us watching as we have that many more people to visit with while watching. we had a great day a few saturdays ago where we went to watch kaden's soccer game, have a picnic lunch followed by everyone staying and watching mark's baseball game. at one point i sat there and took in all the familiar faces and knew that we are blessed with family and friends who support and encourage each of us and our kids.you know that old saying; it takes a village to raise a kid - so often i think of that when dealing with problems in raising kids but, you sure feel supported and loved when family and friends surround you in life's simple events while you are raising your kids too!

easter





the easter bunnies came for a final time to gramma and grandpa's garden.  precious moments of watching the children hunt easter is a time of reflection of how our saviour died and rose again. it is also a time of cherished moments for family staged in a season of new growth and rebirth.

early anniversary





10 is a big number. it's the beginning of double digits. i remember turning 10, it was a big thing as a kid. i"m scared mark will be there too soon....and yet, thinking of the last 10 years of marriage, it is a joy. a true celebration. which is why we decided to celebrate early. thankyou ray....i love you and look forward to the next 10 yearsray and i enjoyed a weekend away, close to home and yet peaceful and quiet.sparking hills is a wellness centre were we felt pampered and relaxed. great spas, beautiful room and crysals everywhere the eye could see....beautiful!

this is where i'm at today...you?





take some time to become still in god's presence. slow your breathing through the following exercise inhale: breathe in the peace of christ exhale: breathe out anxiety of the day. inhale: breathe in the gentleness of christ. exhale: breathe out mental clutter and distraction. inhale: breathe in freedom in christ. exhale: breathe out that which binds you. inhale: breathe in the joy of christ. exhale: breathe out discouragement. inhale: breathe in the love of christ. exhale: breathe out selfishness and personal agendas. continue until you feel at rest before god

spring???





well, it's time change day.  i saw the first points of my tulips and hyacinths in the garden.  the neighbour of our duplex raked the front yard and ray raked the back yard.  all the fall leaves are cleaned up and we're ready for the brown grass to turn green...that might take awhile but we're waiting.we went for a walk and knocked on karl and lisa's door to invite them to the park...only to find them already at the park.  this new park is a great discovery.  it is perfect distance...not to close so it feels like a bit of a walk, yet not too far that the kids are exhausted by the time we arrive.  it is right off the green way and from what we can gather - will have washrooms when the building is finished. we met friends and family and all agree this is a great new destination for bike rides.so spring...whenever you would like to arrive, we're ready for you !!
