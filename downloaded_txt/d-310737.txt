reality begins with consciousness
a paradigm shift that works
vernon m neppe and edward r. close. second edition
once in many decades, a book comes out that is so important that it literally impacts on the whole basis of thinking about reality, life and existence, and all of science. we believe that reality begins with consciousness: a paradigm shift that works is such a book. its importance cannot be overemphasized.

forensics: the medical aspects 
                          of law and the legal aspects of medicine

what is forensics?
forensics implies the practice of law in relation to 
                          medicine. the specific forensic discipline in this site 
                          focuses on forensic neuropsychiatry and psychopharmacology 
                          which is law in relation to neuropsychiatry and psychopharmacology. 
                          this area involves both civil and criminal issues and 
                          may relate to such areas as standard of care, traumatic 
                          brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, complications 
                          of medication prescriptions such as movement disorders, 
                          committals and malingering. forensic neuropsychiatry 
                          and psychopharmacology is in contradistinction to a 
                          coroner who may be involved with the analysis of pathologic 
                          specimens - examination of tissues or organs in autopsy 
                          who is practicing forensic pathology. there is a subcertification 
                          in forensic psychiatry both through the american board 
                          of psychiatry and neurology as well as the american 
                          association for psychiatry and the law. additionally, 
                          the american board of forensic examiners have a certification 
                          in forensic medicine which is broader. 


forensic neuropsychiatry
what is neuropsychiatry and how does it link with forensic 
                          practice? there are several conditions that psychiatrists, 
                          neurologists and internists refer: the first relates 
                          to pharmacologic prescription relating to brain function 
                          such as difficult or refractory cases or dilemmas about 
                          treatment options. the second involves a broad spectrum 
                          of cases with possible brain disease and frequently 
                          behavioral abnormalities: these cases, like the first 
                          group, frequently have forensic facets in their neuropsychiatric 
                          evaluation. medicolegal aspects are very diverse including 
                          reviewing records, research opinions, competency evaluations, 
                          malpractice, torts relating to head trauma or cerebral 
                          anoxia, possible psychiatric disability, tardive dyskinesia, 
                          pain syndromes, aggression, attention deficit disorder 
                          and post-traumatic stress disorder. neuropsychiatry 
                          also encompasses assessments of strange or atypical 
                          symptoms, the behavioral aspects of neurology, seizure 
                          phenomena, refractory psychiatric illness, dementia, 
                          and atypical spells. 


what is the difference between neuropsychiatrists and neuropsychologists?
neuropsychiatrists (sometimes called behavioral neurologists)
• are mds:  they are physicians, who are medically trained at medical schools and have thereafter specialized in an extremely complex area.
                          • are an unusual, highly educated medical 
                          subspecialty.
                          • their background is in psychiatry and neurology
                          • they specialize in pathology of the higher brain 
                          at the clinical neurological and psychiatric levels
                          • they are clinicians who focus on managing difficulties, 
                          assessing prognosis and prescribing medications
                          • usually perform specialized neuropsychiatric 
                          evaluations
						  • use tests that are standardized for a particular population and will commonly find areas of abnormality which may or may not be clinically relevant.
                          • neuropsychiatric evaluations involve assessments of higher cerebral cortical functions, integration of 
                          brain symptomatology such as temporal lobe phenomena, 
                          correlations with neurological and psychiatric diagnoses 
                          and appropriate prescriptions, and several clinically 
                          relevant neuropsychiatric tests.
                          • also rely on neuropsychological tests and such 
                          measures as ambulatory electroencephalography.
                          • neuropsychiatrists are often the "captains" 
                          of the treating team for neurological conditions with 
                          associated psychiatric disorders or psychiatric conditions 
                          with neurological disorders.
                          • typical patients with neuropsychiatric conditions 
                          include patients who suffer from


       

						 
                          • seizures with behavioral, emotional or thinking 
                          difficulties
						  • traumatic head injuries with personality or 
                          other changes including post-traumatic stress disorders
                          • headaches or migraines with mood changes, depression 
                          or anxiety
                          • movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia 
                          with associated medication or psychiatric elements
                          • brain injuries or disturbances
                          • temporal lobe disease


neuropsychologists
 • are not physicians.
                          • generally have phds in psychology.
                          • have subspecialized in the psychological assessment 
                          and management of higher brain function.
                          • cannot prescribe
                          • usually perform specialized neuropsychological 
                          evaluations such as personality, intelligence and specific 
                          brain disorder evaluations.
                          • these tests are standardized and will commonly 
                          find areas of abnormality which may or may not be clinically 
                          relevant.

and what is a psychopharmacologist?
psychopharmacologists
• may or may not be physicians
                          • are experts in the pharmacology of the brain
                          • if physicians, prescribe for patients
                          • often are trained in techniques of biological 
                          psychiatry
                          • have special expertise in brain medications over and above that in psychiatric and neurological training
                          • practice a very difficult and important subspecialty.

where do these specialties fit forensically?
forensically
 • the domains of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology 
                          overlap.
                          • because they are physicians, neuropsychiatric 
                          opinions may be perceived by a jury with more weight 
                          than a neuropsychological opinion, just as the opinions 
                          of psychiatrists may be perceived more heavily than 
                          psychologists.
                          • neuropsychologists are not specifically trained to express a pharmacological opinion, nor opinions on medical or neurological or psychiatric examinations, 
                          nor on recommended medical treatments, diagnoses or investigations.
                          • neuropsychiatrists may be specifically trained to express pharmacological, medical, brain related neurological or 
                          psychiatric opinions, and express opinions on recommended medical treatments, diagnoses or investigations.
						  • neuropsychiatrists performing expert witness work should be specifically trained to express opinions on pharmacological, medical and brain related neurological and psychiatric findings,  recommended medical treatments, diagnoses and investigations.

where does dr vernon neppe and the pacific neuropsychiatric institute 
                          fit this description?
                          • dr vernon neppe md, phd is a highly trained, 
                          experienced and internationally recognized neuropsychiatrist/behavioral neurologist, 
                          and psychopharmacologist as well as forensic psychiatrist/forensic neuropsychiatrist.
                          • he was recruited after an international search 
                          to establish what was then apparently the first division 
                          of neuropsychiatry in a department of psychiatry in 
                          the usa ( in 1986, at the university of washington, 
                          seattle)
                          • he has established a model neuropsychiatric 
                          institute for complex clinical evaluations and also 
                          does forensic evaluations. this is the pacific neuropsychiatric 
                          institute.
                          • he also has a phd and so is an md, phd.
                          • he has a string of specialist qualifications 
                          making him academically one of the most highly trained 
                          physicians in the united states. (vernon m. neppe md, 
                          phd(med), frssaf, fapa, ffpsych(sa), frcpc, mmed (psych), 
                          dipabpn [psychiatry; geriatric psychiatry (91-01-11); forensic 
                          psychiatry (94-04)], dabfm, dabfe, dabps (psychopharmacology), 
                          facfe, lmacfe, mb, bch, dpsm , ba). on paper, this makes dr neppe one of the most highly qualified physicians in his area in the world. he has usa board certifications as well as numerous non-usa specialist qualifications.
                          • he has been working in this field for more than 
                          a quarter of century
                          • he has been regarded by his peers as a leading expert in his area (for example, he appears in every edition to date of americas top doctors, and at times is the only 
						  neuropsychiatrist [2002 edition] under psychiatry listed in the western united states in the book, and certainly the only one listed under neuropsychiatry / behavioral neurology. he also is listed under forensic neuropsychiatry (only one) and psychopharmacology. americas top doctors is a peer voted primary source for such information with 2005 being the fifth edition. moreover, dr neppe was also listed in the peer voted on book, best doctors in america, when it was the authority in the mid/late 1990s). 
						  • he is an academic as well (an adjunct full professor in st louis, 1700 miles from his home base, a singular honor, attesting to his degree of respect (an extremely unusual honor). he endeavors to keep up-to-date on the standard texts, controversies and trends in his field as well as with clinical changes.
						  • he is author of two books on psychopharmacology and has made ground-breaking contributions to the area.
						  • he has developed several measuring and other neuropsychiatric tests and pioneered the area of neuropsychiatry.
						  • he was instrumental in the american medical association listing a subspeciality of neuropsychiatry under psychiatry.
						  • he also has been recognized as the pioneer of several major areas of research in psychopharmacology, such as the use of anticonvulsants in psychiatry and developing a treatment for tardive dyskinesia.
						  

specifically, in forensic neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology, where does dr neppe fit in the realm of being retained for expert testimony?
• dr vernon neppe md, phd is a highly trained, 
                          experienced and recognized forensic expert
						  • his forensic certifications include forensic psychiatry by the american board of psychiatry and neurology (1994-2004); also dabfm, dabfe, dabps (psychopharmacology), facfe.
                          • he is experienced in virtually every facet of medicolegal work
                          • as with neuropsychiatry, he has been regarded by his peers as a leading expert in his area. for example, 
                          he appears to be the only forensic psychiatrist under psychiatry listed in the western united states in the 
                          book, americas top doctors, a peer voted primary source for such information, 2002 edition and thereafter is so listed, for example, currently is the only person listed under forensic neuropsychiatry.
                          • his range of case expertise is broad: he prefers civil, competence and disability work compared with criminal work.
                          • he has been retained repetitively by plaintiff and defense. 
                          • he will express the real opinion he thinks, 
                          and what may need to be done. this is extremely useful 
                          in preliminary chart reviews or research in a particular 
                          area, where legal questions of how and whether to proceed 
                          or plan defense of cases or settle are important.
                          • he can assist attorneys who are not experts 
                          in areas of neuropsychiatry in advising them about such 
                          factors as deposing or cross-examining.
                          • he has acted as consultant, reviewer of medical records, expert witness in depositions, rebuttal / surebuttal witness.
                          • he works quickly, a major advantage in terms of time for attorneys. yet he endeavors to be thorough and may point out areas in which he needs more information.

                          aspects that had not previously been considered relevant. 
                          this may involve a review of records to obtain preliminary 
                          ideas as to how to proceed further or be based on the 
                          extensive clinical evaluations performed at the pacific 
                          neuropsychiatric institute.

professor neppe's major research areas include pharmacologic, 
                          neuropsychiatric and phenomenologic elements. he developed 
                          several measuring neuropsychiatric instruments and inventories 
                          including the brocas 
                          scan (screening cerebral assessment of neppe), the 
                          inset (inventory 
                          of neppe of symptoms of epilepsy and the temporal lobe), 
                          the straw (the 
                          first time / severity measure for tardive dyskinesia), 
                          a geriatric inpatient instrument namely the pbrs (with jp 
                          loebel) (the problem behaviors rating scale) as well 
                          as research subjective paranormal questionnaires and 
                          narcolepsy questionnaires. additionally, he first demonstrated 
                          the links of anomalistic psychological experiences (subjective 
                          paranormal experience) with the temporal lobe of the 
                          brain. his pharmacologic areas include the only double 
                          blind study demonstrating the value of carbamazepine 
                          in dyscontrol and psychosis thereby being a major pioneer 
                          of the whole area of anticonvulsant drugs in psychiatry 
                          —this has possibly impacted on millions, the use 
                          of high dose buspirone as a successful treatment for 
                          tardive dyskinesia, and the extended use of azapirones 
                          in aggression and attention deficit disorder. he 
                          has also developed concepts in medical areas such as 
                          deinduction, non-vertiginous dizziness, 
                           dysproccia, chindling and possible temporal 
                          lobe symptoms. 
he is also a media resource. (more info.)


pni neuropsychiatric evaluations
what kinds of review do neuropsychiatric patients have? 
                          because it is a new specialty, guidelines are lacking. 
                          at the pacific neuropsychiatric institute, these evaluations 
                          are generally extensive, involving several units of 
                          neuropsychiatric testing and numerous comprehensive 
                          complex clinical consultations as well as appropriate 
                          electroencephalographic (e.g. outpatient home ambulatory 
                          monitoring) and neuroradiologic (e.g. mri, spect) examinations. 
                          following on these clinical comprehensive assessments 
                          with follow-ups occur as necessary. these evaluations 
                          are frequently highly relevant to prognosis and etiology 
                          and two of the clinical tests we developed have been 
                          very useful and simple instruments in evaluation of 
                          the progress over long and short periods of time, in 
                          one instance examining defects of higher brain function 
                          and in the second, concentrating on symptomatology. our 
                          hope is to delineate what is clinically relevant as 
                          opposed to findings of dubious significance which are 
                          sometimes generated with full scale neuropsychological 
                          batteries - such batteries can, of course, be very helpful 
                          in the holistic medical context. many patients are initially 
                          clinically, not forensically, referred for appropriate 
                          medical management, and the medical insurances in those 
                          instances become the appropriate source for billing.

forensics: the medical aspects 
                          of law and the legal aspects of medicine

what is forensics?
forensics implies the practice of law in relation to 
                          medicine. the specific forensic discipline in this site 
                          focuses on forensic neuropsychiatry and psychopharmacology 
                          which is law in relation to neuropsychiatry and psychopharmacology. 
                          this area involves both civil and criminal issues and 
                          may relate to such areas as standard of care, traumatic 
                          brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, complications 
                          of medication prescriptions such as movement disorders, 
                          committals and malingering. forensic neuropsychiatry 
                          and psychopharmacology is in contradistinction to a 
                          coroner who may be involved with the analysis of pathologic 
                          specimens - examination of tissues or organs in autopsy 
                          who is practicing forensic pathology. there is a subcertification 
                          in forensic psychiatry both through the american board 
                          of psychiatry and neurology as well as the american 
                          association for psychiatry and the law. additionally, 
                          the american board of forensic examiners have a certification 
                          in forensic medicine which is broader. 


forensic neuropsychiatry
what is neuropsychiatry and how does it link with forensic 
                          practice? there are several conditions that psychiatrists, 
                          neurologists and internists refer: the first relates 
                          to pharmacologic prescription relating to brain function 
                          such as difficult or refractory cases or dilemmas about 
                          treatment options. the second involves a broad spectrum 
                          of cases with possible brain disease and frequently 
                          behavioral abnormalities: these cases, like the first 
                          group, frequently have forensic facets in their neuropsychiatric 
                          evaluation. medicolegal aspects are very diverse including 
                          reviewing records, research opinions, competency evaluations, 
                          malpractice, torts relating to head trauma or cerebral 
                          anoxia, possible psychiatric disability, tardive dyskinesia, 
                          pain syndromes, aggression, attention deficit disorder 
                          and post-traumatic stress disorder. neuropsychiatry 
                          also encompasses assessments of strange or atypical 
                          symptoms, the behavioral aspects of neurology, seizure 
                          phenomena, refractory psychiatric illness, dementia, 
                          and atypical spells. 


what is the difference between neuropsychiatrists and neuropsychologists?
neuropsychiatrists (sometimes called behavioral neurologists)
• are mds:  they are physicians, who are medically trained at medical schools and have thereafter specialized in an extremely complex area.
                          • are an unusual, highly educated medical 
                          subspecialty.
                          • their background is in psychiatry and neurology
                          • they specialize in pathology of the higher brain 
                          at the clinical neurological and psychiatric levels
                          • they are clinicians who focus on managing difficulties, 
                          assessing prognosis and prescribing medications
                          • usually perform specialized neuropsychiatric 
                          evaluations
						  • use tests that are standardized for a particular population and will commonly find areas of abnormality which may or may not be clinically relevant.
                          • neuropsychiatric evaluations involve assessments of higher cerebral cortical functions, integration of 
                          brain symptomatology such as temporal lobe phenomena, 
                          correlations with neurological and psychiatric diagnoses 
                          and appropriate prescriptions, and several clinically 
                          relevant neuropsychiatric tests.
                          • also rely on neuropsychological tests and such 
                          measures as ambulatory electroencephalography.
                          • neuropsychiatrists are often the "captains" 
                          of the treating team for neurological conditions with 
                          associated psychiatric disorders or psychiatric conditions 
                          with neurological disorders.
                          • typical patients with neuropsychiatric conditions 
                          include patients who suffer from


       

						 
                          • seizures with behavioral, emotional or thinking 
                          difficulties
						  • traumatic head injuries with personality or 
                          other changes including post-traumatic stress disorders
                          • headaches or migraines with mood changes, depression 
                          or anxiety
                          • movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia 
                          with associated medication or psychiatric elements
                          • brain injuries or disturbances
                          • temporal lobe disease


neuropsychologists
 • are not physicians.
                          • generally have phds in psychology.
                          • have subspecialized in the psychological assessment 
                          and management of higher brain function.
                          • cannot prescribe
                          • usually perform specialized neuropsychological 
                          evaluations such as personality, intelligence and specific 
                          brain disorder evaluations.
                          • these tests are standardized and will commonly 
                          find areas of abnormality which may or may not be clinically 
                          relevant.

and what is a psychopharmacologist?
psychopharmacologists
• may or may not be physicians
                          • are experts in the pharmacology of the brain
                          • if physicians, prescribe for patients
                          • often are trained in techniques of biological 
                          psychiatry
                          • have special expertise in brain medications over and above that in psychiatric and neurological training
                          • practice a very difficult and important subspecialty.

where do these specialties fit forensically?
forensically
 • the domains of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology 
                          overlap.
                          • because they are physicians, neuropsychiatric 
                          opinions may be perceived by a jury with more weight 
                          than a neuropsychological opinion, just as the opinions 
                          of psychiatrists may be perceived more heavily than 
                          psychologists.
                          • neuropsychologists are not specifically trained to express a pharmacological opinion, nor opinions on medical or neurological or psychiatric examinations, 
                          nor on recommended medical treatments, diagnoses or investigations.
                          • neuropsychiatrists may be specifically trained to express pharmacological, medical, brain related neurological or 
                          psychiatric opinions, and express opinions on recommended medical treatments, diagnoses or investigations.
						  • neuropsychiatrists performing expert witness work should be specifically trained to express opinions on pharmacological, medical and brain related neurological and psychiatric findings,  recommended medical treatments, diagnoses and investigations.

                          • he was recruited after an international search 
                          to establish what was then apparently the first division 
                          of neuropsychiatry in a department of psychiatry in 
                          the usa ( in 1986, at the university of washington, 
                          seattle)
                          • he has established a model neuropsychiatric 
                          institute for complex clinical evaluations and also 
                          does forensic evaluations. this is the pacific neuropsychiatric

                          facfe, lmacfe, mb, bch, dpsm , ba). on paper, this makes dr neppe one of the most highly qualified physicians in his area in the world. he has usa board certifications as well as numerous non-usa specialist qualifications.
                          • he has been working in this field for more than 
                          a quarter of century
                          • he has been regarded by his peers as a leading expert in his area (for example, he appears in every edition to date of americas top doctors, and at times is the only 
						  neuropsychiatrist [2002 edition] under psychiatry listed in the western united states in the book, and certainly the only one listed under neuropsychiatry / behavioral neurology. he also is listed under forensic neuropsychiatry (only one) and psychopharmacology. americas top doctors is a peer voted primary source for such information with 2005 being the fifth edition. moreover, dr neppe was also listed in the peer voted on book, best doctors in america, when it was the authority in the mid/late 1990s). 
						  • he is an academic as well (an adjunct full professor in st louis, 1700 miles from his home base, a singular honor, attesting to his degree of respect (an extremely unusual honor). he endeavors to keep up-to-date on the standard texts, controversies and trends in his field as well as with clinical changes.

						  • he also has been recognized as the pioneer of several major areas of research in psychopharmacology, such as the use of anticonvulsants in psychiatry and developing a treatment for tardive dyskinesia.
						  

specifically, in forensic neuropsychiatry and behavioral neurology, where does dr neppe fit in the realm of being retained for expert testimony?
• dr vernon neppe md, phd is a highly trained, 
                          experienced and recognized forensic expert
						  • his forensic certifications include forensic psychiatry by the american board of psychiatry and neurology (1994-2004); also dabfm, dabfe, dabps (psychopharmacology), facfe.
                          • he is experienced in virtually every facet of medicolegal work
                          • as with neuropsychiatry, he has been regarded by his peers as a leading expert in his area. for example, 
                          he appears to be the only forensic psychiatrist under psychiatry listed in the western united states in the 
                          book, americas top doctors, a peer voted primary source for such information, 2002 edition and thereafter is so listed, for example, currently is the only person listed under forensic neuropsychiatry.
                          • his range of case expertise is broad: he prefers civil, competence and disability work compared with criminal work.
                          • he has been retained repetitively by plaintiff and defense. 
                          • he will express the real opinion he thinks, 
                          and what may need to be done. this is extremely useful 
                          in preliminary chart reviews or research in a particular 
                          area, where legal questions of how and whether to proceed 
                          or plan defense of cases or settle are important.
                          • he can assist attorneys who are not experts 
                          in areas of neuropsychiatry in advising them about such 
                          factors as deposing or cross-examining.
                          • he has acted as consultant, reviewer of medical records, expert witness in depositions, rebuttal / surebuttal witness.
                          • he works quickly, a major advantage in terms of time for attorneys. yet he endeavors to be thorough and may point out areas in which he needs more information.
                          • patients requiring "independent," "plaintiff" and "defense" medicolegal examinations can be evaluated at the pacific neuropsychiatric 
                          institute. sometimes patients with medical insurance are referred by other physicians for a complex, comprehensive, clinical evaluation of their medical status at the pacific neuropsychiatric institute:  this kind of clinical evaluation is linked with their medical insurance as dr neppe becomes a provider of treatment.
						  • he is an excellent communicator, being an internationally in demand speaker, and a writer who writes medical scientific information for the layperson in a dialogic framework (e.g. the book cry the beloved mind). this has been and should continue to be of value in a context of delivering expert testimony. he has also been consulted by the lay media: radio, television, newspapers and other publications. 
                          • as a writer, playwright and highly published scientist he is experienced in writing a well-organized and concise report.
						  • also, as a writer for laypersons, he has learnt to explain complex matters in a manner understandable to triers of fact.
						 
						 
						 
					    • possibly because of these attributes, dr vernon neppe  
						


       

						 
                          • makes an accomplished, excellent and formidable expert witness;
						  • is extremely good at justifying his position to opposing counsel attacks;
                          • conveys his expertise and knowledge of the subject matter in a confident but not arrogant style and with care about grooming and professional dress;
                          • comes across as coherent, logical and believable with a comfortable presentation style.


• makes an accomplished, excellent and formidable expert witness.
• in general, because of his professional backgrounds in neuropsychiatry / behavioral neurology and psychopharmacology, and his unique attributes (his background), dr neppe may be more able to use his expertise appropriately to teach a jury what in his opinion is the correct answer or direction for a particular case than some of his opposite witnesses such as neuropsychologists, neurologists or psychiatrists.
• dr neppe can address a far broader area of expertise than many experts in the areas of neuropsychologists, neurologists or psychiatry are expert in doing.
• on the other hand, as a psychiatrist as well he can also express opinions on psychiatric issues. 


in what special contexts  is dr neppe a logical expert witness?
most certainly, dr neppe is an eminently logical expert witness provided the case is within his expertise realm.
dr neppe has special expertise in the following medicolegal areas:
special expertise in brain injury including traumatic brain injury and this includes also "minor" head injury with alleged changes in thinking,  emotion, motivation or personality. (he has written chapters in key books; and also has developed his own classification?learn more)
special expertise in psychopharmacology  (numerous chapters; two books; many articles; lectures round the world; major contributions)
special expertise in malpractice issues
special expertise in neuroleptics , anticonvulsants, azapirones, antidepressants, anti-anxiety agents
special expertise in seizure disorders, atypical spells, brain function and psychiatric elements (includes a classification of psychiatric disorders in patients with seizure disorders).

special expertise in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (publications and expert testimony)
special expertise in medication side-effects
special expertise in differentiating the pre-existing condition from the new neuropsychiatric condition
special expertise in neuropsychiatric issues of any kind (e.g. competence, responsibility, medication)
special expertise in differentiating the organic from the psychological
special expertise in brain function assessments and competency issues
special expertise in so-called "diet" medicines such as ephedra
special expertise in disorders of consciousness and higher brain function

in what kinds of forensic neuropsychiatric and psychopharmacological contexts can dr neppe be used?
areas such as competence in the area,  expertise and appropriate credentials are vital for expert witnesses.  communication skills and credibility are critically important too. 
the information above gives a perspective of where dr neppe fits in that regard.
the following guidelines may assist when he can best be retained.
professor neppe can express opinions in a wide variety of different contexts.
chart review can be valuable to establish forensic neuropsychiatric and psychopharmacological perspectives and strategies.
evaluations of patients whom dr neppe has seen clinically, are very useful.
dr neppe makes an excellent expert witness during depositions, trial and advising in preparation for trial.
whereas dr neppe does not generally accept criminal cases, he is prepared to act as an advisory consultant.
dr neppe is an eminently suitable rebuttal or surebuttal witness in neuropsychiatry, psychopharmacology and the biological aspects of psychiatry.
dr neppe can give expert appraisals of some of the medical strengths and weaknesses of cases within his domain of expertise. attorneys have found this very useful in their evaluations as to whether to settle a case or even take the case on.
dr neppe may be useful as a so-called "big gun." whereas the attitudes of jurors may differ, because of his background, qualifications, expertise and  experience in communication skills, theoretically, this could be a major advantage, though, of course, no warrantees can be made!
dr neppe's rates are highly competitive for this level of expertise.
dr neppe has been retained nationally in the usa as well as outside the usa in forensic psychiatry / neuropsychiatry.
  he is retained by both plaintiff and defense in civil cases and endeavors to deliver unbiased expert opinions in that regard.

                          discipline of neuropsychiatry with clinical, academic, 
                          research, forensic and educational emphases. his major

                          in criminal cases although this is an area he no longer 
                          prefers to do. he has also served in arbitration, and 
                          rebuttal capacities. dr neppe consults nationally, 
                          particularly on challenging and complex cases, giving

                          on difficult medicolegal problems in his disciplines 
                          providing an objective opinion on the medical strengths 
                          and weaknesses of individual cases, and possibly finds 
                          aspects that had not previously been considered relevant. 
                          this may involve a review of records to obtain preliminary 
                          ideas as to how to proceed further or be based on the 
                          extensive clinical evaluations performed at the pacific 
                          neuropsychiatric institute.

                          injury and psychiatric medicine. despite this the vast 
                          majority of his work is not specifically forensic, but 
                          clinical.

                          professions, has been perceived as a major contribution 
                          and a classic, defining as it does, the new literary

professor neppe's major research areas include pharmacologic, 
                          neuropsychiatric and phenomenologic elements. he developed 
                          several measuring neuropsychiatric instruments and inventories 
                          including the brocas 
                          scan (screening cerebral assessment of neppe), the 
                          inset (inventory 
                          of neppe of symptoms of epilepsy and the temporal lobe), 
                          the straw (the 
                          first time / severity measure for tardive dyskinesia), 
                          a geriatric inpatient instrument namely the pbrs (with jp 
                          loebel) (the problem behaviors rating scale) as well 
                          as research subjective paranormal questionnaires and 
                          narcolepsy questionnaires. additionally, he first demonstrated 
                          the links of anomalistic psychological experiences (subjective 
                          paranormal experience) with the temporal lobe of the 
                          brain. his pharmacologic areas include the only double 
                          blind study demonstrating the value of carbamazepine 
                          in dyscontrol and psychosis thereby being a major pioneer 
                          of the whole area of anticonvulsant drugs in psychiatry 
                          —this has possibly impacted on millions, the use 
                          of high dose buspirone as a successful treatment for 
                          tardive dyskinesia, and the extended use of azapirones 
                          in aggression and attention deficit disorder. he 
                          has also developed concepts in medical areas such as 
                          deinduction, non-vertiginous dizziness, 
                           dysproccia, chindling and possible temporal 
                          lobe symptoms. 
he is also a media resource. (more info.)


pni neuropsychiatric evaluations
what kinds of review do neuropsychiatric patients have? 
                          because it is a new specialty, guidelines are lacking. 
                          at the pacific neuropsychiatric institute, these evaluations 
                          are generally extensive, involving several units of 
                          neuropsychiatric testing and numerous comprehensive 
                          complex clinical consultations as well as appropriate 
                          electroencephalographic (e.g. outpatient home ambulatory 
                          monitoring) and neuroradiologic (e.g. mri, spect) examinations. 
                          following on these clinical comprehensive assessments 
                          with follow-ups occur as necessary. these evaluations 
                          are frequently highly relevant to prognosis and etiology 
                          and two of the clinical tests we developed have been 
                          very useful and simple instruments in evaluation of 
                          the progress over long and short periods of time, in 
                          one instance examining defects of higher brain function 
                          and in the second, concentrating on symptomatology. our 
                          hope is to delineate what is clinically relevant as 
                          opposed to findings of dubious significance which are 
                          sometimes generated with full scale neuropsychological 
                          batteries - such batteries can, of course, be very helpful 
                          in the holistic medical context. many patients are initially 
                          clinically, not forensically, referred for appropriate 
                          medical management, and the medical insurances in those 
                          instances become the appropriate source for billing.
