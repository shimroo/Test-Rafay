cold weather tips
holiday season feasts mean potential fats oils and grease (fog) into sewer lines, causing backups and breaks. all of this is exacerbated by cold weather, freezing pipes, frozen drains, and faster cooling and coagulating of fogs. stay ahead of these risks with these tips!

never put fogs down drains, toilets, or sewers.
scrape fog and food scraps from pots, pans, and dishes and dispose of them in the trash.
use sink strainers to catch food items before they reach pipes and sewer lines.
fogs can be placed in a disposable container to cool and solidify and then put in the trash.

      shingles, using the western red cedar, which grows in abundance
      in the region.
