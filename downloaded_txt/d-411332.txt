                                    radio show at heartical fm


the
                                    dubroom is currently having a weekly radio
                                    show at the internet reggae radio station
                                    heartical fm. but we also have an extensive
                                    archive of previous shows we've done
                                    throughout the years. most can be downloaded
                                    straight from the dubroom servers, or
                                    streamed from mixcloud. 
                                    take a look at radio dubroom's own little
                                    place at dubroom.org and discover some very
                                    interesting music. of course the emphasis is
                                    on dub tracks but that's by far not the only
                                    thing we play.

one
                                    of the most important parts of the dubroom:
                                    mp3.dubroom.org, your one-stop for free and
                                    legal (dub) reggae mp3's. sure, there is
                                    more than enough uninteresting material out
                                    there and that is why everything on this
                                    website is hand-picked and reviewed to serve
                                    the online (dub) reggae community with some
                                    of the best material out there. completely
                                    in the vibe of the dubroom, we only review
                                    material that is actually worthwhile. browse
                                    by albums, single tracks or podcast.
some music can be downloaded straight
                                    from the dubroom server, like music released
                                    through creative commons (cc) and/or because we
                                    obtained permission and/or the music isn't
                                    available elsewhere anymore and/or we're
                                    talking about rare, historic and

midi
                                    archives


in
                                    a way, this is where it all started back in
                                    1997. that's about the time messian dread
                                    started releasing his music online through
                                    the -then popular- midi format. the format
                                    has since gone back to the studio,
                                    especially with the introduction of the mp3
                                    format and faster internet. still, the midi
                                    archives serve a purpose, as it is visited
                                    daily by people looking for, well, looking
                                    for midi.
whether
                                    you're a producer looking for chords or
                                    other inspirational things, a historian
                                    looking for ancient online music, or simply
                                    like a little bit of nostalgia, check out
                                    the midi archives. especially since all
                                    releases have been put into the creative
                                    commons domain at august 16, 2014.

yesus
                                    kristos livity


last,
                                    but definitely not least: read our words of
                                    wisdom for the seeker of redemption. when
                                    you seek redemption, that is. on what could
                                    be considered the most important page of all
                                    thousands of pages on this website, you can
                                    find an explanation of and introduction to
                                    the (eternal) life offered to each and every
                                    one by the creator himself. 
do not go
                                    to this section looking for arguments,
                                    political correctness, or any other reason
                                    but a simple hunger and thirst for the pure
                                    untainted grace and redemption that yesus
                                    kristos has to offer.
