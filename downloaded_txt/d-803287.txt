        how we came to be "zawieco bengals"
    




    before moving to stuart, florida, we lived in ny, on eastern long island... we had a vet there that we admired greatly due to his knowledge and compassionate nature. when i got my little seal mink spotted girl, i had just lost my 19 year old calico, daisy. 
    dr. zawie had been his kind, caring self as he did the best for daisy (and me). he touched my family and me greatly, and we named the little girl zawie, in his honor. 
    zawie is now momma zawie, and the matriarch of the cattery. 
    hence the name zawie and company...... zawieco.

        history of the bengal cat
    

       bengal cats are a hybrid cat breed from crossing an asian leopard cat (felis bengalensis) with a domestic cat. this small, elusive alc wildcat is found from siberia, pakistan, tibet and india, burma, thailand, and parts of mainland china then south to sumatra, java, borneo and the philippines. they can thrive in a variety of habitats... dense tropical forests, scrub, semi-desert and agricultural areas. 
       




          (photo courtesy of jill orman, legacie bengals)
      


the species latin name (bengalensis) is derived from the first leopard cat that was discovered swimming in the bay of bengal. 
       
       the early generation bengals are called foundation bengals, or "f" cats, and represent bengals that are 1, 2, or 3 generations removed from the alc. a bengal is considered domestic (can be registered and shown) when it is 4 or more generations removed from the alc.
   








      how lighting affects bengal cats in pictures
       











      pictures of the same bengal cat, just minutes apart, as the sun affected his coloring, changing him from a grayish tone to a much warmer brown.
      

















 bengals in action!
    

     bengals love to jump, and they are excitingly good jumpers!  watch them show off  their strength, beauty and agility in these videos. 
     















     and when they are done jumping and knocking things over, they will often find a nice high place to chill out and relax!!
     






















         bengal cats are a fun loving, affectionate, energetic and curious breed. they have inherited their ancestors intelligence and fondness for water, and it is not uncommon to find your bengal playing in the sink, tub or water dish. bengals are social pets, they get along with children and other animals, and they are happy to carry on a conversation with you.
