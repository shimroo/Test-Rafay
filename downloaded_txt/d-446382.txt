no more

i can't keep up with updating the store listings for yarn shops in fl and local snb's anymore.  the pages will be removed.  duplicate information is available about everywhere, unlike when i started this blog, and i'm also tired of people giving me attitude about updates or about not wanting their information on their public knitting group made "public". er. . . what part of public is confusicatin' for you?i'll still continue to post news having to do with fl knitting as i find it!
