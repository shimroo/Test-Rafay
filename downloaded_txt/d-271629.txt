 hushbutton fans: harry has finally retired and left hushbutton in the hands of patrick murray, an old friend and colleague. please visit catchtechnologies.com for all your microphone muting needs, or call patrick on 800-653-5702.




















 
welcome to the hja website, which as you see hasn't been updated for some time, since we stopped doing integrations in 2009, to be precise, and have just made hushbuttons since then. if you're an integrator we are now your vendor, no longer your competitor, with 40 years of experience to help support your hushbutton projects into the future. if you're an end-user, please browse the site and then talk to your integrator about any ideas it generates.
