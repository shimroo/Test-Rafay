the common manifests god’s glory too! skies, springs, and squirrels







"by faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of god, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible." (heb 11:3 esv)

today, as in all periods of human history, human beings have great interest in the sensational and the supernatural. there is a penchant in human nature for the bizarre and unusual.  the latest “viral video” will no doubt bear this out. 

this desire for all things amazing is a god given one.  god has wired humanity with a thirst for awe.  his purpose is that we would be in awe of him, and all of his works.  

what many fail to realize is that it is not just the uncommon which is awesome. while they pursue the sensational in those things that are uncommon, they run past many things that are awesome, but whose awesomeness is hidden by their commonness.  these common things are bursting with the awesome glory of god, but that glory can only be seen through the eyes of faith. 

what could be more common than the sky? it is always above us. we never even wonder if it will be there when we walk outside. yet the writers of scripture saw the awesome glory of god in that ever present common thing. they wrote things like: "the heavens declare the glory of god, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork." (psa 19:1 esv), and "the heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory." (psa 97:6 esv) and "when i look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?" (psa 8:3–4 esv) 

these words of scripture expressing worship and awe, while looking toward the sky, were penned before the invention of today’s powerful telescopes. modern scientists can see things that the psalmists could never see.  they know, for example, that there are multiplied billions of stars just like our sun.  but while their telescopes can show them the stars, many of these scientists  lack eyes of faith to see the awesomeness of the god who created those stars. they fail to realize that he has a different name for every star, and because his power never fails, every star is accounted for! (isaiah 40:26)

every facet of the common creation of which we are only a part, is bursting with awe, as it manifests god’s glory! whether it is a spring gushing millions of gallons of water daily, or one squirrel chasing another one around and around a tree, it is all awesome, and yet all common. 

these common things make men accountable to their creator. paul writes, "for his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. so they are without excuse." (rom 1:20 esv) one day every human being will give an account for what  he or she did, with the revelation of god’s awesome glory, through what we would call just common every day things.

“father, help us to see your awesome glory in the common things of our lives, and worship you with fervency, affection and pleasure.”

the things i learned from losing my mind





holly turner:
    the printer is not on their computers yet
aaron:
    where are you?
holly turner:
    where am i????
    don't you know where i am?
aaron:
    something has happened
holly turner:
    what???
aaron:
    i don't know where you are
    please tell me
holly turner:
    aaron are you teasing?
aaron:
    no
    i have lost something
holly turner:
    do i need to call you?
aaron:
    yes




so began my experience with tga- transient global amnesia.   of this day i have no recollection, except what holly and others tell me and occasional "flashes" of memory. she was working at the house of one of our friends, and i was to go over there later to do some work on their computers.  after this exchange of text messages, she did call me, and our conversation caused her to come home right away. 

a very strange experience 

i can honestly say this is the strangest thing i have ever experienced. in all of my years of ministry, and walking with people through their medical problems, i had never heard of this.  during the episode, i remembered my own identity, and the identity of others, but did not remember other pieces of information.  for example, i recently purchased a new guitar--a taylor 814 ce. i had previously owned a taylor 314 ce, but had sold it on e bay. when holly came home, she asked me if i could play my guitar, and i did, but i was confused as to why i had an 814 instead of a 314,  and did not know what happened to the 314. when i got to the hospital,  joel met us there, and i knew him, but didn't remember where he worked.  i remembered that he and his family have been sick recently.  when asked who the president was, i could remember that it was barack obama. but when asked for my address, i gave my post office box from years ago when we lived in steinhatchee, instead of our current one.  i continually asked the same questions again, and again. 

tests tests and more tests

when holly came home and realized that something was wrong, she tried her best to get me to get dressed and get ready to go to the hospital.  i was not defiant, but was not compliant either.  i was confused and bewildered.  she had been at the home of  matthew and jennifer ellison. matthew called their pastor, brother leon holden to pray for me. he was away, and called his son chris to come and check on me.  chris came, and then matthew ellison, mitch and carolyn mitchell.  the emts were called, but i finally ended up just riding to the hospital with holly.  upon arrival in the er, i was immediately taken back and the testing began.  it was decided that i should be admitted, and i ended up spending a total of 3 days in the hospital.  they were not able to find the cause of my episode, but did find some other minor things wrong with me. 

what i learned 
(again)

i am dependent   as a matter of fact all of us are. we are only alive, functioning and in our right minds because of the grace and mercy of god.  at any moment, if the lord so chooses, we could lose our ability to function. (lam 3:22 kjv) “it is of the lord’s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.” it is humbling to realize that at any moment, this kind of thing can happen, and there is nothing i can do to stop it. anyone who thinks that they are in control of their own destiny is very foolish. we are all at the mercy of god. and not only that, but we are dependent on others.  there are times in all of our lives when we cannot take care of our selves, and must depend on others to take care of us. 

god communicates his love through others.  throughout this ordeal, many people have communicated their love and concern to holly and i. some came to the hospital. some called. some sent texts. some posted on facebook.  two of my dear pastor friends came and prayed with me. it meant so much to holly and i.  this experience makes me more than ever, want to reach out to people who are going through hard times. if i started listing all of the people that have meant so much to me through this time, i would surely leave someone out, and feel badly because of it. (as you know i am having memory problems these days). under this point, i must say that i am very thankful for facebook.  facebook allowed me to stay in touch with many people during this time, and many people to communicate with me at a time, when i needed to hear from them. god truly communicates his love for us through others! 

humor is therapeutic.  i am aware that not everyone "gets' my sense of humor.  i have been told that it is "strange" but being able to see humor in things and laugh was a great blessing during this time, at least to me. there are many things to laugh about in a hospital if you just know what to look for! i am convinced that they make you wear those split back gowns, so that you won't be tempted to run away when you see the food! who in their right minds would want to be seen in one of those things on the street!

god providentially arranges appointments.  one of the tests that i had was a chemically induced stress test.  this test is conducted in three different stages and there is some waiting that is required between stages. i found my self in a row of wheel chairs next to a black man by the name of leroy watson.  so here we were side by side in our wheel chair, and i looked at him, smiled, and asked him if he wanted to race! (see my last heading). he laughed and so began our conversation.  i was going to bring the gospel into the conversation, but before i could he did! he began to talk about how good god had been to him. he shared about his marriage and family. he has been married for 46 years, and all of his kids have gotten scholarships to different universities. we talked about how the gospel was the answer to racial issues. all the while people were listening to our conversation and hearing about the greatness and glory of our god and his gospel! i was able to share the gospel with two of the techs that worked on me. i believe that if we will be sensitive to the holy spirit, we can exploit the appointments that the lord sets up for us to fellowship with other christians, and share the gospel with the lost!

thankful 
i am very thankful to be home, and at least for now i am in my right mind (some could debate this point i know). i can honestly say that my love for others, and compassion for those who are suffering has grown through this. i hope to be a better, husband, father, friend, and pastor because of losing my mind!

starbucks and the providence of god





as i write this, i am in vero beach, florida.  holly and i drove down yesterday afternoon, and are going back to steinhatchee this morning. the purpose of our quick trip, was to witness the baptism of our seven year old grandson, john william andersen iv.  god saved johnny a few months ago, and he followed the lord in baptism last night, along with three other young men.  
i woke up this morning at 4:45 am, and didn't want to wake the rest of the house trying to make coffee in an unfamiliar place, so i decided to grab a shower and head to starbucks, where i could drink some coffee and have my morning devotions.
upon my arrival at starbucks at about 5:40 am, i noticed only one other car in the parking lot, and a young man sitting at the table outside reading by the lights of the parking lot.  i got out of my car walked up to the door, only to find it locked.  they weren't open yet! i peered through the window and saw that there were workers in there, so i knew it wouldn't be long. i looked at the book the young man was reading and noticed that it was the bible.  i am affectionately referred to by my family as "the greeter" (at least i think it is affectionately),  because of my tendency to speak to strangers. i asked the young man what he was reading, and looking up at me with a quizzical look, simply replied, "the bible." i said, "it's good isn't it!" looking up again, this time with an even a more quizzical look, simply said, "yeah it is." i said, "where are you reading in it?" he replied, "samuel." i said,"yeah, samuel had a great mother but lousy sons." 
by this time, they were turning on the lights and unlocking the door.  come to find out, they were running about 15 minutes late, just long enough for me to have this conversation with this young man.  
after we got inside, i introduced myself, and found out his name was jason.  jason, a young man in his mid to late 20s,  was saved about 10 months ago, and gave testimony of all that god was doing  in his life.  he shared how that god had totally changed him, given him a job at publix, and a christian girl friend who had become his fiance.  they are to be married in january.

as we continued our conversation, he shared with me that of late he had been experiencing a lot of opposition from the enemy, and was very discouraged. i was thankful that i could share with him, many things that god has used to in my life to bring me encouragement over the years. he had many questions, particularly about his upcoming marriage. i shared with him that holly and  i are celebrating 31 years of marriage on monday, and some truth from ephesians 5, that i have found helpful through the years. 
jason said that he normally would not be in starbucks that early on a saturday morning, but that he had been awake since 3:00 am and decided to come to starbucks at about 5:00 am, and read his bible and drink some coffee. i normally would not be at that starbucks at all.  but god in his providence had arranged for our meeting, and i was encouraged by it, and i believe he was as well.


when we got ready to leave, i asked if i could pray with him to which he heartily replied, "yes!" we prayed,  exchanged cell phone numbers,  and promised to keep in touch.
as i write this, i am back at jeremy's and still haven't read my bible yet, but i believe i have met with the lord through fellowship with one of my brothers in christ. now to get in the word!

the mothers in my life.





tomorrow is mother's day.  i have been working most of the day getting ready for the services that we will have at the church that i serve. i have been thinking all day about the mothers in my life.  tonight i want to write a tribute to them.

my mother wanda turner, was a godly, practical woman, who had much common sense.  she was one of the hardest working people i have ever known.  she was responsible, and she loved us kids unconditionally.  she went home to be with the lord two years ago, and there is not a day that goes by that i don't think about her.  i am thankful for her and wish i could talk to her tonight.  i always remembered her on mothers day, but i wish i would have done more for her.




 
my oldest daughter rachel andersen. i fully realize that she is my daughter and not my mother! my mind doesn't work as good as it used to but i am not that bad off yet! however she is the mother of two of my grandchildren. and i must say that i have profound respect for her as a mother. she loves her children and her family, and takes wonderful care of them.  she loves the lord, and is one of the best writers i have ever read. i am so proud of her! i love you rach! 






cheryl turner is my daughter in law, and the mother of two of my grandsons. i am thankful for how you love and take care of preston, and zac. as well as how you love jeremy.  you are a wonderful mother, and wife. we are blessed to have you in our family! i thank god for you!




waynette turner is my daughter in law and the mother of one of my granddaughters, one of my grandsons, and soon to be the mother of my youngest grandchild. thank you for  how you love and take care of your alena, and luke, and how you love joel.  we love you and are glad that you are in our family!







my youngest daughter bethany goddard. she is the mother of one of my grandson, and one of my granddaughters.  i have seen you walk through very deep water in the last several months and come through stronger and more godly than even before. i am so thankful for how god is working in your life, and how you are a godly mother to your children, and as well as a godly wife to your husband. i pray for you daily, and love you more than i can say!




i have saved the best for last. holly the mother of all my children. there is no way that i can put into words what you mean to me. i have the deepest and most profound respect for you. your influence on our entire family cannot even be measured.  you are the wife of my youth, and i am enjoying growing old with you.  you make me very happy. you are the greatest mother i have ever known. thank you for filling our lives with your smile, and your love! your family deeply loves you!

the blessedness of confession





“for when i kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. for day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up* as by the heat of summer. selah i acknowledged my sin to you, and i did not cover my iniquity; i said, “i will confess my transgressions to the lord,” and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.” (psa 32:3-5 esv)

two time presidential candidate john edwards has been very much in the news for the last several days because of an affair that he had with  rielle hunter.  after denying the affair, he finally confessed to it in an interview with bob woodruff of abc news.  in that interview, he said that he had "made a mistake" and that he had confessed that mistake to his wife, and to his lord, and had found forgiveness.  i couldn't help but think about this incident when i read this text this morning as part of my bible reading schedule.

the purpose if this writing is not to criticize or cast judgment on mr. edwards.  i sincerely feel sorry for his wife and family. my hope is that he really does know the lord jesus christ, and that he truly has received forgiveness, not only for the sin of adultery, but for all of his sins.  the truth is, there is no one reading this, including the writer or is without sin, and in need of god's forgiveness through the merits of the lord jesus christ.

but this incident reminds us of some truths about confession--truths that are found in this psalm.  allow me just to list some of them for you.
happy is the man whose sin is forgiven.  “blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. blessed is the man against whom the lord counts no iniquity,” (psa 32:1-2 esv) there is no greater joy, than knowing that all is well between you and the lord, and that all of your sin is confessed and forgiven, and no longer held against you!
miserable is the christian who is living with un-confessed sin. “for when i kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. for day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up* as by the heat of summer. selah” (psa 32:3-4 esv) they are the recipients of god's chastening hand.  they are acquainted with godly sorrow, because the spirit of god that lives within them is grieved,  they are going to be grieved!
confession involves more than saying "i made a mistake." “i acknowledged my sin to you, and i did not cover my iniquity; i said, “i will confess my transgressions to the lord,”” (psa 32:5 esv) notice that the psalmist did not say, "i confessed my mistakes" but rather, "i acknowledged my sin...i will confess my sin."  a mistake is something that you did not intend to do.  a sin is on purpose.  it is rebellion against the commandments of god. it is much worse than a  mistake.  jesus christ did not die for our mistakes, rather he died for is sins!
god is faithful to forgive when true confession is made. “and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. selah” (psa 32:5 esv) this is something that we should stop and think on.  god has forgiven you dear reader of every sin, if you have truly confessed it in dependence upon christ!  therefore you can pray with confidence! “therefore let everyone who is godly offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found; surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach him.” (psa 32:6 esv)
confession of sin gives confidence in time of trouble.  “you are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with shouts of deliverance. selah i will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; i will counsel you with my eye upon you.” (psa 32:7-8 esv) one of the most important elements of this is the confidence that god will lead and guide us!
confession of sin restores our ability to enjoy our god. “but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the lord. be glad in the lord, and rejoice, o righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!” (psa 32:10-11 esv)
confession of sin is evidence that we are truly trusting the lord. but steadfast love surrounds the one who  trusts in the lord.
"father, please help us to confess our sins to you, and not live in the misery of unconfessed sin.   thank you for the promise of your word that tells us that if we confess our sins you are faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousnesses." thank you for the blood of the lord jesus christ, through whom we have forgiveness of our sins."

how do you react to bad news?





“as soon as i heard these words i sat down and wept and mourned for days, and i continued fasting and praying before the god of heaven. and i said, “o lord god of heaven, the great and awesome god who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that i now pray before you day and night for the people of israel your servants, confessing the sins of the people of israel, which we have sinned against you. even i and my father’s house have sinned. we have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you commanded your servant moses. remember the word that you commanded your servant moses, saying, ‘if you are unfaithful, i will scatter you among the peoples, but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your dispersed be under the farthest skies, i will gather them from there and bring them to the place that i have chosen, to make my name dwell there.’ they are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. o lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, and give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” now i was cupbearer to the king.” (neh 1:4-11 esv)how do you respond to bad news?  our automatic first response to bad news can tell us a lot about our hearts.  in nehemiah's case, his response was to weep and mourn, which are understandable human responses.  but that is not all that he did.  he prayed and fasted.  this tells us where nehemiah's confidence was.  it could have been said of him, “he is not afraid of bad news; his heart is firm, trusting in the lord.” (psa 112:7 esv)prayer and fasting indicate that we are in fact trusting in the lord.notice several elements of his prayer.1.  he recognized the greatness of the god to whom he was speaking. “o lord god of heaven, the great and awesome god who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments," it is very important for us to realize that when we pray we are not just saying words in the air, but talking to the "great and awesome god" who is faithful to keep his promises.2. he requested that god hear his prayer. "let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that i now pray before you day and night for the people of israel your servants,"3. he confessed sin. " confessing the sins of the people of israel, which we have sinned against you. even i and my father’s house have sinned. we have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you commanded your servant moses." if we confess and repent of our sin, no matter what they have been, god will hear and forgive.  this will put us in a position to get our prayers heard and answered.4. he claimed a promise. "though your dispersed be under the farthest skies, i will gather them from there and bring them to the place that i have chosen, to make my name dwell there.’" there are so many faith strengthening promises to claim, all of which god will be faithful to keep and honor.5.  he made his request.  "they are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. o lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name, and give success to your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”this pattern is so often repeated in scripture that we dare not overlook it but pay close attention to it. what problems are you facing today dear reader? in closing consider the following promises of god from todays reading in psalms.“oh, how abundant is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you and worked for those who take refuge in you, in the sight of the children of mankind! in the cover of your presence you hide them from the plots of men; you store them in your shelter from the strife of tongues. blessed be the lord, for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me when i was in a besieged city. i had said in my alarm,* “i am cut off from your sight.” but you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy when i cried to you for help. love the lord, all you his saints! the lord preserves the faithful but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride. be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the lord!” (psa 31:19-24 esv)
