the result according to visibility is of a minimum of forced and ornate intervention, and of a maximum in the space in which we operate, out of respect and appreciation for the nature, learning and understanding of the specific desert environment in which the hotel takes place!
the area of the hotel stands on about 40 dunams and is all one homogeneous desert space that forms a fit with the crater it overlooks, using ancient navigation language from the "nabataean" period, which marks road's and turns in the desert roads, along many miles.
due to this all paths in the hotel are marked with rows of stones.
what's more, the desert animal's that turn around the hotel grounds continue to live in their natural environment.
all this and more provide guests with the true feeling that exists in the desert, in terms of the visibility of the space, the climatic dryness and the shadowless temperature, while combining hospitality with the highest standards received today in israel and around all over the world.
