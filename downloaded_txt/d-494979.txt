    what our

﻿parishioners say



    

  


the warmth of this parish helped me reconnect with my catholic roots after a 25-year absence. i am closer to god due in part to this community.  joanie anderson

 
  


“what i love most about this parish are the close relationships i've developed with fellow parishioners, which deepen and reinforce my faith. our church is very warm and welcoming. i truly feel at home here.”  kerry franzman

 
  


“this parish has been my spiritual home for many years. there are so many ways to get involved , give back, and make friends. i love that we have two warm, wonderful priests.”   maria vitola

 
  


“i have been a member since 1995 and have seen many changes. the biggest change is how i have grown spiritually and closer to the lord. the clergy have encouraged me to participate in so many ministries that i never thought i would ever be a part of. i am so blessed that this parish has become my church family.”  mark gallagher
