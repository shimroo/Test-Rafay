“i had emailed your company about an issue, and this morning -- to my pleasant surprise -- i received an email with the answer, and now i'm happily playing solsuite again. i must say that it's quite unusual for a software company to be as proactive as you have been. 
                     that's very nice and i appreciate it.“
richard mckee u.s.





“just want you to know that i've been playing solsuite
					 several times every day for the last 20 years... and can't imagine computer life without it.
					 your menus and background material are nothing short of sensational.thank you very much...”

“i'm impressed with the exceptional quality of solsuite solitaire
and am spreading the word among my friends and family.”
donna hensley u.s.





“not only is solsuite the very best set of card games on the whole of the internet,
                               but the support is second to none - simply amazing. i have been at this address for 17 years
                               and i know i already had solsuite on my computer before i moved here.
                               i knew way back then that the quality of your graphics and the professional
                               'style' of the way your programme was designed was so much better than
                               any other card game on sale, and i've never regretted paying your charges.“
geoff lacey great britain





“i have enjoyed solsuite for over ten years and your support is part of the reason.
                     thanks to all of you for myour continuing support. in a world of choice, this your attitude
					 and commitment towards your customer-users does is the difference.“
david j. wyner u.s.





“greetings from iceland! thank you for your fun games; i appreciate the effort you put into solsuite.
                     i can tell you that in my isolated, dark and cold country, especially during the long and cold days/nights of winter,
                     many an icelander has gone mad-mad i tell you!!!-from the lack of sunlight and warmth. it is a comfort to have these games.“
kilowag magnusson iceland
