page to see all the links.


all types of  



new and used firearms,

deceased estates.

*this is the first firearms retail web site in australia and 
	went live in 2003 and i haven't changed it much since then.
yes, its a horrible, dodgy looking thing that's intended 
to run as simply as possible on older systems, hence no
whistles and bells like drop down menus and flashy graphics etc, it's a real 
	internet "dinosaur" and that's just 
	the way i like it.
 everyone is welcome to use my photos for educational purposes, 
	however please give credit where its due. 
if you need them for 
commercial reasons please ask permission first 
as the contents of this site are copy written.

 


take note
 

all guns are stored with another dealer
under secure 24/7 guard at another location.
most 
 "new"
 
firearms 
are rarely kept in 



stock but are easily ordered on request though 
sometimes i have a few "new 
on consignment" firearms 
on hand from importers.


all comings and goings of people and vehicles are

remote monitored and recorded 24/7
*
all transactions for firearms and their parts are bound by the 
relevant state and commonwealth laws.
*
i only send firearms to licensed gun dealers or 
club armour's,  that is the law!








 
warning!




i run this business to the 
absolute letter of the law!


if you're stupid enough to contact me trying

to obtain firearms, ammunition 
parts and
accessories
illegally be warned, 
i log all those calls and

e-mails and
pass
them on to the police!

(also police sometimes 
covertly monitor communications of dealers as well...)
i've invested too much into 
this business to risk it all for a few crooked bucks!

if you're interested in taking up the sport or need some 
advice or have 
an unregistered firearm of any type,
(even semi-auto etc) or 
old ammunition etc you don't know
what to do with,
by all means call me and i'll happily
and confidentially
point
you in the right direction.

  what 
does it all mean bob?

             new            
                               as new          

            
a new gun, in it's box with all                           second hand but unfired              

              accessories and unfired                                   or fired very few shots,                

  except for 
the usual factory testing.                no 
marks on stock and barrel etc


  fair/good/very 
good                         ratty                   
         
guns 
still in sound shooting condition            worn out, world weary and well used, or 
                 some usage marks on stock and           shit house! tomato stake! snapper sinker! crap!
                barrel to varying degrees.                    "put the poor bloody thing out of it's misery!"
  they still should have plenty of 
life in them.      not for shooting, wall hanger or parts only!


i source all my new firearms from the 
recognized

australian agents who can
offer factory warranties etc.
i do not deal with dodgy "gray" or "parallel" importers!
my 
new gun prices are fairly 
accurate but because of the fluctuating 
dollar and sometimes my clumsiness, it's always
a 
good
idea to get an 
updated quote.

pictures of 
new 
guns are often only examples and there may be variations
in finish, sights, grips, serial numbers and 
accessories etc.

sorry i don't stock powder, primers,
ammunition, gun parts or spares.

feb 14 
the eve of the roman feast of lupercalia. 
naked youths would run through rome, anointed with the blood of 
sacrificed dogs
and goats, waving thongs cut from the goats. 
if a young woman was struck by the thong, fertility was assured. 
pope gelasius 1st decided this was all a bit too much, and co-opted the 
roman holiday
to be the feast of st. valentine in 484 a.d. 
a wise decision i feel.go to 



the thoughts of chairman bob for more







do you have a gun 
or militaria that's 
surplus to your needs?do you have a gun 
or militaria that's 
surplus to your needs?
did granddad forget to drop into the q 
store before
rejoining civie street?
perhaps there's a gun, ammunition or militaria stuck in the shed or buried away that 

you 
forgot about or probably shouldn't have around any more?
regardless of type, calibre, make, category (a, b, c, d, h) or even if it's not 
registered, give me a call and lets see if we can register it or turn it into $$$
