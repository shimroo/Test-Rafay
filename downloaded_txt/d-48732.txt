more heaven than hell


                in religious mythology, purgatory is where souls pay for their earthly mistakes to gain entry into heaven. it’s about overcoming obstacles to attain eternal happiness.golfing at purgatory is a game of strategy. take care to avoid the numerous bunkers and thick, tall grass. stay in the fairway and soon you will realize the heavenly achievement of a lower score.
