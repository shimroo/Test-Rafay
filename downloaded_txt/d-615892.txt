welcome to giordano's









“in 1930, edwardo and mary giordano brought their family to martha’s vineyard island and 
                                                    together they established an american italian restaurant. eighty years and four generations later 
                                                    the giordano family is still carrying on the same old fashioned tradition in oak bluffs. we are 
                                                    proud to serve the people of martha	’s vineyard and we thank you for dining with our family. ”
sincerely,
the giordano family
