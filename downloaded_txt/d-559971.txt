“the trip went really well.  for me the tour was exactly what i was looking for, although initially it was a shock and outside my comfort zone.  but i very quickly got used to it and went with the flow.titiru was really good.  all the people were wonderful and the activities were well arranged.  i enjoyed some good meals cooked in the local way.the kolombangara hiking was really good in the forest.  the accommodation was fine.  the bathrooms were very basic but functional.  zolielo was very good.  andrew and andy were very welcoming and andy’s brother john wayne and his wife were great hosts.  this was by far the best cooking. here’s a photo at the top is midway through the worldwar 2 tour.for me the entire tour was a great success and the people are what makes it special.thanks for putting it together for me.”

“hi emily, thank you for your knowledge once again.i hope you realize who our travel agent will be when we visit oz.  your service is outstanding!”

“amazing holiday. go tours looked after everything we needed and organised a great trip away for the whole family. would definitely book with go tours again.”

— brad and maree hartley

  


“hi nick we had an amazing trip to the solomon islands, it was wonderful, so beautiful and we had so much fun exploring the islands. it was great to stay with kilo at titiru eco lodge, they were great hosts and made us feel so welcomed, it was really nice to have local style food and to be shown around by his family, they also made a special effort to show us the experience of the new year celebrations in the local village! i’d definitely recommend it if you have any customers interested in the future as it felt like a very unique experience. sanbis was wonderful and the best diving i’ve ever done, i still can’t get over the visibility and warmth of the water. and we loved papatura island retreat, so beautiful and remote! think bobby was a bit overwhelmed at the prospect of taking complete beginner surfers out on the reef breakers but we survived and even managed to stand up on our very first day! thanks for all your help organising and planning.best wishes”
