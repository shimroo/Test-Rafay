we believe that locally generated knowledge and solutions are key to solving local and global challenges








research and knowledge saves lives
our vision is of research and knowledge at the heart of development – where decisions are informed by relevant and rigorous evidence, and where knowledge is created with the communities it is intended to serve.
that requires many voices, many institutions and many types of knowledge. we call it an equitable knowledge ecosystem.
our mission is to support southern individuals and institutions to make that possible.
our work




so talent can thrive

we measured our impact on early career researchers in the global south, expanded our work on further developing tescea, developed new toolkits, trained research writing facilitators, ran multiple online courses, and more. read our full annual review here.
