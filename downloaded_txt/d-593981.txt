weather alert


...cold temperatures and slippery road conditions to persist into
tuesday morning...

recent snowfall along with gusty winds has led to drifting snow
across the region. very cold temperatures will allow any snow that
drifts onto roadways to quickly freeze into black ice in some
areas. this will especially affect north-south oriented roadways
that are downwind of large open fields. motorists should drive
with additional caution in these areas.

in addition, the gusty winds and temperatures falling back into
the single digits will bring winds chills of 5 to 10 below zero by
tuesday morning.
