our location makes us speciallocated at the 42nd parallel and the southern end of lake michigan, our region contains 90% of michigan’s vineyards. this massive body of fresh water, up to 80 miles across and 600 feet deep, creates a benevolent mesoclimate for fruit growing, unique to our side of the lake and this corner of michigan.our “inland ocean” provides protection from the extreme cold of winter and spring, and extends the growing season later into the fall. it also provides more than enough natural rainfall to produce the most flavorful grapes that will be crafted into award-winning wines.
