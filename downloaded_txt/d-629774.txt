	 exams are coming!!!
	 
    


wow...i haven't blogged for about 2 months! unbelievable! haha...it's because i am busy. now that i am in my 2nd year, i have projects and heavy subjects to study for. hm...hopefully all will be well...lol.okay...since exams are coming, i'll blogged something about the exams. i have been studying the exam papers of different subjects since my first year and semester and interestingly there's a pattern. do you know what it is? you know how some papers are essay-type and how some papers are mcq-type...well, even though they may be different there's still a common question amongst them all. it was "discovered" through one of our informal study groups.friend a: i think fracture will come-out in the exams.friend b: you mean the one with the linearization?a: yeah.b: okay, so steph, what do you think will come out in the exam?me: so fast arh? it's my turn already?a: yeah, we all thought of a question that will come out for the exam, now it's your turn.me: hm...let me think.so i flipped through the lecture notes and past year papers. after a few seconds of suspense...me: ah hah!a: what?me: i realized something. i spotted a question...a very important question.b: which one?me: the first question in the exam.a: so what about it?me: well, the first and most important question in the exam is your matriculation number!so dear friends, please don't forget to answer the first question which is your matriculation number.now for something inspirational. i found this inspiring video from youtube. it's about a girl and her hard work. it's pretty inspiring. enjoy.all the best for your exams :d

	 back in singapore
	 
    


hello! i've been away for so long...yeah i know. why? because i missed 2 weeks of school and had to catch up with it. haiz...it's a lot of work i must say. anyway, i reached singapore at around midnight...like 1am. there i met azaria and her friend and passed to azaria her luggage. after that my parents brought me home. it was a tiring flight. 11 hours from san francisco to narita and 7 hours from narita to singapore. i reached home at around 2am and unpacked for awhile before going to sleep.i slept for a few hours as i have classes in the morning. so i slept for around 6 hours. then i walked out of my home and went to ntu. wah...got sbs bus leh...i reached ntu and waited to see who i would see first. i went to the lecture hall and saw one of my friend. i said hi to him and he was like "hey! you are back!". yes, i am back. the lecture was pretty hard to understand as i missed quite a lot of classes liao. i won't say i understand 100%...maybe around 50%? jia lat man. anyway, after that i went to library and met some of my other friends. most of them said something in common. "hey...you look tan!". yeah that was what they said. they said i look darker...lol. also they mentioned that my hair was pretty long. it was long as i didn't cut it for 2 months...haha...can you believe that? there was this friend who said something like this...friend: wah...you look darker.me: haha...i know. a lot of people say that. is my hair long?friend: yeah...it's quite long.me: i know...i was planning to cut it.friend: it's long in a fashionable sense.lol...what does he mean by "fashionable"? i don't know. anyway i just cut my hair last week. so it's short now. school was pretty long as tuesday is my long day. after that i ate dinner at took the bus back home. whoa...the experience on the bus was...nostalgic. it has been a long time since i tapped my ez-link card and hear the *beep* sound...lol.another thing i missed about singapore is the food! lol...carrot cake, chicken rice, tau huey (beancurd), prata, cheng thing, bak kut teh...etc. wah the food here is nice loh...but so unhealthy...lol.however, there are some things that i don't miss at all. for example the weather. after bathing, i sweat after a few minutes...lol. it's so humid and sunny here man, unlike in berkeley where you hardly sweat. anyway, i don't really walk as much as i did in berkeley here in singapore because of the weather. in berkeley and san francisco, i used to walk a lot...like 7km or so. but here...lol. from house to bus stop already can sweat...it's humid man.another thing i noticed is that the people here are generally less friendly as the ones in berkeley. why do i say so? simple. there was once i was taking the lift to my floor. inside was an auntie. she saw me and i walked towards the lift. i thought that she pressed the "door open" button for me so that i can enter. so i said "thank you". however, when i walked in the door closed! can you imagine that? i looked at her and her face was black...lol. diao...and she didn't say sorry! -_- welcome to singapore. okay not all singaporeans are like that but encountering such a situation in just the first day is really...how you say...not very nice...lol.this semester will be a busy one for me as i have cca and projects to handle.one thing i noticed...i've been writing less and less...lol. could it be that...haha...hopefully not. this blog has been running since 2005.i don't know why but i still feel tired and sleepy...lol. must be the jetlag. okay i guess i end here first.

	 berkeley summer session 08 is over
	 
    


it truly has been a long time since i last blogged. at last, my exams are over! i just sat for my last (it also happened to be the first) exam paper today. the subject i took was ee100 electronic techniques for engineering.i must say that a lot of things have happened. i've seen how people mugged through the whole night, how toilet doors do not stay close when they are supposed to, how "kiasu" some people here can get, how friendships grow, how packing more than 8 books into your bag is stupid, how people here behave...etc.i will be back in singapore in 2 more days. i've missed like 2 weeks of school and hopefully i still can catch up.so far i am pretty satisfied with how things are going in life. all i can say is that the lord is good.i am now in stern hall writing this post. i just moved here. apparently, they placed me in a suite. it has two beds but i am the only occupant here. nice!interestingly, the people here don't really know where singapore is. it's like when i tell them i am from singapore, they are like "oh is that somewhere in india?" diao! there's this guy who said that singapore is in thailand...well at least it's closer to its actual place.tomorrow i will be shopping around for family and friends back in india...wait i mean thailand...er no...singapore.then there was once we were eating with this girl from america. we taught her how to speak some hokkien words such as "wah piang" and "wah lau". it was a very interesting experience...lol.anyway, when i go back to singapore, i hope that the workload there will be fine.
