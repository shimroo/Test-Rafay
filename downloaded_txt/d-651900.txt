                                        i ordered these flowers for my wife about one week before valentine's day. they were delivered mid-morning on valentine's day. she really loved the arrangement!

                                        i have used ponderosa flower shoppe for many years and they have always provided beautiful arrangements and delivered as promised.  like most everything else, prices have gone crazy.  although i don’t mind paying for quality, the $20 plus fee for delivery was excessive in my view.

                                        i had two orders to go out and both flower arrangements were beautiful and looked just like the picture i requested from. the woman i spoke to on the phone at ponderosa flowers was so friendly and helpful, even during this crazy busy season. i will most definitely be using them again.

                                        i'm not one to usually write a review, but i was thoroughly impressed with this florist. from the time i placed my order, their communication was flawless and i was surprised to see they kept me updated throughout the entire process. i received communication confirming my order, a picture after the arrangement was complete, an email letting me know it was out for delivery, and a follow up confirming the delivery was successful! they were caring, attentive, and the arrangement was beautiful. the flowers were vibrant, fresh and arranged perfectly. i live out of state and don't know how often the opportunity will present that i need flowers in this area, but i would definitely use ponderosa flower shoppe again in the future!

                                        this flower shop was more reasonably priced than the other one in the area by quite a big margin. i appreciated the snapshot of the bouquet they made and really thought it was beautiful. i would definitely use this company again.

florist's response:

i'm so sorry lynnette! roses really hate the hot weather we are having. would you like me to replace it? i'm getting roses in on monday again and would be more than happy to send out half a dozen roses in a vase to make up for it! please just let me know. warmest regards, yvonne
