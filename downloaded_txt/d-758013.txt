why join?
the oda supports all members at the national, state and local levels. from helping you manage your practice more efficiently & advocating on your behalf to offering tools & resources that help you find the answers you’re looking for – we’re there every step of the way.
we are all in this together! the importance of organized dentistry has gone undervalued in recent years, as times for dentists have been so favorable. but in an era of increasing student debt, massive political change in health care, and rapidly evolving technologies, our team must again have its importance realized. being a member of organized dentistry strengthens our profession.
the dental field is great because we have protected it. if we stop, this changes.
join the ada, your local and state dental societies. what else could you do for your career and your practice that costs so little but can do so much? together we stand.
