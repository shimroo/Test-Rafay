black_eyedgirlhello :) i am blackeyedgirl on dreamwidth and black_eyedgirl on livejournal. also blackeyedgirl-writes on tumblr.if you are here, i assume you are here for fic? do please note that i am fannish-fickle and with the exception of the west wing, tend not to stay writing the same thing for very long. in six months i may not be writing in the fandom that brought you here. i'm easily led astray that way ;)i mostly write slash, but also gen, het or femslash when the mood takes me/pornbattle is on. i sometimes write rpf. i love sci-fi and fantasy, superheroes, people solving mysteries, people saving the world, and ya novels. but, as i said, i'll try most anything once.almost all fic written from december 2009 onwards is on ao3: blackeyedgirl. pre that, tags on dreamwidth are best. the main fic tag is here: fanfic tag. i'm reposting older things on ao3, but it's slow going.friending/subscribing/accessmost of this journal is fanfic, or sometimes talking about fanfic or fandom or what i'm watching. the only locked stuff is very personal, or personally identifying. friend/subscribe at will, and the same for defriending/unsubscribing. at the moment, i mostly only subscribe to journals if we've spoken to each other, but do jump into any conversation you find interesting. i also mostly only reply to feedback if it asks a specific question or raises an issue/complaint. this is not a reflection on my love of feedback, which is considerable ♥ for various anxiety and introversion related reasons, i have limited capacity for interaction. but please do talk to me, and i'll talk back when i'm able! or don't talk - lurking is also perfectly acceptable.transformative worksif you would like to remix, translate, make podfic or art, or otherwise produce a transformative work of anything here, please do so! i would very much appreciate being sent a link to your work when you're done. please credit me as author of the work being transformed and include a link back.further informationabout-me is unsurprisingly the tag with more about me. there's also a tag for fandom memes - here - which is where most of my fandom ramblings end up. or ask me something on any post, and i'll try my best to answer it. i do better with questions.this entry was originally posted at dreamwidth: http://blackeyedgirl.dreamwidth.org/149811.html |  comments. please comment there using openid or signed anon.

yuletide letter 2016


oct. 10th, 2016 at 12:14 am



 


black_eyedgirldear writer,i'm sorry this is late - i haven't had free time this week, and when the schedule said 'assignments by sunday' i sort of thought that meant friday at the earliest! if you've already started writing, please go on ahead - i love these fandoms, and i look forward to reading whatever you come up with. but if you're stuck or you'd like some more information on what sort of stories i usually enjoy, or why i like these fandoms, i've written a little bit more here.i'm on ao3 as blackeyedgirl, and on tumblr as blackeyedgirl-writes.a note: one of these requests is a repeat, and one a partial repeat, for no other reasons than because these are still things i'd like. fic for any of these three requests would make me equally happy.( generalitiescollapse )( the chronicles of chrestomanci - diana wynne jonescollapse )( jane the virgin (tv)collapse )( road show - sondheim/weidmancollapse )i hope some of that was in some way useful, and if you do need to ask a question via mods i promise i will answer it. but really just write a story you love and i'm sure i'll love it too :)this entry was originally posted at dreamwidth: http://blackeyedgirl.dreamwidth.org/176858.html |  comments. please comment there using openid or signed anon.

black_eyedgirldear writer,i'm sorry this is so late - i wasn't expecting assignments to be out until yesterday/today, and then they were out early. i hope it didn't frustrate your writing plans too much, and if you have already started and are on a roll, then please don't let this stop you. however, if you're looking for more guidance than i gave in the requests, then i hope this helps. and i'm sure i'll love whatever you write.( generalitiescollapse )( alphascollapse )( the chronicles of chrestomanci - diana wynne jonescollapse )( hark! a vagrantcollapse )( homeward bounders - diana wynne jonescollapse )( orange is the new blackcollapse )( the thick of itcollapse )thank you for writing for me! and again, tell me a story you love, and i'm sure i'll love it too :)this entry was originally posted at dreamwidth: http://blackeyedgirl.dreamwidth.org/176146.html |  comments. please comment there using openid or signed anon.

hockey rpf: like other girls [girl!kane/toews; r]

yuletide reveals


jan. 3rd, 2014 at 8:16 pm



 


black_eyedgirlfirst, smilebackwards, thank you for the card and craftworks! ♥for yuletide, i was lucky enough to get two awesome fics in two different theatrey fandoms. ten (or twelve) plays in the life of geoffrey tennant (8050 words) by sagefandom: slings & arrowsrating: maturewarnings: no archive warnings applyrelationships: ellen fanshaw/geoffrey tennant, geoffrey tennant/oliver welles, geoffrey tennant & oliver welles, darren nichols/geoffrey tennantcharacters: geoffrey tennant, oliver welles, ellen fanshaw, darren nichols, original charactersadditional tags: theatre, backstory, pre-canon, post-canon, shakespeare, drunk sex, spoilers, yuletide, yuletide 2013, don't have to know canonsummary: ten (or twelve) plays, approximately, in the life of one geoffrey tennant. and attendant drama.this is basically the story of geoffrey tennant, new burbage, and how the productions he was a part of there shaped everything that came after. also of geoffrey and oliver, geoffrey and ellen, geoffrey and darren, and geoffrey and directing. i love alll the things about it, but should give special note to all the particular theatre details up to and including how much geoffrey falls in love with the idiosyncratic theatre he's exploring in the first scene, because theatre spaces get to you that way. and the ending, because that's what i wanted from the show.the problem of frank shepard (1685 words) by raedbardfandom: merrily we roll along - sondheim/furthrating: general audienceswarnings: no archive warnings applycharacters: franklin shepard, charley kringas, mary flynnadditional tags: writing about writing, yuletide, friendshipsummary: the play that won charley kringas the pulitzer was meant to be an exercise in cathartic release. but it hasn't really worked out that way.this was a less than covert yuletide treat, but no less beloved for it ;) this is charley and mary, still trying to get over frank sheppard, and failing in their separate ways. charley analyses himself because his therapist is a jerk; mary is better than everyone (especially frank) and drinks too much because she can't give up on them; nobody can write a happy ending but maybe they could have written a hopeful one. and it's the aftermath of one of my favourite musicals, written by one of my favourite people ♥ i wrote two things:not measured in minutes (5549 words) by blackeyedgirl for calliotropefandom: mission: impossible - ghost protocol (2011)rating: teen and up audienceswarnings: no archive warnings applyrelationships: william brandt/benji dunncharacters: benji dunn, william brandtadditional tags: canon-typical violence, rescue, post-traumatic stress disorder - ptsd, anxiety, snark, team dynamics, slow burn, missions, post-movie(s)summary: benji is not an analyst, but he is doing his best to make sense of brandt all the same.an: betaed by jamjar and signe, for whom i give all thanks. for some reason, this fic would not come easily. i suspect giving me free rein is a bad idea. this is actually, in a lot of ways, the story i wanted to write immediately after i saw the film, in that it's primarily about brandt fitting in with a team and finding his way back from a particularly messed-up type of trauma. also about coping mechanisms not being a bad thing and the people who love us not running roughshod over them. whether it also succeeds as a romance, i'm not sure :swe'll strive to please you every day (2741 words) by blackeyedgirl for thelittlestbirdfandom: slings & arrowsrating: teen and up audienceswarnings: no archive warnings applycharacters: anna conroy, geoffrey tennantadditional tags: friendship, post-seriessummary: one of anna’s duties, as manager of theatre sans argent, is occasionally getting geoffrey to do things he does not want to do. this is why they have a deal.an: i saw this prompt late-ish and knew i wanted to write a treat if i could, because the request was basically for a show-type shakespeare moment and something happy for anna, which felt in my wheelhouse :) also twelfth night, which is my favourite.this entry was originally posted at dreamwidth: http://blackeyedgirl.dreamwidth.org/174714.html |  comments. please comment there using openid or signed anon.

yuletide panic


dec. 21st, 2013 at 10:09 am



 


black_eyedgirlhi! don't suppose anyone'll be around tomorrow/monday who feels like a quick beta? slashy but not explicit, shenanigans and also people's brains being weird places? it's not strictly speaking finished yet, but it'll be postable pre-deadline and then i will edit at not-quite-leisure. will go hunting in yulechat if necessary but i can't really work irc and i'm always worried something will go awry. this is the least organised yuletide i've ever had. remind me again why i thought starting the mba was a good plan? i am a person with no time and much stress already, why did becoming a part-time student seem smart? why did no-one stop me? argh. anyway, i'm flying home for the week now so it's fine. it's all fine. yes?this entry was originally posted at dreamwidth: http://blackeyedgirl.dreamwidth.org/174415.html |  comments. please comment there using openid or signed anon.

"it's on with the lights to warm the dark" - cards?


nov. 20th, 2013 at 6:57 pm



 


black_eyedgirla) i have raedbard here with me now, and we're going to write some yuletide fic, and maybe go to the cinema and definitely watch some boxsets, and i'm not going to think of how bad the last few months have been. so that's good :)b) would anyone like a holiday card sent to them? i can't promise they will necessarily arrive before christmas, or that any prompt-fic will be more than a three sentence fic, because i decided to start an mba this month and work has been killing me. but i like writing post. (i also like receiving post, and my current address is here, or let me know if you would like it!) if you would like a card sent to you please let me know:- your address and a name which will ensure it reaches you. if you would like an e-card, also fine!- if you have any particular preferences card-wise (not holiday, not winter etc)- if you would like a very mini ficlet, then a fandom and character or pairing and prompt wordwriting this post is the most christmassy i've felt yet this year ♥this entry was originally posted at dreamwidth: http://blackeyedgirl.dreamwidth.org/174323.html |  comments. please comment there using openid or signed anon.

black_eyedgirlanybody around who fancies doing a quick readthrough of my troublesfest fic? which, yes, is already finished and posted because it was due thursday, but it's not revealed until tomorrow and no one but me has actually read it.haven fic, s3 spoilers, can't say much more publicly because it's an anonymous exchange! canon knowledge not massively necessary so much as someone who doesn't mind doing some typo spotting.though if anyone would like to volunteer to beta the fic of doom, also haven with s3 spoilers, all offers welcome. i really need to finish it tomorrow or monday, or it's not going to be worth posting at all given that it will be jossed to oblivion on friday. but there are still fairly large gaps with plot here in them.why have i not been able to write all summer? (yes, i know, because work may literally be the death of me soon, but still. i'm sick of myself right now. i just want to finish something.)this entry was originally posted at dreamwidth: http://blackeyedgirl.dreamwidth.org/173241.html |  comments. please comment there using openid or signed anon.

black_eyedgirla) if you got an email from my hotmail account with a link, don't open it. email has (obviously) been hacked and i imagine it's a bad link.b) i've been silent lately - work problems plus brain spiral. i'm still around occasionally on tumblr. mostly reblogging, sometimes commenting on reblogs, not much content creation. c) raedbard was here. we watched s1 of deep space nine and s2 of haven. saw merrily we roll along (my second time, his first). fun times were had. d) i have moved house. if you previously had my address, my new one is in this post. if you want it and don't have it, let me know.e) i was in edinburgh at the beginning of the month, and it was lovely. i want to live there.f) i am getting no writing done.this entry was originally posted at dreamwidth: http://blackeyedgirl.dreamwidth.org/172840.html |  comments. please comment there using openid or signed anon.
