the perfect example by shaykh muhammad saleem dhorat






the perfect example

by shaykh muhammad saleem dhorat hafizahullah



many muslims, nowadays appear to share the misconception that material progress and prosperity rather than moral grit are the most expedient means to success. this concept has become so popular today that it is accepted even by the people who are otherwise pious or stand for religious revival.

this way of thinking is, nevertheless, discredited by the lives, noble characters and achievements of the prophets alayhimus salaam. the character and conduct of the prophets of allah alayhimus salaam make it quite clear that the secret of their victory  and weapons with which they successfully fought their enemies were faith and obedience to allah subhanahu wa ta'aalaa.

the noble person of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam stands pre-eminent, dignified and exalted amongst all the prophetsalayhimus salaam in all qualities, habits and manners. allah subhanahu wa ta'aalaa has praised in the holy qur’ãn the grandeur of the noble character of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam in the following words:

and thou (standest) on an exalted standard of character. (68:4)

the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam has himself said: ‘i have been sent to bring the good morals to perfection.’from the above it is evident that all the virtues and noble qualities had been granted to him.  ‘allãmah nawawi rahimahullah writes in his book ‘tahzeeb’: ‘allah subhanahu wa ta'aalaa had assembled all the excellencies and virtues of character and habits in the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam.’

to describe all these noble qualities and merits is beyond human capacity, since all those excellencies which can be imagined as attainable are possessed by the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam. however, a hadeeth which comprehends the majority of the noble characters of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam is presented hereunder:

‘allah subhanahu wa ta'aalaa says: “o prophet! we have surely sent you a witness, a bringer of good tidings, a warner and a protector for the ummies. you are my chosen servant and messenger. i have named you the ‘trusting’, (since you trust me in every matter). you are neither rough mannered, nor hardhearted, nor do you uproar in the market place. you never requite evil for evil, but you forgive and overlook. allah will not give you death till he has brought the astray ummah on the right path through you and has given light to blind eyes of the unbelievers; and has opened their deaf ears and closed hearts.”’

in some traditions the following is also mentioned: ‘i will refine you with all that is noble; and endow you with every noble habit; and will make tranquillity your attire and trait; and piety your conscience; and wisdom the substance of your thought and knowledge; and truthfulness and sincerity your nature; and forgiveness and good works your custom; and justice your practice, truth your rule, righteousness your guide.’

these were the very characteristics which prompted even the non-muslim leaders at the time of rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam to testify to his prophethood. one such incident is related in saheehul bukhãri:

aboo sufyãn ibn harb radiyallahu anhu relates that heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he (aboo sufyãn radiyallahu anhu) had been accompanying a caravan from the quraysh. they were merchants doing business in shãm (syria, palestine, lebanon and jordan), at the time when allah’s messenger sallallahu alayhi wasallam had truce with aboo sufyãn and quraysh infidels. so aboo sufyãn radiyallahu anhu and his companions went to heraclius at ilyã (jerusalem). heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior roman dignitaries around him. he called for his translator who, translating heraclius’ question said to them, ‘who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a prophet?’ aboo sufyãn  replied, ‘i am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).’

heraclius said, ‘bring him (aboo sufyãn) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.’  aboo sufyãn radiyallahu anhu added, ‘heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man (the prophetsallallahu alayhi wasallam) and that if i told a lie they (my companions) should contradict me.’ aboo sufyãn radiyallahu anhu added, ‘by allah! had i not been afraid of my companions labelling me a liar, i would not have spoken the truth about the prophetsallallahu alayhi wasallam.’  the first question he asked me about him was:

‘what was his family status amongst you?’ i replied, ‘he belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.’

heraclius further asked, ‘has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a prophet) before him?’ i replied, ‘no.’

he said, ‘was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?’ i replied, ‘no.’

heraclius asked, ‘do the nobles or the poor follow him?’ i replied, ‘it is the poor who follow him.’

he said, ‘are his followers increasing or decreasing (day by day)?’ i replied, ‘they are increasing.’

he then asked, ‘does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?’ i replied, ‘no.’heraclius said, ‘have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim (to be a prophet)?’  i replied, ‘no.’

heraclius said, ‘does he break his promises?’ i replied, ‘no. we are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it.’ i could not find an opportunity to say anything against him except that.heraclius asked, ‘have you ever had a war with him.’ i replied, ‘yes.’ then he said, ‘what was the outcome of the battles?’ i replied, ‘sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.’

heraclius said, ‘what does he order you to do?’ i said, ‘he tells us to worship allah and allah alone and not to worship anything along with him, and to renounce all that our ancestors had said. he orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep good relations with our kith and kin.’

heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following. ‘i asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. in fact all the messengers come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. i questioned you whether anyone else amongst you has claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the negative. if the answer had been in the affirmative, i would have thought that this man was following the previous man’s statement.

then i asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, i would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. i further asked whether this man was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. so i wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about allah. i, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. you replied that it was the poor who followed him. and in fact all the apostles have been followed by this very class of people. then i asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. you replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. i further asked you whether there was anybody, who after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. i asked whether he had ever betrayed. you replied in the negative and likewise the apostles never betray.

then i asked you what he ordered you to do. you replied that he ordered you to worship allah and allah alone and not to worship idols along with him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. if what you said is true, he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and i knew it (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but i did not know that he would be from you, and if i could reach him definitely, i would go immediately to meet him and if i were with him, i would certainly wash his feet.’

the noble and graceful character of rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam is in total conformity to all the natural needs of man. his perfect human nature, sublimity of character, long suffering and forgiveness, magnanimity and grace, valour, benevolence, trust in allah subhanahu wa ta'aalaa, modesty, honesty, humility, purity of heart, self denial and forbearance, devotion and piety, fear of allah subhanahu wa ta'aalaa, mercy, compassion and generosity in all he is a perfect and beautiful example and a complete code of life for all.

for rulers and heads of states, the life of the chief and king of the arabs holds a perfect example. for the poverty stricken, the life of the one in whose house the fire was not lit for two months holds an example. for the warriors and conquerors, the life of the warrior of badr and the conqueror of makkah holds a beautiful example, who forgave even his bitterest enemies. for those who have turned their backs on this world, the life of the lone worshipper in the solitude of the cave of hira is an example. for the labourers the one who laboured strenuously in the digging of the trench before the battle of khandaq is an example. the orphans can find solace if they look at the orphan of ãminah. the businessmen may inculcate honesty and piety within them, by looking at the life of the one who handled business in syria. for the imãm and judges, the great imãm and judge of masjidun nabawi, who pronounced justice, without distinguishing between strong and weak is a worthwhile lesson.

in a nutshell, there remains no facet of the life which has not been covered by the noble life of rasoolullah sallallahu alayhi wasallam and in which there is not a beautiful example to follow.

verily in the messenger of allah you have a good example for him who looks unto allah and the last day, and remember allah abundantly. (33:21)

we must all study this great life which is a beacon light for every human, and imitate this greatest personality in every mode of our lives. may allah subhanahu wa ta'aalaa enlighten our hearts with the love of  his rasool sallallahu alayhi wasallam. ãmeen.

before hajj - advices by shaykh muhammad saleem dhorat





before hajj - introductory advicesby shaykh muhammad saleem dhorat hafizahullah hajj is an invitation from the lord of all the worlds to visit his sacred house and an opportunity for us to correct the shortcomings and faults we find in our lives. all intending pilgrims should be focused on the great journey that awaits them and prepare for it as best as possible. in addition to the essential task of learning the injunctions of hajj, there are a number of other points that should be given special attention by all those who are about to become the guests of allāh ta‘ālā.1. sincerity intending pilgrims should examine their intentions and ask themselves why they are going for hajj. rasūlullāh sallallāhu ‘alayhi wasallam said:‘actions are only according to intentions.’ (bukhāri, muslim)if one’s intention is correct and sincere, the deed is accepted, but if it is incorrect then the deed does not receive acceptance. regarding the intentions for hajj, rasūlullāh sallallāhu ‘alayhi wasallam predicted:‘near to qiyāmah, the affluent of my ummah will perform hajj merely for leisure whilst the middle-class of my ummah will perform hajj for the sake of trade, the scholars will perform hajj for show (and ostentation) and the poor will perform hajj in order to beg.’ (kanzul ‘ummāl)we need to examine our intentions. we should not be going just to appease relatives and friends who keep ‘pestering’ us to go or because we desire the title of hājī. our sole intention should be to please allāh ta‘ālā who created us and who granted us the health, wealth and opportunity to visit makkah mukarramah and to fulfil his command. moreover, we have to endeavour to maintain this sincerity all the time whilst performing the rites of hajj and after we return, until our last breath.2. tawbahas we are to acquire a unique proximity to allāh ta‘ālā and be his guests of honour, it is inappropriate to go as offenders, guilty of disobedience. therefore the next task for us is to make tawbah (repent) from all sins, major and minor. perform two raka‘āt nafl salāh with the intention of repentance and make sincere tawbah from all past sins. regardless of whether sins relate to the rights of allāh ta‘ālā or the rights of his creation, or whether they relate to the realm of akhlāq (moral conduct), ‘ibādāt (worship), mu‘āmalāt (transactions) or mu‘āsharah (social interaction), tawbah is necessary in each case.there are certain preconditions for tawbah: for those sins which only violate the rights of allāh ta‘ālā, such as drinking alcohol, fornication, gambling, failure to perform salāh or give zakāh etc., there are three conditions. the first condition is immediate abstention from such sins. secondly, there must be regret in the heart for having committed these sins; a feeling of remorse about disobeying allāh ta‘ālā who brought us into existence when we were nothing. thirdly, there must be a firm intention never to engage in those sins again in the future.if a sin also involves violation of the rights of allāh’s ta‘ālā creation, e.g. defrauding someone, slander or backbiting, then in all such cases a fourth condition will also have to be met. it will be necessary to make amends to the person whose rights were violated, e.g. if someone’s wealth was misappropriated, it will have to be returned or forgiveness sought. if the violation was such that it cannot be compensated for materially, forgiveness must be sought from the victim and his displeasure must be abated.when a servant fulfils all these conditions, then, as appears in a hadīth:‘a person who repents from sin is like one who has no sin.’ (ibn mājah, tabrāni)true tawbah results in a commitment to perform the five daily salāh and to complete any qadhā salāh, to discharge zakāh on time and to settle any past zakāh and to fulfil the obligation of qurbānī and to pay sadaqah for previously missed qurbānīs. if we have oppressed or wronged someone, we must seek their forgiveness; if we have defrauded or usurped somebody’s wealth, we must return it; if we are on bad terms with somebody, we must reconcile our differences.the reason behind meeting people before departing for hajj is just this; that we ask for forgiveness and reconcile any disputes that may exist between us. superficially saying, ‘forgive me,’ is not enough to secure forgiveness, we have to genuinely make an attempt to please the person whom we have wronged. nowadays, we go to meet and seek forgiveness from those whom we are on good terms with and where there is no real need to seek forgiveness, yet we do not go to see and make peace with those with whom we have some quarrel.3. trust in allāh ta‘ālāa further point worth addressing is the anxiety felt by those intending to go for hajj. there are two reasons for this: firstly, the quite natural apprehension of travelling to a foreign country, and secondly, the negative comments made by those who have been to hajj before. it should be understood that throughout the whole journey of hajj, inshā’allāh you will witness 99% comfort and a mere 1% of difficulty. shaytān however, in order to ruin our ibādah, makes us look only towards the 1% so that upon our return, we complain about the difficulties encountered in the sacred places and spoil our hajj. the consequence of such disrespectful talk is that other servants of allāh ta‘ālā become discouraged from performing hajj.the reality is that every journey has its hardships, even travelling to the airport involves discomfort and inconvenience. rasūlullāh sallallāhu ‘alayhi wasallam commented:‘travel is a portion of suffering.’ (bukhāri, muslim)the journey of hajj is long, with approximately two to three million people from all over the world congregating at one specific place. often they all flock to one place at one time to perform the very same ibādah! organising for such an event is beyond the capacity of any organisation/government, it is only possible through the power of allāh ta‘ālā. in such circumstances, the minute amount of inconvenience we may encounter is totally insignificant; the sheer bliss of just casting a single gaze at the house of allāh ta‘ālā outweighs all the difficulties.therefore pilgrims returning from hajj are requested to only relate the positive and complimentary tales of their journey and to forget any negative experiences. relating negative experiences is a shaytānic ploy designed to ruin the reward of our hajj. and if, due to our stories of hardship, someone decides against going for hajj, we may be held responsible.so those going for hajj, and in particular those going for the first time, should pay no attention to the tales of others. the journey of hajj is a comfortable one, free of any threat, where everything is available. of course, being a journey, it has some inconveniences, as do all journeys, but we should place our trust in allāh ta‘ālā and remove all anxieties from our minds.my late respected father, hāfidh ibrāhīm dhorat rahimahullāh, used to say a wonderful thing to those intending to go for hajj. he would say, ‘when we go to visit somebody and become their guest, we do not need to worry about our sleeping arrangements or meals etc. our host takes full responsibility for us and repeatedly asks us our preferences and if we need anything, we simply request it from our host. now when this is our state of affairs when our host is a human, is it conceivable that when we go as guests of allāh ta‘ālā, the creator, he will not fulfil our needs?’so we need to realize that during hajj we are the guests of allāh ta‘ālā. and if we do experience any inconvenience, we should think that allāh ta‘ālā is making us go through some minor problems in order to wipe out the mountains of sins we have committed in the past and to save us from the eternal troubles of the hereafter.4. selection of travelling companionswhen selecting travelling companions, care should be taken to choose pious and righteous people, possibly people who have performed hajj before. if it is possible to travel with a pious scholar, then all the better. the group should not be too large and fellow travellers should be like-minded, able to get on with, assist and serve each other without considering it a burden. experience shows that during hajj, if people of dissimilar temperaments travel together, some disagreement or other always crops up. obviously hajj is a journey in which rancour and bitterness are to be avoided. it has been seen that friendships that develop during hajj remain lifelong as do hostilities. accordingly, our companions should be pious people, who will prompt us when we are neglectful and make us incline towards allāh ta‘ālā, the ākhirah and the successful accomplishment of our goal.5. avoid unnecessary luggageanother point to remember is to avoid taking along unnecessary items. this will make the journey easier, particularly at customs, and whilst travelling to and fro between the airport and hotels. everything is available at our destination and can be purchased when needed. essentials to take along are necessary clothing, toiletries, etc. generally, people take along many superfluous items from home and then end up going through hardship because of them.6. refrain from unfounded customsduring the time leading up to departure, we must refrain from all disobedience to allāh ta‘ālā, including those customs and traditions which displease him. we do many things just because others do, e.g. inviting lots of people for a meal before going for hajj. it should be remembered that whatever act is done merely for show incurs the displeasure of allāh ta‘ālā, not his pleasure.should someone give an invitation out of affection, which is accepted out of affection, then it will be a rewarding deed. if however, one feels compelled to offer an invitation because other relatives have done so, then the act of inviting is just for show and devoid of any reward. furthermore the intending pilgrim, having been invited by so many people, feels obliged to arrange a meal for them too. thus, just before setting off on his blessed journey, the intending pilgrim hires out a hall and invites lots of people to a function resembling a wedding party in its extravagance. there is no need for such formalities and excesses. we should beware lest the burden of sins we already bear prior to going for hajj is added to by such behaviour.7. acquire and study a book on hajjevery intending pilgrim should acquire a book on hajj in the language he is most comfortable with. the book should not be too brief nor should it be overloaded with masā’il and it should be written by an authoritative and experienced ‘ālim. repeated study of this book, preferably under the supervision of a reliable ‘ālim or mufti, will ensure a firm grounding in the method of hajj. and whatever is not clear should be clarified again with a qualified authority.8. study ‘virtues of hajj’the masā’il of hajj can be acquired through the above method, but to give life to the rites of hajj and to endow them with their true spirit,  ‘virtues of hajj’ should be studied carefully. it should also be taken along and read during the journey of hajj.[source: http://www.idauk.org/publications/leaflet65.html ]

islamic wedding by maulana muhammad saleem dhorat





islamic weddingby shaykh muhammad saleem dhorat hafizahullahwedding of fātimah radiyallahu anhafātimah radiyallahu anha is the youngest daughter of our beloved prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam. out of all the children, she was the most beloved to him. he said, ‘the queen of the ladies in jannah is fātimah.’ he also said, ‘fātimah is part of my body. whoever grieves her, grieves me.’when fātimah radiyallahu anha reached the age of fifteen, proposals for her marriage began to come from high and responsible families. but the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam remained irresponsive.‘ali radiyallahu anhu, who was 21 at the time, says:‘it occurred to me that i should go and make a formal proposal, but then i thought, “how could this be accomplished, for i possess nothing.” at last, encouraged by the prophet’s kindness, i went to him and expressed my intention to marry fātimah radiyallahu anha. the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam was extremely pleased and asked, “ali! do you possess anything to give her in mahr?” i replied, “apart from a horse and an armour i possess nothing.”the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said, “a soldier must, of course, have his horse. go and sell away your armour.”’so, ‘ali radiyallahu anhu went and sold his armour to uthmān radiyallahu anhu for 480 dirham and presented it to rasūlullāh sallallahu alayhi wasallam. bilāl radiyallahu anhu was ordered by the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam to bring some perfume and a few other things and anas radiyallahu anhu was sent to call abū bakr, uthmān, talhah and zubayr with some companions from the ansār radiyallahu anhum.when these men arrived and had taken their seats, the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam recited the khutbah (sermon) of nikāh and gave fātimah radiyallahu anha in marriage to ‘ali radiyallahu anhu. he announced, ‘bear you all witness that i have given my daughter fātimah in marriage to ‘ali for 400 mithqāl of silver and ‘ali has accepted.’ he then raised his head and made du‘ā saying, ‘o allāh, create love and harmony between these two. bless them and bestow upon them good children.’ after the nikāh, dates were distributed.when the time came for fātimah radiyallahu anha to go to ‘ali’s radiyallahu anhu house, she was sent without any clamour, hue and cry accompanied by umm ayman radiyallahu anha. after the ‘ishā salāh, the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam went to their house, took permission and entered. he asked for a basin of water, put his blessed hands into it and sprinkled it on both ‘ali and fātimah y and made du‘ā for them.the sovereign of both worlds gave his beloved daughter a silver bracelet, two yemeni sheets, four mattresses, one blanket, one pillow, one cup, one hand-grinding mill, one bedstead, a small water skin and a leather pitcher.in this simple fashion, the wedding of the daughter of the leader of both the worlds was solemnized. in following this sunnah method, a wedding becomes very simple and easy to fulfill. some points derived from the above mentioned marriage1. the many customs as regards engagement are contrary to sunnah. in fact, many are against the shari‘ah and are regarded sins. a verbal proposal and answer is sufficient.2. to unnecessarily delay nikāh of both the boy and the girl after having reached the age of marriage is incorrect.3. there is nothing wrong in inviting one’s close associates for the occasion of nikāh. however, no special pains should be taken in gathering the people from far off places.4. it is appropriate that the bridegroom be a few years older than the bride.5. if the father of the girl is an ‘ālim or pious and capable of performing nikāh, then he should himself solemnize the marriage.6. it is better to give the mahr fātimi and one should endeavour to do so. but if one does not have the means then there is nothing wrong in giving less.7. it is totally un-islāmic for those, who do not possess the means, to incur debts in order to have grandiose weddings.8. it is fallacy to think that one’s respect will be lost if one does not hold an extravagant wedding and invite many people. what is our respect compared to that of rasūlullāh sallallahu alayhi wasallam?9. the present day practice of the intermingling of sexes is an act of sin and totally against shari‘ah.10. there is nothing such as engagement parties and mendhi parties in islām.11. great care must be taken as regards to salāh on occasions of marriage by all - the bride, the bridegroom and all the participants.12. it is un-islamic to display the bride on stage.13. the unnecessary expenses incurred by the bride’s family in holding a feast has no basis in shari‘ah.14. for the engaged couple to meet at a public gathering where the boy holds the girl’s hand and slips a ring on her finger is a violation of the qur’ānic law of hijāb.15. it is un-islamic for the engaged couple to meet each other and also go out together.16. three things should be borne in mind when giving one’s daughter gifts and presents at the time of nikāh:i) presents should be given within one’s means (it is not permissible to take loans, on interest, for such presents);ii) to give necessary items;iii) a show should not be made of whatever is given.17. it is sunnah for the bridegroom’s family to make walimah.note: in walimah, whatever is easily available should be fed to the people and care should be taken that there is no extravagance, show and that no debts are incurred in the process.18. to delay nikāh after the engagement is un-islamic. some customs in following modern day trends, we have adopted many cutoms that are unislamic and contrary to the sunnah. some examples are:i    displaying the bride on stage;ii   inviting guests for the wedding from far-off places;iii  receiving guests in the hall;iv  the bride’s people incurring unnecessary expenses by holding a feast which has no basis in shari‘ah. we should remember that walimah is the feast arranged by the bridegroom after the marriage is consummated;v    it is contrary to sunnah (and the practice of some non-muslim tribes in india) to wish, hope for or demand presents and gifts for the bridegroom, from the bride’s people. we should always remember that our rasūl sallallahu alayhi wasallam did not give ‘ali radiyallahu anhu anything except du‘ā.[source: http://idauk.org/publications/leaflet10.html]

barclays decision to close uwt account. the ummah welfare trust (uwt) is dismayed by receiving a 30 day notice from barclays to close their bank account. the trust has been banking with barclays since its inception in 2001 in order to carry out relief operations in over twenty countries across africa, asia, europe and the middle east providing support to over a million people.barclays bank has given no apparent reason to why the notice has been served. uwt director of operations mohammed ahmed said in a statement, “we are deeply concerned with barclays bank’s decision to close our accounts without any justification. this decision will not only affect the great work carried out by uwt but will affect millions of people who rely on uwt. this decision sets a dangerous precedent of disrupting british charities without any substance, especially as interpal is in the process of having its bank accounts closed by lloyds tsb. targeting charities in this way shows there is a conceited attempt to stop the good work in politically-sensitive regions by leading british muslim charities.uwt is calling on all supporters and friends to urge barclays bank to review its decision so uwt can continue its humanitarian projects across the world without any disruption. uwt would like to reassure its supporters this is a decision of a bank and does not reflect the view of the charity commission.ummah welfare trust is a uk registered international relief and development charity operating in over 25 countries. for further details, visit http://www.uwt.org/ or contact: uwt head office, 351 derby st. bolton, greater manchester, bl3 6lr. t: 01204 383 732. e: info@uwt.org for all media enquires, please contact the media officer on 01204 383 732.help uwt now! contact barclays and ask for a reason of account closure and inform them that you and your associates will be closing your accounts if the decision is not immediately reversed.your support is vital for the cause of humanity.you can contact barclays bank in the following ways:call barclays now on 0800 282 390 / 0207 116 7488email barclays business manager mr. columb o'shea: columb.oshea@barclays.com and mr. john varley: john.varley@barclays.comwrite to:john varley group chief executive barclays bank 1 churchill place london e14 5hpdownload a draft letter to barclays (right click on download link and choose 'save target as' to save to your computer.)
