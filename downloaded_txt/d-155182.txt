i am a literary crusher.
i was a fellow in wisconsin.
dirty dancing, salon link.  you'll have to watch a little ad to read the whole article, which is worth it, considering i'm quoted in it.  or click on this no ad version.
here i pop in at mcsweeney's to dispense more wisdom.
i share design advice as well.
i wrote some strange books for kids about capitalism, 
coping with death, 
se hinton, 
and william mckinley's assassination 
i used to drive an ambulance.
i am not a jumper, 
running back, 
account executive, 
convenience store entrepeneur, 
hazee, 
murderer (see bottom of column),  
or a real estate agent.
did i miss anything?
(googling yourself is fun, but amazoning yourself is even better.)
