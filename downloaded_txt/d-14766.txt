welcome to tds saddlers
traditional saddlers and saddle fitters
saddle fitting in hampshire, wiltshire, surrey, berkshire and sussex
tds saddlers is a family business founded by george day over 80 years ago, established as a traditional saddler and harness maker, the company is still a family concern.
we hold an extensive stock of new saddles from some of the world’s top brands including albion, ideal, fairfax, kent & masters, prestige and arena.
our principal saddle fitter, tom day, has over 40 years trade and craft experience and specialises in competition saddles for jumping and dressage. tom also has extensive experience of remedial fitting such as slipping, poor balance or when the horse is showing discomfort due to poor saddle fit.
tom will travel to any location within a 30 mile radius of our store, including hampshire, berkshire, surrey, sussex, and wiltshire that fall within that radius.
see our saddle fitting appointment and call out charges including how to take a wither pattern, factors that affect the fit of a saddle, indications of a badly fitted saddle, how to recognise a well fitted saddle and the best ways to store and look after your saddle, plus further information in our saddle fitting guide.
tds saddlers is a member of the society of master saddlers and tom day holds their professional saddle fitting qualification. all our saddlers and saddle fitters are qualified and experienced in ensuring your chosen saddle is correctly fitted and fit for purpose.
