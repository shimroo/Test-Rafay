peace i leave you, my peace i give you: peace that the world cannot take away. do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not be afraid. (john 14:27)these words of jesus provide the focus and motivation for this web site. its purpose is to provide a variety of resources that encourage and support christian spiritual practice. as such, it is an online spirituality center -- a place where you can find retreats, workshops, books, handouts, worksheets, and a community of kindred spirits who are seeking to grow in christ.i have been able to develop these resources because of the support provided by heartland center for spirituality, in great bend, ks. kudos to the dominican sisters of peace for recognizing the role of the internet in furthering the "holy preaching" they so value and emphasize.philip st. romain, m.s., d. min.
