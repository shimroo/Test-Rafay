				*the nadi - tropical cyclone centre was officially designated by wmo in june 1995 as a regional specialised meteorological centre (rsmc) with activity specialization in tropical 
				cyclones tasked to provide "first-level" information in tropical cyclones (ie, basic information covering the tropical cyclones' present and forecast position, movement and intensity) 
				in the south-west pacific ocean. 
				the public and the international media are requested to note that the rsmc-nadi-tropical cyclone centre is the official source of reliable "first-level" information on tropical cyclones 
				occurring in the south-west pacific ocean
