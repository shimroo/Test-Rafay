the railroad is ran by local hobbyists and runs a few times a year from nashville to watertown, as well as nashville to monterray. too bad we don't have amtrak.

my girlfriends, mothers, next door neighbor has a 6 toed cat named "digit" and he is quite friendly. if i had a fence around my yard i would get a cat like this, but you just can't fence in a cat.edit: just to be clear, this is not the cat i was referring to in the above post... this video is just some random shit on youtube. but still... 6 toed cat.labels: 6 toes, ammonia, cats, hemmingway

i just watched an amazing documentary about don rickles. view it for yourself by clicking the picture above.this documentary was fantastic and bittersweet to watch. it's a couple of years old but a great find if you are a fan of old school comedy.

life in america isn't going to go to hell under obama and a democratic congress, as the conservatives types are fearful of. welfare queens aren't going to be any more of a problem than they are already. national security isn't going to suddenly go into the toilet. the economic roller coaster wont stop. the militant homosexuals are going to continue being just as crazy as they have been. it's going to be life as usual for republicans. democratic rank-and-file, too, are going to experience a letdown. the foreign police actions, the health care debate, the environmental issues… none of those problems are going to be addressed in a timely manner.there will be no significant change under obama, only the same frustrations. so finally, stop reading conspiratorial blogs and turn off the damned pundit shows. read a real newspaper or some other legitimate news sources to influence your takes on current events. i didn't vote for mr. obama but he is my president(elect), because i am an american and he is the american president(elect). i will be the devils advocate in the face of open hostility toward my president because when i enlisted to serve my country, i took an oath "to uphold and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic." i think that gives me a little bit of clout. (a little combat veteran status never hurts)ironically, i didn't vote for bush either but i felt compelled to stick up for him when the rhetoric got so ridiculous that it needed to be challenged by pure nature of the seriousness of the charge overshadowing the facts of the evidence. if he was so damn bad then he should have been impeached. impeachment was never brought up because, evidently, there were not enough malcontents to make a charge stick and god knows there are enough lawyers in dc to sift through the bullshit. was all the hand wringing really worth it? having turned 40 this year and going through my only brother and my father dying last year the activities of the sitting president really doesn't affect the quality of my life in the slightest. debating is fun but that's about where it stops.i hope, as an ex-johnson citian that some of you will come back and renew the dialogue. i pissed most of you off (i hope), i chased some of you off (i really, really hope), but i was only having fun and there was no malice.
