“wow, this is just incredible. we walked into the exhibit area and our jaws dropped… gives you a good feel for the value of the ore mined here to warrant an investment of this magnitude.”

“exceeded my expectations. reading the history of the gliders and the stats associated with the combat missions they were used on were awe inspiring and humbling... this is a must see if you are in the area. we had kids ranging from 10-17 and they were fascinated with what they learned.”

— trip advisor review of the wwii glider & military museum
