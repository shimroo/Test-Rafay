				personal injury faq
			





can i afford a personal injury lawyer?



most personal injury attorneys accept cases on a contingency basis, which means any attorney fees will come out of a percentage of your verdict or settlement. at christiansen trial lawyers, your first consultation is completely free, and we only collect a fee if we successfully recover compensation for you. there are no out-of-pocket costs to discuss your rights and options with a member of our team.



how much is my injury case worth?



every case is unique, and no attorney can guarantee a certain result. the damages available for your injury will depend on the severity of the injury and its lasting effects, the cost of medical treatment, and the injury’s effect on your life going forward. the best way to get an idea of what compensation may be available is to discuss your specific case with an attorney who has handled similar injury claims.



i don’t want to sue anyone. what are my options?



we understand that most people dislike the thought of bringing a lawsuit against another person or entity. many personal injury claims never reach the point of becoming an actual lawsuit. in most cases, compensation is recovered through a claim with the insurance company. your attorney and insurance adjuster can negotiate a fair settlement to cover your medical bills, lost wages and other expenses. in some cases, the insurance company will not provide an acceptable settlement offer. if this happens, it may be necessary to pursue the matter in court. however, you are in control of your case and your attorney will take time to explain all your options for moving forward.



what type of injury compensation is available?



people affected by a serious injury experience a variety of losses, including physical, financial and emotional damages. an important step in maximizing the compensation that is available is to identify all potential sources of damages, which may include:medical expenses, including rehabilitation, medication, and ongoing carepain and sufferingemotional distress“loss of use,” which provides compensation for activities an injured person is no longer to doloss of consortium, which allows an injured person’s spouse to bring a claim for the loss of companionship, physical affection, or the ability to bear childrenlost wages and future earning capacity



how much time do i have to file a claim?



in nevada, those who have been injured because of someone else’s negligence have two years from the date of the injury to bring a legal claim. however, that does not mean that waiting two years is best for your claim. it is generally best to seek medical attention and speak with a knowledgeable personal injury attorney as soon as possible after your injury. this creates a record of your injury and medical care and allows your legal team to conduct a thorough investigation of the injury and collect as much important evidence as possible.

				criminal defense faq
			





do i need a lawyer even if the prosecutor offers a standard plea deal?



there is no law that requires you to work with a criminal defense attorney, but it is important to remember that the prosecutor’s job is to secure “guilty” verdicts and plea deals that are favorable for the state. signing a plea deal without the advice of your own lawyer puts you at a distinct disadvantage. consider speaking with a criminal defense attorney before agreeing to a plea.



can i clear an arrest or conviction from my record?



in nevada, the court may order criminal records be “sealed” if the court is satisfied that the defendant has been rehabilitated and other conditions are met. when records are sealed, they are physically removed from the records system, their dissemination is restricted, and only certain state employees may access the information. this prevents criminal record information from appearing in background checks and makes it much easier for people with a criminal history to secure employment, housing, and other essential services.sealing a criminal record is a complex process that can take many months. to avoid mistakes that could compromise your privacy and ability to move on from a conviction, consider discussing your questions with an attorney experienced in record sealing and similar criminal law matters.



the officer did not read me my rights. can i still be charged?



it is a common misconception that an arrest or criminal charge can be “thrown out” if the arresting officer made a procedural mistake, such as failing to read the defendant’s miranda rights. it is rare for a case to get thrown out for this reason. if the officer failed to follow proper procedures, the prosecutor may be unable to use certain evidence at trial. it is important to identify any lapses in procedure or mistakes by the opposition because these mistakes may help your attorney negotiate a more favorable result.



how long does it take to resolve a criminal charge?



this depends on many factors, including any criminal history, the severity of the charges, and the strength of the prosecution’s case. in some proceedings, a plea agreement can be reached quickly. in other cases, particularly those that go to trial, it may take longer. your attorney can help you develop a clearer idea of what to expect from your case.



what happens after an arrest?



in most cases, the arrested person is brought to a police station where they are “booked.” the police will gather information to determine whether the person has any warrants or criminal history that may affect how the case moves forward. the police will determine whether the person can be released from custody and whether any bail or bond is required. officers may also seize property or records as evidence.aside from providing basic information about one’s identity, people who have been arrested are not legally required to speak to police. deciding whether to speak to the police can have a significant impact on a case and should be discussed with one’s attorney.

representing clients facing a variety of chargesour firm is equipped to handle a wide spectrum of criminal defense cases. founding partner, peter s. christiansen, has participated in over 100 jury trials and his father, peter james christiansen, has over 30 years of experience as a public defender.additionally, we have a legal team with the knowledge that spans multiple practice areas. with such a variety of experiences, we are able to approach every criminal defense case with a creative and informed strategy.we represent clients facing a variety of charges. from dui/dwi offenses to federal crimes including murder, firearms charges, and drug distribution, christiansen trial lawyers begins with a personalized consultation and can see your case through the end. along the way, we can do everything within our power to provide the best possible outcome for you.furthermore, with our knowledge comes the various ways we know how to protect your rights. many defendants facing criminal charges—especially if it is their first offense—may not realize all the ways in which nevada and federal laws protect them. our attorneys can ensure you understand how the proceedings affect you and your liberties.recently, nevada implemented the restoration of voting rights for convicted felons. upon their release from prison, they may register to vote should they meet certain criteria.however, conviction for a felony still limits you from other freedoms like the right to bear arms. also note that even misdemeanors, depending on the gravity of the charge, may lead to limited freedoms and possibly even compromise your ability to find work in the future.knowing what to expect out of your criminal case can make a big difference in how you and your attorney prepare. at the end of the day, there simply is no substitute for courtroom experience. we approach each case with the understanding of what a judge or jury may look for, as well as how the prosecution may strategize.



helping clients after serious injuryour team has a diverse background in personal injury law. we understand the true gravity of a serious injury and the many ways it can affect your life. from missing time at work to an inability to participate in everyday actives you once enjoyed, injury losses are about more than just medical expenses.with more than 50 years of combined experience, we are adept at seeking compensation that covers every loss relevant to your injury. that includes pain and suffering damages and lost wages.cases we take often include:distracted driving and other motor vehicle accidentsdefective or dangerous productsproperty-related injuriescatastrophic injuriespedestrian accidentsanimal attacksbirth injuriestourism-related injuriesas it relates to a lawsuit, the state of nevada follows negligence laws based on fault. that is, if you are more at fault than the party you are attempting to sue for damages, you may not recover compensation. if that is not the case, then you would recover damages proportionate to the percentage of fault you bear for the accident.there are, of course, layers of detail and evidence that can affect the final recovery award and general case outcome. we will examine the circumstances surrounding your injury, see what the opposing parties claim, and address all relevant issues.our pursuit on behalf of our injured clients has led clients to millions of dollars in damage recovery, both in and out of court. some successful cases include compensation for a spine injury after a taxicab accident and a jury award for $8.935 million after a client sustained an injury on a construction job.
