 in 1993 chopin created the world’s first super premium vodka, and the luxury vodka category was born.we’ve remained at the industry’s forefront ever since, driven by a guiding purpose: to show the world that well-made, ingredient-forward vodka is worthy of being sipped and savored in the same way as whiskey or wine.as poland’s last family owned vodka maker, we proudly produce small-batch, hand-crafted vodka from our own distillery in the pristine countryside of eastern poland.we know the best vodka is never ‘odorless’ or ‘tasteless,’ so we invite you to try our collection of single-ingredient vodkas and discover for yourself just how nuanced, complex and flavorful vodka can truly be.

				people misunderstand vodka. they think alcohol is about drinking. no, it’s about passion. it’s about enhancing what we eat. it’s about pairing food and culture and climate with a little bit of poland’s national drink – vodka.
