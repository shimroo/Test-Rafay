arlo guthrie once said, (and i will paraphrase) “you know, if one person, just one person buys a travco, they may think he’s really sick and they won’t take him. and if two people buy a travco–in harmony–they may think they’re both mentally deficient and they won’t take either of them. and if three people do it! can you imagine three people walkin’ in, buy’n a travco and walkin’out? they might think it’s an organization! and can you imagine fifty people a day? i said fifty people a day–walkin’ in buy’n a travco and walkin’ out? friends, they may think it’s a movement, and that’s what it is:
the travco anti-establishment movement!
