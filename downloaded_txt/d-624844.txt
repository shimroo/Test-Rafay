!!by general consensus, religion is no longer the opiate of the masses





as of march 22, 2006, 4:53 am, i tried to knock some sense to idiots and dimwits. i ventured to the insanity of hell and beyond by visiting forums. i went to a filipino web forum called pinoyexchange (http://www.pinoyexchange.com). 

then, i tried to go to its religion forums where i can kick ass for the lord by knocking some sense to idiots. but for some strange reasons, i cannot find a dedicated thread for religion. then, it dawned to me. religion is not anymore important to filipinos. 

i investigated the whole site and found out that there is a total of 13,645,007 messages posted in the whole pinoyexchange forums, which are broken down to:

local movies and tv = 7,956,562 posts 
international movies and tv = 270,636 posts
anime and manga = 64,527 posts

total = 8,291,725 posts

holy fuck! that's 60.77% of the whole forum. karl marx is very, very wrong. tv is now the opiate of the masses.

they changed the colgate commercial, but it is still stupid





you probably know by now that i hate the colgate commercial where they show jay-r's armpits more than his teeth. because it was pretty stupid to show armpits in a tootpaste commercial.

anyway, shortly after i posted my message to colgate about thier idiotic commercial, they changed thier commercial. however, it was for the worse. it was completely asinine. i wished that they kept the armpit commercial they have than the new one. 

in the new commercial, a loser but i'll call him 'dorkface' for convenience for future reference in this article, admires a girl interacting with her friends. but if you can see, the 'dorkface' is really stripping the girl

it sucks to be the president of the philippines





if you have been paying attention to current events these days, you may empathize with the current president of the philippines. she battles stupidity all day long. here is a list of the stupid things she has to battle everyday.

* people who call for her resignation for... well, being the president of the philippines.

* people don't know what they are rallying about.

* idiots who blame the president for their misfortune.

* fresh graduates that really doesn't have any skills and talents appropriate for work that couldn't find a job blame the president for not doing anything in order to give them jobs. (fuckers!)

* senators who think they're in saturday night live show. maybe that's why they are so goddamn funny!

* people who call for her help for things that don't call for national concern (ie. a police gunned down a child. the victim calls for the president's help. he should have asked for the mayor's help first. what an idiot.)   

* people asking for her to comment on things that are not even a national issue (remember the issue about the skank kris aquino and the idiot joey marquez? the fucking channel gma-7 tried to press her for a comment. big fucking idiots. it's an asinine showbiz issue dolts!)

* satirists call for her resignation because, well, she makes them extinct.

* fucking assholes who rally against american imperialism but they have shallow patriotism. (an issue which i will discuss in the future.)

* dolts that are calling for an honest government but they are not even honest themselves.

* priests and nuns who want to jump in the bandwagon and call for her resignation (hey dickheads! didn't jesus told you that give ceasar what belongs to ceasar and give god what belongs to god? don't know what the fuck that sentence means? it means don't ever fucking meddle with state affairs dipshit!)

* makati business club calling for resignation because they say she is not honest and cannot run a government ethically (compared to these fucking companies that evade tax, don't use legal software, hire children, bribe government officials, make employment contracts so fucking confusing that employees don't even know they are being raped in the ass by these companies and etc., do i need to state more?)

* former president aquino calling for her resignation because of harsh dispersal of 
rallies and protests. hey former president aquino! yeah you asswipe, did you smoke weed or anything? because it is sure some strong stuff it makes you forget all the atrocities your administration have done. apparently, there's an incident during your term as president called 'mendiola massacre' where 13 were killed and hundreds are gravely injured. 

* most of all, miriam santiago! do i need to say more about her?

well, there are many more i am sure that cause the president of the philippines too much migraine but i listed the obvious reasons why it sucks to be the president of the philippines.

!!stupid idiots who wear che guevarra and bob marley t-shirts should be shot





you know, all stupid idiots that wear che guevarra and bob marley t-shirts should be shot and make them do some deep-sea-diving in the pasig river with concrete shoes. 

these idiots are far worse than anime idiot otakus listening to jpop songs that have no idea what the japanese lyrics mean. the anime otakus at least have an excuse not knowing japanese because it can take years to study japanese, but these idiots that wear che guevarra and bob marley t-shirts have no excuse not knowing about these people because they are just a research or a google search away, but no... these idiots are too lazy to look up who are these two people. 

some people try to be a smartass and tell me that che is a revolutionary, against consumerism, and blah, blah, blah, bullshit, bullshit, and more bullshit. that is why they are wearing a shirt with his picture, because they are rebels, revolutionary! dumbass!

i say that idiots needs to get some facts straight. che is a big fucking loser. che made guerilla attempts in argentina, bolivia, the dominican republic, nicaragua, haiti, panama and the african congo, and failed big time. he only got cuba, and that is not even threatening enough.

and oh yeah che guevarra said this: "the socialist countries have the moral duty of liquidating their tacit complicity with the exploiting countries of the west." that's pretty much saying che wanted to kill democracy and freedom you enjoy, dipshits. he's a fucking communist! 

and the same goes to idiots who idolize bob marley. they say that bob marley promotes smoking marijuana. assholes! rastafarian culture treats marijuana as sacred sacrement.

i say that when you try to be a rebel and going against the mainstream, try not to wear shirts with bob marley or che guevarra's picture on it, because, well it isn't even fucking original anymore, you're just one of those 5 million idiots who try to be original with unoriginal t-shirt. great job, dumbass! next time you want to be a rebel, wear a shirt with my face on it. now that's bad-ass.

stupid idiots who wear che guevarra and bob marley t-shirts should take a deep sea dive in the pasig river with concrete shoes. 

and yeah, while i am at it, let's include the dumb fucks who wear t-shirts with mao tse tung's face on it.

!!filipino creativity, rest in peace (1891-2006)





it's official, filipino creativity is dead. well, we know that the filipino movie, tv and film industry is on its deathbed a long ago, but what i discovered a few days ago nailed the final nail on its coffin. you want to know how it died? well, apparently, here in the philippines, a television network gma 7 airs a tv show here called "captain barbell" that killed pretty much every creativity that filipinos have.

i mean, just look at the costume:

i swear that this show really gets worse than this awful costume

let's comment first on the costume as to let you get a feel on what's coming next. 

who ever fucking designed that goddamn awful costume is sure smoking some serious crack there. that goddamn awful costume is too big for that actor. i mean look at his pathetic face. and yeah, i forgot to mention, the armor was designed by the same person that design the "gay armored nipples" amor for the "batman and robin" movie. but wait, it gets worse here.

so let's go with a summary of the story of the "captain barbell"

hero was a still a baby when his homeworld is attacked by vicious enemies from whatever place they came from with no explanation. then as his homeworld is being taken over, his dad sent him to another place in order for him not to be killed along with them. when the hero is transported to another place, the hero was discovered by a couple riding in a red pickup truck. the couple then decides to raise the hero by themselves. as hero grows up, he did some fantastic feats like lifting a tractor, making a fence by pounding wood to the ground. 

the hero one day befriended a rich guy when he rescued him in a car accident. the rich guy is a poor soul because his dad treats him like dog shit. so the hero and the rich guy became friends. and he is in love with a girl who always wear pink. 

sounds family? as in sounds familiar? 

well, if you watch a lot warner brothers' shows, you can say that, or rather shout, it's freaking smallville! yes, i have lost respect to filipino writers, directors, scriptwriters, actors, actresses, musicians, playwrights, entertainers, stand up comedians, artists. can't we have some originality here? fuck the filipino creativity, it is dead long time ago.

!!computer shops that sell defective products should close down





i hate computer shops that sell defective products. these computer shops sell defective products that only work for as long as your warranty last. and when the computer's warranty run out, your computer will break down. it is like these computer shops put a time bomb inside the computer that will go off when the computer's warranty expires.

what is more aggreviating here is that these fucking computer shops won't repair your computer. they will just say "sorry, can't do jack. but we will give you a 10% discount on your next computer purchase for the inconvenience of having a computer break down on you days after your computer's warranty expired." fuckers!

so as you can see, these computer shops are money-grabbing assholes that want to get more money from you by selling defective products with short limited warranty and high prices. 

man! these shops should be closed down and their owners needed to be kicked in the nuts!

!!the most fucking idiot ever: superman!





yeah, we know that one of the most stupid superheroes ever is superman for wearing his red underwear over his blue thights, but you see, superman is the most stupid idiot ever for not conquering the world.

yes, he is stupid for wearing his red underwear over his blue thights and not the other way around.

superman is the most fucking stupid idiotic superhero because he's a visitor from the planet krypton, with powers far beyond men! can jump over tall buildings with a single leap, faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a speeding train, and yet he didn't conquer the world?  any self-respecting visiting alien from other planet will really try to invade and conquer it. superman tries to be nice and pretends to be a idiot, pussy whipped journalist. and yes, superman has four amazing dorky super-pets: a dog, a cat, a horse and a monkey—named krypto, streaky, comet and beppo. now you really have to wonder, superman has already have the power to conquer the world, and he also has a small army of idiotic super-pets to do his bidding, yet, why he didn't conquer the world? man, what a dope. he's not superman, he's superstupid.

!!see, i told you that every self-respecting alien would try to take over the world






comic creators jerry siegel and joe shuster first drew superman as a bald villain in a january 1933 story called "the reign of the super-man," which appeared in an issue of their comic fanzine science fiction. it bombed, so they reimagined him as a superhero.

hahaha. now, the question is, if superman was evil like back then, would he get along with general zod?

okay, i think i'll take back what i said. superman really did conquer the world back then... 





and because of this, this really proves that no self-respecting alien visitor from another planet wouldn't try to conquer the world at least once.

ok. he really had the guts to conquer the world. but he is still stupid for wearing that red briefs over his blue tights.

!!the top 12 list of people who deserve an ass-kicking





12. it department: these people are one of the biggest pricks in the world. they act high and mighty with their outdated knowledge on lowly average executive using the company's computer. but when there is a trouble in a company's computer, they are nowhere to be seen. fucking wimps! even some ordinary worker has more tech knowledge than you do! 

11. techie dorks: these are people who own the latest mobile phones, every video game consoles, fastest computers, biggest whatever gadgets they have. they compete with other techie dorks to see who has the best mobile phone, techie gadgets and whatsoever. watching this is like seeing two dorks that are engaging in a cyber pissing contest. 

10. rallyists: seriously, these people need a hard ass-kicking. these people complain about low wages, high prices, unemployment, political issues and american imperialism. hey idiots! how about stop complaining and start working? oh yeah, great, you're rallying against american imperialism, but you are wearing hanes tee-shirts, lee jeans, nike shoes. great work on defending your country's sovereignity dumb ass, you just contradicted your fucking point, nice work dipshit. and yeah, include the idiots who don't know what they are protesting about.

9. evil bosses: these are scheming weasels that his or her redeeming feature is that he or she is a big fucking idiot and you may get some good enterntainment as they show to the people in the workplace on how stupid they are. they never do anything right. the evil bosses are scheming, lying, manipulative bastards who relish on seeing people being abused. these doofuses had the manners and social skills of a gnat. well, it is their nature after all, they are the devil's advocate. fucking tyrants.

8. the idiot cheering squad team leader boss: this kind of boss is simply the most inept boss you will ever have. he has no skills whatsoever. he only became your boss due to the fact that he and the owner of the business are buddies. because he has no skills whatsoever, he compensate by looking like a morale building guru and try to raise the morale of the ordinary worker joe. he likes to make a lot of useless meetings and make a lot of morale boosting speeches that don't make any sense. and of course, this idiot likes to barge in meetings that discuss about a work project then start giving a idiotic morale boosting speech.

7. your coworkers: seriously. your coworkers are also scheming weasels that kiss your idotic boss' slimy and dirty ass in order to get promoted while backstabbing you.

6. anime otakus: these dimwits deserve all the ass-kicking they get. these idiots tries to be cool by having a lot of knowledge about anime. these people are getting a hard on by just imagining a naked female anime character. these are the stupid idiots who think they are some anime character and they dress up and talk like their favorite anime character. and they are really stupid for singing j-pop songs but they don't understand a single japanese word.

5. politicians: again, although their antics are quite funny, its already tired, dry and stupid toilet humor. these politicians range from the crybaby jamby madrigal, to psychotic miriam santiago to the ultimate drama queen in the u.s. senate ted stevens. fucking idiots.

4. gun owners: these gun owners are nitwits, and insecure one at that. look at the "great white hunter" dick cheney. he shot the only lawyer for bush. what a dick. the reason why they own guns is because they are insecure about the size of their small dicks. once i encountered a mug who aimed a shotgun at my head and i just said "so, big gun, small dick eh?" and the idiot ran away crying "mommy! wahhh!" sheesh.

3. wikipedia contributors: this need to stop, now. there are two types of fucking idiots who contributes to wikipedia, the idiot who, every two minutes, try to change a post with idiotic rants like "jesus sucks" or "bush sucks", and the idiot who, every two minutes, tries to change the idiotic posts like "jesus sucks" or "bush sucks" back to what was originally posted. pathetic losers. they need a life.

2. sports dorks: these kind of people almost top the list of the idiotic people that need to receive an ass-kicking. these kind of people are the kind of people who collect useless data about athletes, like the size of michael jordan's wang, or like when a basketball team defeated the other basketball team in a game of monopoly. these are also the kind of people who play basketball on their video game consoles or on their computer rather than playing sports in real life. these are people who get a hard on just looking at athletes grabbing each other's balls and asses. just look at the examples of the pics these sports dorks will get a hard on with below:

you may say, "dude, these sports dorks are gonna beat your ass!" first things first, don't call me dude, you prick! and contrary to popular belief, sports dorks are scrawny little idiots, they don't even have a single muscle in them. they are not well-built physically. they rather spend their time fawning over sweaty athletes than doing some real sports instead. these sports dorks tries to compensate their scrawny little body by making gay athletes their idols and watching these gay athletes play a game of ass-grabbing. what a maroon. so stay away from these kind of people, they are gay, gay dorks.

so, who tops the list? well without further ado, the most idiotic type of people who needs a royal ass-kicking

1. techie sport dorks: if there is anything worse than sports dorks, it is the techie sports dorks. these are sports dorks who check up the internet every 5 minutes about their favorite gay athletes. these are the kind of geeky sports dorks who own a mobile phone with geeky application in order to check up on sports scores every fucking 5 minutes. these are the kind of dumb fucks who make personal sports blogs about their favorite gay athletes. these are scrawny sports dorks who are only brave when they are online, because they can claim they have the biggest dick in the world and since proof is not available, no one can claim if that statement is true or plain horse shit. 

and because all of you people know that techie people are geeky idiots and sports dorks are well, dorks, techie sports dorks are the lowest life form on earth. they sit on the bottom of the dorky idiots food chain. there was once this techie sports dork who said to my face that: "if sports buffs are dorks and i'm a sports buff, then i'm the coolest dork you'll ever meet." then i said "nice try, dumb ass!" then i kick his shins, which made him grab his shins in pain. because of this vulnerability, i kicked straight to his puny wang! with my kick straight to his groin, this dork was kneeling on the ground and trying not to pass out from the pain. and since i am a kind bad-ass priest, i walked over to his back and give him a swift kick to the ass for a traditional ass-kicking. 

so what is the morale of this story? well it is simple, no matter how cool you are among the sports dork, even if you are the coolest sports dork ever, you are still a dork.

slacking at your work





there’s an easy formula for becoming a slacker: do nothing. go get more coffee. repeat. but how can you slack and still keep your job? it’s all about appearances.

complain that you’re totally swamped at every opportunity. use phrases like “up to my ass in alligators” and “jumping from one fire to another” to make your job sound kind of sexy and dangerous.

carry a piece of paper wherever you go. to give yourself the necessary urgent facial expression and body language, imagine it’s something incredibly important, like a stay of execution from the governor.

never clean your cubicle. after all, if you had any spare cycles you wouldn’t let yourself live like a pig.

emailing looks like work. email friends and family often.

if you feel like talking instead of working, talk to your boss. that counts as work no matter what you’re chatting about. the ideal topic of conversation is how poorly all of your coworkers are performing.

if you wear glasses, leave an old pair on the desk as though you will be right back. then go home.

leave voicemails for coworkers at 1:00 am, even if you’re getting up just to take a whiz. if you really want to inspire awe, leave a message for your boss with your thoughts on the company’s outdated filing system at 11:30 pm on new year’s eve.

be sure to get involved in unquantifiable projects. you want to be doing a lot of consulting and advising and attending. avoid anything with a hard and fast deadline.

learn to sleep with your back to the cubicle entrance. you’ll have to practice to keep your head from slumping over, but it’s worth it. if you can’t pull that off, try a neck brace painted the same color as your skin.

bitch about your job as much as possible. this is considered work even though it’s fun.

job hunting tips





hello loyal servants, this is your bad-ass priest derick here. if you notice, we are now in the middle of the job-hunting season. if you wanna know, the annual job-hunting season starts in june and ends in december. this is the season when people act like neanderthal cavemen who compete with each other to hunt the best job that is high-paying, low-stress and idiotic bosses to make fun of.

however, this is also the season when virgin, naive, doe-eyed fresh graduates from university comes out of their parents basement and look for work, probably because their parents kicked their deadbeat ass out of the house. this is the primary victim of scrupulous companies who will suck blood out of these fresh and naive graduates. most of these evil companies posts classified ads with some-what harmless buzzwords, but there are overall evil intentions lurking in these buzzwords.

and i derick, your bad-ass priest presents you the most common and popular job-ads buzzwords that evil companies uses. try your best to not to apply at them.

"able to work in a fast-paced environment": this means that things don't go along as they were planned in this company. this 
means that the company expect you to do everything at the last minute.

"able to multitask": this means that the company expect you to roleplay without actually costume playing. you play the role of 
secretary, janitor, reception, office clerk, accountant all at the same time. to cut things short, the company
expects you to do a lot of things poorly, than one thing really well.

"detail-oriented": this means the company is anal-retentive. be sure to wear face masks when showing your work to your boss.
because his/her spit will fly when nitpicking your work. make one mistake, you'll get chewed out.

"team player": the company expects you to like everything what they like, even though you hate it with your guts, because that                      is what a team player" is being all about.

"able to work under minimum supervision": this means the management is like david copperfield, they disappear when you need
them. companies that post classified ads with this kind of requirement likes to play hooky, hoping that workers 
will pick up the slack and mess while they are away playing golf.

"self-motivated": this needs no explanation, really. the management expects you to work extra hard, motivated by something
else other than the tiny salary.

okay, with that out of the way, here are my tips in order for you to find a job, you deadbeat asshole.

* your resume should not be a "one-size-fits-all" resume.

* you should not post your online resume on jobstreet, jobsdb or what ever online job boards and wait for employers to contact you.

* your resume should not be a shotgun. meaning, don't just apply to whatever company you fancy. your thinking of finding a job is by applying for as many companies is stupid.

* know the job search domino effect:

1. marketing preparation
2. dynamic cover letter
3. excellent resume
4. strong interviewing skills
5. timely follow-up

with these tips that i gave you, you can surely avoid all those evil companies out to suck your blood and land the job of your dreams, well, unless you screw it up halfway there.

updated list of filipino celebrities that i hate





from this article, yes, i admit i think i am losing my bad-assness now. yep, i thought that i already covered all the filipino celebrities that i hate with my short list, but now, i need to update it because, there are some filipino celebrities i hate that i haven't mentioned yet. so now, here is the updated list of filipino celebrities that i hate:

1. everyone
2. their sons and/or daugthers or their future sons and/or daugthers.

seriously, the filipino television and movies today have so much inept actors and actresses already, but these inept actors and actresses have so much ego that they think they can act have no sense of shame. these idiots have plans of insisting their sons and/or daugthers to be actors and actresses too. 

i mean, what the fuck!!! these idiots can't act already and they are insisting their sons and/or daugthers to be idiots too by going into show business. look at the following actors and actresses who insisted their fucking sons and/or daughters can act:(i know i am putting a big space here, just in case you're wondering)














parentsons and daugthers who entered show business 

fernando poe, sr.fernando poe, jr.

eddie gutierrez
anabelle ramarichard gutierrez(the highest paid idiot in the showbiz industry in the philippines today)
ruffa gutierrez, raymond gutierrez
ritchie paul
pilita corralesjackie lou blanco
ramon christopher
eddie mesa
rosemarie gilmark gil, cherie gil
michael de mesa
gina alajarryan eigenmann, geoff eigenmann, aj eigenmann
dolphy(rodolfo vera quizon)from alma moreno: vandolph
from pamela ponti: ronnie quizon, eric quizon, jeffrey quizon
alma morenomark anthony fernandez,  vandolph
joey de leonfrom daria ramirez: keempee de leon
helen velaprincess punzalan
sharon cunetamaria kristina cassandra concepcion


i can post more here, but i think i made my point. filipino television is filled with inept actors and actresses and their idiot sons and daughters. 

you know, it wouldn't be bad if their sons and daugthers are decent actors, but no, they are nothing more than second-rate, trying hard copycat of their inept parents. as if the filipino television and movies weren't fucking bad and puke-inducing, here comes their equally, if not more idiotic sons and daughters make it worse. i think i quoted "bituin walang ningning(star that doesn't shine)" here.

listed in technorati under humor, satire, comedy, television, philippines

mary is crying in heaven





you know, if anyone is crying up in heaven, it is certainly not your relatives, brothers, sisters, friends or whatever but it is mary, mother of jesus. she cries a lot because catholic idiots are worshipping her to no end. 

mary is crying because catholic idiots call her "mother of god", while god is omnipresent and omnipotent. meaning god was there before the world is created, so how she can be "mother of god"? jesus christ was already god even mary was born.

catholics even name her as "the immaculate conception" (that mary was born without sin), while it was really clearly written in the scriptures that "for all have sinned, and come short of glory of god." (romans 3:23)

catholic idiots even make statues of her, while it was really stated in the bible that "thou should not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in earth beneath, or that is in the water beneath the earth ... thou shall not bow to them." exodus 20:4,5

may 7, 1997 vatican information service says:

john paul ii underlined that "the history of christian piety teaches that mary is the path that leads to christ, and that filial devotion to her does not at all diminish intimacy with jesus, but rather, it increases it and leads it to very high levels of perfection."

he concluded by asking all christians "to make room (for mary) in their daily lives, acknowledging her providential role in the path of salvation."

well, to all catholics, they will just say that it is just harmful adoration and respect for mary. but it says that in romans 2:9 "but ye have to respect persons, ye commit sin..."

but wait, there's more:

ten series of meditations on the mystery of the rosary, by john ferraro, is intended to give an overview of roman catholic dogma concerning the virgin mary. ferraro's book was given the nihil obstat and the imprimatur, which is an official statement by the roman catholic church that the book "is free of doctrinal or moral error."
*she(mary) is co-redemptrix of the human race.
*the church and the saints greet her thus: "you, o mary, together with jesus christ, redeemed us."
*god has ordained that no grace will be granted to us except through mary. it is a doctrine preached by all the saints that no grace will come to us from heaven without passing through mary's hands. no one will be saved nor obtain mercy except through you, o' heavenly lady. remember this well, no one will enter heaven without passing through mary as one would pass through a door. o' mary, our salvation is in your hands.
*during his passion, mary suffered in her heart all the pains that jesus suffered in his body. for this reason, god exalted her so greatly.
*mary is our co-redemptrix because she gave us jesus pledge of our salvation. furthermore, she is co-redemptrix of the human race, because with christ she ransomed mankind from the power of satan.
*jesus redeemed us with the blood of his body, mary with the agonies of her heart.
*we were condemned through the fault of one woman; we are saved through the merits of another woman. just as eve was the root of death for everyone, so mary was the source of life for everyone.
*mary is our co-redemptrix because she suffered in her heart whatever was lacking in the passion of christ. are we obligated to jesus for his passions? -- so we are indebted to mary for her participation in his passions. she gave birth to jesus with joy; she gave birth to us, brothers of jesus, in anguish and sorrow.
*mary, queen of the apostles: she is queen of apostles because she formed them and directed them in their preaching. mary is queen of apostles because by herself she routed all the heresies. mary is queen of apostles because she is mother of grace and channel of mercy. she is queen of apostles because in her every hope is life and virtue. she is queen of apostles because she is conqueror of the infernal dragon. (emphasis added.)
*if we spread devotion to mary, we will gain heaven -- "who explains me will have life everlasting."
*god shared his power with her [mary]. "my mother, ask, for i must not turn away your face." christ speaking to mary: "without your command, no one shall move hand or foot in the whole land."
*all grace is passed from god to jesus, from jesus to mary, and from mary to us. the grace of god, cure for our ills, comes to us through mary like water through an aqueduct.
*mary is the compliment of the holy spirit. before god she asks not -- she commands!
*no true devotee of mary will be damned because she is the terrible conqueror of the devil.
*because she believed in christ's mission of salvation, she became the co-redemptrix of the whole human race.
*mary is holier than the saints, loftier than the heavens, more glorious than the cherubim, more venerable than any other creature.
*no one can acquire an intimate union with jesus and a perfect fidelity to the holy spirit without being greatly united with mary.
*it is necessary for us to have a mediator besides jesus as mediator, and we will never find one more qualified than mary. (emphasis added.)
*it was never written of anyone that he became a saint without having a special devotion to mary.
*when god deeply loves a soul, and finds it stained with sin, he covers it with a beautiful mantle that makes it precious to him -- that mantle is mary.
*mary is the ark of salvation built by god on the deluge of our faults so that whoever desires may enter and be saved.
*whoever is enamored of mary, attaches his soul to a steadfast anchor that will draw him to the port of happiness.
*it is important to be devoted to mary as it is to enter heaven, because no one can enter paradise who is not devoted to mary.
*in reward for humility, god gave to mary the power of filling with blessed souls the thrones left empty by the rebellious angels.
*mary is secretary of the king of heaven. it is she who writes in the book of life the names of the predestined, and signs them with the emblem of god. she herself is the book of life from which god will read the names of the elect on the day of judgment.
*to be devoted to you, o' mary, is a weapon of salvation which god gave to those whom he positively wants to save.

this is absolute horseshit. nowhere in the scriptures is mary exalted and treated as co-mediatrix to god this way. not one time do we find the apostles praying or worshipping her. none of the apostolic epistles to the churches even mention her. 

catholics are big bunch of big idiots that are not really praying to god. man, i hate  catholics.

the most pompous, arrogant, idiots who think they are gods: popes





you know, popes of the catholic church are the most pompous, arrogant, self-serving bastards that they think they are jesus christs on earth. they try to teach about jesus and his humility, but they aren't the prime examples of it. okay, let's cut the crap and have a look at the idiot popes, shall we?

first stop, pope innocent iii:
pope innocent iii: "he(pope) judges all and judged by no one." 
holy fucking shit man! i just cussed in capital letters over that one, well because, as you see pope innocent iii sees himself as a messiah-like figure that exempts him from all sins and be like jesus christ. from all i know, even the bible states that everyone is sinner, only jesus christ is sinless. moses sinned against the lord, even david, the lord's favorite sinned against him. so what makes this pompous asshole thinks he's sinless?

next stop, pope leo xiii:
pope leo xiii: "we hold upon this earth the place of god almighty." 
what the fuck?! do you really think you hold the earth under catholic rule? that's really boosting your already bloated ego and assume you are the earth's messiah. and yep, you dipshit, how dare you call earth the place of god almighty! you know, god is in  heaven, not earth!   

well, last stop for the day, pope boniface viii:
pope boniface viii said a lot of things, so we'll put it in bullet points.
1. the dead will rise just as little as my horse which died yesterday;
2. mary, when she bore christ, was just as little a virgin as my own mother when she gave birth to me;
3. sex and the satisfaction of natural drives is as little a sin as hand washing;
4. paradise and hell only exist on earth; the healthy, rich and happy people live in the earthly paradise, the poor and the sick are in the earthly hell;
as you can see, these popes are clearly pompous and arrogant bastards and pretty much they think they are gods and messiahs. now let's look at the ii thessalonians:  

[2 thessalonians 2]
2:1 now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our lord jesus christ, and [by] our gathering together unto him,
2:2 that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of christ is at hand.
2:3 let no man deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come], except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
2:4 who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god, or that is worshipped; so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god, showing himself that he is god. 

ah... i give up. popes are just pompous airheads.

i guess everyone is condemned to go to hell





well, you know me, the bad-ass priest that kicks ass for the lord. as much as i try to save people, stupidity is pretty much rampant. and because of this, jesus christ called me earlier and told me i should do a month long holy week special since its already holy week. so since buddy jc asked, i will try to point out some very stupid things in religion. 

first stop, i'm gonna say that a lot of catholics still study to the old testament. i say it is stupid. if you go by the old testament, everyone is fucking condemned to the blazing, burning, painful hell. 

how is that so? well, let's check the leviticus book in the old testament. you will see that everyone is very much, got a way ticket to hell(an another concept that i will discuss soon).

if you check leviticus 19:19, it will say:
"keep my statutes: do not breed any of your domestic animals with others of a different species; do not sow a field of yours with two different kinds of seed; and do not put on a garment woven with two different kinds of thread."

okay, we are eating fuji apple(combined the red delicious and old virginia ralls gene), people cross-breed dogs, horses and what other shit there may be, and yep, fashion designers makes clothes with two kinds of thread. i guess that condemned a lot of people to hell. maybe around 35 million? 

okay, how about checking leviticus 19:27:
"do not clip your hair at the temples, nor trim the edges of your beard."

i guess that god condemned all the bald people and people with shaved beards to hell. 

or how about this verse leviticus 19:18:
"take no revenge and cherish no grudge against your fellow countrymen. you shall love your neighbor as yourself. i am the lord."

i guess all of your fucking, backstabbing cockbite neighbours are also condemned to hell too. but i guess that includes you since your fucking, backstabbing cockbite neighbours thinks you are a fucking, backstabbing cockbite neighbour. so, you're going to hell too buddy. 

and last but not the least, see leviticus 19:26:
"do not eat meat with the blood still in it. do not practice divination or soothsaying."

ok, that doesn't sound too bad. but if you ate chicken at any fastfood restaurand, let's say jollibee, mcdonalds, popeyes, then you probably ate a chicken that is not cooked well because you can see the reddish blood in the bones.

well, i guess pretty much every one is condemned to hell now.

i guess our next olympic gold medal winner will be piolo pascual





you know, i have been seeing a lot of stupidity from television shows today. but the most stupidity i see in television shows comes from abs-cbn shows. you want to know why? well, because when i travel, i ride the bus. and these buses have television sets in them. and what the idiotic thing here is that the dimwit conductor changes the channel to abs-cbn.

as a result, i am forced to watch idiotic shows from this stupid channel. however, there is a single drama series that irked me the most. the series is called "sa piling mo." in this series, the protagonist is the actor piolo pascual and his love interest is judy ann santos. piolo pascual here plays the part of a blind athlete. but wait, not just your ordinary blind athlete, a fucking blind swimmer! how asinine is that? don't you know how much you train a blind person, he has a fucking bad sense of direction. that is why you don't see many blind athletes, especially swimmers, they are just going to swim to the bottom of the pool. 

and yet, this dimwit actor piolo pascual joined in a swimming competition and won. how idiotic is that? well, for one reason, if you have a disability, you are fucking disqualified from competiting in sports and you have to join special sports competition for disabled persons. man, these scriptwriters, directors, heck, let's just say the whole production team of this asinine drama series are big fucking idiots.  

that's why i hate tv.
