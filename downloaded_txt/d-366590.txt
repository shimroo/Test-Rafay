a look back on the asf in 2024


 
our mission 
 the american-scottish foundation®, was established in 1956 as a bridge between scotland and the united states.  its mission is as important today as when founded by lord malcolm douglas hamilton.

asf seeks to strengthen & support the future of the scottish american community, its heritage and cultural legacy through social, cultural, educational, and business activities.

dear american-scottish foundation patrons, members and friends,
 this past november marks the 50th anniversary of the very first scotland week which took place november 11 - 17 1974 - conceived by asf co founder lady natalie douglas hamilton 

lady natalie was a wonderful marketer and we recently discovered in our library a presentation copy (hardbound with personal letter from the publisher, martin schrader) of town & country's october 1974 issue, a scotland issue - with features on whisky, clan spirit, clan chiefs, ' the new scotland', scottish fashion, 2 articles on golf, local antiques and scottish travel.  
the binding is covered in a lively dress stewart tartan.  50 years later, each of these topics seems current and engaging. and alongside other press releases and documents, the first scotland week is a template for what is now tartan week.

we urge our members to come visit the library and find treasures like this, which we have been given or kept as record of leading projects asf has been involved in in the past 70 years.

asf was formed in 1955 from the highland fund and in 1956 became a 501c3 with its name changing to the american scottish foundation. over our nearly 70 years of service to the scottish-american community.

with best wishes from the asf team
on the 46th anniversary of the first new york scotland week organized by the american scottish foundation in new york during november 11 - 19 1974, the foundation proudly announced the deeding of a sizable trove of letters, photographs, manuscripts (unpublished), books, newspaper clippings, documents relating to the work of our founders lord malcolm douglas-hamilton and his wife, lady natalie douglas-hamilton.  learn more . . . 
the scots who built new york
from the earliest days, scots have contributed much to the growth of new york city, and our series of talks titled the scots who built new york illustrated this.
weve now been developing a series of walking tour maps - the first one around lower manhattan and midtown east & west was launched in april 2019.
