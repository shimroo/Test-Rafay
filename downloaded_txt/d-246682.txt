                  about our foundress
                



                  when eternal word television network (ewtn) was launched on aug. 15, 1981, many felt there would be little demand for a catholic network. in fact, when mother m. angelica, a cloistered nun, fulfilled a promise to our lord in the early 1960s by founding our lady of angels monastery in irondale, ala., she had no idea she would one day found the largest religious media network in the world.
