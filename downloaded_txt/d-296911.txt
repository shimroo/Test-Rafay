president trump and porn star





   how is one to assess the endless “porn star and donald trump” saga since it became “breaking news” for the last month or so? is it worthy of the media investment? will it be the straw that breaks the teflon coating so lavishly administered by trump diehards? not on your life! it ranks at about the same level as having just discovered the wheel.           yes, there may be some legal questions involving a campaign contribution and lying but don’t hold your breath---those are but tiny drops in the ocean of trumps personality disorder---whether has consensual sex with one or a dozen adult women.            he is a dishonest person, raised in a cocoon of wealth that facilitated and enhanced his bullying tendencies and gravitation to self-aggrandizement and hyperbole. he is a pathological liar. he doesn’t read. he is factually ignorant and admitted making things up.              in normal speech, without the aid of speechwriters or adult coaches, he has the vocabulary and syntax of a 12-year-old.  he views women from that juvenile mind— “you can grab them by their pussy.”                            his seventy years have codified these elements with an impenetrable bubble of narcistic personality disorder (npd) in which he lives every moment ---and to which he dedicates every action.     trump once said metaphorically (though that word is not in his vocabulary) that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street and his supporters would not desert him. that is precisely what his core supporters swear by when questioned about the sum of his behavior so far. as a republican chairwoman put it recently, vowing her continued support, i voted for him because he could turn the economy around and be financially good for working people.           that is roughly the equivalent of saying “well, yes, my husband gropes women, screws around, uses foul language, lies all the time and mostly watches tv about himself---- but, he pays the rent and gives me an allowance. that’s why i’m sticking with him.”

on “wanting president trump to succeed”

from the vast middle ground of our nation’s political
landscape, one occasionally hears this about president donald trump: “i didn’t
vote for him, but i want to see him succeed.”



when this longing for his success comes from his core
supporters or the right wing remnants of the grand old party, i understand it
because i am aware of their motivation.  however,
when it comes from that nominally informed middle america, the reason escapes
me!



i do not want president donald trump to succeed!



 his political success
would roll back and denigrate the very values that i understand this nation and
our constitution represents and that is simply unacceptable. as imperfect as
our practical efforts to provide for the defense, health, education and general
welfare are ---the tunnel vision of donald trump, facilitated by the likes of steve
bannon and the russian oligarchy should not be politically successful.



what is the difference in that and the effort to thwart
success by president barack obama?   it
is in the brain and personality of the man one would cloak in success or
failure. for openers, donald trump is a pathological liar.



research that charge and it is described as a “behavior of habitual or compulsive lying.”



 “a compulsive liar is someone who lies
with ease and finds comfort in it. the person may even continue to lie
when presented with the truth in cold, hard facts. getting a compulsive
liar to admit he or she lied can be nearly impossible. although not
officially designated as a mental disorder, pathological lying is
often seen as the tip of the iceberg for deeper psychological problems
including narcissistic personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder
and obsessive-compulsive disorder.” sound familiar?



 
donald trump, in normal speech---without the aid of speech writers or
adult coaching, has the vocabulary and syntax of about a twelve-year-old---at
its best , the mind of a juvenile (“you can grab a woman by her pussy if you
are a star!”). he was raised in a cocoon of wealth that enhanced his bullying
tendencies and his gravitation to self-aggrandizement and hyperbole.



seventy years has codified his personality
as an impenetrable bubble of narcissism in which he lives—exclusive of any real
world of activity or factual information that might challenge his hubris.  he is not a reader. he is ignorant. is that
the new standard we want to emulate? is that the kind of personality we   want to be successful in a presidency?



wanting to see him successful is wanting him
to change who he is. that is like the bald headed man or woman looking for the
formula that will grow hair on a cue-ball.
