new york prime
this wildly popular steakhouse with swift, professional service, a classy supper club ambiance and extensive wine list has topped “best of” lists for over 20 years in boca raton, myrtle beach and atlanta. the focus at new york prime is its top-quality, usda prime-only beef, colossal seafood platters and classic sides. and for a sight you have to see to believe… when big red (aka the largest lobster in the tank) gets wheeled around in a radio flyer wagon for guests to ogle and order. visit our menu story to see why new york prime is a different kind of steakhouse.
