t53 turboshaft engine specifications
development of what became the t53 turbine engine started in 1951 when avco became the contractor for the stratford army engine plant in stratford, connecticut.
avco started research and development of gas turbine engines and produced an experimental engine in 1953 that produced 600 shp (447 kw). this early t53 engine was selected in 1956 to power the bell xh-40 experimental helicopter, which developed into the uh-1 “huey”.

since production of the t53 engine started more than 19,000 engines have been produced. the fleet has logged over 50 million hours of flight time. most of the t53 engines power helicopters, but a few turboprop variants also exist.
