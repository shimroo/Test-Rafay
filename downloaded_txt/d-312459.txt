important replacement parts advisories:1.) due to the advanced unimog technical concept, with its extensive array of factory options, international variables - particularly with regard to integrated safety features, frequent improvements in replacement parts, and after-market equipment, the one-size-fits-all approach to web-based "shopping basket" parts sales is not advised.2.) purchasers of unimog replacement parts should be aware that numerous vendors are now marketing "n.o.s." ("new, old stock") items as "new". these military surplus spares have in many cases been stocked in nato and other logistics depots for up to 30 years, far in excess of their serviceable shelf lives.of particular concern should be electrical (including ignition), brake system, fuel system, aggregate overhaul (engine, transmission, steering and axle), and petroleum- and chemical-based items (tires and rubber/neoprene components, plastics and synthetics, composites, etc.) - including seals and gaskets, hoses, belts, filters, as well as repair kits.always insist on original factory-fresh mercedes-benz spare parts from professionally-trained parts specifiers.
