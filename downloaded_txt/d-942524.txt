kwik fit's core services

kwik fit is a tyre expert and leading stockist of the top tyre brands in the world. as the uks leading fast-fit supplier of tyres, kwik fit offers industry-leading automotive repair services and parts to all its customers. as well as this, kwik fit offers mots and servicing for a number of vehicles, while also fixing issues that extend from bike repairs in partnership with fettle to diagnostics and engine treatments. 
you can browse our core services below. 









tyre repair & replacement
when it comes to tyres, kwik fit are the experts you can trust. as the only point of contact between your car and the road, good-condition tyres are crucial. if your tyre pressure keeps dropping, you've noticed the tread wearing thin, or you have any bulges in your tyre, come in for a free tyre inspection. we can usually repair or replace tyres that same day.









mot tests
providing honest mot testing at over 500 centres across the country, our team works to ensure you're able to drive safely at all times. if you're concerned your car's not up to scratch, book in for a combined service & mot test for additional peace of mind.









car servicing
vehicle servicing is one of kwik fit's most essential services offered to motorists. keep your car fully roadworthy, oiled, and happy with our service packages  from interim services and full services to manufacturer services and engine oil changes. we'll go through an exhaustive list of inspection items, top up fluids and replace the oil and filter in your vehicle to make sure everything's ship shape for the road ahead.











car batteries
batteries lose their charging capability over time, making it tougher to start your car - especially on cold mornings. book in for a free battery health check or buy your new car or van battery online - we'll even dispose of your old one. 









air con regas 
your car's air con system keeps you nice and cool during the summer months and helps clear the windscreen during winter, but the refrigerant gas doesn't last forever - get a recharge at kwik fit.









brake repairs
squeaky or spongy brakes? abs light showing on your dashboard? book in for a free brake inspection. we offer brake pad and disc replacements as well as full brake servicing & repair.

finding your tyre size



tyre size
your tyre size can be found on the sidewall of your current tyre and is a sequence of numbers and letters. the most common tyre size in the uk is 205/55r16 but there are many variations so its important to check your existing tyre first before searching for tyres.
tip: take a photo of your existing tyre sidewall to make it easier to identify your tyre size using the guide below.










tyre width
aspect ratio
rim diameter
speed rating
load rating




tyre width
 the first three digits. this displays the width of the tyre  in millimetres. a tyre marked 225 will measure 225mm across the tread from sidewall to sidewall.


aspect ratio
the fourth and fifth digits of the tyre code that  immediately follow the tyre width. the aspect ratio or profile height of the  tyre sidewall is expressed as a percentage of the tyre width. so an aspect  ratio of 55 for example means that  the profile height of the tyre is 55% of its width.


rim diameter
the next two digits represent the size of the wheel rim that  the tyre can be fitted to. it is also the diameter of the tyre from bead to  bead.  so a tyre marked 16 will fit on a 16-inch wheel rim.


speed rating
the speed rating of a tyre is represented by a letter of the alphabet at the end of the tyre size code and indicates the maximum speed capability of the tyre. tyres receive a speed rating based on a series of tests which measure the tyres capability to handle a set speed for a prolonged period of time. 
select your tyre speed rating to find out the maximum speed your tyres can maintain.




speed rating  

e.g. v
q
r
s
t
h
v
w
y



max speed  





if you are unsure what speed rating you need, be sure to check your vehicle handbook. choosing a lower speed rating than that recommended by your vehicle manufacturer could potentially invalidate your insurance.


load rating
the load index provides information on the maximum weight capability for the tyre. the load index is a numerical code that can be located just after the tyre size marking and before the speed rating.
select your load index to find out the maximum load capability for your tyres.

max load  




although not illegal, it is not advisable to have tyres with a lower speed rating or load index than the manufacturer recommended tyre specification for your vehicle, or to have a combination of different tyre construction types. consult your vehicle handbook to confirm your vehicles tyre speed rating and load index as well as any additional requirements.
