pitching horseshoes is 

fun

for everyone!





whether you’re new or an “old hand” at pitching horseshoes,you’ll find what you need here—a top quality horseshoethat will help improve your ringer percentage and add to your enjoyment of the game. 
























thoroughbred horseshoe models 















each thoroughbred horseshoe model has a unique design, purpose, and performance.  however, they all share these common features: 








made in the usa





two-year warranty





durable iron alloy, resists burring, retains its shape





stock colors:  blue and red, non-flaking mate finish





nhpa sanctioned, tournament grade, official size & weight, perfectly matched pairs






every thoroughbred horseshoe can take a serious beating.  it’s part of the plan from the beginning, as we know our customers well.  but if used only occasionally, a set of thoroughbreds may last a lifetime.
