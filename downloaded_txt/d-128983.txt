wordpress vulnerability leaves millions of servers open to hackswordpress plugins or themes that leverages the genericons package is vulnerable to a dom-based cross-site scripting (xss) vulnerability due to an insecure file included with genericons.
jetpack plugin and the twentyfifteen theme (installed by default) are found to be vulnerable. the exact count is difficult to grasp, but both the plugin and theme are default installs in millions of wordpress installs.
the main issue here is the genericons package, so any plugin that makes use of this package is potentially vulnerable if it includes the example.html file that comes with the package.

here are the key issues faced by todays’ online gamblers – […]

kaspersky lab uncovers new cyber hit-n-run operation called ‘icefog’cybersecurity firm kaspersky lab said thursday that it’s discovered a group of “cyber-mercenaries” called “icefog”.  target: government and military institutions.
most of the victims have been in south korea and japan.  but the icefog campaign is coming to an american company near you, kaspersky lab security analysts said during the 4th annual billington  cybersecurity summit in washington dc today.

should madware be considered an internet security threat?a recent technology discussed in the realm of internet security is madware (mobile adware).  the primary question is whether or not it is a legitimate threat to security or simply a terrible inconvenience.  adware on mobile devices is more noticeable than adware on traditional computers because the viewing screens are significantly smaller.  while the same number of ads may be displayed, it is more overwhelming on  smaller mobile screens.
madware is a growing problem
there is no denying that the amount of advertising seen on mobile devices has skyrocketed over the past several years.  one recent study noted the number of apps […]

kids, dont share too much online!in today’s world we would not dream of letting our kids walk to school by themselves, but when it comes to online safety, are we as being as safe as we should be?
a video from the child exploitation and online protection centre in the u.k. which has over 90k shares on facebook drives the message home about what information kids put up on the internet and
draws similarities between posting an online profile on a social media website to placing a large sign in the front garden of your house announcing details to the cyber stalkers and cyberbullies in the area.

teachers and parents are taking on the brunt of the task.
