arm on 5 o'clock news
 



the last 50 years have seen many technological milestones. in 1968, man was yet to walk on the moon, computers were enormous, and the plastics industry was about to boom. for a family business in syracuse, ny, 1968 would mark the beginning of legacy as a leading manufacturing supplier to some of the biggest companies in the world.           
                   founded by john and betty armstrong, who came to the u.s. from coventry, uk, where john started out as a wood and metal pattern maker apprentice, armstrong rm began with modest dreams of building a small firm of five. today, as the company celebrates its 50th anniversary, armstrong employs over 150 people, headed up by the familyâs next generation. 
                   âi was 9-years-old and with my dad at the plant when the first equipment was delivered,â peter armstrong, president of armstrong rm recalls. âi didnât have a clue what it was. today, decades later, i still see some of that original equipment as i walk around our plant.â
                   when armstrong started out, the company intended to make cast molds for plastic molding, but soon got into the rim (reaction injection molding) process when a customer problem turned into an opportunity. a clothing designer came to armstrong to produce a mannequin mold but soon struggled to find anyone to run the body forms. a short conversation with a local material supplier later and a 50-piece order for rim polyurethane was made.

assist in selection and in design for process
armstrong rm uses its experience and knowledge in manufacturing processes to help you select the right method and the right material for the job. and since design for manufacturing isn't always the same as a finished parts design, we offer our talents in designing your parts for the process. so, you don't have to worry about designing a metal part for its "as-cast" state or plastic part for moldability. we take care of that for you, so that you can start tackling your next design challenge.
so, if your design is nearing completion and you now need to manufacture prototypes or production parts, turn to armstrong rm. call us today to discuss your project or send us a request for quotation. you will be glad you did.
