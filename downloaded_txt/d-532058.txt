standings and ical links updated



the standings tables should now be updated as of week 2 of games.  also, calendar subscriptions are updated.  if you have not used calendar subscriptions before, this lets you add your favorite team’s schedule to your phone or outlook calendar.  it includes the opponent’s name, scheduled side of the ice, and the time.  instructions on how to setup calendar subscriptions can be found at the bottom of the page.
if you are subscribed using last year’s links, there is no need to update.  the games should already be visible.
