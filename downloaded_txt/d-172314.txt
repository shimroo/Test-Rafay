arkanimals.com
arkanimals.com started after i fell from the top of a zoo hay barn–injuring myself on christmas day. it was formed after the prompting by a couple of friends who insisted i start a website upon my return to the mountains to recover.
ark animals first appeared on the internet in 1995 as a private website for me (diana l guerrero aka the ark lady). it grew with topics related to wild and domestic animal behavior and training, animals careers, and contributions related to conservation. because of the traffic had to be moved to its own domain in 1997.
oblivious to just how innovative the internet was (or how unique the arkanimals.com website was), i just kept writing and adding more articles and information.
the site has gone through a few transitions since that time and now includes a blog, podcast and vlog along with a wide range of articles, special reports, and other goodies.
in the end of 2013 i had to take a hiatus to recovery from toxic mold exposure and am still in that process.
ark lady (diana l guerrero)
as for me, i am a highly credentialed professional who is known as wild and domestic animal behavior consultant and trainer with over thirty-five years under my belt.
but labels are limiting. my roles have been varied and also include working as a professional speaker, staff trainer, etc., in both large and small organizations. my expertise in marketing and public relations began early in my career and is my current area of focus.
i am also the author of

what animals can teach us about spirituality: inspiring lessons of wild & tame creatures,
blessing of the animals: a guide to prayers & ceremonies celebrating pets & other creatures,
flea control secrets,
animal disaster preparedness for pet owners & pet professionals,
help! my pet is driving me crazy,
and contributing editor to resources for crisis management for zoos & other animal care facilities.

this site has always been a labor of love so i hope that you enjoy your visit, will join the community and take time to leave me your comments on social media or via email.
you can also follow me on facebook, twitter, and linkedin.
