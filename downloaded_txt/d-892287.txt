how do make a same-day appointment?
same-day, drop-in appointments are limited as our services are in high-demand. to book a same-day appointment, grab a ticket from the ticket machine outside the building starting at 9:30 am each day, and come back at 10 am when we open. if you aren’t back at 10 am or if you lose your number, we will give your spot to the next person.

we do not schedule ahead of time for screenings unless you have already tested and have a positive test result, or you are in our prep program and are due for a refill on your prescription.



how do i request my medical records?
if you are not able to access your medical records through the healow patient portal or app, copies can also be requested in-person at magnet or by email.



do i need a full sexual health exam?
if you think you might have symptoms, want to talk to a clinician, are a new client, or have been exposed to an sti, you’ll need a full sexual health visit.



when do i get test results?
test results are usually available within 7 days via the healow patient portal and app. we will also notify you by email when test results are available for review.



i may have been exposed to hiv in the last 72 hours. do i need pep?
for people who have potentially been exposed to hiv in the previous 72 hours, we offer full post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) services with a full month of the medication provided for free. pep should be considered if you were sexually assaulted, if you were stuck by a needle or if you shared injection drug use equipment with someone of an unknown hiv status, or if you had a condom break or you had condomless anal sex with a person of unknown hiv status or someone with a detectable hiv viral load. people with undetectable viral loads do not transmit hiv.
if you think you need pep, call us at 415-581-1600 before coming to magnet so that we can be sure that we can see you. if we are unable to see you, we can refer you to another clinic for pep. pep should be taken as soon as possible and within 72 hours after the potential hiv exposure. every hour counts. do not wait – call us right away.
