http://www.capetimes.co.za/index.php?farticleid=3590601divers get legal opinionrule on scuba permits 'is beyond powers of mcm'december 13, 2006 edition 2melanie goslinglegal opinion obtained by cape town scuba divers is that thegovernment is acting beyond its powers in compelling them to buypermits before they may dive in marine protected areas, which coverthe entire coastline of the peninsula.the r75 permits come into force on january 1 and will be valid for ayear. monthly permits cost r45.the legal opinion is that the department of environment's marineliving resources act does not allow the government to make rules tocontrol recreational uses of the sea that do not entail theconsumption of marine resources. examples are swimming, surfing andscuba diving.scuba divers were advised they could get the new permit legislationoverturned, but that this would require high court action that couldtake three years and cost r500 000.monty guest, chairman of the false bay underwater club, said repeatedrequests, made over three years by diving businesses, clubs, diversand tourism organisations, not to introduce the permit system had beenignored."mcm has just gone ahead with this hugely flawed system. we've lodgeda complaint with the public protector."fishermen kill sharks in marine protected areas and nothing happensto them, but we cannot even swim underwater to watch marine lifewithout buying a permit."there are sewerage outfalls pumping effluent into the marineprotected area and nothing is done ... but scuba divers must havepermits."i believe they're doing it to collect money, because everyone knowsmcm is bankrupt, and to control poaching. but poachers by definitionoperate outside the law, so they're not going to get dive permits. buteven if they did, how would that stop them poaching?"alan boyd, of mcm, agreed that the act did not permit mcm topromulgate legislation controlling non-consumptive recreational use ofprotected areas, but said mcm might do so if the activity was causingdamage.he conceded there was no evidence that scuba divers damaged thepeninsula's kelp forests. he said permits were necessary to enable mcmto "manage" the scuba diving industry, and was not an attempt tocontrol poaching.

	 scuba theory: snorkels aren't evil
    


i really enjoyed this post by will o'brien on divester. divester is beginning a new series on scuba diving theory starting with this fantastic article. there are some good reader comments posted on this page as well.quoted from divester: we're beginning a series on scuba diving theory. not only will we explore techniques and best practices in safety, we'll talk about the reasons behind them. bad puns will abound as we dive into everything from using and maintaining your gear to compartmental decompression theory. today, snorkels: they aren't evil.do you carry a snorkel on your dives?i've met several divers lately who leave the snorkel at home when they go scuba diving. the snorkel has become percieved as dead weight that tugs at the mask strap. today i'll talk about the importance of strapping that tube to your head.snorkels are annoyingthey add extra drag to your head. they poke you in the chin. you forgot the one that isn't pink...yup, they're just obnoxious, until you need them. i'm diving, not snorkelingaccording to reports by dan(the divers alert network), the majority of diving deaths at the surface in 2005 were due to exhaustion. in one case a diver drowned at the surface after he dropped his regulator because his tank was empty at the beginning of his dive.that boy's head is like sputnikin full diving kit, keeping your head above water is very exhausting. the human head averages about 12 pounds. that's a big weight to keep out of the water. oh, and don't forget that the top of the tank and your regulator are poking out of the water. lets make that 20 to 25 pounds of dead weight. inflating your bc will offset the weight of your noggin, but todays bcs are not designed to keep the divers head out of water. please sir, make them smallerit's not entirely the diver's fault that snorkels are being left behind. it has become difficult to find a simple, streamlined snorkel in a dive shop. purge valves certainly make clearing a snorkel very easy. unfortunately adding a purge valve makes the snorkel bigger and heavier, resulting in more drag on the divers head. my favorite, trusty, valve free scubapro snorkel isn't even made anymore. purge valves are simple devices, but they can fail. a piece of sand in the right place can turn that spiffy valve into a water inlet. aside from children's gear, my local dive shop doesn't even carry a snorkel without a purge valve.you're still not convinced?for the local advanced open water course, we have a skill designed to prove the importance of the snorkel. in full gear, the divers swim laps around the pool with everything but a snorkel. in a class filled with 20 year olds in good physical condition, most hit exhaustion between 5 and 8 laps or 250 to 400 yards! after a break, we give them back their snorkel. once their heads is comfortably in the water, previously exhausted students easily swim the same distance and more with very little energy use. this skill is designed to produce exhaustion, do not try it without an instructor to keep you safe.failure is not an optionhave you really considered what happens if you experience an equipment failure at the surface? an aborted dive can easily result in surfacing away from the dive boat. bc failure, broken fin straps, an un-recoverable free flowing regulator all become more serious problems if you left your snorkel in your bag. even in an out of air situation, most people take their regulators back once they get you to the surface. gearing up?every year, several diving deaths occur at the water surface. the majority of these deaths are due to exhaustion. snorkels may be a drag, but carrying your head out of the water is even worse. swimming at the surface in full gear without a snorkel will quickly exhaust even the most physically fit diver. the snorkel is sort of a secret seat belt for divers at the surface.me? i carry my snorkel on every dive. i'll even take the pink one.source: www.divester.com

	 "shark parks?" oceans said in need of protection
    


with tracts of the ocean as little known as mars, discoveries of a stunning richness of life in the depths are spurring calls for more protection from trawlers, oil drillers and prospectors.only about 0.5 percent of the oceans are in protected areas, compared to about 12 percent of the earth's land surface set aside in parks for creatures ranging from lions in south africa to polar bears in alaska.a united nations meeting of the convention on biological diversity in brazil from march 20-31 will review calls to extend protected areas into the high seas to help safeguard marine life ranging from seaweeds to sharks and from starfish to corals.scientists say the issue is pressing because life is being found in parts of the ocean long thought barren -- in the sediments of abyssal plains on the ocean floor, around subsea mountains, deep sea corals or hydrothermal vents."great attention gets paid to rainforests because of the diversity of life there," said u.s. oceanographer sylvia earle, an executive director of conservation international. "diversity in the oceans is even greater.""we should have at least as much of the oceans protected as of the land," she said. most existing protected sea areas are close to coasts, such as around australia's great barrier reef, ecuador's galapagos islands or in the mediterranean."we need better international cooperation and marine protected areas are one way forward," said kristina maria gjerde, an expert at the geneva-based world conservation union which groups governments and environmental groups.catching squirrels with a bulldozer"key areas for protection are deep sea coral reefs and seamounts which are being strip-mined by bottom trawl fishing," said simon cripps, director of the global marine programme at the wwf environmental group.fishing fleets are trawling ever deeper international waters in search of new commercial species, like the orange roughly, as traditional stocks, such as cod or tuna, dwindle due to over-exploitation.unregulated fishing is by far the biggest threat to marine biodiversity because trawlers dragging nets over deep corals, for instance, may be destroying nurseries for fish.earle said deep-sea trawling was like trying to catch squirrels in a forest with a bulldozer.new technologies are also opening up the ocean depths: exxon mobil corp. says it can drill for oil in waters approaching 3,000 meters (9,840 ft) deep. deep water sponges have uses in fiber optics and heat-loving bacteria from thermal vents have promise in helping produce ethanol fuel.yet much of the ocean remains as mysterious as mars."we still can't begin to say what's down there," said ron o'dor, chief scientist of the census of marine life, a 10-year $1 billion international effort to map life in the seas."we've only explored an area the size of 10 football fields of the abyssal plains," he said, referring to the flat sediments on the seabed covering 60 percent of the planet's surface at an average depth of 4 km (2.5 miles).one recent expedition off angola turned up more than 400 new species in abyssal sediments, mostly tiny single-cell organisms.and only 250 of about 15,000 seamounts, rising from the plains but not tall enough to become islands, have been sampled.scientists went to the arctic last year to explore two seamounts marked on charts. "we discovered they weren't even there," o'dor said. "how much do we know about seamounts? obviously not enough."and scientists were stunned in 1977 by the discovery of deep sea hydrothermal vents, leaking acidic water heated by subsea magma and sustaining heat-loving bacteria, tube worms and crabs. many more such vents have been found since.many experts say implementation of existing laws, drafted before the deep-sea marine finds of recent decades, is insufficient to protect the high seas -- the area beyond the 200 nautical mile territorial waters.high seasyet many countries fear restrictions and experts say the brazil talks are unlikely to resolve the tangle -- many nations say the u.n. law of the sea is the proper forum while the convention on biological diversity should just advise.one huge headache would be how to enforce any marine protected areas."a simple approach of blue-helmeted u.n. police on the high seas is never going to happen," wwf's cripps said, adding it would be unworkable despite satellite surveillance.still, the very existence of a protected area on a map would allow the world to "identify and vilify" violators, he said.some parts of the high seas have some forms of protection.the indian ocean has been a no-go area for whaling since 1979 and the southern ocean was added in 1994. wrecks like the titanic can be protected under rules on cultural heritage.and since 2002, a u.n. convention has begun restricting trade in endangered species of commercial fish -- the great white shark, the humphead wrasse, basking sharks, whale sharks and seahorses.source: today.reuters.co.uk

	 no serious coral reef damage after tsunami
    


most indian ocean coral reefs which were hit by the december 2004 tsunami escaped serious damage, but their full recovery could be hampered by humans, the world conservation union warned on wednesday.a small number of damaged reefs may take two decades or more to bounce back, while some individual reefs may never recover at all, said the union and the global coral reef monitoring network in a joint report.but most of the ocean's remaining tsunami-affected coral reefs could recover within five to ten years, provided the damage from human activities can be reduced, the report said."these human activities include over-fishing, deforestation and climate change," said clive wilkinson, an expert from the australian institute of marine science and one of the editors of the report.the tsunami disaster, triggered by a 9.3-magnitude earthquake off the indonesian island of sumatra on december 26, 2004, killed about 220 000 people in 11 indian ocean countries.it also wreaked enormous economic damage.however, the report said, the physical impact on coral reefs in the indian ocean was patchy, depending on factors including the distance of the country from the source of the tsunami and existing condition of the reef.most of the damage to coral reefs resulted from backwash of debris and sediment from land, including from waste disposal sites, it said.the report raised concerns about potential damage caused by efforts to revive the economies of tsunami-affected areas near coral reefs, particularly fishing communities.in the aftermath of the disaster, the focus was on potential tsunami damage to coral reefs and the associated livelihoods for millions of people who lived and work near them, but unsustainable reconstruction efforts are now moving into the spotlight, the report said.it pointed in particular to fears that replacement boats, motors and general fishing equipment often use different technology, often leading to inappropriate use and increased fishing, to the possible detriment of the reefs.source: www.iol.co.za

	 shark cage diving and shark encounters without cages
    


most people have heard of shark cage diving. but now try this: diving with the cape's sharks with no steel cage for protection.that's exactly what a local tour company has been quietly offering for six years.chris fallows, of apex shark expeditions, has warned against hysteria after the latest shark incident.durban tri-athlete peter larcombe was training in fish hoek bay on monday when a shark swam near him and he was hauled out of the water on to a fishing boat. a witness said: "the shark was moving closer to the man. it was a matter of seconds and he would have been another statistic."fallows congratulated the fishermen who helped larcombe, but said humans were not part of sharks' diets.and he opened his photographic library on the extraordinary company he runs.most people would consider such a venture madness.but fallows says: "we use cages off seal island in winter but we also offer snorkelling with blue and mako sharks off cape point in summer when the great whites leave seal island and are difficult to find."humans don't form part of the natural food chain of sharks. and, as such, in most instances, they're more curious about us, even wary, than they are aggressive."in most instances, they shy away from us, instead of provoking an interaction."fallows and his wife, monique, have worked with sharks for more than 15 years and have, for the past six years, offered snorkelling with the pelagic blue and mako sharks off cape point. pelagic refers to the "blue water" type of diving, over 1 000m deep, as opposed to close to the shore."most of our dives take place (about 25km) out to sea. we use low frequency sounds to attract the sharks to the boat, whereupon the divers get into the water and, under strict safety guidelines, get to encounter them at close quarters."in more than one hundred dives with pelagic sharks, no shark has ever acted aggressively."do great whites generally have a different attitude?"although they're very curious animals and will inspect floating objects, they are very selective as to what they bite and consume."in all likelihood, peter would probably have been inspected and the shark would have continued on its merry way, as they've been doing for hundreds of thousands of years in false bay."having tagged more than 600 sharks of various species within 150m of the shore off the strandfontein beaches over the past decade, i'm sure people are regularly inspected by sharks and are complacently unaware of it."human beings kill more than 100 million sharks a year and, on average, less than 20 people are killed each year by sharks."they certainly have a lot more to fear from us."source: www.iol.co.za

	 pre-dive checklist
    


scuba diving is full of opportunities for embarrassment, as perhaps you've noticed. does your diving protocol include sometimes stepping off the boat without weights?mine too. you'd think we might learn eventually to run down a checklist of all the gear we're going to need in the water before making that giant stride. you know the kind of thing: weight belt on? check. air on? check. but somehow paper checklists get lost when you need them most. and who wants to do paperwork when there's diving to do?padi course director ned branch doesn't use paper checklists for recreational diving. "i tried them and forgot stuff," he says. "i'd skip something, thinking i'd get back to it later." but paper does have its place. when he dives his complicated closed-circuit rig, he uses paper and pencil to be sure he's got everything. and people differ. if you feel more comfortable making those tick marks with a pencil before every dive and have the discipline that takes, do it.i don't. on ordinary dives, i need a substitute for the shopping list that's hard to screw up and impossible to forget: a no-pencil, no-brain reminder of all the equipment we must have and all the things we must do to avoid embarrassment--something, well, idiot-proof. and i don't mean those acronyms and trick phrases that instructors love so much. i can't remember them either.instead, i like the "checklist" that's always right at my fingertips because it's my own body. each part of it--my eyes, ears, mouth, chest, stomach, hands and feet--suggests a piece of essential gear or a predive ritual. by always making a head-to-toe body scan of my predive checklist, i haven't forgotten anything important. lately, at least.visit scuba diving's ultimate pre-dive checklist for the full article and find out how it can work for you...source: www.divester.com

	 new zealand: health of scuba divers to be monitored
    


recreational scuba divers will soon be asked to provide information about their health to prevent more deaths under the water. the new zealand underwater association has begun circulating a medical questionnaire as part of best practice guidelines. its head of dive safety lynn taylor says it is in response to coroner recommendations after several diving deaths involving pre-existing medical conditions. she says the questionnaire will also bring overseas divers who are not required to have a medical check before gaining a certificate to their attention. taylor hopes the questionnaire will help stop regulation being imposed on the industry.source: tvnz.co.nz

	 san jose diver may have drowned before shark attack
    


by many accounts, anthony moore was an experienced diver. the 45-year-old san jose engineer left a detailed "float plan" with his wife before heading out for a free-diving excursion off the south coast of maui thursday.then something went terribly wrong. when he failed to return as scheduled, his wife called 911, prompting a massive search by the us coast guard and maui authorities.on friday morning, a kayaker discovered parts of moore's shark-bitten body off the coast near makena. the coroner's office received three different sections of remains: a pelvis and lower extremities. a coast gaurd official said saturday that moore's wife identified her husband by a lanyard that included his rental car key."we're not able to determine the cause of death," said dr. tony manoukian, a coroner's physician, from the morgue at maui memorial medical center saturday. "we can't exclude the possibility that he was dead at the time of the attack."manoukian, a forensic pathologist, said this was his fourth autopsy of a shark attack victim. he said the fact that the kidney was congested with blood indicated that moore probably drowned and was then attacked by sharks, as opposed to bleeding to death while alive."we see shallow water blackouts and drowning more frequently than shark attacks," said manoukian, who said that dna testing or recovering the skull and dental records would be required to positively identify the body."it may have been more than one species of shark," manoukian said. "but we have no evidence that it was anything other than a tiger or reef shark."moore was an engineer at code green networks of sunnyvale."he was very well liked, and he'll be missed," said bob verheecke, who recently joined the company as chief financial officer.source: www.mercurynews.com

	 new shark species discovered in the sea of cortez
    


a mexican marine biologist has discovered a new shark species in the murky depths of mexico's sea of cortez, the first new shark find in the wildlife-rich inlet in 34 years.postgraduate student juan carlos perez was on a fishing boat in early 2003 studying sharks from the mustelus family netted at depths of 660 feet when he noticed some of them had darker skin and white markings.the sharks, slender, dark gray-brown and around 5 feet (1.5 meters) long, turned out to be a new species that perez and his team have named "mustelus hacat," after the word for shark in a local indian dialect."what i first noticed was their color. they are dark in color, like dark coffee, and have white markings on the tips and edges of their fins and tails which jump out at you because they are so dark," perez told reuters on thursday."i got back from the boat and the first thing i said was that i thought i had a new species, but i wasn't sure until six months on when we did genetic tests," he said, audibly elated.worldwide, marine biologists tend to discover two or three new shark species in any given year.but perez's find -- bringing to five the types of mustelus shark found in the eastern north pacific -- is the first shark discovery in the sea of cortez since the tiny mexican horn shark (heterodontus mexicanus) was identified in 1972."i wasn't looking for something new, but it's very satisfying. i'm very happy," said perez, 31, who is based at the cicese science and technology research center at the port of ensenada in northwestern baja california state.his find was published in the u.s. journal copeia in december."there must be more undiscovered species there but access is difficult. if we hadn't been on those boats i'd never have seen them because that's the only place they are caught. and it's not a region that attracts scuba diving."there are some 50 to 60 species of shark in the sea of cortez, a narrow body of water also known as the gulf of california that separates mexico's baja california peninsula from the mainland and is famous for its rich and unique ecosystem.the mustelus hacat lives in the ocean's depths feeding on shellfish and shrimp," perez said, adding: "they have very, very small teeth. they are really not aggressive or dangerous."source: www.underwatertimes.com

	 new species found on barrier reef
    


scientists have found new species of fish and other sea life as part of a landmark survey of the great barrier reef.the great barrier reef seabed biodiversity project, conducted last year, covered 210,000sq km of the continental shelf from fraser island to cape york.project leader dr roland pitcher of csiro marine today said a survey on such a scale had never been carried out before.data collected by survey vessels lady basten and gwendoline may in several voyages over 325 days included more than 2000 hours of video footage by a remote-controlled camera.about 15,000 plant and animal samples were collected using a small sled pulled along the seabed.dr pitcher said one more voyage was planned before the end of the year to complete the mapping of seafloor life and marine habitats up to 100m deep.the information would be analysed over the next two years, dr pitcher said.these will likely include confirmation that many species on the east coast were related to species off northern western australia and in the waters of some asian countries.there would be some brand new sea creatures unique to the great barrier reef such as the pipehorse – which resembles a snake-like seahorse, as well as a crab and lace-like corals."we think around one-third of the species that have been found might be new because these species had not been studied before," dr pitcher said.the survey will help the federally funded great barrier reef marine park authority (gbrmpa), which manages the park, to plan how the reef can be better monitored and used, and how state authorities can best manage trawl fishing."it's very important to have maps of where things are and what they are, what's there and where is it, so you can think about all these planning activities in the same way that we think about them on land," dr pitcher said.source: www.theaustralian.news.com.au

	 atomic aquatics presents atomicvision line of dive masks
    


the latest innovation from atomic aquatics unveiled at dema show 2005 in las vegas. atomic aquatics continues to turn the dive industry on edge with its innovative products. first came the ground-breaking atomic regulator family, followed by the award-winning splitfins. now at dema 2005 atomic aquatics is pleased to unveil its new atomic-vision ultraclear line of professional dive masks.atomic engineering combined decades of diving knowledge, proven concepts, and especially input from atomic retailers and dealers to create the ultimate dive masks. customers can choose from two distinct models - the atomic sub-frame and the atomic frameless.the atomic sub-frame mask is the strongest and most indestruct-ible two-window mask ever made. after talking to several atomic dealers nationwide our dealers noticed that many two-window masks on the market are inherently structurally weak and susceptible to twisting and breakage. because of this atomic decided to build the strongest and most durable two window mask we could. now divers don't have to worry about breaking their mask if someone sits on it, steps on it, or even if a tank falls on it.the atomic sub-frame mask is a two-window design built with an innovative patent pending three-piece frame structure. this structure provides unparalleled durability and strength. in fact, the atomic sub-frame is so durable that the company is announcing a lifetime warranty against frame breakage.the sub-frame mask design's strength is due to the super strong engineering grade thermoplastic frame molded beneath the mask skirt surface. this grade of plastic is so strong it has been used in other industries as a replacement for cast metal components.to add even more rigidity and strength to the frame structure, atomic engineers designed into the frame a solid 316 stainless steel lens retainer support section around the nose bridge. this makes this the sub-frame mask incredibly rigid in the normally weak area of a two-window mask design. the support is not just a metal accent, but a purposefully designed structural support to keep the lenses flat and parallel to the viewing plane.the two-window design also allows changing lenses for vision-correction needs with the mask’s interchangeable lens option.the atomic frameless mask is all about fit, comfort, and simplicity. a large lens and a close fitting skirt work in harmony to create one of the widest viewing angles available for a frameless mask design. the lens shape was computer designed to maximize upward, downward and side-to-side vision. it is a true low profile and very low volume design.the squeeze to release the buckles rest behind the lens for a sleek look and true hydrodynamic function. available in either clear or black silicone with co-molded color accents.ultraclear lensesboth the atomic frameless and sub-frames models offer a new standard feature never seen or “seen through” before on a diving mask. we call them ultraclear lenses.what makes ultraclear special? did you ever notice that normal dive mask lenses have green tint to the glass? to see this tint put you're existing mask up to a piece of white paper and see for yourself. the green tint you see is the result of iron impurities left over in lower quality “ float or window type” glass. that green tint distorts true colors and blocks out some of the light that reaches the eye.ultraclear is a new and exciting optical quality glass with exceptional clarity and high light transmission, with no color distortion.the exceptionally high light transmittance and lack of distortion in an ultraclear lens maximizes the light available for improved visual acuity, especially underwater in low light conditions.like all atomic products, the atomicvision line is built for performance with the added elements of comfort and style. the ultra-comfortable silicone skirt is available in clear or black and the accent colors (red, blue, yellow or black) are designed to match to popular atomic splitfin line.visit atomic aquatics for more information.

	 diving businessman ruled liable over wife's death
    


a us dive shop owner has been found liable for the death of his wife, in a civil case that awarded the victim's parents more than $3.5 million in damages. a superior court jury found that david swain, 50, who ran a dive shop in jamestown, rhode island, killed his wife shelley tyre, 46, during a dive off the caribbean island of tortola in 1999.according to a report by the providence journal, the jury accepted testimony from experts that, based on examination of the victim's scuba gear, swain had attacked his wife from behind at a depth of 24m, turned off her air and forced her to drown. however, swain has never been charged with any crime.tyre's parents were reportedly awarded $2 million in punitive damages and $1,534,943 in compensatory damages. tyre, according to her lawyer, had given up a $70,000-a-year job as an academy principal to take a lower-paid teaching job closer to home, in trying to salvage a marriage which she believed was in trouble.had the pair divorced, it was reported, a prenuptial agreement would have left swain with nothing. upon tyre's death, swain reportedly collected $570,000 from policies and other sources. however, he is reported to have filed for bankruptcy last autumn. in the usa, as in britain, in contrast to criminal trials in which guilt has to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt, in civil hearings a jury may find a defendant liable if such a position seems firmly likely under the weight of evidence presented.source: www.divernet.com

	 grey nurse shark species at risk of extinction, says genetic survey
    


grey nurse sharks are in danger of becoming extinct, according to a genetic survey of the fish in their natural habitats.scientists analysed dna from small populations of the sharks off the western and eastern coasts of australia and south africa to see how much the groups mixed and how diverse their genes were.they found that grey nurse sharks living around the australian coast are isolated from other small groups of sharks, suggesting that their dwindling numbers will not be boosted by sharks migrating from other waters. the survey also discovered that each individual population of sharks had a very small range of genetic diversity, making the group vulnerable to dangerous infections and changes in habitat. "low genetic variation lowers the potential for a species to adapt to environmental change such as global warming and also increases the risk of disease," said adam gow, of macquarie university in sydney.grey nurse sharks have been in rapid decline, particularly during the 60s and 70s, when they were hunted for sport using explosives. the species, carcharias taurus, is now listed as critically endangered. "although it has rather menacing needle-like teeth on display, it has become clear that they really are not people eaters. their tooth structure is suited to grasping slippery fish rather than large mammals," said dr gow. the decline of the grey nurse shark is exacerbated by its slow ability to bounce back from overfishing. the sharks take up to 10 years to reach full maturity and each female has a maximum of only two live young because the firstborn attempts to eat all of its siblings in the uterus, leaving only a single "pup" in each of the two fallopian tubes. "the population is so low now that with their slow recovery rate, they really are particularly vulnerable to extinction unless all mortality due to fishing and other human impacts is removed," said dr gow, whose study appears in the royal society journal biology letters."along with the negligible migration into the critically endangered east australian population, our finding of low genetic variation shows that the risk of extinction is higher than previously thought," he said.the finding reinforces efforts to conserve the sharks' habitats and protect  their current populations, which in australia amount to no more than 400 in the wild. but more will need to be done, according to dr gow. to broaden the shark population's genetic diversity, sharks from distant waters will have to be introduced to those elsewhere in the hope that they breed young.mixing sharks from different regions should produce a more sturdy population, although there are risks to the welfare and migration behaviour of those chosen for transferring.source: www.sharklife.co.za

	 study warns of threat to sharks
    


sharks could be more vulnerable to the fishing industry than was previously thought, research has revealed.marine scientists led by aberdeen university have discovered that the deepest oceans of the world appear to be shark free. one possible reason, they tell a royal society journal, may be lack of food.the researchers warn that the findings mean all shark populations are within reach of human fisheries and could be at greater risk than was thought.in their paper published on wednesday - the absence of sharks from abyssal regions of the world's oceans - the international team of researchers reports that sharks have failed to colonise at depths greater than 3,000m.sharks are found throughout the world's oceans and it had been hoped new species would be discovered as exploration went deeper. however, 20 years of exploration combined with analysis of records over the past 150 years, has convinced the scientists that the world's oceans are 70% shark-free. the average depth of the oceans is 4,000m and bony fish - relatives of cod - thrive down to around 9,000m depth.the scientists do not know why sharks are absent there but suggest one possible reason could be a lack of food resources. professor monty priede, director of oceanlab at aberdeen university, said: "sharks are apparently confined to around 30% of the world's oceans. "all populations are therefore within reach of human fisheries, near the surface and at the edges of deep water. "sharks are already threatened worldwide by the intensity of fishing activity. "but our finding suggests they may be more vulnerable to over-exploitation than was previously thought."as far as we can see, there is no hidden reserve of sharks in the deep sea. all we see is all there is - it's highly unlikely we are going to find any more." the scientists based their conclusions on a wide range of data, which includes information gathered during a major expedition along the mid-atlantic ridge between iceland and the azores in 2004.the team also used findings built up over the last two decades when the university's oceanlab started developing landers - remotely operated vehicles - which have been used in deep waters all over the world. expeditions using landers visited deep areas including the south atlantic off the falkland islands.the shark paper is published in proceedings of the royal society b: biological sciences.source: www.sharktrust.org

	 new zealand: more of great white sharks to be tagged
    


an international team of marine scientists returns to the chatham islands next week hoping to fit satellite tags on up to 13 great white sharks. the tags will allow the scientists to track the sharks’ movements for up to nine months.the team is led by dr ramón bonfil of the new york-based wildlife conservation society (funded by national geographic), dr malcolm francis of the national institute of water & atmospheric research, and clinton duffy of the department of conservation. white sharks are long-lived and slow to reproduce. they have a ferocious reputation, but their population numbers are low and have declined drastically in some parts of the world. better information on the behaviour and distribution of white sharks will help inform management decisions about their protection. in april last year, the same team of scientists used satellite tags on new zealand great whites for the first time. they tagged four sharks using pop-up archival tags (pat tags) which record information about the depth, temperature, and light levels as the animals swim through the water. the tags then detach at a pre-programmed date, float to the surface, and transmit the data via satellite. one tag detached prematurely, but the others provided unexpected results.all three sharks travelled great distances to tropical regions. "we knew white sharks turned up in the tropics on occasions," says dr malcolm francis, "but to see all of them travel there was a surprise. if anything, we thought they'd move closer to mainland new zealand." this year, the team plans to follow the sharks for a longer period, programming their tags to stay on for up to nine months (rather than a maximum of six). they are keen to check whether other sharks make similar long distance journeys and whether any of them return to the chathams. the team hopes to tag eight sharks with the pat tags, and to tag five sharks with the more sophisticated 'spot' (smart position or temperature transmitting) tags. this will be the first time spot tags have been used on sharks in new zealand waters. the spot tags are attached to a shark's dorsal fin and have an aerial. they will transmit data to satellites whenever the shark's fin breaks the surface of the water. "during their long distance journeys, the three sharks last year spent 60-70% of their time in the top few metres of water, so we're quite hopeful that we can get almost real-time information about shark movements from the spot tags," says dr francis. to do the tagging, the team are again working with tim gregory-hunt, chatham islands cage diving operator and skipper of tessa b. pat tags can be attached using a long pole. spot tags are more challenging because the shark has to be caught and partly hoisted out of the water onto a 'cradle' or stretcher at the side of the vessel. water is continuously run over the shark's gills, and a vet monitors all parts of the operation. dr bonfil has successfully used spot tags on sharks in south africa.to read the original press release click heresource: www.sharktrust.org
