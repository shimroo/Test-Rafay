selecting headphones made from easy-to-clean materials ensures that students use clean and hygienic equipment, thereby promoting a healthier learning environment.
adjustable headbands
adjustable headbands provide a comfortable fit for students of all ages by allowing them to adjust the tightness of the headband to their own preference. features such as hook and loop fasteners, snaps, and flexible elastics enable users to tailor the fit of the headphones to their individual head shape and size, providing a more comfortable experience for extended use.
choosing headphones with adjustable headbands guarantees a comfortable and secure fit for your students that won’t slip off during use.
