covenant college commencement | may 6, 2023 - more information




in all things christ preeminentfounded in 1955, covenant college is a christian liberal arts college located on lookout
                        mountain, georgia.
distinctly christian: our motto, "in all things christ preeminent," says it all: we exist to glorify and
                     make known the name of jesus christ.
liberal arts education: we view academics as a way to honor god - not just in biblical & theological studies,
                     but also through the sciences, arts, humanities, and more.
reformed theology: we are committed to the bible as the inerrant word of god, and everything we do is
                     grounded in our reformed theology.

                              the rest of your life. at covenant, we hope you succeed as a student and begin a fulfilling
                              career, but more importantly, we care about your lifelong walk with jesus.
