many other letters are received on a regular basis that relate similar sentiments, 
such as the following: "dear sir, some
days back i chanced on your website whilst browsing the internet. may i tell you
that you are doing a lot more for hinduism than a born brahmin hindu like myself
is doing. thank you. i am a tamil brahmin iyengar from chennai. your website is
a real reminder/eye opener. thanks and best regards, k. g."  6/5/2003
 
        or this one which 
relates a blessing: "i have become a great fan of yours. i consider you as a 
rebirth of swami vivekananda who has come to save the vedic way of life. may 
vishnu shower his abundant blessings on you!! thank you! yours faithfully, balaji." 9/9/2008
 
       

"what an introspective journey and fight!!! every hindu should 
see and realize the greatness of sanatana dharma and how people from west are 
contributing their might to defend vedic tradition and indian culture! my 
respect and regards to stephen knapp for his efforts and contribution to vedic 
system and indian culture."

this booklet 
provides the means for standing up to defend sanatana-dharma especially against

followers of sanatana-dharma. herein you can find the means to help yourself and 
others defend dharma by using logic and common sense, and the counter arguments 
that can be used against the criticisms from those who simply do not understand 
it, especially christians. this also helps you recognize the lapses in logic 
(known as "philosophical fallacies") in their own arguments. thus, everyone 
should awaken to the realities of what christianity has done to decent humans in 
the past, and how their conversion tactics are still performed with the mission 
of christianizing the world. (33 pages)

about stephen knapp
        stephen has dedicated 
himself to spreading the deepest and most practical levels of spiritual 
knowledge about the soul--our real identity. it is his strongest realization 
that our existence on this earthly plane becomes much easier and more vibrant 
the more we expand our spiritual awareness to perceive the higher dimensions and 
purpose of things around us.
        though this world may 
give us numerous challenges, when we rise above the basic materialistic view and 
its limited search for solutions, our evolutionary development on all levels 
greatly accelerates. by recognizing that we are all spiritual beings who are, 
basically, attempting to achieve the same essentials for our existence--namely 
love, acceptance, harmony, peace, and happiness, not to mention the ordinary 
needs of food, water, clothing and shelter--we can reach a new level of 
cooperation with each other. then everything can be much easier for everyone. it 
is stephen's conviction that this can be attained by the distribution of genuine 
spiritual knowledge. this is one of stephen's purposes in what he does.
        it is through this 
means that we can discover who we are and get a better understanding of what is 
our position in this universe and our relationship with god. fortunately, many 
of the answers to the numerous questions in this regard have already been given, 
as seen in the ancient spiritual texts of the east. these have provided not only 
the insights but also the timeless methods for our continued spiritual 
development. stephen has studied these numerous ancient texts and practiced the 
methods prescribed therein for over 40 years. he is now presenting this 
enlightening information in a much needed, concise, and easy to read format.
        stephen knapp grew up 
in a christian family, during which time he seriously studied the bible to 
understand its teachings. in his late teenage years, however, he sought answers 
to questions not easily explained in christian theology. so, he began to search 
through other religions and philosophies from around the world and started to 
find the answers for which he was looking. he also studied a variety of occult 
sciences, ancient mythology, mysticism, yoga, and the spiritual teachings of the 
east. finally, after his first reading of the bhagavad-gita, the 
classic summary of vedic philosophy known as the song of god, he felt he 
had found the last piece of the puzzle he had been putting together through all 
of his research. this increased his understanding of everything else he had been 
studying. therefore, he continued to research all of the major vedic texts of 
india to gain a better understanding of the vedic science, until he became a 
full-fledged follower and practitioner of sanatana-dharma. now he also 
tirelessly works to protect, preserve and promote the deep spiritual knowledge 
of vedic philosophy and its traditions. since he started writing in 1986 to 
share the vedic spirituality with others, he has published over 50 books and 
numerous articles. an introduction to his research, writing 
and projects can be found at his website:


www.stephen-knapp.com  or  
http://stephenknapp.info. 
        it is known amongst 
all eastern mystics that anyone, regardless of qualifications, academic or 
otherwise, who does not engage in the spiritual practices described in the vedic 
texts, cannot actually enter into understanding the depths of the vedic 
spiritual science, nor acquire the realizations that should accompany it. so, 
rather than pursuing his research in an academic atmosphere at a university, 
stephen directly engaged in the spiritual disciplines that have been recommended 
for hundreds of years. he continued his study of vedic knowledge and spiritual 
practice under the guidance of a spiritual master, his divine grace  
a. c. bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada. through this process he was given the 
spiritual name of sri nandanandana dasa and became initiated into the genuine 
and authorized spiritual line of the brahma-madhava-gaudiya
sampradaya. this is a disciplic succession that descends back through 
sri caitanya mahaprabhu and  sri vyasadeva, 
the compiler of vedic literature, and further back to lord 
sri krishna, who originally enlightened lord brahma to help in the universal 
creation, and who again appeared on this planet 5,000 years ago in mathura, 
india to display his pastimes. 

        besides being brahminically 
initiated and being trained in temple pujas, stephen has also been to 
india numerous times and traveled extensively throughout the country, visiting 
almost every state of india and most of the major holy places and temples, and 
many minor ones, and gaining a wide variety of spiritual experiences that only 
such places can give. his knowledge of india and familiarity with traveling in 
such a diverse country has made him an advisor for those who would like 
information concerning their own journeys to india. stephen is also a free-lance 
photographer and does what he calls cultural photojournalism, capturing the 
essence of india and spiritual life in practice, which can help explain and show 
the depth of the culture, and has put together a collection of over 18,000 
slides of various places, festivals, and the people of india. he enjoys giving 
slide shows on the holy places, and mixing photos with philosophy. you can see 
samples of his photography on this website.

        stephen has been involved in temple 
management since 1975, overseeing and engaged in a number of different roles in 
the temple, whether as landlord of temple properties, management of the temple, 
being the treasurer and bill-payer, etc. he was also the inspiration behind the 
idea to develop another krishna temple in the detroit suburbs, so that more 
people could approach krishna through a local temple for those who did not want 
to drive all the way into detroit. this has developed into a successful temple 
in the town of farmington. more outreach activities in other towns have 
developed from that.

        he also told the temple sankirtan 
department, a group of devotees in detroit who did harinama sankirtana in the 
area, to develop a preaching center/temple in the ann arbor/ypsilanti area. ann 
arbor is a university town that has always been a place with a wide range of 
students from various backgrounds and a center wherein many devotees have come 
from over the years. so, a nice and permanent preaching temple was developed 
there, and has expanded to include a few more houses, a small restaurant for 
prasada distribution in the middle of ypsilanti, and a small farm with several 
cows for a place of retreat as well as gardens for a consumer supported 
agricultural project, located about a half-hour drive south.  
        stephen continues to 
travel to india on a regular basis, giving lectures on the benefits and glories 
of the vedic tradition. his life is dedicated to spreading the eternal knowledge 
of the soul, sanatana-dharma, and highlighting the vedic teachings to help 
everyone get a better understanding of themselves and bring everyone closer to 
god. he has especially focused on the sadhana
of bhakti-yoga and mantra-yoga to purify the mind and 
consciousness, and awake one's love for the supreme being.
        stephen is also the 
founder of the  world relief network. its 
goal is to help relieve the sorrow, suffering and confusion on the planet by the 
dissemination of genuine spiritual knowledge and the means for individual and 
social enlightenment, and to work with others who feel the same. many of his 
books are published through the world relief network.
       stephen is also the past 
president of the vedic friends association for fifteen years, since before it 
was incorporated in 2002. he helped form its visionary purpose, oversaw and 
published its monthly newsletter, developed its website, helped attract members, 
and helped develop its direction and means of sharing the universal vedic dharma 
with students who were interested, and to connect with other scholars, writers, 
and lecturers who were involved and already working to help spread the profound 
nature of the vedic knowledge.

destiny. with his insights and philosophical background, he has the 
qualifications and understanding to provide a most unique and uplifting view of 
the natural transition called death and how it can be used for our benefit. for
