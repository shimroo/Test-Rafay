notes for death valley, long long canyons, maybe big groups.



feb 13, 2025




notes for death valley, super long canyons, big groups, long rappels, moving efficiently.  might apply elsewhere. suggestions. there are always multiple ways to do it, please ponder on this.guidelines. suggestions. not rules.1. contingency anchors – no!  these ain’t waterfalls, at least, i hope not. if we have beginners along, we are already in big trouble.2. bottom belays – yes!  especially on rappels longer than 100’. but, dv has a lot of loose rock, so the bottom belayer needs to be out of the target zone. usually best to step to the side (and back) rather than just back. as the rappeller gets close to the ground, to maintain belay, you will need to step closer in.2b. two ropes: if we are running two ropes, just belay both of them. no need to yell up ‘which rope’.  just belay both.3. off rope (two whistles); thank you (or one whistle): do this, every time. both the off rope, and the response from the top. in death valley, step out away from the target zone before saying off rope.  (if you are at the bottom with a whistle, only whistle once the rappeller is out of the target zone).

jacob canyon zion, nov2024, brent mecham guest rave



nov 15, 2024




the seed for running jacob was planted last year when my friend mark mentioned it. after that i quickly started looking for beta on the internet. the only information i could gather was on canyoneering usa. tom does a good job in providing helpful information on many of the zion routes. i like his old school approach with a topographic map and some coordinates.
