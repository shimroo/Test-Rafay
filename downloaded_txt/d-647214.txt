jan 4th with the new year 2024





 i mentioned in my last post about the two bobbin lace snowmen being one went to my lace exchange  partner marcela in spain. this is a picture of the exchange i received from her. isn’t her star beautiful? she included a pair of bobbins and the christmas tree ornament.    i also mention the other snowman i made from a free pattern on facebook. here i am with nicola parkman and the ornament i gave to her. she was so kind and friendly.my lastest projects are two cross stitched christmas stockings both designed by jody from satsuma street designs. i got “oh deer” done that i made for kiara my granddaughter. as far as the second stocking went it i couldn’t finish it before christmas so i made what i had finished into a bag so after christmas i could take the bag apart and finishing stitching on it which is what i am now working on and then it will become a stocking. here are pictures of kiara with her finished stocking and colton’s bag.  today i got a surprise in the mail from my friend iris niebach. iris has a new tatting book out. the book is beautifully done. the colors are bright and cheerful the way all of iris’ books are. this book has flower sprigs and leaves with some floral arrangements. it is a wonderful book. thank you iris!! here is a picture showing the beautiful cover which gives you the idea of the beautiful tatting between the pages.this will be it for today’s post. i will post again soon …meanwhile stay safe.

it is now new years eve…





 so i thought i would write a posts and share some picture with you all.first i my wish for you all you putting here a picture i did with different holiday tatting i have done in years past.next is a tale of two free forming snowmen that i did in bobbin lace making. i follow a woman that is on youtube. some maybe know who she is. her name is nicola parkman from the cornwall, uk. she has a business called hands across time samplers. i find her very friendly sounding as i love when she talks about samplers that are found from times in the past and are reproduced and brought back to life. well, she came here in the fall a couple months ago to teach a workshop. i would have loved to take the work shop and meet her in person. the beauty of this was i didn’t have to get on a plane. nicola was going to be only 30 miles from my house … wonderful huh?? i had written to nicola and told her how i follow her and the fact i live pretty close to where she was going to be when she came states side. i told her that i wished i could take her workshop and i lived close by. she said to come on friday morning and we could have a coffee together. since she was so nice and willing to do this i decided i would make her a cloth card and since winter was on the horizon i made her a snowman. here is the picture of that snowman which was on the front of the card. the back said happy winter with some confetti snowflakes with beads added on. i gave it to her and we had coffee together and a chat. it was a very nice and special time for me.   i then made another snowman using the same pattern for my lace exchange partner in spain. here is that snowman. marcella made for me a beautiful red star in bobbi lace. i will show that in my next post. this will be all for tonight for the new year is now less than an hour away. i will write soon again. happy new years!!!!

mimosa tree





 here is a picture of my mimosa tree taken from my kitchen window. it is so pretty. the tree makes me think of my parents. nobody had a mimosa tree around me. the only place i saw it here in new york was my parents. i remember my dad with his binoculars  sitting in his chair in the living room watching the hummingbirds.   years ago while visiting my girlfriend erin in knoxville we pulled over the side of the highway so i could pick some seed pods. i brought the pods home and the next year i started the seeds in a pit and planted them. the mimosatree that was at my parents house is no more. when my daughter had a room added to her house the mimosa tree was taken down.   when i see this beauty i think of my parents and my friend erin whom i have fond memories of both.
