spring breakage





hello rock n' rollers-so spring break draws near for the mtsu crowd. while classmates cruise off to cancun or wherever all the kids go these days, i'll be perusing the nashville clubs for some shows. check these puppies out.saturday, february 24:autovaughn will be hitting up 12th and porter with brenn and the rewinds. autovaughn is headed to sxsw in march, so catch 'em now before they come back all cool and famous 'n such.saturday also marks the opening of the f.y.e. in the old tower building on west end. i will be interested to see how f.y.e. does. go to the festivities though. there shall be song and dance!friday, march 2:my beautiful disaster will be jamming on the square in murfreesboro with caprice and dead sun. if you haven't ever been to wallstreet, check it out. it has a great vibe, nice and clean, and who knew so much rocking out could happen on the second floor?man so much goodness in the boro that night. two co-workers of mine from the mtsu music school will be playing at the boro bar and grill, the vermicious k'nids and alex grant. muchos rocking to be done i'm sure. also playing: the transcenders and tequila.monday, march 5:the swear will be playing at bmi's 8th of 8th! i happened to see the swear at a show at exit/in in late '06 and they absolutely blew me away. i mean rarely do bands completely impress me the first time around. i was excited to learn that this atlanta band has been featured on tv shows (including the cult tv show roswell) and all kinds of elsewheres. seriously, i can't wait to see where this band will go and i am jumping on their bandwagon right now. you should too. or in the very least, go check them out at the mercy lounge. rad. (sorry kids...21+)other business:there has been so much going on lately. guess i must pick and choose for now.in light of the recent announcement of starwood's closing, i guess i must do the mandatory "tell about your starwood experience..."i went to starwood 3 times in my 20 years of living in nashville. my first concert (don't judge me...) was matchbox 20 and paula cole (keep in mind this was during my extreme dawson's creek addiction phase). my sister taught me that night what pot smells like.at some point, my sister and i went out to starwood to see counting crows and live. both put on a good show, but we were both there to see live. and they are glorious, especially live.the last time i graced starwood with my presence was to see jimmy buffett on a double and half date including me and this particularly cute fellow, this parents, and his youth minister. honestly, out of the three concerts, i think the buffett concert is the one that will make me miss starwood most because the outdoor venue was perfect for the show. (not to mention mr. buffett made fun of the harpeth hall girls short skirts. yeah he mentioned my high school during the show).in truth, starwood has been doomed for a while now. i think it's pretty sad that live nation promised the 2007 season and then yanked it when the right deal came along, but i think good things will eventually come out of this. one day...way off in the future.alas, i must whisk myself off to the electronics lab to build circuits. let me know what shows you are seeing and what shows i should be listing. before you know it, you too can be guru approved.~peace~

i know somebody out there is saying to themselves, "man new year...crappy weather...new semester at school...i am really down in the dumps..." alas, whether you find yourself saying this or not, check out the folloing shows. they are sure to add a bit of pick me up.thursday, january 25:musicares benefit featuring treva blomquist, jeremy lister, katie herzig, bodhicitta bellydance (ooooh!) at 8 pm at the basement. sorry kids, this one is 21 and up.saturday, january 27:dave barnes will be playing the cannery ballroom. i've heard many a good thing about mr. barnes and i think he is well worth your time. besides, if lightning 100 plays his stuff, then he must be cool.for those of you looking for something more electronic and rad, check out wick-it at cafe coco on saturday night. he's got some crazy cool re-mixes on his myspace page including a grooving remix of the bangles' "walk like an egyptian."saturday's a hopping night around town apparently. for the rockers at heart, the worsties, taylor sorensen and the trigger code, the lonely hearts, and chelsea scott will be rocking out at the basement. should be pretty glorious.thursday, february 1:in a myspace bulletin entitled "rabid orphans," ethan swim announced they will be showing off their moneymakers at the boro in murfreesboro. expect a new record from these guys later this year.saturday, february 3: beauty school dropouts will be doing a live dvd taping at 12th and porter. if you want to show your support or just mark your absolute coolness for all eternity, you don't want to miss this event!other tidbits:go show some love to the independent. it's a website that i write for and is run by the todd, the brain behind nashvillezine. love it.also, i will be starting a photo of the week column there so submit those amazing photos of you chilling with the band or those fab action shots that are just sitting on your hard drive waiting to be discovered.finally, if you aren't feeling the love and think your show should have been included in this blog, send me an email and i'll remedy that superfast.keep rocking.

resolutions for 2007





well i know it may seemed like i've abandoned all ye music fans out there. but, being in college is tougher than the movies make it out to be. i survived fall '06 which was deemed "the hell semester." too many group projects and term papers. just the fact that i'm taking three hours less this semester is promising for the future of this blog. alas, i graduate in a year and best get this sucker going seeing as how it is officially on my resume now. enough rambling. get on with the local love.tonight!! monday, january 15, 2007:for a whole $8 you too can see sean mcconnell and his band (members of the band formerly known as kixelsyd) will be opening for jason boland and the stragglers at exit/in. that's right my friends. drummer travis tohill encourages everyone to come out and "shake their moneymakers."wednesday,  january 17:not local in origin, but the red hot chili peppers will be heating up the gec with gnarls barkley. i saw his album on vinyl at the great escape and had a massive craving to own it. some things just sound better on vinyl...thursday, january 18:for all you returning mtsu students, the koo, lasalle, and the masses will be playing wallstreet at 9:30 p.m. you know all those striped stickers on signs all over mtsu's campus? yep they belong to the koo. at first i thought they belonged to the masses because one was placed over the word "mass" on the john bragg mass communications building. alas, we aren't quite that clever yet.friday, january 19: fine china (whose website is http://www.youmakemehatemusic.com) will be celebrating the release of their ep at exit/in. doors open at 8:00, show at 9. tickets are $10 and leigh nash opens (of sixpence none the richer fame).  and with your paid admission, you get a free copy of the ep. sweet!for those of you looking to celebrate the success of the pink spiders, you can do so on friday at rocketown as the band will be performing with kill hannah. tickets are available for $12 from www.selloutpresents.com.saturday, january 20:get comfy with the comfies as they play the end. they are touring right now, but made room for a stop in their glorious hometown. hooray for local rockers.other tidbits:on sunday, the tennessean ran a pretty li'l article about local bands and what they will be doing in the upcoming year. there were many major label debuts and other exciting news. read it and see who you should see before they get famous. definitely worth a look. it will increase your local music vocabulary.all ages venues rocketown and the muse have both revamped their websites. go check them out.i found this site while hunting down shows today. it's got more listings but is not nearly as cool as this blog...right? anyway, it's good for checking on what's going on around town. beethere nashville.feedback:finally, i want to hear about your awesome music discoveries over the holidays. new cds? rad concerts? tell me about them.and of course any shows you want to promote, just give me a holler and i'll get it posted asap.
