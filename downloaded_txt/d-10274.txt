is another world"
 bermuda
is britain's oldest and smallest but most affluent british overseas
territory,  internally self-governing (except for external affairs and
defense). bermuda is 600 miles due east of the nearest mainland, the usa's north
carolina.  bermuda is not in the caribbean but 900 miles north of it, with no airlines flying between bermuda and the caribbean.
 note above and below frequent daily airline services
to
bermuda from  the  usa  (it supplies 85% of bermuda's international business, imports and tourism markets),
canada and britain (uk).   the world bank - see http://data.worldbank.org/country/bermuda
- rates bermuda as one of the top four jurisdictions in the world in gross national income per capita. bermuda is an
important and strategic offshore business jurisdiction and the registered
offshore or principal home of thousands of multinational companies and
corporations (most are from the usa, canada, europe, russia, hong kong and rest
of asia) in aviation, computers, investment, insurance and reinsurance,
pharmaceuticals, oil, property (real estate), shipping, software, unit trust and
other companies. they include amazon, apple, google, microsoft. their main business
operations including management, corporate control  and head
offices are located beyond bermuda. our cost of living
is the highest in the world. bermuda (not the uk), creates its laws including those on citizenship,
commerce, customs duties, employment, finance, health, insurance, investments,
hospitalization, immigration, taxation, trade, welfare, etc. uk visitors to
bermuda are welcome as all other nationalities but like the others are also
subject to immigration and work permit laws if employed locally, have no free uk nhs-style medical services
or residential or voting rights and are restricted in real estate purchase to
the top 5% of single family homes or condominiums in assessed or market value.
size and resident
population. bermuda is 21
square mile (56 kilometers) in total land area, a
cluster of small islands (6 main islands and 120 others) in the north west atlantic ocean.
it is one of the nine
smallest places in the world in total land area, compared to the usa's 9.629 million square kilometers.
the main islands are connected by bridges. with nine parishes (counties or districts), each 2.3055 square miles (3.68 square
kilometers, bermuda has about 65,000 residents and 550,000 visitors yearly, mostly from cruise
ships that visit one of bermuda's three cruise ship ports.
