our holiday drive raised over $800 and 847 lbs. of food for the greater cleveland food bank!

thanks to all who participated, from our students and faculty to school groups from fairview park and westlake high schools, to musicians within the community including brian henke and gary rice. together we raised our largest comtribution for a drive, so over the last 18 months we've facilitated donations of over $2800 and over 1300 pounds of food for the greater cleveland food bank! 









we are a rental affiliate for music & arts. they're the largest band & orchestra chain in the country, and they can now provide us with a ready supply of band instrument rentals!
														if you're looking for a rental instrument for school, (or you're an adult getting into it!) contact dan at the store or go directly to the m&a link here--you can set up your rental and have it waiting for you at the store!
