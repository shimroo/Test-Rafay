"thus
        the hero of the odyssey is a great fighter, a wily schemer, a ready
        speaker, a man of stout heart and broad wisdom who knows that he must
        endure without too much complaining what he gods send; and he can both
        build and sail a boat, drive a furrow as straight as anyone, beat a
        young braggart at throwing the discus, challenge the phaecian youth at
        boxing, wrestling or running; flay, skin, cut up and cook an ox, and be
        moved to tears by a song.  he
        is in fact an excellent all-rounder; he has surpassing arête.
"arête
        implies a respect for the wholeness or oneness of life, and a consequent
        dislike of specialization.  it implies a contempt for efficiency--or rather a much higher
        idea of efficiency which exits not in one department of life but in life
        itself."
