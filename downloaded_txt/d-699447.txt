 a letter of intent was signed with the united nations office on drugs and crime (unodc) regional office for south asia (rosa), in new delhi on august 28th, 2008. on the occasion mrs. puri said, “for a woman to live life with dignity, economic empowerment is very crucial, especially to enable her to come out of domestic violence and to protest against other crimes". 
 even in modern day today, the sad fact is women have very few rights in the indian society. injustice, violation of human rights and exploitation still prevail in the everyday reality of indian women. they have been systematically oppressed for centuries.
 the angel! foundation was launched in london in 2012 to generate awareness within the south asian community. it now has a significant presence as an established charity in new delhi and london.















about us










angeli kapoor puri 
founder and chairperson



angeli kapoor puri founded the angel! foundation to fight the cause of female foeticide and crimes against women. a letter of intent was signed with the united nations office on drugs and crime (unodc) regional office for south asia (rosa), in new delhi on august 28th, 2008.
the angel! foundation has been creating awareness against female foeticide by organizing street theatres in the urban slums of new delhi.
whilst working with underprivileged women & children in the urban slums angeli kapoor puri said: "i found that the girl child was severely under nourished & neglected. parents in the slums have limited resources hence they feed the boys & ignore the girls. it is sad to see that a girl child is still treated in this manner. there is nothing more satisfying for me than saving the life of a girl child. in most indian homes girls are still considered a burden on family resources."
angeli kapoor puri, the founder of the angel! foundation received the global indian karmaveer puraskaar for her outstanding work in social service.
