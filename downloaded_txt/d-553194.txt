so sad ...





i'm sad ... really ... really sad. i lost my handphone last thursday. the last time i recall using my handphone was; i put it on top of my hard disc to recharge it. i always doing that and never lost it before. i strongly believe that my colleague will never do that to me... it's cleaner that i suspect did it but i don't have any evidence.the only hope is going to the cctv room to see who the culprite is but hopeless because the cctv that install in my office is not functioning yet. such a stupid management. what for they keep on putting the notice here and there saying that the entire place was cover by cctv but actually is not. the only hope that i was spoil and i'm sure that i can't get my handphone back.every time i try to find a new phone on the handphone shop... but whenever i saw the same brand with my handphone i feel very sad. until now i haven't get any to replace it. it is not only the phone that i treasure much but the think that store inside ... like family & friend contact, all the important messages and my family picture inside.i hope and pray hard that one day the culprit will get the same thing that i have face now... being lost on the think that you love and treasure most.

paul's rr is completed !!





i received paul's rr from vero last week. he chooses dragon from dragon dreams design as his theme and paul is so kind to attach the kreinik floss together for us to easy stitch. so this is what i’ve stitch. i choose “dragon of air” because most of the thread being use is blue. blue is my favorite color.it just takes me less then 3 days to finish it. the funny thing when i finish this rr is .. most of my family and friends say that it is a seahorse and doesn’t look like dragon … lol. what ever it is … i’ve done my part and thanks to paul for choosing this theme to enable me to have a chance to stitch dragon dreams design. i think i’ll stitch the other 3 dragons again for my own collection … *wink.anyone who interested with this chart can get it here. it's free.

marquoir du jardin in 56 parts





for those who love to stitch marquoir ...here is the marquoir of the garden. http://squarenews.blogs.com/linsanslautre/one part per week ..now, two parts is currently available.the full chart features 5 alphabets and several border sections.it's not a mystery.all instructions are available in both french and english.(no fussing with translation engines!)it's charted for 5 shades of each of two colors ...use the designer's suggested or easily pick your own.  i think it could also be readily stitched with two variegated flosses.

done ...





tea cup samplerthis is what i have done for vero's rr. at first i don't like this tea cup and i though i choose a wrong one to stitch. after finish stitching, the color is so light and not cheerful at all. i feel boring. but no choice … i have to finish it … i start back stitch the cup and outer edge of the plate … i get excited. the piece turn out alive ... i mean .. look more real .... *wink. then i can’t wait to finish the backstitch for the leaves and lastly the vines … after everything is done … i was so happy.. happy .. happy .. not believe me .. then have a look … but i guess the real piece look more beautiful compare to pic.floss tagsecondly, i want to show my first try on floss tag. i saw a lot of stitcher making floss tag. so i decided to try out one. it’s fun, easy to make and finish very fast. i finished it with my way because i couldn’t find eyelet tool and puncher here. anyway, the result is not so bad … :)now .. i have to start stitch my rose sampler for part 10, 11 & 12 while waiting vero to send paul's rr to me.till then, have a nice weekend everyone. don't forget to come back and visit me.
