lenape ceramic towel bars, ceramic soap dishes, tp holders, corner shelves, robe hooks, toothbrush holders. we have offered lenape since 2001. sorry to say, ac products, our dominate line from 2009-2023 went out of business in nov. 2022. we still have a bit of their stock, but not a lot. we cannot order any more, they are gone. but we have lenape. and lenape has revived a few of the ac products items. we still have a bit of stock on the acp stoneware collection too. whether you are fixing one item in a bathroom, remodeling your whole bathroom, or building it new, ceramic bath hardware is popular! it can get wet, it doesn't fade, it color coordinates. we also have solid surface (corian) bath hardware: shower caddies and corner shelves. and we have glass shelf brackets and glass shelf kits from expo design. a few granite corner shelves on closeout too.

there are hundreds of manufacturers worldwide that make cabinet pulls. we showcase under a dozen of them. but what we have is pretty darn cool. metal and glass custom pulls, corian pulls, wildlife themes, forest themes, ocean themes, high end elegant handles, mainstream pulls, mosaic pulls, multiple length series of handles, appliance handles, etc. some manufacturers have small concise collections. a few offer too much to summarize in one paragraph or picture.
