sorry about the obscure post, but i just remembered the times when i was hypnotized as a child in front of the purple weather channel screens with sometimes-cheesy music.  i decided to look on youtube and lo-and-behold, there seemed to be a community of weather channel geeks, even giving answers to what songs were being played in most of the clips.  it's not too much fun to look at, other than nostalgia, but sometimes the music's good.oh and i got a droids album and dirty space disco tracks i want to put up, hopefully late tonight, after getting off work.  so, it's not always gonna be weird like this hah.-matt, the weird kid who'd watch the weather channel when he was a kid and when the weather channel was still all about weather!  hah.  enjoy yo' saturday everyone.

...that sounds like mr. do samples.  this is the "fountains of light" album by starcastle.  their name fits the music. starcastle - "fountains"  starcastle - "dawning of the day"  starcastle - "silver winds" starcastle - "true to the light" starcastle - "portraits" starcastle - "diamond song"my next post will be more varied, promise.  listen to "silver winds" on a bangin'(?) system.  pretty darn cool.  get the vinyl if you can, or cd.  i doubt if it's sold these days heh, awesome stuff.
