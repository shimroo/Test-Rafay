our process




1. assess and define:
				triad's experts will first meet with you to obtain a solid understanding of your immediate business need and long-term goals.  from this initial needs-assessment, triad will collaborate with you on a comprehensively defined web-based solution that meets your immediate needs and gives you the flexibility to adapt to your ever-changing landscape. 
				


2. implement:
				triad's experienced technology professionals will then bring your fully defined solution to fruition. having worked with large corporations and organizations for many years, triad understands that changes happen more often than not.  depending on the scale and type of web-based system being developed, triad may or may not use agile principles for our development process.  but with every client we've worked with, we know that changes inevitably come and we excel at adapting to our clients' ever-changing needs.
				


 3. deployment:
				once your web-based system has been built, tested, and accepted by you, triad is here to assist you with its launch and beyond.  we can either package up your product for hosting in your environment, providing assistance to your it team with its proper setup, or you can host your system in triad's secure cloud-based hosting environment.  regardless, triad can provide on-going support and help make future system enhancements when needed.
