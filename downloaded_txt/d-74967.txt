kudzu
known as "the vine that ate the south,"
kudzu is very much present in hemingway. the vine is not all bad,
however.  it is very pretty, it feeds our pollinators in late
summer when there is not much feed available for them, and it has quite
a few uses. it can be used as a food, for medicinal purposes, or for
basket weaving.
the
amazing story of kudzu

shark's
teeth
found at indiantown approximately 10 feet below ground,
in dug material from a pond, position thought to be at the surface 
of the black mingo formation, or possibly the pee dee
formation.




the "good ole
days" weren't...
gone
are the days of blisters and sore backs from picking cotton. the cotton
harvest  in south carolina is the "new fashioned" way...with a
cotton picker that doesn't have aches and pains.










hemingway's
annual bbq-shag festival: held in
april each year, it features the barbecue cookoff, shagging (the state
dance), local foods, crafts, carnival rides and much more. thousands come from the eastern
united states for some mighty good eating, music, dance, and games. if
you haven't been to a southern "pig pickin'," y'all don't know
barbeque.

it is little known that the hemingway area is also the honeybee capital
of south carolina. from hemingway and the pee dee area, a number
of  beekeepers supply honeybees for pollination
of millions of dollars worth of watermelons, cucumbers, cantaloupes,
squash, kiwifruit, apples, peaches and other crops that need bees.
south carolina and florida provide the two main wintering grounds for
east coast migratory beekeepers, which are vital to america's food
supply.
