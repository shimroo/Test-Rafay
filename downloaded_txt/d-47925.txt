recor's paradise renal denervation system
gets fda approval
the paradise rdn system had been approved for the ce mark in europe over a decade ago, as have several other systems from medtronic, et al, but this is the first system that has received approval to be marketed in the u.s.
















new shockwave ivl catheter to debut at tct 2023
shockwave medical, will be introducing their latest iteration of the intravascular lithotripsy catheter, the c2+, just approved by the u.s. fda. the c2+ provides 50% more pulses and "will be an added benefit of ivl for optimally treating complex calcium, including more diffuse disease, as well as nodular and thick, eccentric calcium."
















medtronic's evolut fx tavi system gets ce mark
medtronic today announced that its latest iteration of the evolut tavi/tavr system, the evolut fx, has received the ce mark. although medical devices often are approved in europe prior to us approval, the evolut fx did the opposite: it garnered us fda approval two years ago. today's announcement means that this newest and most advanced transcatheter platform for treating severe aortic stenosis will now be available in europe and beyond. 
















"it's time!" say 4 cardiology orgs regarding changes to the process of physician certification
they no longer wish to be subject to certification by the american board of internal medicine (abim) & are addressing the long-standing complaints of a wide range of cardiologists who claim that the certification requirements of abim are not in any way related to their day-to-day practice, are needlessly time-consuming, and are expensive.
















fda approves boston scientific's watchman flx pro left atrial appendage closure device
designed to further advance the procedural performance and safety of the watchman technology, indicated to reduce stroke risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (nvaf) who need an alternative to oral anticoagulation therapy, the device now features a polymer coating, visualization markers and a broader size matrix to treat a wider range of patients. 
















interview with dr. b. clay sizemore about calcium modification with ivl in hospitals that do not have surgical backup
in this interview, dr. sizemore discusses how intravascular lithotripsy (ivl) has been a game-changer for patients with significant calcified lesions -- that instead of having to transport them to a distant hospital, he is able to safely and efficaciously treat them in thomasville, georgia.
















shockwave: dual announcements at europcr --  improved catheter & 1st patient enrolled in all-female empower study
the company introduced to the international market their latest iteration of the calcium-cracking coronary catheter: the c2+ which affords greater numbers of pulses to treat longer and more challenging lesions. additionally shockwave announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the empower study of the treatment of calcified lesions in women.
















medtronic receives fda approval for its next generation micra leadless pacing systems
with approximately 40% more battery life compared to previous generations, the median projected battery life of micra av2 and micra vr2 is nearly 16 and 17 years, respectively. this means more than 80% of patients who receive a micra are projected to only need one device for life.
















three-year results of medtronic's evolut tavr compared to surgery in low risk patients
presented at acc
the 3-year comparative data for medtronic's corevalve/evolut tavr vs. savr for low risk patients that were presented at today's late-breaking clinical trials session were much needed and the results showed that this device compared favorably with surgery and, in some respects, was superior.
















new data show superiority of abbott's triclip device compared to medical therapy for tricuspid regurgitation
late-breaking data demonstrated triclip was superior to medical therapy with significant improvements in quality of life and tricuspid regurgitation (tr). findings show triclip, an investigational device in the u.s. to treat a leaky tricuspid valve, demonstrated safety and met the primary endpoint.
















medtronic corevalve/evolut durability bests savr at 5-years
data were presented in a late-breaking clinical trial session at crt 2023 by dr. steven yakubov: "these results add yet another proof point demonstrating the durability benefits of tavr compared to surgery when it comes to bioprosthetic valve dysfunction  a complication that can impact the durability and performance of a critical valve replacement."
















updated scai guidance includes coronary ivl as a treatment option in all u.s. catheterization labs regardless of surgical backup status
shockwave medical, inc. announced that coronary ivl was included in a treatment guidance document published by the society of cardiovascular angiography and intervention (scai) as a potential therapeutic option in all u.s. catheterization labs. - including facilities without on-site surgical backup.
















spyral htn-on med study demonstrates meaningful clinical benefits consistent with other spyral htn renal denervation trials
at the american heart association (aha) scientific sessions 2022, medtronic announced the six-month results from the full cohort of the spyral htn-on med clinical trial. with this news, the final module of the symplicity spyral premarket approval (pma) package has been submitted to the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for review and approval.
















shockwave medical initiates all-female coronary ivl study
empower cad is the 1st prospective, female-only study of coronary interventions. the study seeks to confirm benefits of shockwaves coronary ivl in females who historically have suffered less favorable clinical outcomes than male patients with traditional therapies. the study is headed by two female co-principal investigators, drs. alexandra lansky and margaret mcentegart, and will have a prevalence of female site investigators in the u.s. and europe.
















"the whole story is about increasing patient happiness."
interview
                  with dr. ferdinand kiemeneij
in this two-part 20th anniversary interview, the "father of transradial intervention, " talks about the history and future of tri.

patients are talking about...










i had radial angiography 2 days ago...it was a fascinating experience and was able to watch part of the procedure. i feel fantastic, have no "heart ache" or any problems with my arm.
i can't afford my post-stenting meds, where can i find help paying for plavix or effient?
i'm 64. after 4 stents and 2 heart attacks since dec. 2008, i'm as physically active or more so than ever.  i plan to hit 4,000 miles on my bike this year. i've hiked/climbed at 13,000 feet.

                    at 40: 2017
                      marked the 40th anniversary of coronary angioplasty.  in
                      1977 in zurich, switzerland, a young physician named andreas
                      gruentzig inserted a catheter into a patient's
                      coronary artery and inflated a tiny balloon, successfully
                      opening a blockage and restoring blood flow to a human
                      heart. 




today over
                      two million coronary angioplasties are
                      performed worldwide each year and angioplasty has become the gold standard for emergency heart attack treament.
