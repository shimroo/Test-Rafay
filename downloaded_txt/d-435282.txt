understanding hereditary bleeding disorders
            

bleeding disorders are a group of conditions that result when the blood cannot clot properly. as a result, people with bleeding disorders experience extended bleeding after injury, menstruation, trauma, or surgery, and in many situations depending on the severity, spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles, or other parts of their bodies.

improper clotting results from defects in blood components, such as clotting proteins and/or platelets. the body produces 13 different clotting proteins, also called clotting factors. if any of these clotting factors are missing or not working properly, a bleeding disorder can result. bleeding disorders are quite rare, and some bleeding disorders such as hemophilia, can be congenital (hereditary) or acquired. congenital bleeding disorders are caused by defects or damage in the genes and are present at birth. they can be inherited or appear due to a genetic mutation. acquired bleeding disorders are those that develop after birth or spontaneously occur in the individual.

treatment varies, depending on the condition and its severity. for some bleeding disorders, there are treatments that can be taken at home to prevent or treat bleeds. with appropriate education and treatment, people with bleeding disorders can live full and productive lives.








over 300,000

						people have bleeding disorders
					


30%

						of people with hemophilia have no family history of it
					


1 in 100

						people are born with von willebrand disease
