what guests
have been saying







bennington properties went over and above any service we have experienced in the 40 years we have been renting homes in vacation areas.

laurie hynson




bennington properties made our family trip at christmas spectacular! when there was a problem with our original rental, jessica found us several comparable options to choose from and then later offered us a free upgrade when our choice wasn’t available. the house we ended up in was clean, well appointed, and super convenient to everything. check-in/out was also super easy. lastly, when the rental’s has fireplace suddenly stopped working on christmas eve, i made a quick call to the management company and they sent a maintenance technician to fix it within the hour! we had such a wonderful experience and would happily rent from bennington properties again.

veronica wagner

stephanie roberts




truly enjoy the vacation rental experience with bennington. great communication,  clean homes with thoughtful touches and easy check in/out procedures are just a few of the reasons we choose bennington when we visit sunriver.

shawn edwards




bennington is always our go to for lodging in sunriver. we have never had a complaint of any kind. clean comfortable homes, excellent service and wonderful for traveling with the pups. during covid we had to cancel two trips and they were kind and helpful in rescheduling. we are so glad to be back and appreciate the efforts they go to helping visitors stay safe and have a great time!

jeff paul




delightful to work with and so welcoming, they really go above and beyond giving a new meaning to pet friendly too. have stayed in the past, we have another vacation booked with them for next month, and will definitely stay for other future trips.



i have been vacationing annually in sr for many years. bennington properties is hands down the best property management company in sr. it's like being in disneyland; they make sure all of the little details are taken care of and that you have everything you need or want to make your stay as memorable and comfortable as possible. the staff is friendly, warm and accommodating. i have used other property management companies in the past and will never go back. my dogs and i highly recommend bennington properties.



5 star. beautiful, clean and cozy home in sunriver. very impressed with the staff and great communication. will definitely come again.



we have stayed in bennington properties vacation rentals a few times over the years and the cabins are always clean, well-maintained and well-stocked. we especially like how pet-friendly they are because we like to bring our dogs with us on vacation. they make it really easy to be relaxed and comfortable. we highly recommend and will stay with bennington properties again.
