tss' 25th anniversary: the sonic stadium "version 3" design has been added to the timewarp


						


dreadknux posted a blog entry in sonic stadium blog, february 3


we're into month 2 of the sonic stadium's 25th anniversary, and to keep the festivities going i'm happy to announce an update to our timewarp section, with a (re)release of a classic design from one of our past eras. you can now browse version 3 of the 'stadium, first launched in mid-2001 and existed through to october that same year (yes, this site went through a lot of designs in the early years).
