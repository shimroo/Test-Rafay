quick. reliable. affordable.
for markets such as primary care and cardiology  hokanson makes reliable and simple to use non-invasive vascular assessment tools that help inform clinical decisions. 
for endocrinologists, specifically focused on diabetes, looking at blood flow in the legs and feet can be fast and easy.  utilizing the toe pressure kit from hokanson physicians can “see” what is happening in the vessels.  these results can be obtained immediately.  no need to refer your patient to the vascular lab leading to faster assessment and higher examination compliance.
for wound care professionals it is critical to assess blood flow to the area to ensure proper healing.   good blood flow means healthy healing; whereas poor circulation can limit the ability to heal and could lead to gangrenous tissue, amputation and/or systemic infection.

repeatable. accurate. tested.
in 1973 d. eugene hokanson began building instruments and accessories for vascular research and clinical testing at the seattle veterans affairs hospital and the university of washington medical center.  these instruments used pulse wave and continuous wave doppler technology, photo/pneumo/strain gauge plethysmography, specialized blood pressure cuffs, and blood pressure cuff inflators in order to facilitate groundbreaking peripheral vascular physiological testing. over time, hokanson has continued its commitment to research by developing and introducing computerized instrumentation for noninvasive blood flow testing and vascular disease diagnosis in human limbs. hokanson products have stood the test of time with their unbeatable durability and accuracy for clinical researchers.
