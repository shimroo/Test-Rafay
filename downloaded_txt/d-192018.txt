mrs taylor




thank you for looking after me so well. 






peter




great service, great prices and a great set up! 






mark




i just got a new set of tyres from elite. as promised the tyre noise is much reduced with less vibration.
service was excellent and friendly. i highly recommend them. 






finn j




got road hero space saver wheel kit from them. although was a bit sceptical as it seemed like an extra cost at the time but trust me, i have never regretted this purchase. it has saved me from being stranded so many times. thanks to their friendly staff who convinced me for this purchase. 






penny
