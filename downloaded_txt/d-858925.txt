pb&j latest notes:



‘fall into dance’ is fallen!
because of the necessity for physical distancing* in the current pandemic.
dance at home with your family!

*dancing is the opposite of physical distancing; we learn to work closely, safely, and joyously with our classmates and friends. now is the time for dancing solos in the backyard or the living room! join us for a zoom dance session on dec 3rd at 5:30pm (see above)
we look forward to dancing with you when the circumstances permit in the future!

 first light celebration november 2019   in the sprint store window in
coolidge corner, 301 harvard st, brookline
