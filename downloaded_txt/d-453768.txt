we are bases. we help empower the next generation of stanford entrepreneurs.who we are meet our team





bases – business association of stanford entrepreneurial students – is at the heart of student entrepreneurship.as one of the premier student entrepreneurship organizations in the world, bases empowers the next generation of makers, designers, artists, engineers, and entrepreneurial leaders. we collaborate with exceptional students, prominent professors, and thought leaders to bridge the worlds of innovation, academia, and industry. each year, we fund stanford startups through our annual startup challenge, bring entrepreneurs from around the globe to campus via our entrepreneurial thought leaders seminar, and host other campus-wide events such as the startup career fair, frosh battalion program, and hackspace demo day.



 our philosophy













challenge assumptionswe view the world with fresh eyes. where others see problems and inefficiencies, we see puzzles and opportunities. we combine creativity, problem solving, and hard work to bring great ideas into fruition.













say it. mean it. do it.we communicate effectively, early, and honestly about what we need and what we’re planning to do; we make conscious and willing decisions and follow through with our commitments; we get down and dirty - we're scrappy, efficient, and take initiative.













bases familyabove all else, bases is a family. we are willing and eager to lend a hand to other members. we always seek to give our community fulfilling experiences. we work to push each other to grow as well-rounded intellectuals, friends, and entrepreneurs.
