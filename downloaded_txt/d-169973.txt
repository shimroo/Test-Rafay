news and articles




dear members,it is with great sadness that we share the passing of hollis rinehart, a long-standing and cherished member of the north toronto croquet club. hollis was a dedicated croquet enthusiast and a true friend to so many within our community.for many years, hollis served on the club's executive as vice president and director, contributing his time, expertise, and passion to the growth and success of the club. beyond his leadership, he was always generous in sharing his knowledge, guiding new members, and forming enduring friendships as a playing partner.hollis lived a full life, recently reaching the remarkable age of 93. he was predeceased by his beloved wife lenore (1942–2018), whom he met during her time as a fellow educator at york university. hollis is survived by his daughter, hildreth, and two grandchildren. jim wright (president, croquet canada and long-time president of nt) shared his memories:he was the croquet champ of vermont!we never found out exactly when hollis rinehart reigned, but champion was an impressive enough title that for a long time hollis was our 6 wicket go-to-guy at the north toronto croquet club.  it was hollis and wife lenore with a small but faithful group that also kept 6 wicket croquet alive at nt.his tall lanky frame supported his accurate shots and a strategic mind. hollis was a retired professor of english at york university, but it was his generous guidance on a croquet court that earned him the gratitude of many new players. his summer residence in vermont sported its own croquet field….and a literal field it was. the hay was cut short but winning at croquet depended on lucky bounces as much as it did precision. returning to toronto for the other three seasons, hollis and wife lenore were long-time and loyal members of the north toronto. it was hollis who provided a senior’s perspective to toronto city counsel arguing to save north toronto croquet when the tennis club was threatening to take us over.  now, he and his wife lenore are gone; lenore first just before covid, and this past friday, hollis passed on having reached the very respectable age of 93. he played until this past year when his diminishing skills and waning endurance forced him to retire from the club. it in turn, awarded him an honorary membership that recognized his contribution of many years to our game. his daughter hildreth has plans for a memorial gathering in the spring. in the meantime, we remember a true gentleman who will be missed by his family, and so many friends he gathered over the years from his wide range of interests. these include his folk singing and book club, but especially croquet. we will remember his gentle demeanour, his quiet intensity and his kind soul. we extend our deepest condolences to hildreth and the entire rinehart family during this time. hollis’s contributions to our club and the friendships he nurtured will always be remembered fondly.
