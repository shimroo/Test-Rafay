our 2024 impacts!








































haw river assembly is a 501(c)(3) non-profit.  we were founded in 1982 to restore and protect the haw river and jordan lake. we are building a watershed community to support that effort.Â  there are eight counties  that are part of the haw river watershed:Â  guilford, rockingham,  caswell, alamance, orange, chatham, durham and western wake. our missionour mission is to promote environmental awareness, conservation and  pollution prevention; to speak as a voice for the river in the public  arena; and to put into peoplesâ hands the tools and the knowledge they  need to be effective guardians of the river.Â  our haw riverkeeper  advocates for clean water and against threats to the river.the haw river assembly is dedicated to the goal of environmental  justice and equality for all people in our watershed.Â  the haw river  assembly is a stronger organization and our work to protect water is  more successful when our organization represents the full diversity of  people living in our watershed.Â  we believe all people should have  access to enjoyment of the natural world and a voice in decisions that  may affect their environment and/or health.Â  no group of people should  bear a disproportionate share of negative environmental consequences  resulting from industrial activities or governmental policies that  situate polluting activities in their community.



our work is made possible by the efforts and support of our members and volunteers! join us today!
