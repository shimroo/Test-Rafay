perpetualfree for educationterragen 4terragen 4 is a powerful solution for building, rendering, and animating realistic natural environments.create entire worlds from your imagination, or import real world terrain data sets and use terragen to create the most realistic visualizations possible. you control the weather, landscape, rivers, lakes and oceans, suns, moons and stars. with terragen you have complete control over the shader networks used for terrains, textures, micropolygon displacements, clouds and object distributions. you can reorganize the planetary shading pipeline to suit your goals. place grass and trees wherever you want, as well as other objects in native tgo or obj format.terragen has been used for visual effects in countless feature films as well as numerous major tv productions, game development, vr environments, museum exhibits, documentaries, and more. some of the largest and most respected visual effects companies in the industry rely on terragen, including digital domain, industrial light & magic, weta digital, scanline vfx, mpc, and many more. terragen’s powerful displacement and atmospherics engines have a reputation for accurate, photo realistic environments featuring detailed terrains, physically-based volumetric skies, and massive populations of instanced geometry. we have continued to improve these core strengths for terragen 4, producing new creative options and render capabilities, improved performance, and enhanced workflows. terrains create and manipulate highly realistic terrains based on procedural or heightfield data. replicate real-world terrains by loading existing heightfields, or go beyond the limits of heightfields by enhancing them with procedurals to create cliffs and overhangs. seamlessly combine the benefits of both terrain types in one scene, achieving global-scale terrain of nearly infinite detail, from the smallest pebble, to the largest mountains. read more clouds “easy cloud” models correspond to real-world cloud types such as altocumulus, cirrocumulus and others. for more control, terragen’s node system allows you to create virtually any type of cloud, from wispy stratus to cirrus, billowing cumulus, towering thunderheads, mist and fog. shading models simulate multiple scattering effects, resulting in cloud renderings that can be indistinguishable from photos. read more lighting and atmosphere terragen 4’s physically based atmosphere model simulates not only the common rayleigh and mie scattering properties, but also the effects of ozone. terragen provides all the flexibility you’ll need to light your scenes. realistic sunlight(s), local, and spot light sources can illuminate anything, and cast ray traced soft shadows. global illumination enables full lighting interaction between surfaces, atmospheres and clouds. read more planetary scale built around a full planet model, both large and small-scale detail is possible in the same scene. seamlessly and easily drop down from orbit to a realistically detailed ground level terrain. read more import & export import terrains, texture maps, 3d models, cameras and light sources. export volumetric clouds (vdbs), terrains
