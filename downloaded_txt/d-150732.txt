stanley donwood   
|   ‘avert’, ’borealis’, ‘realistic’ and ‘teeth’



february 13th 2025


raising awareness about issues of greater importance, stanley donwood achieved acclaim as a young graduate through his work; whether it was art, books or music. the early association with the rock band, radiohead, paved the way for a wider public recognition and has allowed donwood to stay committed to his activist beliefs, developing a genre of graphic landscape art unique to him, often charged with messages. from the archive of works for the studio album ‘kid a’, avert, borealis, realistic and teeth feature amongst donwood’s earliest print editions; four editions starring at the ‘cover up’ exhibition at eyestorm in the spring of 2007.

lucie bennett   
|   ‘delphine’, ‘marianne’ and ‘romy’



november 28th 2024


presenting three french girls into her cast of savvy and confident females, lucie bennett introduced the ‘naked burgundies’ on a london spring evening. the strong feminine sexuality - one that confronts the audience - is apparent in many of bennett’s work; at other times her female subjects are portrayed in a private moment of contemplation, seemingly oblivious to the viewer’s gaze. bennett’s controlled, sensual lines and her conscious use of a refined burgundy palette in the burgundy nudes, embraces delphine, marianne and romy in flattering warm, dark red hues.

jacky tsai   
|   ‘stained glass skull’ and ‘cloisonné skull’



november 02nd 2024


reflecting on a life experience spanning two uniquely different cultures, jacky tsai brings opposing concepts head to head. in his works, the artist fuses traditional eastern motifs with western pop-art imagery, often exploring old craftmanship before infusing them with his own contemporary and humourous twists. zebras, cooling fans and space rockets float in landscapes alongside cranes and beds of flowering peonies; and in the two print editions, stained glass skull and  cloisonné skull, tsai expands on two crafts of the past, presenting new versions of his famous floral skull.

hamish fulton   
|   ‘leave only footsteps, take only photographs’



september 03rd 2024


an artist among walkers, and a walker among artists, hamish fulton is an outlandish and inspiring figure. for several decades he has embarked on short walks and demanding ones of up to 50 miles a day, depending on the terrain, and in all weathers. from soho to saskatchewan, from his home in kent to the peaks of nepal, he has trekked, hiked and trudged the world in small groups in solitude. his object is to unite two apparently incongruous activities: walking and art. a series of print editions from the turn of the millennium invites the viewer to join fulton on four walks covering three continents.

john simpson   
|   ‘omega and the bear’



august 07th 2024


studying the historic and organic relationship between humans and animals, john simpson reflects on what at times seems to be a long lost bond. in his drawings, the artist’s references to classical antiquity, folklore and beliefs are plentiful; returning to scenes from the tale of actaeon and artemis, and other intriguing, mythological encounters. the serigraph, omega and the bear, elaborates on a series of lithographs by edvard munch, and through his signature monochrome palette, simpson takes control of the narrative and leads the viewer into a philosophical story of related beings.

jeff koons   |   ‘loopy’, ‘cut-out’ and ‘hair’










renowned for his flawless stainless-steel sculptures of balloon dogs, solitaire diamond rings and shaped hearts, jeff koons takes everyday objects and represents them as art icons. with themes of banality, mass-appeal and consumerism - and arguably greater showmanship - the artist has become one of today’s most successful contemporary artists. from his break-through in the new york art scene in the mid-eighties, koons devoted himself to bold and controversial projects, one so grand and ambitious that it took decades to complete. the complexity of ‘celebration’ eventually led to the series ‘easyfun’ in 1999; a body of work bringing back childish simplicity.
