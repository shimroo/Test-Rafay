tis a mistake to think this fault [tyranny] is proper only to monarchies; other forms of government are liable to it, as well as that. for where-ever the power that is put in any hands for the government of the people, and the preservation of their properties, is applied to other ends, and made use of to impoverish, harass, or subdue them to the arbitrary and irregular commands of those that have it: there it presently becomes tyranny, whether those that thus use it are one or many.

the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. his own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.
john stuart mill
 
liberty not only means that the individual has both the opportunity and the burden of choice; it also means that he must bear the consequences of his actions. liberty and responsibility are inseparable.
friedrich august von hayek

 




 
what our generation has forgotten is that the system of private property is the most important guarantee of freedom, not only for those who own property, but scarcely less for those who do not. it is only because the control of the means of production is divided among many people acting independently that nobody has complete power over us, that we as individuals can decide what to do with ourselves.
friedrich august von hayek
 
the vocabulary of the political left is fascinating. for example, it is considered to be 'materialistic' and 'greedy' to want to keep what you have earned. but it is 'idealistic' to want to take away what someone else has earned and spend it for your own political benefit or to feel good about yourself.

if there is no struggle, there is no progress. those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. they want rain without thunder and lightning. they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. this struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle.

i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country... corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed.

our government, national and state, must be freed from the sinister influence or control of special interests. exactly as the special interests of cotton and slavery threatened our political integrity before the civil war, so now the great special business interests too often control and corrupt the men and methods of government for their own profit. we must drive the special interests out of politics.

of all the contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind, none has been more effective than that which deludes them with paper money.
daniel webster
 
it is the people who constitute the basis of government credit. why then cannot the people have benefit of their own gilt-edge credit by receiving non-interest bearing currency-instead of bankers receiving the benefit of the people's credit in interest-bearing bonds. if the united states government will adopt this policy of increasing its national wealth without contributing to the interest collector-for the whole national debt is made up on interest charges-then you will see an era of progress and prosperity in this country such as could never have come otherwise.

this federal reserve act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth. when the president (wilson) signs this bill the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalized. charles august lindbergh
 
despite these warnings, woodrow wilson signed the 1913 federal reserve act. a few years later he wrote: “i am a most unhappy man. i have unwittingly ruined my country. a great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. our system of credit is concentrated. the growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. we have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.”

the truth is the federal reserve board has usurped the government of the united states. it controls everything here and it controls all our foreign relations. it makes and breaks government at will. louis thomas mcfadden
 
when the federal reserve act was passed, the people of these united states did not perceive that a world banking system was being set up here. a super-state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure. every effort has been made by the fed to conceal its powers but the truth is - the fed has usurped the government!!louis thomas mcfadden
 



 




 “… our whole monetary system is dishonest, as it is debt-based… we did not vote for it. it grew upon us gradually but markedly since 1971 when the commodity-based system was abandoned.”
the earl of caithnes, in a speech to the house of lords, 1997.
 

 

when the federal government spends more each year than it collects in tax revenues, it has three choices: it can raise taxes, print money, or borrow money. while these actions may benefit politicians, all three options are bad for average americans.

what's happening is there's transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy. this comes about because of the monetary system that we have. when you inflate a currency or destroy a currency, the middle class gets wiped out, so the people who get to use the money first, which is created by the federal reserve system, benefit, so the money gravitates to the banks and to wall street. that's why you have more billionaires than ever before.
ron paul
 

 
we in the congress have a moral and constitutional obligation to protect the value of the dollar and to understand why it is so important to the economy that a central bank not be given the unbelievable power of inflating a currency at will and pretending that it knows how to fine-tune an economy through this counterfeit system of money.
