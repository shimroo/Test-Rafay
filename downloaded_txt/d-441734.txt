"there is not a day that goes by that i am not complemented on my bright and beautiful smile and i have you, your wonderful staff and invisalign to thank for that. from the bottom of my heart thank you dr. hodgins."


















pam d.
" i am not afraid to talk to people, apply for a job or smile. i couldn’t do any of those things a year ago... it was hard to break the habits of having to hide that horrific mouth but i think i have done it. the old pam is back!!"


















terry m.
"[dr. hodgins] has changed my life. i cannot express enough what a joy it is to be able to smile again. for example, i can actually smile in family photos! that was something i was really looking forward to."
