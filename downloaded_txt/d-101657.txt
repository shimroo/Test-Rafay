upcoming workshops



the prose poem: a workshop with william archila

saturday, march 1511:00 am - 2:00 pm pt
in this workshop we will attempt to write prose poems, a marriage between the lyric and narrative between the image and discourse. to paraphrase william blake, contraries need each other to exist, just like the narrative and the lyric need each other in the prose poem. we will look at examples of baudelaire, simic & forche, to name a few, and focus on its economy and surprising element. we will then close our circle of prose and poetry by generating our own prose poems.
 




en-chant-ment: a generative poetry porkshop with sarah maclay

saturday, march 2211:00 am - 2:00 pm pt
ready to give yourself an inner break? to create a little bubble of temporary sanity? in this generative workshop with sarah maclay, weâll come to understand the link between the middle syllable of the word âenchantmentâ and a key craft technique that has ties to meditative practices and that, in the right hands, can further the sense of magical engagement that the word implies, as well as a temporary suspension from our more distracting and vexing inner narratives.

proxy gallery presents: phyllis greenfebruary 1 - march 15, 2025
proxy gallery is happy to present phyllis greenâs june 2024. modeled from earthenware clay and colored with copper metallic surfacer and patina, the work nods to conventional busts and traditional techniques. over the years green has presented clothing without bodies, i.e. costumes for a constructed
persona, hair without heads, boobs without torsos, masks without faces. it is as if the revelation
of something is much less meaningful for her than the revelation of something not there. this is
another way to say that form is singularly foregrounded in her sculptures. for more information visit proxy gallery online here.

 new arrivals include our new tote bags, zip bags, journals, candles, and of course, our classic metaphors be with you shirt. all proceeds support beyond baroque programming! visit our shop here beyond-baroque.square.site
