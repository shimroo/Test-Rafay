show your cards for disaster preparedness on november 16th!

posted on november 12, 2024  by  rsca 


each year in november, rsca promotes safety preparedness with the emergency preparedness month. you can read this month’s issue of the pilot for a number of tips and recommendations to ready your home and your family in case of a sudden disaster. 
 
as part of emergency preparedness month, rsca also provides all homes and businesses in redwood shores with a red/green disaster signal card designed to help emergency responders quickly assess who needs immediate help and who is ok, in a disaster scenario, and for use in drills occasionally.  this year, it was printed in the center page of the pilot, so you can tear it out and keep it (…and hopefully never need the red side). please keep this card where you can locate it quickly. also keep tape nearby so that you can quickly put it where it can be seen clearly from the street. this may be in a front window or on your front or garage door depending on the layout of your particular neighborhood. if you need assistance, this card will help get the quickest response. the card should not be displayed year-round.
 

“show your cards” drill on november 16th!
on saturday, november 16th, rsca and local volunteers will be running a drill to practice home checks of card use.
