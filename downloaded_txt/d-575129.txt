an observation, not an announcement





this blog is dead.in truth, it has been stone-dead for months, and perilously ill for several years before that. i have to admit that the so-called 'teabag' movement in the usa did accelerate its decline, but there were other factors at work too.i'd like to think that, once upon a time, tampon teabag was quite an entertaining place, in a disgusting sort of way. well, i enjoyed it anyway. so thanks to everyone who read, linked, lurked, commented, or contributed (yes, david duff included). three editors even had such good taste as to lift posts from it into book-form.the good news is that i'm not dead. at least i don't think i am. i believe myself still to be around. if you'd like to know what i'm up to, do get in touch.
