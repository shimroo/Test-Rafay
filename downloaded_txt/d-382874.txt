personalized service, rooted in quality

north branch nursery, inc. was started in 1982 by tom oberhouse, as a christmas tree farm. his first office was a 10×16 shed made out of dynamite boxes. that shed is still on the property, serving as a reminder of how far the business has expanded.
today, the nursery spans over 300 acres. we carry a variety of trees, shrubs and perennials. our production department maintains over 60 greenhouses for container shrubs and perennials. in addition to selling locally grown plants, we offer full-service landscape design and installation services as well as a complete garden center.
