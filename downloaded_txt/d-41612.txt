blue water maritime represents over thirty supply vessels, barges and tugs, landing craft, and passenger ferries in the caribbean area.  vessel charters are "time charters" sealed with a charter party contract. the charter can be to move bulk cargo like vehicles or concrete block or it could be to arrange a special delivery to an unusual location. it can be for use as background in a movie set or as a camera platform. sometimes time charters are made because rapid delivery is very important. please call us about your caribbean location needs.

blue water maritime is not just a shipping agency for cargo vessels. ever since we cleared the m/v "black watch" into san juan -- a cruise ship with an itinerary of the world's ports -- we have had a great love for our passenger carrying client vessels. we have also proven out new ports-of-call for the new shoreham and the nantucket clipper. these small cruise ships are then able to offer tours of the "spanish virgin islands" and they can visit ports that no other cruise line offers.
