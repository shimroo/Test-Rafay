from forbes -- gluten intolerace: fact or fakery?







gluten intolerance may not exist



in 2011, peter gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at monash university and director of the gi unit at the alfred hospital in melbourne, australia, published a study that found gluten, a protein found in grains like wheat, rye, and barley, to cause gastrointestinal distress in patients without celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder unequivocally triggered by gluten. double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled, the experiment was one of the strongest pieces of evidence to date that non-celiac gluten sensitivity (ncgs), more commonly known as gluten intolerance, is a genuine condition.



by extension, the study also lent credibility to the meteoric rise of the gluten-free diet. surveys now show that 30% of americans would like to eat less gluten, and sales of gluten-free products are estimated to hit $15 billion by 2016 — that’s a 50% jump over 2013′s numbers!





but like any meticulous scientist, gibson wasn’t satisfied with his first study. his research turned up no clues to what actually might be causing subjects’ adverse reactions to gluten. moreover, there were many more variables to control! what if some hidden confounder was mucking up the results? he resolved to repeat the trial with a level of rigor lacking in most nutritional research. subjects would be provided with every single meal for the duration of the trial. any and all potential dietary triggers for gastrointestinal symptoms would be removed, including lactose (from milk products), certain preservatives like benzoates, propionate, sulfites, and nitrites, and fermentable, poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates, also known as fodmaps. and last, but not least, nine days worth of urine and fecal matter would be collected. with this new study, gibson wasn’t messing around.





thirty seven subjects took part, all confirmed not to have celiac disease but whose gastrointestinal symptoms improved on a gluten-free diet, thus fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for non-celiac gluten sensitivity.**  they were first fed a diet low in fodmaps for two weeks (baseline), then were given one of three diets for a week with either 16 grams per day of added gluten (high-gluten), 2 grams of gluten and 14 grams of whey protein isolate (low-gluten), or 16 grams of whey protein isolate (placebo). each subject shuffled through every single diet so that they could serve as their own controls, and none ever knew what specific diet he or she was eating. after the main experiment, a second was conducted to ensure that the whey protein placebo was suitable. in this one, 22 of the original subjects shuffled through three different diets — 16 grams of added gluten, 16 grams of added whey protein isolate, or the baseline diet — for three days each.



analyzing the data, gibson found that each treatment diet, whether it included gluten or not, prompted subjects to report a worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms to similar degrees. reported pain, bloating, nausea, and gas all increased over the baseline low-fodmap diet. even in the second experiment, when the placebo diet was identical to the baseline diet, subjects reported a worsening of symptoms! the data clearly indicated that a nocebo effect, the same reaction that prompts some people to get sick from wind turbines and wireless signals, was at work here. patients reported gastrointestinal distress without any apparent physical cause. gluten wasn’t the culprit; the cause was likely psychological. participants expected the diets to make them sick, and so they did. the finding led gibson to the opposite conclusion of his 2011 research:

“in contrast to our first study… we could find absolutely no specific response to gluten.”

instead, as rcs reported last week, fodmaps are a far more likely cause of the gastrointestinal problems attributed to gluten intolerance. jessica biesiekierski, a gastroenterologist formerly at monash university and now based out of the translational research center for gastrointestinal disorders at the university of leuven in belgium,* and lead author of the study alongside gibson, noted that when participants consumed the baseline low-fodmap diet, almost all reported that their symptoms improved!



“reduction of fodmaps in their diets uniformly reduced gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue in the run-in period, after which they were minimally symptomatic.”

coincidentally, some of the largest dietary sources of fodmaps — specifically bread products — are removed when adopting a gluten-free diet, which could explain why the millions of people worldwide who swear by gluten-free diets feel better after going gluten-free.



indeed, the rise in non-celiac gluten sensitivity seems predominantly driven by consumers and commercial interests, not quality scientific research.



“on current evidence the existence of the entity of ncgs remains unsubstantiated,” biesiekierski noted in a review published in december to the journal current allergy and asthma reports.



consider this: no underlying cause for gluten sensitivity has yet been discovered. moreover, there are a host of triggers for gastrointestinal distress, many of which were not controlled for in previous studies. generally, non-celiac gluten sensitivity is assumed to be the culprit when celiac disease is ruled out. but that is a “trap,” biesiekierski says, one which could potentially lead to confirmation bias, thus blinding researchers, doctors, and patients to other possibilities.



biesiekierski recognizes that gluten may very well be the stomach irritant we’ve been looking for. “there is definitely something going on,” she told rcs, “but true ncgs may only affect a very small number of people and may affect more extraintestinal symptoms than first thought. this will only be confirmed with an understanding of its mechanism.”

currently, biesiekierski is focused on maintaining an open mind and refining her experimental methods to determine whether or not non-celiac gluten sensitivity truly exists.



“we need to make sure that this research is as well controlled as possible and is reproducible,” biesiekierski told rcs, subsequently adding the quintessential adage of proper science.



“much, much more research is needed.”

guilty pleasure





beanstalk's 
guilty pleasure:
mtv's teen wolf




tyler hoechlin, tyler posey, arden cho, dylan o'brien & holland roden.



we actually aren't loathe to admit it: we watch mtv's "teen wolf," even though it's gotten to the point where it often aggravates us.

the mythology of the series has always been a combination of commonly known/accepted lore with convoluted tales introduced for dramatic and creepy effect, but then dismissed without much (if any) explanation (an example from the recently aired episodes -- the man-without-a-mouth and the animal-skull wearing demons; earlier in the season, the black smoke that turned into ninjas and back again were never satisfactorily incorporated into the storyline).

the actors -- parents and "teens" --  are primarily all within a few years in age, which can be awkward. it took us a couple of episodes in the first season to distinguish the difference between scott's mother and his girlfriend in the first season (and, no surprise, really, when there's actually only an 11-year age difference tween the two).

it's also of particular annoyance when a character who has been dispatched is resurrected for whatever caprice the show runners decide upon (i.e. gerard and kate argent). tw is particularly good at offering up characters who viewers (us, at least) can't wait to be killed (including the aforementioned gerard, victoria argent, and ethan and aiden). the actors who played those twins the carvers, have since moved over to hbo and its new series, "the leftovers." we were shocked that they were o.k. in the new series, since they were horrible in tw.

acting is never the strong suit of tw -- notably the aforementioned carver twins, eaddy mays (victoria), michael hogan (gerard) and the too-model-y hales,  played by tyler hoechlin and ian bohen.  included in the limited acting skills is the still-likable star, tyler posey. check out, too, the scene-chewing when joy luck club alum, tamlyn tomita is on screen; she could afford to dial it down a bit, as could jr bourne (mr. argent), but that might not be an entirely fair assessment, as argent's role was limited to grimacing and glowering; his character's recent return may give the actor a chance to grow.

there are, however, a few exceptions, and good performances are regularly delivered by linden ashby (sheriff stilinski), melissa ponzio (melissa mccall), and the now-departed british actor daniel sharman (issac).

one actor who is a total standout, and will likely have a very healthy post-tw career -- dylan o'brien, who plays sidekick stiles. later this summer, he'll star in the theatrical release the mazerunner. o'brien may be the only reason we continue to tune into the show.

the new (and new-ish) regulars are serviceable, and include arden cho, shelley hennig and dylan sprayberry (although, in our opinion, the jury is still out on sprayberry). sprayberry, who plays freshman liam, seems easily poised to take over as the eponymous teen wolf, if the need arises. as the cast grows, it reduces ashby's and ponzio's roles to expository, which is a shame, but it's obvious who the audience is for the series, and despite their chops, they aren't in the correct age bracket.

despite our status as regular viewer, we're not sure if we can actually recommend the series, which, at this point, in the second-half of the fourth season, is quite a commitment, if you haven't been watching. still, if you're nursing the measles or a broken leg, tw can be fun company.

agent provacateur's big guest role
on showtime's ray donovan 




so, as a 'make-up' gift on sunday's (20 july 2014) ray donovan gives his (literally) put-upon wife, abby this agent provacateur corset set.  



petunia corset

sweetly feminine yet distinctly alluring, petunia is an irresistible mix of pretty and provocative. it's delicately embroidered with multi-coloured blooms and seductively cut to create dangerous curves. based on the best-selling mercy shape, this padded corset is crafted from super-sheer black tulle, decorated with a delicately-hued floral motif, which creates a pretty scalloped edge along the neck, bust and hips. french lace ribbon runs along the bones, hem and hip, helping to accentuate the seductive female form. 



petunia thong

$150

sweetly feminine yet distinctly alluring, petunia is an irresistible mix of pretty and provocative. it's delicately embroidered with multi-coloured blooms and seductively cut to create dangerous curves. the thong is made from super-sheer black tulle, decorated with black french embroidery punctuated by a delicately-hued floral motif, creating a pretty scalloped edge along the waist. the legline is trimmed with lilac and black french lace ribbon, while ribbon slot bows sit at each hip. 



silk stockings

$120





whew! $1060 is quite a bit of “make-up” lingerie. www.agentprovacateur.com got a huge shout-out on the showtime series, “ray donovan.” and actress paula malcomson (abby) looked amazing in it.

beanstalk's back!





we're back on 
summer's heels

we're back! for our 10-year-anniversary, we took a break. our new career was preoccupying us and didn't give us enough time to dedicate to beanstalk biz, but we're back, with all kinds of cool ideas and events.



one of our favorite fox girls (“new girl’s” zooey deschanel is the other), mindy kaling, wore this david meister white jersey one shoulder evening gown with silver beaded bodice (seen here in meister’s runway show) to the white house state dinner honoring president françois hollande of france. she is looking super sassy lately!

our you tube obession





bunny



clearly, beanstalk is not a 14-year-old girl -- but one lurks within.

to prove this, this is our latest obsession:

texan rachel "bunny" meyer aka grav3yardgirl, youtube sensation.

check out her videos:

http://www.youtube.com/user/grav3yardgirl

you won't be sorry you did.

we especially like her real-life take on items she buys herself (she identifies if she's gifted anything) and came across her when we were trying to figure out what those spiral curler things were (curlforms). we've watched numerous videos, much to the alternate amusement and chagrin of our ceo and cfo.

it took beanstalk all of a minute to grow accustom (and eventually fond) of her ott antics, loud voice (she has hearing issues, people!), rapid-fire banter and playful (at least it is to us) mugging.

we find her quite fun. we do!

the annual oscar luncheon



and beanstalk is there



by elaine sanchez wilson

beanstalk contributor



fashion, food, and philanthropy joined forces to kick off
awards season at the 6th annual valentine romance oscar style lounge
and party, an all-day fete effortlessly pulled off by the expert hands of pr
veteran doris bergman. inside west hollywood's swanky chic fig & olive
restaurant, cast and crew from the silver and small screens schmoozed with
vendors representing an array of lifestyle products. 








celebrities, such as former oscar nominee angela bassett,
william shatner, tommy davidson, and eva la rue, strolled through a breezy and
sunlit atrium adjacent to the restaurant's main dining room and bar, alongside
former oscar winner louis gossett jr., current nominee robin mathews (make-up
artist for dallas buyers club), cheech marin, tommy chong, lou ferrigno, dot marie
jones, "office" star kate flannery, nicholas guest, and tia carrere, among others. 



the invitation-only event, hosted by begley & begley's
100% all natural sodas and presented by whitening lightening & nature's
flavors, featured an assortment of women's and men's fashion accessories, body,
skin and hair care lines, fine art, decadent desserts, and premiere cocktails.
while the gifts were certainly luxurious (a straw hat displayed at baron hat's
booth would reportedly sell for $10,000), the party also shone a light onto the
needs of the less affluent. guests were encouraged to donate new or gently used
articles of clothing and accessories for a valentine's day gift drive
benefiting “wednesday's child,” a weekly segment that airs on fox 11 news, los
angeles. anchor christine devine was on hand to discuss the program, which aims
to unite “harder to place” foster children from los angeles county with
adoptive families (wednesdayschild.davethomasfoundation.org). 



““in los angeles
county, alone, there are over 30,000 children receiving child welfare
services,” said social worker, william wong. “this event reached far beyond the
hollywood ‘glitz’ and into the heart and soul.”



also embracing the humanitarian spirit, hollywood hat-maker
mark mejia, president and ceo of baron hats (http://baronhats.com), discussed
his intent to organize a medical mission to the philippines, where he has
worked with filipino craftsmen. “this is a dying art,” said patti gardner,
mejia's personal assistant. “and what's happening is that mark is trying to
save this dying art.” mejia's custom hats are hand-woven in ecuador, take anywhere
from eight weeks to six months to finish, and retail for around $10,000. they
can be seen in the lone ranger and django unchained, in addition
to the billboard poster for fx series justified.



occupying a prime spot at the entrance of the suite, designer
timmy woods, of timmy woods beverly hills (www.timmywoods.com), showed off
handmade bags that double as home furnishing collectibles. her wearable art
creations, which can take upwards of 30 days to complete, are a wonderfully
eccentric mix of quirk and kitsch (a pair of cat-eye sunglasses, a
black-an-white striped feline, and an eiffel tower replica were among the items
on display). “they are usually extensions of people's personalities,” woods
said, adding that if all goes as planned, she will be working on a bag for
oscar nominee sandra bullock. “it has to feel like it's part of you. they're
very psychological.”



at poof your pouch
(https://www.facebook.com/pages/poof-your-pooch/548792331871278), a small crowd
oohed and aahed over charming brown-and-white chihuahua sophie, who was decked
out in a pretty floral harness. according to owner cori stockman, the
one-of-a-kind poofs are interchangeable, are available in a wide range of
flower types and colors, and retail for $40. and over at event sponsor whitening
lightening (http://www.whiteninglightning.com),
president and ceo jen gerard talked about why her high-grade whitening
gels are a celebrity favorite. “sensitivity isn't a factor because the gel doesn't
strip away the enamel,” she explained. 


beanstalk contributor and article author elaine sanchez wilson at the event.


other participating vendors included ooh la bra, silvana k
designs, handmade hearts by hillel, pk’s chocolates,  simply eartha, dr. ava cadell, the “love
doctor,” monatelier, waraire boswell executive men’s clothiers, platinum image
services, mia bath & body, “serenade” by virtuoso violinist,

steve jobs' treasure

time capsule containing steve jobs’ apple lisa mouse
considered lost for more than 10 years but uncovered 30 years later

footage of the capsule, its contents and the excavation available for download

a time capsule containing the mouse from steve jobs’ first mass-marketed lisa computer was uncovered in september 2013 on the grounds of the aspen music festival in aspen, colo. the finding was made by national geographic channel’s diggers team for the kick-off episode of the second season, airing tonight, tuesday, feb. 25, at 10 p.m. et/pt, one day after what would have been steve jobs’ 59th birthday. diggers airs tuesdays at 10 p.m. et/pt.
footage of the capsule, its contents and the excavation is available here.
stills are available here.


steve jobs' "lisa" computer.


buried in 1983 during the now-defunct international design conference in aspen, the tube was intended to be unearthed in 2000, but due to changes in the landscape, its exact location was unknown — until now. working closely with the aspen music festival and school and harry teague, one of the original members of the design team that buried the capsule, the diggers team was able to narrow down the time capsule’s location using original survey coordinates and good old-fashioned math. the capsule was carefully excavated under the supervision of diggers archaeologist michael durkin, and the contents of the capsule will be cataloged and evaluated before being turned over to the aspen historical society.



steve jobs and his daughter, lisa, the namesake of his computer.


in addition to the lisa mouse, the contents of the 13-foot-long capsule include a mix of early ’80s relics: an eight-track recording of the moody blues, a sears roebuck catalog, a june 1983 copy of vogue magazine, a rubik’s cube and a six-pack of beer. the time capsule was related to the theme of the conference, “the future is not what it used to be.” at the conference, before donating the mouse, jobs addressed the crowd in a speech that many believe predicted some of apple’s great innovations to come, including the ipad, wireless networking and even the apple app store.

in the diggers series, tim “ringy” saylor and george “kg” wyant scour the country for lost pieces of american history — from civil war buckles to family heirloom rings and silver coins. where there is an empty yard, field or beach approved for metal detecting, the duo see a treasure trove, and will go the distance to uncover “the juice,” as they call it, working in close collaboration with a local archaeologist or historian at every site. it’s not just the raw value of the object that gets them excited; it’s the thrill of the hunt and the possibility that the next artifact they dig up could yield the discovery of a lifetime or, in this case, a significant piece of tech — and pop culture — history!
