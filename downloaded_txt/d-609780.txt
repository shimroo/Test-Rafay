lady of q at soul fusion kitchen 



all things lead to food.  the kitchen is the hub of all social events in my home.  holiday parties, outdoor bbq, bbq team competition, luncheons, dinner and brunch-everyone still migrates to the kitchen and food.

lady of q bbq trailer








 
there are certain pleasures one can have in order to make life on the bbq competition circuit comfortable and organized.  i have reached that level but before i disclose, i'd like give you an idea of why i bit the bullet and sought comfort.

looking back on the last seven years  of competing, i only had a canopy with weights to protect from the wind, some 6 ft collapsible tables, a few dish tubs to wash dirty dishes, an igloo to store water, a coleman hot water to go to heat the water, no less than 10 various sized plastic bins filled with supplies, three wsm smokers, three coolers to store meat, drinks and perishables, two cambro warmers to hold cooked meat, a sleeping bag and pillow to sleep in overnight in the back of the suv or van.  all these supplies organized to fit in a suv or van. i would load all these things before a comp,  unload them at the comp, reload them after the comp and then unload them again once i got home.

when it was cold, i had a little propane heater at my feet,  when it rained, i put up the canopy sides and hoped to stay dry.  when it was windy, i hoped the weights on the canopy would hold.  most often they did but a couple of times, the canopy failed.

preparing the meats for turn in to the judges can be affected by the weather when doing so in a canopy. meats should be as hot as possible so judges will taste at the height of best flavor.  wind, cold and rain in a canopy can not be controlled thus when prepping the meats for turn in, the meat temps drop, fat congeals and it isn't pretty.

at most competitions, there are only a few public port-a-potties.  you all probably have experienced the displeasure of using these.  for us ladies, it is even more disgusting- no other adjectives needed.

so, my requirement for comfort and organization included, a bathroom area, sink with hot and cold water, a refrigerator, tables and storage containers. generator for power, electrical outlets, ac/heat and protection from the weather elements.

my bbq competition trailer:

 

i received my trailer in march of 2013.  it is mounted with a backwoods smoker party g2 on a 4 ft porch.



 

inside the trailer. my personal bathroom which at comps is a necessity unless you enjoy public porta potties.


 large sink for cleaning large pans.


 commercial refrigerator.


 stainless steel counter tops.

leaving (left)  los angeles





after nearly 30 years, we sold our house in los angeles and moved to north san diego county.  it was a really big job to pack up, stage our l.a. house for sale and move.  we we're fortunate to get a buyer after less than a month on the market.  wishing many happy future memories to the buyers.

we now are in the process of getting acclaimated to life on the ranch (yea, we bought an avocado ranch), the serenity of living away from the city but close enough to the city to enjoy it's culture and entertainment.  ziggy loves it in that he can roam without a leash but stay out of the coyotes way. 

here are a few pictures of the house and the views.  breath taking!

our new home





i am still unpacking boxes while continuing to compete on the bbq circuit.  recently i competed in kansas city at the american royal.  this was a two day competition with an invitational and 150 plus teams from all over the u.s. competing day 1 and then day 2 over 540 teams competing in the open registration.  i cooked both competitions but wasn't proud of my results but am happy to say it was a great experience.

i am looking forward to my next comp in less than two weeks at the santa anita race track.  this "lady of q" is itching for another big win.

i'm  still here





since the las vegas acm bbq throwdown, i have also competed in a wildomar,ca  comp and a sam's club regional bbq comp.  we won't talk about wildomar other than an 8th in brisket covering gas money but overall judge's didn't like my turnins.

sam's club, i finished in the top 10 which got me an invite to the albuquerque regional event.  rough competition with storms and heavy winds in san diego.  i cooked that one solo and without a pit b$%^&*.  thank goodness for my fantastic bbq family coming to my assistance to help with a failed canopy. 

wish me luck in albuquerque. a top 10 finish gets me a place in the finals in bentonville, ark.
