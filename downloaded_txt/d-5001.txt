act of consecration to the
  
 most sacred heart of jesus and immaculate heart of mary








most sacred heart of jesus and immaculate heart of mary, i consecrate myself and my whole
family to you. we consecrate to you: our very being and all our life. all that we are. all that we have. and all that we love. to you we give our bodies, our hearts and our souls. to you we dedicate our home and our country. mindful of this consecration, we now promise you to live the christian way by the practice of christian virtues. o most sacred heart of jesus and immaculate heart of mary, accept our humble confidence and this act of consecration by which we entrust ourselves and all our family to you. in you, we put all our hope and we shall never be confounded.




 most sacred heart of jesus, have mercy on us. 
 immaculate heart of mary, be our salvation.

when we think of sin, let us see it in the light of christ's death, and hate it because it nailed him to 
the tree; and when tempted to sin, let us call up before our memory the pale, drooping figure on the 
cross  anguished, bleeding, dying  and let us think that there is the proof of what sin is, and what 
god thinks of it. and thus, as a safeguard against temptation and the snare of the devil, let us hear 
about the remembrance of christ's dying.
