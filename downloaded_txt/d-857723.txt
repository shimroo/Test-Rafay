	 best walking shoes
	 
    


hello walking fans!if you're a walker, for sport, pleasure or out of necessity, you need a comfortable shoe. but what's really a comfortable able walking shoe? actually there's no better way to determine that for yourself than to simply experiment with different shoes on your own.  of course that can be time consuming and expensive. here's a little help.first of all think about what style of shoe you want.   if you do a lot of walking for your job, you probably want a casual looking shoe that looks good with your business outfit.  if you're an exercise walker a white sports shoe is probably what you want. for example,  i'm taking a trip to italy in may (whaaahooo! i'm excited) but my biggest concern is getting a walking shoe that will be as comfortable as it can possibly be. now, i've been told that when visiting italy, white tennis shoes give you away as an american tourist and they should be avoided.  is this true?  not sure, but i'm not one to be conspicuous so i'm going to try to go for a walking shoe that's not a bright white sports looking shoe. if you wear orthotics, have high arches, bunions, narrow or wide feet, these can all play a part in the best shoe for you.  so think about what style you like, assess your foot needs and go with shoes that are known for comfort.  when buying a shoe, be sure to read the buyer reviews. most good online shoe stores offer them.  based on reviews i've read, here's a few of the most popular and most purchased walking shoes that are primarily based on 'comfort'.  haven't decided on which one i'm buying yet for my italy trip -- but i'll let you know :-)i suggest buying them at zappos - they have the best prices and customer service. plus they often run some pretty awesome sales. asics gel nimbus viiithis is a highly cushioned running shoe that is excellent for walkers as well.  it enhances the foot's natural gait from heel-to-toe. the cushioning  provides maximum front and rear foot shock absorption for all  motions and it doesn't bind across the toe.  they are also good for high arches. these shoes have pretty wild colors.mephistomephisto is what comes to my mind as a primo walking shoe, everyone that wears them seems to love them and buy them a second time.  they are a bit pricey but extremely comfortable. they offer great support in the heel. any of their shoes offer perfect walking comfort.  all of their shoes provide huge comfort.new balance 659this is actually a running shoe that gets high marks. it offers great support with great traction on roads and trails. good shock absorption in the heel. lightweight synthetic mesh, reflective detail for safety, outsole stabilizes the foot through your walking cycle.rockport walking shoesrockports for walking seemed to get  average to low reviews. they offer moderate arch support and some shoes don't offer any. however, the rockport world tour classic walking shoe did get rave reviews. their not a stiff shoe and go well with slacks or jeans.  they are also a good shoe for orthotics.reebok dmxthis shoe got some fairly good reviews for looks but lacked in the comfort department, probably because they take awhile to break in, however once broken in they can be a dream.reebok shoes also tend to squeak a bit.  make sure this does not bother you.happy walking :-)elizabeth (the shoe nut)

	 shopping - bah humbug!
	 



if you think about shoes, a few facts come to mind:everyone wears themthey can dress-up or dress-down an outfitthere's a shoe for every occasiona new pair of shoes can put a spring in your step!i personally love a new pair of shoes and i love to shop for shoes, but i gotta ask you ... who has the time to shop? i work a thriving business and before that, i had a busy career with a house, kids and a home to take care of. so as much as i love to shop, i don't have much time left in the day to roam about the shopping malls.now the holidays are fast approaching. this is my favorite time of year, but again i ask you -- who has the time to wander the shopping malls? i sure don't. life is just too busy and i guess i have to admit it -- the older i get, the less i like it.uh oh --- i hope my daughter didn't hear that.so what's a busy gal like me to do when i need a new pair of shoes for that christmas party or to to simply pick up my spirits?shop online i tell you!i'm still not sure why more people don't do it. no wait, i think i know -- "i like to try them on and see how they fit" yep, i hear that a lot.ok, there's something to be said for "trying them on for fit" i'll give you that one, but if you try them on at home and they don't fit, send them back "free of charge" and you can still have the right size sent to you within a few days.yep ... there is a little planning required. buying shoes on saturday to wear on sunday might not work online, but if you do a little pre-planning you can have yourself a new pair of shoes within a few days -- with free delivery! ( zappos, shoebuy, shoes.com and onlineshoes.com all have free shipping, free returns and the best customer service)so, if they don't fit, return them for free. only requirement - think ahead, don't procrastinate. i guess that's a topic for another day.so, if you're feeling a little down and you need a pick me up, take a break and get on out to your favorite online shoe store. it's fast, fun and it will give you something to look forward to in your mailbox.or who knows - you might even find a great gift for someone else!cozy slippers and colorful handbags are all the rage this year!famous brand shoes.com
