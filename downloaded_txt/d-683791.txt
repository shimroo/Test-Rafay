and meditative kabbalah.  i have been facilitating

thirty years.  all of my spiritual work, including
courses, are on a donation basis.

articles on these pages and worthwhile venues of study.  all
is designed to be a catalyst to find and unfold the divine within you.






dance


when
looking at the word guidance, one
can see "dance" at
the end of
the word. 



g_d's will is a lot like dancing.  when two people try
to
lead,
nothing feels right.  the movement doesn't flow with the
music, and
everything is quite uncomfortable and jerky.

when one person realizes that, and
lets
the other
lead, both bodies begin to flow with the music.  one gives
gentle cues,
perhaps with a nudge to the back or by
pressing
lightly in one direction or another.  it's as if two become
one body,
moving beautifully.  the dance
takes surrender,
willingness, and attentiveness from one
person and
gentle guidance and skill from the other.


look at the word guidance



see
the "g," and
think of g_d, followed
by "u" and "i."


"g_d,
"u" and "i" dance."

g_d,
you, and i dance! 




be
willing to let g_d lead.
 dance
together with g_d;
trusting g_d to
lead and to guide you through each season of your life. 

“g_d”
is
used in deference to those of jewish faith.






kabbalah
course description







"songs
of light" are channeled harmonics utilizing
sacred hebrew and greek phrases by school founder, rev. kythera
ann.   the vowel and consonant patterning combined
with the harmonics and visualizations allow individuals to increase
their vibratory rate (light bodies) for active participation as light
workers, and opens and maintains one's connection with spirit.
 many people who do sound work in conjunction with their
kabbalah studies find this material useful also.  if
you

of light (book & tape or
cd)
