posted on october 8, 2021october 8, 2021will you repent? 

will you repent?
repentance has to begin with asking god to search our hearts (psalm 139:23, 24). it is when you allow the holy spirit to turn the spotlights on, that he will show you the secrets of your heart—sins of pride and self-righteousness and many more. david never allowed god to search his heart … read the rest

we do not look to jesus because his sinless perfection makes us uncomfortable in his holy presence.
we do not look to jesus because the “i” in me is demanding to be crowned and fighting to rule my life.
we do not look to jesus because so many of our friends do not consider him … read the rest  



posted on february 5, 2021february 5, 2021who fulfills your desires? 

who fulfills your desires? that is the question i would like to explore.
desires are many. and all your life you strive hard to fulfill your desires. some happen; others don’t come to pass.. fulfilment of desires makes you elated while desires not fulfilled disappoint.
i leave out what is plainly known to all as … read the rest

how many second chances

posted on october 31, 2020october 9, 2021did god say holiness is difficult for you to achieve? 

be holy.
god did not say it is impossible or difficult, but simply commanded us to be holy. so it is not an option, but a command to be followed.
we should be thankful that god pointed us to himself as the model to follow for holiness (see leviticus 11:44). the bible declares that god … read the rest  



posted on october 30, 2020november 1, 2020sexual fantasies in the minds of men is sin and playing with fire! 

sexual fantasies occupy much space in a man’s mind. if he is not on his guard, not right with god, or is not walking with god at the moment; the sight of a woman can trigger a lot of sexual thoughts in his mind.
this is because men are stimulated by sight. it doesn’t matter … read the rest

“give me a sign of your goodness, that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, for you, o lord, have helped me and comforted me” — psalm 86:17.

posted on october 18, 2020october 22, 2020abstain from fleshly lusts that war against your soul 

if we have the realization that we are aliens and strangers in this world, it will make a difference in our spiritual walk.
the first thing you should know is that you will always feel the lusts of the flesh or sinful desires that war against the soul (1 peter 2:11). but then it is … read the rest  



posted on october 16, 2020october 18, 2020god who watches over you 

“i, the lord, watch over it” — isaiah 27:3
have you ever wondered if god watches over you? let us look at isaiah 27:2–6 to find the answer. here god is calling israel, his people, a fruitful vineyard. earlier he was disappointed with it (see isaiah 5:1–7). but now god is saying that he watches … read the rest  



posted on october 11, 2020october 18, 2020unless you bless me 

all of us have tried praying or happily listened to others praying, “i will not let you go unless you bless me (genesis 32:26).” easily said than done. why?
not one of us is willing to struggle with god and prevail. jesus asked us not to go for vain repetition in prayer. at the same … read the rest  



posted on october 11, 2020october 18, 2020let us be honest about prayer 

most of us pray. yes, for an approaching exam, when sickness comes, during financial crisis, and when there is some other trouble. at other times it is just routine “bless me o lord and my family (and sometimes we add, “only me and my family”; which means o lord hope you understood that means bless … read the rest  



posted on october 7, 2020october 18, 2020do you allow god to examine you? 

but the one who examines me is the lord (1 corinthians 4:4b nasb). 
each one of us should live our lives with this truth dominating our minds.

lust deceives. you might not know it. the lack of physical or emotional intimacy in marriage can make you feel attracted to someone else other than your husband or wife. maybe lack of appreciation or care can be a sea of petrol or gasoline waiting to be ignited by a casual physical touch, a longing … read the rest  



posted on october 4, 2020october 18, 2020set your heart on things above 

if no one has called you nuts (meaning crazy, foolish, strange) after seeing your attitudes towards the things of the world; then there is something wrong with your walk with god.
like how a foreigner is easily recognized in a crowd of natives; you should be seen different in your attitudes and lifestyles because you … read the rest

god is merciful. he will show you compassion.

are you confident? if the answer is yes, the next question is on what are you basing your confidence? some people put confidence in their family background, education or riches. all these are good but not good enough. as a believer in the lord jesus, you have better things to be confident about.
