pamela is the academy award®-nominated creator and writer of my year of dicks, an adaptation of her critically-acclaimed comedic memoir notes to boys (and other things i shouldn’t share in public), which was nominated for best animated short film for the 95th academy awards. she is currently writing emily the strange for warner bros. animation and bad robot.
pamela is a screenwriter (moana, nimona, ralph breaks the internet, bears), performer, vr and tv writer, comic book writer (my boyfriend is a bear, slam!), best-selling novelist, and filmmaker. she co-hosts the podcast listen to sassy, a weekly deep-dive through every issue of sassy magazine.
pamela was a flagship contributor to television without pity, and is known as a pioneer in the blogging world with pamie.com, where she launched such viral essays as “how i might have just become the newest urban legend” and “barbie fucks it up again,” the latter of which led to #feministhackerbarbie, a revamp of mattel’s products and marketing for barbie,  and the creation of game developer barbie as “career of the year.” pamela’s stage work has been showcased at the hbo us comedy arts festival.
a former austinite with a bfa in drama from the university of texas, pamela has been entered into the oxford english dictionary under “muffin top.” that is not a joke. @pamelaribon | she/her
