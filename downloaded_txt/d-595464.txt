                                the results of our research inform government policy, the development of
                                standards, and good technology design.
                            

                                you may be invited to use our vehicle simulator at crowthorne, or to use
                                your own vehicle on the road, or simply to complete a survey.
                            

                                every trial is different, and provides essential evidence to advance our
                                understanding.
