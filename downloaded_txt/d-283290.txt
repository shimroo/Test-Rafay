horsepower vs. performance
our engineers have a performance tune rating for each model based on its components, not a flat, general pump rating.
          this provides clearer information regarding the actual performance of a saratoga spaâ® based on jet style, as well as the
          numbers of jets and pumps.
performance tuned rating is the true balance of gpm (gallons per minute) and psi (pounds per square inch) involved in the therapy benefit of your spa.
