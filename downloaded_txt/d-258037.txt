for 25+ years














drake has been supplying high quality furniture becoming one of the most influencial and trusted player on the market...
drake corp. was the first to introduce high quality resin event chairs to the contract market, with the classic look and feel of wood plus all the advantages of resin. over the past years, the company has set new standards, new records, and earned increasing respect from the contract community. new technology, plus drake's tradition of producing quality, durable seating products have been the secrets of drake's success.









green:





most of the products that we supplied in the last 25+ years are still on active duty. our chairs and tables are built to last... last, last and last some more... and at the end, they are 100% recyclable which translates in the smallest environmental footprint in the industry  (beside maximizing our customer's roi, return on investment). infact, buying cheap shorter life span products means not only spending more money to replace them often, it also brings unnecessary waste to the planet, in terms of energy and resources. find out what are we up to:

resin folding chairs (including traditional white folding chairs) for special events & more








the material used at drake is a composite multi-layer techno-polymer which allows the manufacturing of special event resin folding chairs (including the traditional white folding chairs) that are the strongest and the lightest at the same time on the market. no one has been able so far to deliver a plastic chair that is as strong as drake's, and so light that it makes transportation, storing and set up for events as cheap or as easy.

resin stacking chiavari chairs








the aesthetic respects the old traditional look but... deep inside drake chiavari stacking chairs have been re-engineered ground-up. the new mix of techno-polymers they are made of, makes them exceptionally strong, sturdy, and a far better alternative to a wood chair or to a plastic chair with a metallic insert, at a fraction of the weight...
