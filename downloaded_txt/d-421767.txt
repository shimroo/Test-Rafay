deeply offensive
the argument goes "... if you don't vote, you don't have a right to comment or complain after the vote."

this nonsense just doesn't hold water as the argument implies that voting is "having your say".

those...

about not apathetic
notapathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the uk general election
on may 5th 2005 can tell the world why. we won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.

a lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it will
be counted. so if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.
