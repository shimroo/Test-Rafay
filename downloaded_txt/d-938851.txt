	 are you ready for some football?
    


been hearing a bit about vick saying the eagles aren't going to use the 'dream team' moniker anymore... probably a good idea.

see below, same shit as last year... louisville choked (bad matchup, no preston, no siva for majority of game). bracket is all fucked. does anyone read vicklanta anymore? sorry you had to wait a whole year for nothing substantial :)

	 bracket busters!!
    


well obviously the ville didnt do shit this year...but my bracket is totally fucked. the entire left side (thanks kansas,syracuse) is toast.even if it comes down to ky duke in the final 4, i cannot win any more points past that.once again, i watch hours of big east hoops just to see them choke and go down in flames post-season. should have listened to bilas!

	 pirate flu
    


the pirate flu sweeping africa must be stopped! seriously, can't we do something about this rampant problem? until a fellowship of the pirate is formed by the top naval nations, our lands and seas will fall into darkness.blackbeard and jack sparrow must be rolling over in their graves given the high amount of booty these pirates collect. weapons, treasure, microchips, white people... yarrr this be a fine take today. of course the 21st century pirates don't actually talk like this, its more like derka derka click cluck cluck derka der. and they dont have beards, rotted teeth, and live by a pirate code.. its more like tattered clothes, emaciated frames, and west nile virus.the pirate flu must be stopped in its tracks. gunshots to the face seem the only way to remedy the situation...

	 matt ryan is aiiight
    


i know he has a winning record, i know the wins have been exciting, and i know we got robbed last week in what could have been another 2-minute drill where we actually catch balls and win games. but i am still not ready to give mattlanta my 100% approval quite yet. if he is supposed to be the franchise player to replace mike vick, lets see how he stands at the end of the year.and now, pictures of our beatdown in freezing cold wisconsin!.....(more to come later)

	 poker
    


i am not really playing too much poke-her anymore, but i happen to have played 3 times in the past 2 weeks. won a tourney that was $20 buy-ins and $20 re-buy/re-loads. came out +220 in that one. took that cheddar and played the next night, bought in for 200 and cashed out for 300. then i just played in the same tourney again tonight, and lost $20. if a train is travelling at 40 mph towards you right now, how much loot is that?+300 is the answer.spartans....  ahh oooh, ahh oooh, ahh oooh.
