why have this site

       this site is owned by steve aikens and gary slider. we firmly believe in 
        the second amendment, concealed carry and the fact that we have both a 
right and responsibility to take a pro-active position in our personal 
defense. unfortunately, we recognize there are so many variances in our 
state to state laws, the average individual may have difficulty keeping 
up with those laws well enough to prevent them from breaking the law, 
especially as they travel. since we have the ability to research those 
laws and create an informative concealed carry specific site, we have 
done so.
over 21 million concealed carry holders.
we are a database of information on carrying firearms legally for self-defense. as we have time, we continue to add basic, related information. however, this site is focused on concealed carry. that is all we will try to be.

we need your assistance.  if there is a change in your state honoring other states permits/licenses, a change in laws concerning places off limits to carry or other restrictions on carry, or you find a broken link or spelling error on this site, please contact us so we can add it or make a correction. we want to make the information available here as correct as we can possibly make it. thank you and stay safe.
