be alert
never tell anyone a token 3 response code, even someone from the bank. you should only input these codes to our secure business internet banking service when you’re sending and making payments. if anyone calls and asks for a token 3 response code or asks you to authorise a payment on the app for fraud checks, hang up and call us on 0800 085 2914 from another line if possible, remember the bank will never ask you to disclose your security details.
