about narhs

















 





see what others are saying 










						"we appreciate the opportunity to have a hs diploma and teach the curriculum that we feel comfortable with. it is actually quite rewarding to see our children spread their wings, go out into the world and be contributors. home education through narhs has allowed this to happen for us!"					









						"narhs made it easy to educate my high school student. it was an easy transition back into public school."					


-georgia family 






						"we like narhs because we are expected to do the basics, but the electives are flexible and the students can do what they enjoy."					


-ohio family 






						"your timely insights and suggestions helped me time and time again. what i thought was impossible was made possible. in fact, as things fell into place, i never experienced such a peaceful transition before in my homeschooling."					


-new york family 






						"we used narhs for all five of our children. it was a godsend because we were able to plan and use the courses/materials we chose, but we had the peace of mind that they would have an official diploma and transcripts which definitely smoothed the paths over the years…i also appreciated being able to school on a 12-month schedule which allows more flexibility but also more realistic life training."
