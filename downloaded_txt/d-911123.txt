bytedance-owned virtual reality (vr) company, pico, is set to implement significant restructuring, marking its most substantial transformation since being acquired by the tiktok parent company two years ago. this strategic move comes in response to a recent dip in global demand for vr headsets, as confirmed by three insiders with direct knowledge of the matter.
during an internal meeting held on tuesday, pico communicated its decision to retain its hardware team, while integrating a substantial portion of its software team back into bytedance’s in-house product development division. the sources, requesting anonymity due to confidentiality, did not specify the exact number of jobs to be affected, but estimated that “hundreds” of pico staff members across the globe could be impacted.
in response to inquiries, pico issued a statement acknowledging the restructuring effort, emphasizing a renewed focus on hardware and core technologies. however, the company refrained from commenting on potential job cuts.
the reorganization marks a setback for bytedance, as its high-profile acquisition of pico in 2021, which valued the vr entity at over $1 billion, was initially viewed as a direct challenge to meta platforms’ popular quest line of vr headsets.
unfortunately, the demand for vr technology has experienced a downturn this year. data from research firm idc, up to june 30, indicates consecutive quarterly declines in shipments of augmented reality (ar) and vr headsets, with volumes plummeting by 44.6% year-on-year in the second quarter.
since joining forces with bytedance, pico had aggressively expanded its footprint both within china and on a global scale. domestically, it has emerged as the leading vr producer in terms of total shipments, while internationally it trails only meta.
however, two insiders revealed that bytedance had scaled back efforts to establish pico as a distinct brand in recent months, a move reflective of the subdued market outlook. additionally, several senior managers have departed pico over the course of this year.
regarding the shift in pico’s strategic priority within bytedance and the accompanying alterations in senior personnel, bytedance declined to provide specific comments. last month, bytedance reassured its long-term commitment to the vr industry, following media speculation suggesting a gradual wind-down of pico’s operations.

beijing’s recent directive to government employees, instructing them to cease using iphones at work, has prompted concerns among u.s. lawmakers. this move, in conjunction with escalating tensions between the u.s. and china, has raised apprehensions about potential repercussions for american tech companies heavily reliant on the chinese market.
apple faces stock decline amid escalating tensions
apple witnessed a 2.9% drop in its stock value, marking its most substantial two-day decline since november. this development highlights that even companies with robust connections to the chinese government and a significant presence in the nation can be affected by increasing bilateral tensions.
friction intensifies over access to critical technologies
tensions between the u.s. and china have amplified, particularly regarding access to pivotal technologies, including cutting-edge chip technology. in response, china’s huawei recently unveiled its new mate 60 pro smartphone, featuring an advanced chip from chinese contract chipmaker smic. this marks a notable advancement for the companies, considering the constraints imposed by u.s. sanctions.
u.s. commerce department seeks clarity on huawei chip
the u.s. commerce department is actively seeking more information about the composition and nature of the chip featured in huawei’s new mate 60 pro smartphone. there are concerns that it may potentially violate existing trade restrictions.
huawei struggles due to sanctions, apple seizes opportunity
u.s. sanctions have severely restricted huawei’s access to essential chip-making tools, significantly impacting the company’s operations. this situation has enabled apple to gain traction in the chinese market, benefiting from huawei’s reduced market presence.
china’s ban on iphones in government agencies
the broader ban on iphone usage within chinese government agencies, while not entirely surprising, underscores china’s efforts to limit market access for western companies. u.s. lawmakers from both major parties have voiced concerns about national security risks associated with chinese products. this mounting pressure is urging the biden administration to adopt a more assertive stance towards china.
tech sector faces stock decline
the impact of this situation is conspicuously reflected in the stock market, particularly within the technology sector. suppliers of apple, such as qualcomm, broadcom, skyworks solutions, and texas instruments, have all experienced declines in stock value.
china remains integral to apple’s success
china serves as a pivotal market for apple, not only as a significant manufacturing hub but also as an increasingly crucial source of revenue, contributing nearly a fifth of the company’s total earnings. the situation with china holds substantial weight for apple’s future, as any escalation could potentially lead to heightened competition and a reconfigured market landscape. however, apple may experience a surge in demand following an upcoming event where the iphone 15 lineup and new smartwatches are anticipated to be unveiled.

the gaming world is abuzz with anticipation as the release of starfield draws near. scheduled for launch on xbox series x|s and pc (with game pass) on september 6, the game is currently available for early access. xbox wire had the privilege of exploring this highly awaited title ahead of its official release. starfield promises an expansive universe filled with intricate systems, mysteries, and immersive mechanics.
preparing players with “starfield starters”
to prepare players for their cosmic adventures, xbox wire introduces “starfield starters,” a four-part guide designed to delve into essential, lesser-known features without spoiling the gaming experience. one of these crucial elements is space combat, an integral aspect of the starfield universe.
the challenges of space in starfield
space in starfield isn’t always a welcoming place. players will encounter various threats, including spacers, the villainous crimson fleet, and the fervent house va’ruun zealots. whether you choose to defend yourself against these adversaries or embrace a life of space piracy, knowing how to operate your spacecraft and engage in combat effectively is paramount.
mastering space combat: power management and systems
at the heart of mastering space combat lies a deep understanding of your spacecraft’s systems and effective power management. these systems encompass engines, weapons, shields, and the grav drive. power allocation is influenced by your ship’s reactor, impacting the speed of lasers, missile restocking, shield strength, and engine performance. achieving a balance in power distribution during combat becomes a dynamic and thrilling aspect of gameplay.
the intricate dance of space combat
space combat isn’t merely about firing weapons at an enemy ship; it’s a dance of strategy. the process begins with dealing with enemy shields effectively, where laser weaponry proves most efficient. once shields are down, ballistic cannons come into play, delivering significant damage to the hull. missiles, on the other hand, offer massive ballistic damage but require precision in their use. mastering the art of power allocation among these weapon types and targeting enemy defenses is crucial for success.
targeting control systems and tactical advantage
“targeting control systems,” a skill in the tech tree, empowers players to lock onto enemies, manipulate time, and target specific ship systems. this feature, reminiscent of the vats system from fallout, provides a tactical advantage in disabling enemy ship functions or crippling adversaries.
enhancing mobility and maneuvering
in the vastness of space, maneuvering your ship is as vital as your weaponry. learning how to optimize your ship’s speed and movement is key to agility and targeting accuracy. the center-left gauge on the ship’s combat ui displays your speed, with a white section indicating the optimal range for high-speed turns. mastery of ship maneuvering includes investing in the piloting skill, unlocking thruster control for four-directional strafing.
boosting: speed and defense combined
boosting isn’t merely a means of increasing speed; it serves as a crucial defensive tool. when enemy ships lock onto you with missiles, activating your boost breaks the missile lock, keeping you safe from potential destruction. properly managing your boost reserves is essential for surviving perilous encounters.
maintaining your ship: hull damage and repairs
while shields can recharge, hull damage doesn’t recover naturally. ship repairs can be obtained through ship technicians but come at a cost of 1,000 credits each. alternatively, players can keep a supply of ship parts, acting as medpacks for their spacecraft. these parts are essential for quick, on-the-go repairs, ensuring you’re ready for the next battle.
rewards of space combat: ship parts and resourcefulness
engaging in space combat isn’t just about survival; it’s a rewarding endeavor. players frequently encounter ongoing battles between factions, offering opportunities for valuable rewards. ship parts, a vital resource, can be obtained through these battles, making space combat an exciting and resourceful aspect of the game.
starfield presents a rich and multifaceted space combat experience, with elements of power management, tactical weapon choices, precise targeting, nimble ship maneuvering, and resourceful maintenance. players can embark on thrilling cosmic adventures armed with a range of strategies and tactics. mastering these aspects will be essential for success in the vast universe of starfield.

the california department of motor vehicles (dmv) has initiated an investigation into recent incidents involving robotaxi autonomous vehicles operated by general motors’ subsidiary cruise in san francisco. this move comes after a cruise robotaxi was involved in a collision with an emergency vehicle, marking the latest in a series of accidents involving self-driving cars. as a result, the dmv has requested that cruise temporarily remove 50% of its active fleet from the roads while the investigation is underway, a reduction that cruise has agreed to.
cruise reported that the collision occurred when one of its autonomous vehicles proceeded through an intersection with a green light. unfortunately, the vehicle was struck by an emergency vehicle with its red lights and siren activated. although the autonomous car identified the collision risk and initiated a braking maneuver, it was unable to entirely avoid the crash. the incident resulted in injuries to the sole passenger in the self-driving vehicle, who was transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
the san francisco police department’s preliminary findings revealed that the collision happened while the fire truck was responding to an emergency, its forward-facing red lights and siren in operation.
in a broader context, the california public utilities commission (cpuc) recently voted in favor of permitting robotaxis from cruise and alphabet’s waymo to operate around the clock throughout san francisco, while also allowing them to charge passengers for rides. this decision was met with opposition from residents and city agencies. city attorney david chiu expressed concerns about the readiness of this technology, citing instances where autonomous vehicle performance has hindered the operations of first responders. he has called for a re-evaluation of the decision and highlighted potential negative consequences for the city due to the expansion of autonomous vehicles.
the investigation into cruise’s robotaxi incidents underscores the ongoing challenges and safety concerns associated with autonomous vehicle technology, prompting regulatory bodies and industry players to navigate a delicate balance between innovation and ensuring public safety.

are you struggling with dry, damaged hair this summer? whether your hair is damaged from bleaching or coloring, constant heat styling, or as a result of damage from swimming in harsh chemicals like chlorine or time spent in the sun, nothing is more frustrating than damaged hair that is hard to style. luckily, there are ways to repair your damaged locks that are as easy as streamlining workplace communication with votacall!
in today’s blog, we will discuss three simple but effective ways to repair your dry, damaged hair, so your locks will be healthy, shiny, and soft in no time!
1. invest in high-quality shampoo and conditioner
the products you use on your hair can make a major difference in its health! while spending a lot of money on salon-quality products might be less than desirable, investing in a good shampoo and conditioner can make all the difference if you’re dealing with dry, damaged hair. not only will it bring back much-needed moisture to your locks, but it can also help prevent further damage. look for products specifically designed for dry, damaged hair, as they will contain ingredients such as ceramides or keratin which can help repair and strengthen your hair. with regular use, you’ll start to notice your locks looking and feeling softer, smoother, and overall healthier.
2. cut back on heat styling
styling your hair with straighteners, curling irons, blow dryers, and other hot tools might make your hair look great – but these tools can lead to excessive damage over time. instead of frying your hair with hot tools, try air-drying your hair or using non-heat styling methods like rollers or braids. if you need to use heat styling tools, use a heat protection spray and keep the temperature at a minimum. by avoiding heat styling wherever possible, you can help prevent further damage and keep your hair looking healthy and strong.
3. get regular trims
split ends and damaged strands are not only visually unappealing but can lead to further breakage and damage over time as they leave your hair vulnerable. in order to keep your hair looking and feeling as healthy as possible, be sure to get regular trims and keep split ends to a minimum. this is one of the easiest ways to keep your hair looking great, even after a considerable amount of damage as a result of heat styling or coloring.
