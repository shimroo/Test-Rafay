        ceramic morphologies exhibition at the canadian clay and glass gallery

              



ceramic morphologies showcases the creative potential of 3d printing in architectural ceramic design. featuring works produced through robotic fabrication alongside traditional methods of craft, the exhibition explores new form languages that emerge from the interaction between clay’s fluidity and precision-driven tools.

the university of waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the neutral, anishinaabeg, and haudenosaunee peoples. our main campus is situated on the haldimand tract, the land granted to the six nations that includes six miles on each side of the grand river. our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the office of indigenous relations.
