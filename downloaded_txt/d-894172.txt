night night





so, following the recent sleep issues we've been having, i instituted the night-night circuit.  we say goodnight to all the animals and bye-bye to all the lights, then night-night for mama and in to bed with whatever lovvey of the day he wants to bring.  this has been working wonderfully.  if it doesn't work, we wait a few minutes and repeat the process topless so the nursing can begin before going in to lay down.  the fact that this helps has helped me understand some of the feelings the razz is probably having, as i get the same thing: i'm exhausted but for some reason have a non-specific anxiety about actually going to sleep.  that's a horrible feeling and if that's what he feels, i'm into doing whatever i can to help him deal with it.  but that's not really the point here.  the point is, the razz is freakin' adorable.  he has a fascination with vacuum cleaners, brooms, and more recently, air conditioning vents.  in the last couple of weeks his choices of lovveys has included a toy broom, a real broom, and the dirt devil cone vac twice.  last night, as we made the rounds the second time, he directed me to both the full-sized vacuum and the little cone vac to say good night to them (complete with night-night kisses) and then to the air conditioning vent.  thankfully, he settled for waving bye-bye to the vent.  i wasn't looking forward to hoisting him up there to give it a kiss, especially if it was going to turn into night-night kisses for all of the vents!

c25k, 100 pushups progress





i'm currently working through the couch to 5k beginning running program from coolrunning.com.  i've started this program before, but never made it to the end.  right now i have finished the first three weeks, and my knees are killing me.  since several other programs i've looked at have a week off during the third week to avoid injury (with no-impact activity instead, such as biking or swimming), i've decided to go ahead and take a week off and let my knees recover a bit.  my plan is to jump back in and repeat week three after this week of rest and move on with the rest of the schedule.  that makes this wednesday my first day back on.  hopefully i'll be ready by then.  one of the problems i had with c25k last time around was the off days.  i get really enthusiastic at the beginning and taking days off makes me lose steam.  so, to avoid this situation, i'm also doing the 100 pushups thing from hundredpushups.com on the c25k off days.  i'm doing this on an incline using the stairs, as i'm completely unable to do a single pushup at the moment (or at least i was when i started, not so much now!).  after making it through the first two weeks, i wasn't able to make the cutoff to move on but i did do well enough to move over one column, so i decided to go ahead and start from the beginning again in column 2.  i'm loving the way this is going.  i'm up to 40 pushups (not all at once!) and i am actually starting to believe that eventually i will be able to do the promised 100, even if it will take more than the scheduled 6 weeks.  my prediction is that after i finish weeks 1 and 2 for the second time, i will move back to column 1 for weeks 3 and 4, and then repeat 3 and 4 in column 2 before moving on to the final two weeks (which i will also probably need to perform once in column 1 and a second time in column 2).  we'll see.
