gastric band hypnosis manual



            for qualified hypnotherapists only - help your obese clients to lose weight with this
            
            hypnotic world gastric band manual for professional 
			hypnotherapists. 
            the success stories of 
            having a hypnotic gastric band have been well documented in the news 
            recently with a reported success rate of up to 80 per cent, which is 
            higher than actually having the surgical procedure (which only works 
            for approximately 70 per cent of people). 
            your clients can now feel as though they have experienced the 
			procedure without the unwanted side effects associated with surgery  
			- while losing weight at a fraction of the cost of the actual 
			operation.

            includes free entry to the gastric band hypnotherapy register.
