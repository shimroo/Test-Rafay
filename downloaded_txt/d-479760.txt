visitbest shaker village tour in america“this is a must-see. we’ve been to other shaker villages in america. this one is the best because the people who lead these tours know the last shakers. so, the talk had a personal depth that is absent from the other shaker sites, that are run by museum companies.”ronasomerville, tripadvisor review
