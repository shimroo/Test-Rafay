excitement builds for district 13 gnts feb. 22-23 in niles


plans roll out for district 13 gnts 
topping ccba's calendar this weekend, feb. 22-23, is the annual district 13 grand national teams competition in a new location--the white eagle banquet center in niles.      
gnts at the center, already a familiar site for many ccba players, will start at  11 a.m. and tba.
the championship flight and flight a and flight b events will take place over four sessions saturday and sunday. flight c will be a two-session event played on sunday only. under acbl rules, there is no competition between the three flights. players choose the flight in which they plan to play.
there is no mp limit for the championship flight. flight a players must have fewer than 6,000 mps, flight b fewer than 3,000 mps, and flight c players may not be life masters and must have fewer than 750 mps.
flight eligibility was established by acbl’s september 2024 mp cycle.  
suzi subeck, a district 13 director and the gnt coordinator, stressed the need for pre-registration by all teams. for more information, contact suzi at stansubeck@prodigy.net. 
entering teams must provide written confirmation by email or letter. no team without a written confirmation should assume that entry has been verified. captains should bring the written confirmation to the site and be prepared to present it when purchasing an entry.
information about the gnts is also in the dec.-jan. 2025 kibitzer (open "the kibitzer" link at the top of the page).
