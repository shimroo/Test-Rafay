“those are regulars, by god
!” is the title of the painting done by hugh charles
mcbarron. 
the subject is the 22nd infantry
at the battle of chippewa, july 5, 1814. a mounted field grade
officer at left is leading the line of infantry, while
a company grade officer at the right encourages the soldiers to
hold the line steady as men fall under fire from musket and
cannon. another 
company grade officer is being struck and falling, just to the
right of the flags. they are the only soldiers wearing the
standard dark blue coat 
of the us infantry. all the rest are wearing the grey jackets in
which general scott outfitted the men of the 22nd.
the darker flag is the colors 
of the 22nd
infantry. the lighter colored flag is the 22nd
infantry battle flag. the battle flag consisted of the scroll
from the bottom of the
regimental colors against a background of a solid bright color,
in this case yellow, which could be easily seen above the
battlefield. in the
original painting and prints the scrolls can be seen to contain
the words “twenty second regiment infantry”.
 





 
 
 
a private of the 22nd
        infantry as he would have appeared
        on the field at chippewa, july 5, 1814.
he wears the model 1813 black
        leather shako 
        with a silver colored regimental cap plate and 
        white plume and tassels, the plain grey wool jacket 
        worn by most of the regiments in scott's brigade,
        white trousers, and black leather shoes with canvas
        gaiters.
the knapsack on his back and
        the haversack slung on his left side
        are painted blue to waterproof them. the black leather
        cartridge box
        slung at his right side has a wooden block in it which
        contains 26 cartridges 
        each containing a lead ball and individual gunpowder
        charge, 
        rolled into a paper cartridge. in combat the soldier
        would bite the end off the cartridge and use the wrapper
        as wadding
        to hold the powder and ball in place. 
        under the block was a tin container which held 12 more
        cartridges,
        flints and oil rags. also slung on his left side is his
        bayonet scabbard,
        the tip of which can just be seen below his cartridge
        box, and his 
        wooden canteen, slung over the top of the haversack.
his musket is an american made
        copy of a late 18th century french design,
        having a bore of .69 caliber and a 16 inch long
        triangular shaped bayonet.

to all veterans of 1st
battalion 22nd infantry who served in the 4th infantry division:
the 4th infantry
division association needs your membership and support. the
association is an organization devoted to the
preservation of the comraderie experienced while serving in the
division. the 4th infantry division association is one of the
best
of its kind. it co-operates and co-ordinates with the division
currently serving at fort carson, holds reunions, sponsors
scholarships,
and publishes both a hard copy magazine and an e-mail newsletter.

the association was formed in 1919, of veterans of world war one,
and as those veterans aged, they turned over the running 
of the association to the veterans of world war two, who then
turned it over to the veterans of vietnam. it is now time
for those aging veterans to turn over the association to the
younger veterans of the global war on terrorism. 

so you younger veterans of the 4th infantry division who served
in peacetime, and in iraq and afghanistan, the association
especially needs you! we need you to join, and if you can, to
step into leadership positions in the organization. 

to view the types of memberships available, go to the link below.
once there, click on the join now option

22nd infantry regiment paver
project
 
the national infantry
museum at fort benning, georgia has initiated a program to allow 
for individuals and organizations to purchase memorial pavers
along the heritage walkway 
at the museum. that walkway leads to our 22nd infantry regiment
monument on the walk of 
honor at the national infantry museum. the pavers can be
purchased to memorialize the 
service of a veteran or to honor the memory of a fallen soldier. 
below are a couple of
samples of what those pavers can look like:

the national infantry
museum is offering the 22nd infantry regiment society a special 
discounted price of $200 ($50 savings) which includes a 2" x
4" miniature replica for 
your desktop or memento display. all pavers will be in place
along the walkway and 
dedicated at a formal ceremony which will take place on veterans
day november 11, 2020. 
the discount price will remain in effect until they have sold out
the alloted number of pavers.
