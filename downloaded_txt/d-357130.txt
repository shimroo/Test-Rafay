the unknown editor



                                        the unknown editor has been spouting off about a variety of topics since he started this site back in 2001.  sometimes he's all wound up about a microwave topic; other times it's random stuff like new orleans jazz, suvs, or gilligan's island.  read his latest diatribe here, or visit the amazing unknown editor's archives when you're looking for a way to waste a couple of hours or more.
