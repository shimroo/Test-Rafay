"eileen and pastor donald havrilla, of the southampton full gospel church and founders of mroh in leogane, haiti in 1982."




"students on their way to school"










mission reach out haiti is a non-profit humanitarian organization committed to improving the quality of life for the people of haiti.


we believe the most effective way to change lives is through a combination of spiritual, nutritional, and educational methods. 


since 1982, mroh has been an outreach ministry of the southampton full gospel church in southampton, ny


80% of mroh funding comes from individuals who sponsor a child for $20 a month. we could not operate this mission and help so many children without their monthly support.


mroh does not believe that the key to haiti's future is another "welfare" program. this neighboring country's future depends on the development of her children into strong, responsible, christian leaders able to have a positive impact in their communities.


our present field staff consists of 100 haitian men and women training up the next generation of christian leaders. that's what mission reach out is about!!!
