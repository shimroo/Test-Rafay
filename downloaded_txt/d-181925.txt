ignatius was green


ecological dimensions of the spiritual exercises


margaret scott, aci

"ignatius was brought up in the lap of nature and developed a fondness for creation". this book offers a new and exciting reading of the spiritual exercises of st ignatius based on his basque roots and love of nature. a prayerful re-reading of the text discovers an ecological dimension running all through the exercises that, in a rapidly heating world, can offer an ignatian-based new relationship with creation and adds urgency to the commitment to care.

"the ecological conversion we need to save us and our planet requires a new way to relate to god, to creation, and to each other. sr. margaret charts that way, unlocking st. ignatius and the spiritual exercises to show us the god at loving work in all his creatures."
—austen ivereigh, pope francis biographer and author of first belong to god: on retreat with pope francis.
"ignatius was green breaks new ground in ignatian spirituality as a means for discernment regarding the crucial ecological issues of our time. sister margaret scott's beautiful new book is a must-read for those who are committed to sustaining life on our planet."
—james martin, sj, author of the jesuit guide to (almost) everything.
