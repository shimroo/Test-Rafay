serving breakfast all day since 1993

							our first café opened for breakfast at about 7am one morning in
							1993. settled in a quiet neighborhood called candler park on the
							east side of atlanta, we sold out of our signature biscuits by
							11am that day
						

							more than 30 years later, we are an institution–growing to 34
							locations throughout georgia, north carolina, florida and texas.
							but we always kept that quintessential neighborhood spirit and
							focused on our southern-inspired menu of comfort food made with
							fresh ingredients.
						

							though we’re famous for our grits and biscuits (we bake almost
							5,000 biscuits per week at each location), our loyal guests
							throughout the southeast come join us to enjoy breakfast, lunch
							and dinner throughout the day.
