						"i have been a homeowner who has been using farnsworth as my property management company since jan of 2024. farnsworth acquired my previous property management company, and i am so glad they did! kelli and her team are top-notch with communication and support. i had a difficult tenant situation, and i did not have to micromanage the process. kelli was on top of it all."
