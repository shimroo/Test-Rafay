nevada sharpshooter
experience! i have been handicapping since my early twenties and have done it for a living since 1996. my favorite sports to pick are college and pro football (football is still the gamblers favorite game), college basketball (the big dance is the best tournament in all of sports) and baseball (america's pastime and for many an overlooked opportunity for profit). my least favorite sports to pick, i rarely will pick nba games. in my opinion, baseball is a much better money maker than nba basketball day in and day out. check out my guaranteed daily action and take aim at vegas today! you can receive free football picks, free basketball picks, and free baseball picks on my free pick page every day.
