from our beginning in 1932, our primary focus has been to manufacture energy saving window and door products. throughout our history we have established ourselves as an innovator in the design and manufacturing capability of insulated windows and doors.
stringent product testing and innovative design has allowed our products to evolve as market and consumer needs change. in the winter of 1989-90 we started to conceptualize and design our rhino commercial aluminum window and door series. today we have several commercial window styles and doors in the rhino line. this window and door series consists of a commercial horizontal slider, casement, single hung, double hung, hopper, awning, fixed and patio door. each rhino window reflects the design and manufacturing expertise we've implemented over the years. we also publish our aama test results to back up our claims of product performance and quality.
the 90's continued to bring change in the window and door industry. to keep abreast of the new performance demands and innovation that have become a part of all of our lives, we started to plan and create yet another new product line in 1993, comfort series vinyl windows and patio doors. comfort series vinyl products were designed to meet the demands of the 21st century for the new construction and replacement markets. the foundation for all of our products and our success as a company is based on high quality maintenance free products, fair pricing, and service after the sale. we want to offer our customers products of value, the best value for their money.
our window and door products are sold throughout north america by professional building material distributors and dealers. we have taken the initiative to continue company growth with innovative new designs and quality new products. this philosophy and commitment is the legacy of gerkin windows & doors.
