the full moon oyster bar is a popular watering hole 
and seafood restaurant located in clemmons nc, 
southern pines nc, morrisville nc, jamestown nc, 
concord nc, atlantic beach, nc, and now in asheboro, 
nc. boasting some of the freshest seafood anywhere, 
our homemade recipes have been handed down over 
the years making our soups and original entrees some 
of the best in the southeast. like the traditional steam 
houses down on our coast, we have learned that fresh 
oysters and other shellfish delights, are best prepared 
raw or steamed to preserve the salty good freshness 
we love. we also offer grilled, baked, and select fried 
items prepared to order.
