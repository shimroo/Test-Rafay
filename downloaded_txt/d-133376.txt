p p c

google adwords, bing ads, facebook
bing ads and facebook offer particularly good value-for-money (roi) at the moment - given the drop in power of seo.

we can help  you create a new website for your company or improve an existing one. our complete range  services includes:

social media marketing – exploit your blog via twitter, facebook, linkedin etc 
ppc – setting up or full management of your pay per click campaign (google adwords & microsoft adcenter)

 principles of website marketing
the principles of effective marketing have not changed; they have just been  modified to address the opportunities offered by the internet.
  our strong marketing background ensures that the visitors to your company's site are  the right visitors. there is no point in ranking number one in a search and  having large volumes of visitors if they don’t stay long enough to spend their  money!
 what are your marketing  objectives? we need to understand them before we start your website marketing  campaign. 
  our website marketing services are always a joint effort between you and us. we  both need to understand your business goals and objectives before we start any  project.

i am not really interested in getting back in to ppc as it cost a lot of money last time for not a lot of return. we have been without it for over a year and what you are doing is still increasing visits and turnover on the site.

i would just like to bring a ray of sunshine to your day (well it did for me).
since we started to work with ian smith, our adwords guru, our results have improved impressively.
these figures are the average across the board, ..
our click through rate has gone from 1% to a very credible 4.5%
our average cost per click has dropped from 87p to 63p (just remember some clicks are still £2+).
our average position has gone from 5.4 to 4.6
so all in all a very good result and with further input we hope to do even better.
