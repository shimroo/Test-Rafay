our heritage





our history began more than 80 years ago with two businesses – farnell in europe and newark in north america. each began with a simple mission of delivering customers the products they need, when they need them.
since their humble beginnings in the 1930s, these two local businesses selling radio parts transformed into a global distributor of products and technology for electronic and industrial system
                                design, maintenance, and repair.
