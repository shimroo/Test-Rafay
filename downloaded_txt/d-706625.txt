orion’s river guide staff





hand-picked & personally trained

 

along with being one of the oldest rafting companies still in operation in the state of washington, there are many other things that make orion expeditions a unique pacific northwest entity.  orion expeditions is a community bonded through the love of rivers and their therapeutic power. the company was founded in 1978 by people who were invested in bringing people together through outdoor recreation.  our guide training is one-of-a-kind in the pacific northwest, reinforcing the strong community of guides that make up orion.  we are a highly gender balanced company that believes both guys and gals make equally rad, and competent river guides. our trainers are seen as the “elders” of the orion community; passing down experiential knowledge through the development of both hard and soft skills that are crucial for effective outdoor leadership.  if you ask any orion guide the question “what has orion meant to you?” they will likely have a strong sense of community pride, rich with gratitude for the family to which we all belong whole heartedly. original founder and owner, james l. moore sums up orion’s community ethos:“when you join a river running community, you step into an ever-changing, ever-growing mythos with its long-standing pantheon of characters and their deeds. yet there is always room for more and every new guide begins collecting and creating stories from their very first day on the job. a river running community, especially a rafting one, is a collective with shared memories, each one building on the next. all falling together, one on top of the other, like tetris blocks. our stories lay bare our culture. they also enhance it, fortify it, and keep it vibrant.”
