from
'black elk' to 'dances with wolves' tipis have been inspirational since
the beginning. we view the indian tipi as an alternative form of
shelter that is a naturally practical way to live or camp in harmony
with the elements. tipis represent the essence of environmentally
friendly living. 



tipis create an elegant, portable, home away from home, whether it is
used as a summer camp, a guest lodge or a weekend getaway. tipis are
used all over the country/world at: rendezvous, guest ranches, healing
retreat centers, and powwows, just to mention a few. in backyards all
across america, tipis have replaced the gazebo for family home
entertainment.



at spirit tipis, our aim is to make the highest quality tipi possible,
using the finest materials and meticulous workmanship. our emphasis is
in creating a tipi that is durable and artistically pleasing. we want
your spirit tipi to be an exhilarating part of your life, for many
moons to come. enjoy.
