lorraine hansberry: sighted eyes/feeling heart
peabody award winner
john e. oconnor award winner the american historical association
named 2019 notable video by the american library association
naacp image award winner 
lorraine hansberry wrote the classic play a raisin in the sun. lorraine hansberry: sighted eyes/feeling heart (broadcast on pbs' american masters series in january 2018) is the first ever feature documentary on her complex life and it explores both her artistic achievements and political activism. the film features interviews with the plays original cast members, sidney poitier, ruby dee, louis gossett, jr. and glynn turman, director lloyd richards, producer phil rose, supporter harry belafonte as well as writer amiri baraka along with excerpts from the 1961 hollywood movie. 

many people only know hansberry for that achievement but lorraine hansberry: sighted eyes/feeling heart makes abundantly clear that there is much more to know. filmmakers tracy heather strain and randall maclowry combed archives worldwide and had unprecedented access to hansberrys personal papers, archives, home movies and photos. like her writing and activism, the film draws attention to some of the most outstanding issues of the mid-twentieth century and beyond (racial justice, colonialism, feminism, class divisions, sexuality) and addresses the role of artists and intellectuals in bringing them to center stage. in addition to being attainable from california newsreel, lorraine hansberry: sighted eyes/feeling heart is now available through the educational streaming platforms kanopy, alexander street and films media group. kanopy is including the film among the "must-see films for every major". please visit the film's page on the california newsreel website for information on public screenings.
