i had the program up and running in minutes. issuing work orders couldn’t be any easier, and the program’s other features are just as intuitive.

one of the easiest cmms programs to setup and use. the ability to add photos and drawings to parts and equipment in fastmaint is a blessing. this is often a option in other cmms packages. reports, work orders and purchase orders are very professional in appearance and functionality.

the business case for maintenance management software 



maintenance planners and supervisors know how maintenance management software can help them improve maintenance operations. secondly, they can reduce maintenance costs as well as operations costs due to improved equipment reliability.however, it is often hard to convince senior management or company owners to buy a maintenance program. above all there are many other areas besides maintenance where money can be spent! at the same time improvements in many of these areas could  be better for business operations.so how does one justify putting limited budget dollars to get a maintenance management program versus spending it elsewhere?

maintenance software: what should you be looking for? 



maintenance management covers a wide area since regular maintenance is needed for many assets. therefore a maintenance software program is not just useful in locations with a lot of machines – for instance manufacturing plants, mining operations and so on. secondly it is useful when you have a lot of facilities needing maintenance – for example hotels, resorts & restaurants. in addition it is also useful in organizations with a lot of other equipment such as utilities such as power generation plants, water treatment plants and so on.
