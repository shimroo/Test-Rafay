in these times of so much pressure and expectations on our young children, i am grateful for the firm belief in the power of play.


the whole experience of being there with my child is priceless for me. i also love that i have met so many like-minded parents!


an incredibly powerful learning experience… i am a much better parent now than i was before i started participating at the co-op.
