welcome home, follower of jesus



where there is the sense of his presence, of his nearness: it feels like home. like your heart has found a home! and the people you meet when that happens can somehow seem like  family, like we’re all kin — because we’re all looking for the same thing — the sense of his presence! that is what we pray you will find here at alamo city — as we worship, as we study the word, whenever or wherever we’re together — the sense of his presence —- and you will know you’ve found a home for your heart. we often say, “when the king is in the house, anything can happen!” and it’s absolutely true. broken hearts are mended, joy and peace live again, suffering bodies can be healed, and forgiveness & freedom flow!it’s his presence that makes all the difference — and pursuing his presence is our passion!come join us! we can’t wait to meet you & hear your story!pastor david & shirley walker
