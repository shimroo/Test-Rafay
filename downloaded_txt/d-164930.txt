with confidence 
in the abiding and transforming presence 
of the holy spirit in our world,
we participate in the spiritual renewal of the human heart 
so that peace and justice may reign.
 



cenacle constitutions #12

this challenges us to search for the roots of injustice and hatred and war, evils which spring from human hearts, and to recognize the manifestations of them.  as we allow god’s love to transform our own hearts and lives, we become more sensitive to the poor and oppressed upon whom injustice weighs so heavily.  our response must be a willingness to do what we can to alleviate these evils, to engage in the struggle for justice in all ways which are consonant with our vocation. 

















all these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and mary the mother of jesus...acts 1:14our story
