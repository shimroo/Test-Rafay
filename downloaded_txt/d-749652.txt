dasavathaaram - 3.5/5



nice movie, kamal haasan rocks!!i think its one of the first indian movies to have a subject around the chaos theory and the butterfly effectalso the first movie to have george bush, manmohan singh, jayalalitha, karunanidhi.kamal's efforts are definitely laudable and deserves a saluteand yes at 140 crore its india's most  expensive movie**3.5 - 5 points

crazy govt taxes on housing



 after the 5 per cent value added tax (vat)  the state government is levying a 4.5 per cent service tax on all new flats. the whole logic is funny coz already vat is being paid on the entire component that goes into constructing a building. the new taxes so that makes it rs 4.5 lakh for a flat worth rs 50 lakh, plus another 2-3 lakhs for registrations & brokerages. surprisingly this news has come only in mumbai mirror; no other publication or tv channel has picked it up.  i don’t know if this is true or not, if it’s true then am surprised that no one has come out and opposed it.  does anyone have any answers or leads? the story in mumbai mirror  http://www.mumbaimirror.com/net/mmpaper.aspx?page=article&sectid=15&contentid=200806112008061102124783531770627&pageno=1reminds me of stuff being done in gulf to drive out immigrants by raising the cost of living, but then they guys who come to bombay anyways will continue to live in slums & zhoppadpattis while the middle class will be automatically bhagaoed.

"wall street meets 70mm"



 cnbc-tv18 & enlighten film society is showcasing four movies on the stock markets on 5th and 6th june 2008.   5th june 7 pm - wallstreet. 9.30 pm - barbarians at the gate. 6th june 7 pm - boiler room. 9.20 pm - rogue trader.   the fuckall part is they are only being shown in metro adlabs, i’d suggest call up seventymm or clickflix or your local dvd wala and watch it at home in case you can’t make it to town.   nevertheless it’s a nice attempt by these guys.  http://www.filmfest.moneycontrol.com/index.html

vijay tendulkar - r.i.p



vijay tendulkar  one of india's best writer, playwright & overall very brave social activist died today. i would say more than his writing it was his courage to stand up for justice without fear whether supporting  people against bhai thakur in virar or standing in support of mahanagar when attacked by shiv sena or  standing with the displaced people of narmada and many more such things... something that his daughter priya tendulkar did in rajni.  after pula deshpande, this is one of greatest loss to maharashtra. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vijay_tendulkar

snapshots from national park



inspite of living in borivli i went to national park today after more than 10 years, for deepthi it was her first visit to the all famous sanjay gandhi national park.there weren't too many animals just saw a few deers, one leopard and many monkeys... the lion safari was bit vague and the official jeep were missing, and our rickshaw wasnt allowed to enter the kanheri caves region : ( .but the coolest thing was the mini train, the 15 min ride is fun, reminds you of your school picnics and the peddle boating, real paisa vasool stuff.both @ 15 bucks per person.the park was clean, but many of the animals were missing so were the food stalls .. the only food available were the kulfiwalas and the cucumber vendors.maybe next time we can do a group picnic and carry all our food and housie tickets and some booze :)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/borivali_national_parksome images :-

the world this week!!



raj thackeray gave the weekly dose to up wallahs , yawn.....ipl has crossed 30 matches... stil entertaing.mumbai indians are winning thanks to bhajji not playing.no one covered shiv sena's trade and property fair for the marathi manos, even though it was well promoted and some nice copy writing .  bmc wants 41% tax on property rents, yeah right. yashraj films seems to have got it all wrong in 2007-08property prices seem to have fallen 20%, i wonder where in bombaycheerleaders have been replaced by gay dancers. the horny humping sound in the vodafone ad that plays between overs has been muted. the ramdoss health ministry is doing everything apart from healthbillu is not interested in yahoo, i wonder if msft will pickup yahoo stock when they fall today.  markets have bounced back nearly 3k since touching 14500.

another reason not to vote for bjp



protests against ipl cheerleadersthese guys have just lost it, seeing opportunity and publicity they have decided to do ungli where its least required.what happened to all the favorite issues temple, toyota rath,  licking jinnah. 123 nuclear bum.its politicians that need to be banned, specially during cricket and exams. ipl rocks, cheer girls rock, cricket prevails over starved lusty politicians, specially ones who wear half pants and promote celibacy.in 2009 elections its gonna be a choice between jurassic 82 year old vs  37 year old, i know where my vote is gonna go.

microsoft corp's memo to it's indian staff



sorry for the language but this is how the exact memo was.....microsoft's memo to its indian staffthis is a real memo from microsoft hr director in redmond, wa to its staff of indian origin. every word here is kept intact withoutalteration.memo to indian staffin view of the large number of indians working in the usa, uk and manyother countries with white people, it has become important for human resources department to issue directives to their indian staff.to all hindi-speaking staffit has been brought to our attention by several officials visiting ourcorporate headquarters that offensive language is commonly used by our hindi-speaking staff. such behavior, in addition to violating ourpolicy, is highly unprofessional and offensive to both visitors andcolleagues.staff will immediately adhere to the following rules:1. words like chutiya, gandu and other such expressions will not be used for emphasis, no matter how heated the discussion. you will not saychutiye, akkal nahi hai kya tereko when someone makes a mistake, ormadar chod, bhenchod when a major mistake has been made. all formsderived from the verb chod are inappropriate in our environment.2. no project manager, section head or administrator, under anycircumstances, will be referred to as gadha or chutiya. lack ofdetermination will not be referred to as kaamchor saala and neither willpersons who lack initiative be referred to as bhosadikaa or madarchod.3. unusual or creative ideas from your superiors are not to be referredto as gand faadu, if a person is persistent, or if a task is heavy toaccomplish. in a similar way, do not use gand fati, if a colleague is going through a difficult situation.4. furthermore, you must not say bhosade mein gaya when matters becomecomplicated. when asking someone to leave you alone, you must not saydimag ki maa bhen mat kar. do not ever substitute 'may i help you?' with bol teri gand kaise maru?5. when things get tough, an acceptable _expression such as 'we aregoing through a difficult time' should be used, rather than maa chudipadi hai or goti muh mein hai.. 6. no salary increase shall be ever referred to as khairaat baati jaarahi hai kya. under no circumstances should you call our elderlycorporate partners as buddha khoosat.7. last, but not least, after reading this memo, please do not say: ye kagaj gand ponchne ke laayak bhi nahi hai.we hope you will keep thesedirections in mind.sincerely,steve riderhuman resources, director microsoft corporation

liquid prices - fuel for thought : )



got this deadly fwd from sandy.over the weekend, i filled up my car's fuel tank, and i thought fuelhas become really expensive after the recent price hike. but then icompared it with other common liquids and did some quick calculations,and i felt a little better.to know why, see the results below - you'll be surprised at howoutrageous some other pricesare !diesel (regular): rs.! 36.08 pe r litrepetrol (speed): rs.52 per litrecoca cola 330 ml can : rs.20 = rs.61 per litredettol antiseptic 100 ml rs.20 = rs.200 per litreradiator coolant 500 ml rs.160 = rs.320 per litrepantene conditioner 400 ml rs.165 = rs.413 per litremedicinal mouthwash like listerine 100 ml rs.45 = rs. 450 per litrered bull 150 ml can : rs.75 = rs.500 per litrecorex cough syrup 100 ml rs.57 = rs. 570 per litreevian water 500 ml rs. 330 = rs. 660 per litre rs. 660 for a litre ofwater???!!! and the buyers don't even know the source (evian spelledbackwards is naive.)kores whiteout 15 ml rs. 15 = rs. 1000 per litrecup of coffee at any decent business hotel 150 ml rs. 175 = rs. 1167 per litreold spice after shave lotion 100 ml rs. 175 = rs. 1750 per litrepure almond oil 25 ml rs. 68 = rs. 2720 per litreand this is the real kicker... hp deskjet colour ink cartridge 21 mlrs.1900 = rs. 90476 per litre!!!now you know why computer printers are so cheap ? so they have youhooked for the ink !so, the next time you're at the pump, don't curse our honorablepetroleum minister - just be glad your car doesn't run on cough syrup,after shave, coffee, or god forbid, printer ink !

for the last 10 days there have been infinites articles and placed articles mumbai mirror, hindustan times, dna, mid-day etc on car pool, how much fun carpooling is, car poolers are a happy lot etc etc . some paid stories : )http://www.mid-day.com/web/guest/lifeatwork/lifeatwork/article?_ext_5_articleid=1059487&_ext_5_groupid=14http://www.mid-day.com/web/guest/opinion/columns/article?_ext_5_articleid=1032065&_ext_5_groupid=14well, am not against mykoolpool.com or carpool.com or the promotion of these services but what bugs me is that these guys forgot one of the cheapest ideas of pooling… i.e share-e-rickshaw…. not to be confused with share-e-punjab.rickshaws beat cars hands down when it comes to vfm and convenience. • rickshaws run on cng which is cheaper and cleaner than petrol which most cards guzzle. • rickshaw have the latest jhankaar music, no car even with the best kenwood or bose speakers can beat. • rickshaws can go thru shankar gully but cars cant.• you can park rickshaw anywhere, you might go mad finding a parking place for your car.• rickshaws don’t get towed away.• cars have a/c… rickshaws are aircool.• you can update yourself on the mns v/s bihari/up war in the rickshaw and ask questions like rajdeep sardesai. • you are saving india’s forex reserves.on the flip side :• hijras can feel you at every signals • best buses & trucks fart emissions in your face• every other rickshaw passengers tries to ogle or try to catch a glimpse of every rickshaw passenger hoping it’s a maal female…• bad roads can hurt your balls and abs near sakinaka, chincoli bandar, powaihaving said that there still remains the cheapest way to travel in bombay , take the railway pass or best bus which promises unlimited travel for less than 500 per month. : ) btw i travel by bus, shared- rick, local train and occasional car : )
