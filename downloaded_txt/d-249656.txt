roger williams park - providence, ri 



museum of natural history 











this city owned and operated museum, built in 1896, was a nice delight to add to our portfolio!  we were hired to work on the main exhibition room and hall. we prepped and painted the wall and ceilings of the room in a stunning blue-angled color scheme.this was a very fun project as employees working on it often had huge smiles on their faces as they reminisced about attending the museum while growing up. they got a huge kick out of the fact that they were now working on restoring a room where they had such fond memories of as a child. if you love natural history, this truly is a special place and one that holds a warm space in our hearts. we are very proud to say that we had a part in helping to keep its history alive and well.
