how does stone benchtop resurfacing work? 











stone benchtop resurfacing is a straightforward process designed to transform your existing surfaces without the need for a full renovation. the method involves placing a thin, durable layer of engineered stone—typically 7mm thick—directly over your current benchtops. these stone sheets, either marble or granite, are custom-measured and cut to fit seamlessly, ensuring a perfect finish. the process begins with an assessment of your existing surfaces to ensure they’re suitable for resurfacing. once prepared, the new stone layer is adhered to the benchtop using high-strength adhesives, creating a solid, long-lasting bond. the result is a stunning, premium finish that looks brand new and offers enhanced durability, all completed quickly with minimal disruption to your home.
