      if 
        you've ever tried painting plastercraft (also known as "plaster of paris"), 
        you know what a fun craft it is and it's  easy 
        to paint!  if 
        you haven't, you don't know what a fun time you're missing! if you like to paint ceramics, you'll find that it's the same but there's no firing or kiln necessary. try painting our plastercraft statues  and you will 
        quickly see how easy a professional finish 
        can be. most statues and wall art plaques 
        can be painted in less than an hour!
        plastercrafts are similar to ceramics, but there is no firing or kiln necessary.  simply use easy water based acrylic paints.

      our family has been in the plaster statue 
        manufacturing business since 1962 in new 
        jersey and we have always taken great pride 
        in our quality! from small
        
        christmas ornaments
        
        and
        
        lighted christmas village houses
        
        to our
        
        decorative plaster pedestals
        
        , we  use the highest grade statuary 
        plaster available so our statues have a very 
        high surface strength and the brightest white 
        appearance. they also require less paint because 
        the surface is less porous than traditional 
        statues, so the paint has a solid surface 
        area to adhere to.

        all our plastercraft figurines arrive white, unpainted and are ready to paint unless otherwise specified. why buy painted  when you can paint your own statue? paint it yourself to suit your house decor or just leave them as white art plaster. many of our statues look great unpainted, a great example of a statue that can be left white is the

        . columns and pedestals will also look great white but they can be painted with acrylic latex paint to match your decor. many other classical statues will look great as white-ware.
