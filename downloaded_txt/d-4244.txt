what makes us different?
single-sourced, not crowd-sourced
each transcription we publish comes from a single-source, be it the cemetery office, government office, church office, archived document, a tombstone transcriber. other websites already do an excellent job of crowd-sourcing a single cemetery together. but genealogists also need to see the original records from a single source. that's what we offer.
