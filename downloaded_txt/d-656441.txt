our latest seriesjonah—stories from the depthswe all have moments when we run from god’s call—but what happens when he pursues us anyway? join us for our new sermon series on jonah, a story not just about a prophet and a great fish, but about a god whose mercy is greater than our failures. from storms and second chances to changed hearts and unfathomable love, we’ll explore how jonah’s journey speaks to our own.
