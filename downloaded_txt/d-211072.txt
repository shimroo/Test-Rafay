while the "american" war in vietnam has (deservedly)
received great
attention as one of the most important struggles in the "cold war"
period,
the french indochina war of the late 40s and early 50s has largely been
overlooked - only the image of dien bien phu as an example of utter
defeat
seems to have achieved any common currency.
        
        
        this site is jointly written and maintained by nowfel
leulliot (paris, france) and danny
o'hara (st austell, uk). the authors both have long-standing
interests
in the indochina war, and hope to bring various elements of this
fascinating
conflict to a wider audience. we are both wargamers as well as amateur
military historians, and the intention is to include some overviews of
the two military systems (french and vietnamese) in action, with pieces
on particular unit types, operations/battles, important factors
controlling
the actions of either side, specialist equipment/tactics developed
during
the war, and scenarios/ideas for wargaming the various aspects of the
indochina
war. please mail any comments, criticisms or ideas to the authors. 
the site will obviously be somewhat limited initially, but
it will grow
as time permits. here are the various parts which are planned for this
site (look at the site map for detailed
contents)
: 

 what's new :
so
that
you know what
we're up to... 
 history :
this
is the
place where you will find the more general articles about the war. 
 cefeo : an
overview of
the french far-east expeditionary corps. 
 viet minh :
an
overview
of the people's army of vietnam. 
 operations :
some of the major
operations and campaigns conducted by the cefeo and viet minh,
1945-54. 
 scenarios :
scenarios,
both historical and generic, and ideas for wargaming the various
aspects
of the indochina war. 
 terrain :
photos of representative
terrain (not all of indochina is jungle or rice paddies). 
 misc. :
various bits and
pieces that don't really fit anywhere else. 
 links : well,
every site's got
to have them even if there aren't that many. 
 site map :
hopefully this should
help you find your way about the site.




much of the material presented here is translated from french sources,
and several bits have not appeared in english before. it is hoped that
some interest in researching and wargaming this war will be started by
the various pages which we intend to publish, and if anyone does
"borrow"
text or images from the site, we would appreciate a mention!
