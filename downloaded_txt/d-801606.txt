welcome to woodstock

            we are a bristol based bespoke furniture makers established in 1989.
            
            over the years we have earned a reputation for high quality furniture and superb customer service.
            
            we have a very high rate of returning clients and recommendations.
          

 



            our workshop is uk based and we pride ourselves in selling affordable furniture. from order to delivery our furniture is usually completed within 3-4 weeks.
          

            a large percentage of our clients prefer reclaimed timber. reclaimed timber has distinct characteristics and colour when combined with our beautiful wax finish.
          

            when our clients require a painted finish we prefer to use new timber, this is kiln dried sustainable scandinavian redwood, a type of pine. 
          

            we offer an extensive range of colours including paints from farrow & ball, dulux and fired earth. this choice offers an outstanding selection of paint which will enhance and compliment your home.
          

            our selection process ensures we use the finest reclaimed timber which has aged and seasoned often being over 150 years old. here at woodstock we aim to provide a high quality product in sustainable timber that is environmentally sensitive.
