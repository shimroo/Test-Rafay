    ashes by arturo cisneros poireth, tr. diana sánchez rivera
  


by arturo cisneros poireth, tr. diana sánchez riverawhen i woke up, the pillow was soaked in black. it was sweat, and it was black. i went to the bathroom, and in the mirror, i saw a dark stain on my ear, like a dried thread of blood, but it wasn’t blood. ashes were coming out of my ear. i scratched with my pinky finger, trying to clean it with my nail, which came out blackened.

by connor whitewhen walt pulled the van into a parking spot beside the baseball fields, the watkins kid was standing out in centerfield, unaccompanied, a cigarette dangling from his lips and a mitt hatted on his head as he beat the carcass of a dead raccoon with a stick.

    2024 online fiction contest winner: circulation line
  


by jisoo hope yoonin the dark i dream only of bottomless mimosas. when i wake my neck is stiff, a sharp sideways pain like the grind of a screw rusted orange. i right my head and immediately lock eyes with a middle-aged man sitting across from me, too-tight-suit revealing the contour of a soju belly from nights downing pork grease and alcohol to satisfy his boss’s whims.

    2024 online translation contest winner: mériéma
  


by isabelle eberhardt, translated by donald masona low sky, opaque, incandescent; a dull, rayless, burning sun. on the dust about, covering everything, and on the white and grey fronts of the houses, the blinding heat, unrelenting, reverberates, seeming to emanate from some interior hearth hidden within the earth. along the angled crests of the hills, kindled with dryness, some low flames lie darkly brooding—the reddish-coloured smoke amassing behind the mountains about figuig.

by clement yuenobody loves this bird. very few even really know what it looks like. it perches hidden in thick arboreal foliage⎯black plumage indistinguishable from the canopic shadows. i used to think it was yellow, until someone pointed out to my embarrassment that i was looking at orioles all my life.

    god’s touch in nicolette polek’s bitter water opera
  


by ali banachthe work’s size, its breathless metaphors, and its coquette-ish design all point toward contemporary trends that have spawned due to digitally-minded, attention-deficit reading lives. however, as a departure from other contemporary fragmentation, the book’s preoccupation with mysticism creates an internal justification for such formal choices.

    doubting the flare
  


by casey brookssomewhere there is a heartbeat on the bus. to sit upright was a seldom ignorable terror, no matter how much has been lost. it makes it bulge out, defiling form and function. today was different, the earth was, for the first time, in transit with a radiant body. its light melted away the sticky mold that was a life resigned to semi-consciousness.

    story & five poems
  


by ivy charit was celia who first called me h. although we were close, having known each other since kindergarten, i had learned to stray from topics that might turn to points of contention, as was apparently the case with the letter. and besides, there existed the distinct possibility, advanced by the satisfied look on her face, that this was all some sort of friendly challenge. “why ‘h?’” i wondered, and wondered often.

    i tether myself to you: a conversation with alexandra tanner
  


by yasmin roshaniani think of this novel as an existentialist novel. not in any pretentious, philosophical sense, but in the sense that it is really, really hard to know who you are right now. there’s complete information saturation and bombardment.
