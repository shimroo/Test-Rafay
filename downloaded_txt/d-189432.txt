backwater to baywater
the ultimate fishing machine
at action craft, we never compromise. we constantly enhance our products by listening to our customers and focusing on every detail, from research and development to top-quality materials and hand craftsmanship, to ensure every inch of an action craft is top-notch. when you're ready for serious fishing action, rest assured that your action craft will be ready for you.






qui-dry® hull
our innovative design features a bow chine for quieter fishing by minimizing hull slap, while a built-in spray rail and modified strakes reduce wet surfaces, ensuring a drier and more comfortable ride in choppy waters.



pocket-drive
a pocket beneath the transom lowers draft by channeling water to the prop, improving performance, economy, and shallow water capability through higher outboard mounting and reduced motor drag.



premier build quality
with a vinyl ester resin barrier coat, all hand laid, composite cored, foam injected with uni-hull construction, you know you’re getting the best.



versatility
a seasoned team of dedicated craftsman custom building boats one at a time. with so many factory options available, we’re sure we can build the boat of your dreams.














bay boats
