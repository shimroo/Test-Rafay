midwest shiba inu rescuemidwest shiba inu rescue (msir) was founded in 2002 and is a a registered 501(c)3 non-profit and licensed rescue.  we help to save and place shiba inus throughout the midwest, including minnesota, nebraska, iowa, missouri, kansas, wisconsin, michigan, illinois and indiana.msir does not have a facility - we are a network of volunteers and foster homes throughout the midwest.  msir dogs live in volunteer foster homes where their medical needs are taken care of and they receive love, care and a little training until they can be placed in their forever home.  you can learn more about our adoption process here.msir is a non-profit organization that is able to care for and find loving homes for shibas thanks to our generous volunteers and donors.  some of the dogs we save are in danger of being euthanized in shelters, others are released from puppy mills, come in as strays, have medical or behavior issues or are from homes where their owners are not able to care for them anymore. we always are in need of more foster homes, volunteers and donations to provide care.  please learn more about how you can help here.

foster luna here to remind you of our #givingtuesday campaign 🐶

all funds go to benefit our dogs in need of medical assistance (dior last year needed a leg surgery to the tune of about $5300!) as well as routine vet care, preventatives & supplies! 

🔗 in story










we are starting off #givingtuesday with lucky. 🍀

lucky was a beautiful soul that came to us in her darkest hour. found by a few kind souls in minnesota abandoned & broken, we heard her story & knew immediately we had to help. our initial vet estimate was roughly $7,000 but we couldn't turn her away. 

we got her the best veterinary care, but unfortunately she had been neglected far too long & her prognosis was not good. she passed, but not before knowing what love was 🌈

if you're in a place to do so, we'd love for you to honor this little fighter with a donation today.

we can't believe luna is still available for adoption!! 😯

luna loves getting cuddles and pets and is looking for a patient home where she can wander in a fenced yard and get comfy on the couch. 🏡 she loves stealing toys and loves treats.

last night, two of our msir coordinators attended the annual bailing out benji bark after dark gala in representation of the work we do for the shibas. it felt like an incredibly fitting way to spend puppy mill awareness day! 🩵

one of the biggest take aways of the night was the importance of working together (nonprofits & breeders alike) to push for better tomorrows for the dogs and ensure their needs are being met. 

honorable mention goes to pawbassador tora, who drove 3.5 hours with her mom both ways to advocate! 🐾




















please consider donating to our organization and save a shiba!
