the year was 1939. franklin roosevelt was president of the united states, the world fair in new york would make its debut, england and france declare war on germany, the green bay packers win the pro football championship, the new york yankees win the world series, and several movie classics reach the big screen including the wizard of oz and the academy award winner, gone with the wind…





*(in spain, for centuries, las postas were inns built for king’s rest, and were stationed along important travel routes. they were also used as mail drops.)

when i was a child, from texas, my family would stop by and eat on the way to and from california and i always loved it so much! this was in the 60's and i remember there were poor indian people sitting outside as we left begging for money. one day i will just have to drive over and have a feast!

with wife jean and children louise and mike, we dined at la posta in 1966. 49 years ago.. now in the uk, after a career in space exploration, chasing comets such as comet halley, the white sands missile range was the launch site of an experiment to detect cosmic dust in space above our atmosphere. more space missions followed from those beginnings, culminating in the rosetta mission now rendezvousing with comet . we brown bagged it, a novelty for europeans!
la posta was the place to eat well, when at the range and the chili con queso is remembered by my wife as the best ever. some recommendation, spanning 49 years and being 81 tomorrow.

best mexican food i've ever eaten...and i grew up in el paso (lived there 1960's, 70's, early 80's). my son, now 35 years old said his first word at la posta, "hot" in 1980.

from 1969 to 1971 i was stationed at fort bliss in el paso. being a boy from tn, i had no concept of mexican food. i was also a picky eater and refused to try mexican food until i was only 3 months from being discharged from the army. what a fool i was!

a friend and i drove to las cruces one weekend and ended up in mesilla. he talked me into trying mexican food and my first bite ever was at la posta. i asked the server what i should order and they told me that a lot of people liked the chili rellenos, so that's what i ordered. wow!! it was love at first bite. i ended up eating 3 that day and making the drive up from el paso many more times before i was discharged.

a few years later i went back to el paso for a visit and made a beeline for la posta. it was just as wonderful as the last visit. during that visit i bought a small cookbook that had their recipes inside. i just called the restaurant today (2-11-15) to see if i could get another copy as mine vanished years ago. sadly, they no longer sell it. i guess i will just need to plan a trip from pensacola to mesilla soon so i can have some real mexican food again!!!
