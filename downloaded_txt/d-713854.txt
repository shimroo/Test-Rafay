podcast with dr. allee:"our corporation"

i am so excited to join you as we begin another school year! i hope each of you are finding time to relax and enjoy some family time. i anticipate the start of school just as much as the next person. this is the time of year where i walk up and down the school supply aisle trying to decide if i need a new ink pen or mechanical pencil. and, the student in me loves to smell crayola crayons; something about that smell takes me back to my elementary years.  i want to thank you in advance for entrusting our teachers, staff, and support staff with your precious gift, your child, each and every day of their school career. as educators, we take our job very seriously to ensure that your child receives an education to prepare them for the world of work in an environment that is safe and nurturing while providing the appropriate measure of fun and enthusiasm to generate excitement for education. we are here to serve you and our community. please let us know if you see an area of need, either personally or within our school and neighborhoods. i know that our district reaches far and wide and that we provide education for a vast majority of fountain county. it is our goal to be the best provider of education, so please let us know how we can make the educational experience better.
