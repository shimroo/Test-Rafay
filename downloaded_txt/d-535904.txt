welcome to port harbor marine 
 in june of 1965 an abandoned fish cannery on the south portland shore of the fore river was converted into a small marina. by the winter of 1974 the marina had only experienced limited growth, provided few services and had less than 20 usable boat slips.

in april of 1974 the marina was sold to its present owner and under its new management expanded to a full service marina. sales of boats and motors were added. slips increased to 30 and 30 moorings were added.
