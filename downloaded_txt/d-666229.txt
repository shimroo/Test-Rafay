rambus inc. song of the day (1527) - backdated



(it was in my box & posting a backdated tune seemed to be rambus-like for the longterm longs . . . )let it be known.  you can be a rambus investor.  you can put up with a management team that sets new standards for incompetence and shareholder abuse.  you can put up with good-for-less-than-nothing patent legal judges like whyte and kramer.  you can put up with seeing things that are hard to explain without the consideration of bribery.  it's ...... "just not easy"  by  the allman brothers band  (1979)    enlightened rogues -- the allman brothers band yeah, i've been "enlightened" holding rmbs for 11 frickin' years

rambus inc. song of the day (1348) - backdated



how could the beatles have known that kramer and whyte would show such a level of irresponsibility, laziness and appear to raise some suspicion of being corrupt?  how did they know the "duo of delay" would set out to prove that "justice delayed is justice denied"? how could the beatles have known that rambus management would be so totally incompetent and shareholder abusive?  how did they end up writing the rambus theme song! "wait"  by  the beatles  (1965) rubber soul -- the beatlessubmitted by finztorite

rambus inc. song of the day (1347) - backdated



ok, so you sat back and watched most of us get kicked in the 'nads for 11 years.  you watched the seemingly corrupt and manipulated patent legal system fail at every step of the way.  you saw the totally pathetic rambus management team (starring "mr. nancy hughes" and "i get paid for nothing" holt) repeatedly abuse the shareholders. now, you're going to buy in at $19 .... and that's after rambus has won more than a handful of the important legal battles.  you're thinking you're going to make money on this never-ending nightmare?  i've got three words for you.   "look out holmes"  by  the filthy rich  (2003)   from the ground up -- the filthy rich  from the name of the band, you know they have been nothing but short rmbssubmitted by finztorite

rambus inc. song of the day (1346) - backdated



it's very likely that 99 out of 100 sane rambus investors will tell you they believe hughes to be incompetent and a total loser.  yet, his wife is willing to make an a** of herself by going on a message board to try to prop up his sorry a**.  it's yet another example of being able to .....
