new hats : langfield and tens field by @strickmich. the first in cotton kureyon (long discontinued) and the second in kureyon. the striping in the yarn really suits the patterns which are mostly the same with one taller/slouchier. the construction is also very similar to rose candy which i knit last year. #rosekimknits
