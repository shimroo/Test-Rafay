wild rivers whitetails 



wild rivers whitetails is located in northern wisconsin, in a region known for its crystal clear wild rivers, upland forests, and the biggest whitetails in north america. our 400+ acre hunting ranch was chosen as a perfect natural environment for whitetail deer. it is truly a beautiful setting with ridges, large tracts of hardwoods and balsam ﬁr trees interspaced with meadows, creeks, and ponds.we regularly see black bear, wolves, red fox, bobcats, and turkey. however, it is the opportunity to bag a massive trophy whitetail buck, that brings our guests from around the world. and we like to think that it is our warm hospitality, personable guides, and spectacular setting that bring our friends back year after year.
