				water restrictions lifted & upcoming wastewater treatment facility workdear residents, we are pleased to inform you that the water restrictions have now been lifted, and our production facility is currently operating at 80% capacity. we appreciate your patience and cooperation throughout this process, and weâ€™re grateful for everyoneâ€™s efforts in conserving water while we worked through these necessary upgrades. looking ahead, our focus now shifts to the next phase of improvementsâ€”the scheduled work on the wastewater treatment facility (wwtp).this important upgrade is set to begin in the middle to end of february, 2025, and we want to ensure everyone is informed about the process: balzer inc. will confirm that the sequencing batch reactors (sbr) are fully drained before the wwtp shutdown.during the shutdown and flow meter replacement, the bypass system will be available for use if required ( we are waiting on a replacement pump before the work can begin).balzer inc. will pre-fabricate as much of the necessary piping as possible ahead of the shutdown to minimize downtime.mpe will provide the procedure for multiple plc (programmable logic controller) shutdowns to ensure a smooth transition.these upgrades are essential to enhancing our water and wastewater management systems, ensuring long-term efficiency and reliability. we appreciate your ongoing support and will continue to provide updates as the work progresses. if you have any questions or concerns, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. thank you for being a valued part of our community! best regards, barry hrehirchuk resort manager
