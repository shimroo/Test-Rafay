best part of it too is that their jamieson eco 2 shoe is still a must own annually. more info here.

d*face releases epic new book the monograph

september 26, 2019









those who have read the southbank coffee table book would be aware that crossfire and d*face shared their very first skate sessions back in the 80s as school kids and grew up learning how to ollie together ahead of shredding every spot around surrey and london. 
dean stockton, aka d*face, is on the cusp of dropping a stunning new book tomorrow containing 20 years worth of exceptional artwork as the follow up to his epic debut coffee table publication, the art of d*face ‚Äì one man & his dog released five years back.
last night we visited his studio to flick through his first copy of the monograph that was fuelled by skateboarding, punk rock, hip hop, carrots and boulders*. it‚Äôs a monstrous insight into his personal art addiction derived from our collective scenes, depicting his stickers, posters, art pieces and murals that have brightened up streets, lamp posts, galleries and the faces of tall buildings across the globe.
inspired by the work of jim phillips, winston smith and shepard fairey (who shares words in the opening pages) the monograph should be on your christmas list for a visual treat that is designed to inspire. you can pick it up at the book depository now (with a 10% discount), shipping worldwide and released tomorrow. 
 btw, those who can identify all the decks on the wall behind him in the photo above will win interweb nerd bragging rights‚Ä¶

crowdfund for the hugo palmer memorial skate park

a new crowdfund to build a new skateable object in the uk for hugo palmer is up and running and is currently two thirds away from reaching the ¬£30,000 target.
hugo and his best friend erwan went backpacking to australia this winter but sadly went missing in the ocean after getting caught in a rip tide and were never found.
‚Äúdue to the unusual circumstances of hugo‚Äôs disappearance, and the resulting lack of closure, it has been very hard to say goodbye and organise a suitable ceremony and lasting tribute, or place to pay our respects to him,‚Äù explains hugo‚Äôs family who are behind the crowdfunding.
once the funds are reached a new skatepark in forest row will get the green light with the local council behind it. it‚Äôs an area that we annually visit on skate trips that is close to our hearts, so please help them reach their target to build a memorial ramp for hugo and a new spot for us all to skate and remember his legacy.
we wish everyone involved in this project the very best. head here to help.

ben raemers ‚Äì xmas jam winner 2008

it‚Äôs with a heavy heart that we, like you, are having to deal with the news of ben raemers‚Äò death. the news only broke 36 hrs ago but already tributes are pouring over the web from those who met him, skated with him and vibed off his wonderful presence. 
we are pretty blown away to wake up to video tributes already.
rob mathieson and friends worked tirelessly to complete this incredible tribute at victoria park where ben conquered the cradle gap.

 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüå†‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è ben you proper rodney plonker! look how many people love you. . i can‚Äôt tag everyone but thank you so much to everyone that came down and helped me today. i love you all. . **also it took a bit of a debate with the park to let me do this today. please if you visit don‚Äôt add anything. even messages to ben. i wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave one myself. it may make them remove it.**

ben was filmed in so many countries over the years that there will be absolutely loads of footage out there dating back to when he was a tiny essex lad destined for success at the highest levels. 
it‚Äôs too early to delve into why he has left us but when the time is right, it‚Äôs worth discussing to help others, but for now take in another video tribute that popped up in our feed today and cast your mind back to how much this guy brought to skateboarding. 
rest in peace, ben. you are sorely missed already. x
