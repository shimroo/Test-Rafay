“jmg is my family forever.”arsene badose’s story is a testament to the transformative power of jmg’s continuum of support. arsene faced the myriad of challenges that come with the collegiate experience. however, with bridging from his jmg high school specialist, michelle bourne, and then with the guidance and support of his jmg college success specialists, randy inosencio and carlo bufano, arsene navigated his way to success.



“i’m actually going to college. i was accepted.”victoria boone was the first person in her family to ever step foot on a college campus as a student. victoria said, “jmg has changed and shaped my life in ways i can’t even explain. they believed in me when it felt like no one else did.” victoria was able to use jmg emergency funds when she needed them and had the support of her jmg specialist, tara gray, every step of the way.


































“i wish i had jmg when i was in high school in farmington. back then when it came to life skills, communications, finances, and team building, we were pretty much on our own. i wish i had this great group of kids to hang out with, to build things, to do budgets, to practice public speaking, to build trust, confidence, and leadership. jmg teaches maine students the skills, the will and ability to determine both their future and ours.”

the honorable gov. janet mills

"jmg taught me what the real world was going to be like. the reason i'm where i am today is because my jmg specialist taught all of us if you want to do something, go for it and give it all you've got. if you don’t try, you'll never know what you're made of. this is how i live my life every day.”

shawn roderickjmg alumnus | senior legislative aide, maine senate





“while an individual program works with 35-40 students, the very presence of jmg has a contagious effect on the entire faculty to adopt a ‘can-do’ spirit for all kids… we see a greater extracurricular involvement once kids get into jmg, and a huge reduction in behavioral issues and absentee rates.”

chris howelljmg board member | rsu 14 superintendent





"the fact that you can have a program with that many caring people that can tailor the needs of that individual student and have that much impact, but the breadth of it at the same time, is really incredible."
