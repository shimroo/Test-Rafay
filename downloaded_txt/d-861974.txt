join our forum...





this will be the last posting on this blog. does this mean that we are closing down? no, we aren't, matter of fact we're still going strong. this just means that we will no longer provide snippets of new uploads or reups here, if you want to know what's going on, then you'll need to join the forum and follow the guidelines posted there. the closing is due in part to us posting some of the new uploads here that we have on the forum only to have people request it elsewhere for someone else to upload(mainly by another blogger who recently went private with their blog), just because they didn't want to follow the guidelines on the forum. some may ask is it worth it, our answer is yes. members from the blog and now on our forum has introduced and reacquainted gospel music fans with so many gospel artists since 2006. while other blogs have tried to duplicate us (and one in particular has by leeching nearly everything), they haven't come close to what our members provide. to join, just click here and sign up. after signing up, you'll need to check your email for validation and you'll be able to sign in. if you're already a member and aren't able to view the board in full, you'll need to read the guidelines to see how to upgrade your account.if you have any other questions, email us at thegospelfillup at gmail dot com.

welcome

i pray that this blog is a blessing to you. the albums here are just a taste for you to go out and purchase the artist's other titles. you can make requests, but be mindful, there are no guarantees. to listen to any of these albums,  sign up and join our forum,the gospel fill up . we hope that when you join, that you don't leech but fully participate and contribute to the forum.if you'd like to donate, then please join our forum, the gospel fill up. 2 corinthians 2:27 says, "every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for god loveth a cheerful giver. " so this site has to go two ways, alright?! we would like to have people's comments and for them to also share whatever they have in return if they have been blessed by a post or anything. remember luke 6:38 "give and it will come back to you, good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over."  thank you for visiting & stay tuned for more, but while you're here, enjoy and be filled!



what's on the forum?

we've received some questions on what's all on the forum, so to those wondering the same, we have a wide arrangement of gospel music, mainly black gospel music. we have albums from contemporary gospel to traditional gospel. some albums that you see with a reup label are albums we've reupped on the forum, you can see what they are by clicking the reup label shown at the bottom of the posts.not everything that we post on the forum will be shown on the blog.what's shown here on the blog is only a small fraction of what we have. nearly everyday there's more being posted, but you have to sign up and contribute to see for yourself.***notice***because of posts deletion from blogger, no further links for any albums will be posted here. if you want what you see you can either join the forum and contribute as well as participate to gain access to our entire album section, or purchase the music from the retailers provided or other online retailers.
