purchasing from blowers was a great overall experience. mark ensured that i was happy all the way through the purchase and they made sure that the product was 100% to spec before selling.
i absolutely love my timepiece – zenith el primero chronomaster grande date (which is discontinued and no longer available for purchase). i will definitely be using blowers for future purchases and 100% recommend them.
thanks so much to the team there!

superb – highly recommended
just purchased an ap royal oak offshore from blowers. been after this model for some time and seen it on the blowers website. got in touch with the guys at the hull branch to discuss a p/x and they dealt with my enquiry very efficiently. they offered me a great p/x trade in, much better than watchfinder. we agreed on the deal and they instantly reserved the watch for me.
top service, great price, what more can i say but superb. thank you to all the team. i love my new ap

my first significant watch purchase and first class service. i was a little nervous as there are many fraudulent companies out there. i spoke with richard smith who was very professional, talked me through the process, altered the strap to my measurements and even offered to whatsapp the images to me.
my watch arrived at 10:30 the next morning very well packaged va royal mail. it’s just as he described. excellent value and even better customer service. if you want to buy a used watch, go to blowers first. thank you richard, a real gentleman.

first time purchase with blowers for a rolex daytona. absolutely first rate! dealt with richard at the hull branch. provided full video of watch and shop. i knew the watch would be in very good condition but was pleasantly surprised that it was almost as good as new! fabulous service and arrived earlier than expected by royal mail. will definitely be using again in future. a perfect example of underpromising and over delivering. darren, worcestershire.

just been dealing with wayne clarkson. slick and easy purchase of explorer 2 3186 movement with polar dial, having been looking for the right one for the last month. very happy with the price (far better value for money than chrono24). consulted a friend who has also bought from blowers… his words ‘their rock solid, you’ll have no problems, buy it’.
so i did…. deal was straight forward and no nonsense. can’t wait for it to arrive.
