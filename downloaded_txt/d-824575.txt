proletarian democracy


        how will economics, politics and culture work
        when the working class runs modern society?




	how the communications revolution
	will transform the "left ecosystem".
	a communist trend of trends
	will eradicate sectarianism,
	puncture the influence of reformism,
	and capture the imagination of millions.

	architecture for victory

	how the proletariat will use information war
	to mobilize millions for
        the overthrow of bourgeois rule


communist theory and practice will combine to deliver to millions of workers
in the advanced industrialized countries the news that the fundamental solution
to all the problems of the modern world--is the overthrow 
of the system of bourgeois rule--and its replacement with something that
has never existed--workers' rule under modern conditions.






	theory of workers' rule
	under modern conditions


 the rule of the rich will be broken •
     the economic, cultural and political life of society will no longer
     be ruled by the wealthy or subordinate to the needs of corporate profits.
     sources of bourgeois wealth will be confiscated.  
     all attempts by those with any
     remaining form of wealth or privilege--to leverage their resources
     and seize control of society--will be smashed.
 workers will run society without restriction •
     workers will have the democratic right to
     hear and voice uncensored views
     and form independent organizations
     under conditions of political transparency.


	workers' news network


 reviews of all important articles in the mainstream press
 inclusion of full text of all articles from
     participating progressive organizations
 platform for "coopetition"
     (ie: competition and cooperation)
     between various progressive trends

     from all  no copyright--everything is public domain

     of  politics  economics  
     culture  technology  from
     the standpoint of working class interests

     on the basis of collaborative filtering










   what is progress to date ?




	notes of an information theorist:
	


critical mass 
	a communist movement worthy of the name
	can only organize itself around
	a theory of workers' rule
	that is fit for the modern world.
	but before this can happen
	charlatanism and denial must be smashed.

a revolution communications medium is poised to fall
into the hands of a revolutionary class,
and with it, over the next several decades--


the power of the mass media is destined
to fall into the hands of the masses !

..



what are the decisive tasks
to create a communist movement
after seven decades of betrayal and confusion ?
read:

1917 was the beta version

- - -

	the decisive task in practice is to create:


	---- a web-based news service ----

open to all trends and created such that no single trend
(or group of trends) could dominate it
in such a way as to censor or exclude other trends

- - -

the decisive task in theory is to provide:


	---- a clear picture of workers' rule ----

	the decisive theoretical task is to show how the system of workers' rule
.
	will suppress the bourgeoisie
	without also
	suppressing the working class
.

	(and thus paving the way for the domination
	of a new class of privileged exploiters
	--as happened in the soviet union, china
	and other "socialist" countries).

       by continuing our political development
       and harnessing the the power
       of the coming revolution in communications --
       we can help to lay the foundation
       for a communist "trend of trends"
       with the ability to eradicate sectarianism
       from our ranks,
puncture the influence of reformism
       over a vast audience,
capture the imagination of workers
       in their millions
       and mobilize our class
       to ignite a fire
       that cannot be extinguished.


the coming revolution in communications, now in
its earliest stages, is already beginning to demonstrate
its potential to influence the development and interaction
of marxist (and would-be marxist) organizations.
in the next decade or so,
the communications revolution
holds promise to completely transform
the "left ecosystem"
at present consisting predominantly of
squabbling sectarian grouplets,
craven reformists and the
just-plain confused.
in place of this will likely emerge a
dynamic and powerful system
of communist organizations which will both
compete and cooperate
with one another
at levels which at present may seem inconceivable.


this series is being written for serialization
(on a sporadic basis)
for the spoon's marxism-international

a cyberleninist perspective on
information war

riding the crest of the wave
of the communications revolution,
we are going to bring information war
(as a battle of ideas, as a struggle for consciousness)
to the masses, as a vehicle for their aspirations


.


what the hell do you mean by that ?


-- - -
fighting words
- - --


the bourgeoisie (and its apologists and flunkies)
seek to control the language so that
they can control the ability of the proletariat
to think and reason politically.
language (as an instrument of consciousness)
is both a 
passive target and an
active weapon
in the sphere of information war.

the definitions
of key terms are themselves objects
of struggle and represent contested terrain.

here are definitions
worth fighting for.
 

 			
 

	zhang shanguang and
	the proletarian revolution 
    

 
  

criminal or courageous activist?

    zhang shanguang, a political activist in china, was recently sentenced to ten years in prison for giving an interview to a foreign reporter.

    some believe that zhang's imprisonment is necessary to prevent china from being ruled by a class of wealthy and powerful thugs.  others believe that china is 
already 
ruled by a group of wealthy and powerful thugs--and that a 
real workers' state 
would not be so afraid of the free flow of information.

    the question is 
decisive 
to the proletarian revolution because a clear and unifying goal of a 
workers' rule  
can never emerge 
to mobilize millions--until a clear distinction can be made 
in the popular consciousness between workers' rule and a police state.

coming attractions:

     the digital infrastructure
     of the proletarian revolution
     
     humanity stands at the dawn
     of the greatest communications revolution in history.
     the development of a global digital communications infrastructure
     promises, as decade rolls after decade, to
release vast and ever-increasing
     amounts of oxygen
     onto the fires of the class struggle, 
     setting the stage for 
     an eventual political explosion
     of stellar magnitude.


.


     on the transition
     to a communist economy

     a workers' state would organize a "communist sector" of the economy
     side-by-side with a regulated capitalist sector.  
     the capitalist sector would itself consist of both 
     private capitalism and state capitalism.

     the communist sector would be a "gift economy" 
     that would operate 
     without money, wages,
     commodities or exchange.
     it would be highly experimental 
     and would grow as it learns what it is doing, 
     eventually competing 
     with the capitalist economy 
     and absorbing and transforming it
     as a developing chick does the white of an egg.

what's going on with this site ?

the good, the bad, and the ugly


report by your correspondent,
ben seattle



current report -- may 8, 2002




this site has not had a decentoverhaul in four years ...


unfortunately it has been a long time since i have made more than minor updates to this site.
the pressure of other political
work has made it necessary that i prioritize my tasks.


recently i put together a useful index to my current (and past) work including the 
email lists that i run,
my theoretical work and my work with
digital infrastructure.  
you are welcome to check this index out at

http://struggle.net/ben

to get on the party of the future email list
(sent out a few times a year) send email to

pof-100-subscribe@yahoogroups.com


also, some of my recent activity can be seen at the following sites:

 
proletarian democracy
	how will economics, politics and culture work
	when the working class runs modern society?
includes bulletin board and email list!
 
notes of an information theorist
	-- ben's posts to various marxism-related lists --

	watch ben apply the tactics of information war
	(characterized by intelligent listening and calm, scientific
	argument) to help transform the marxism space into
	a powerful weapon against the system of bourgeois rule.

previous report -- 1.may.98



1. transfer to www.leninism.org completed

it took a lot more work than i thought it would--but the entire cyberleninism site has now been transfered to its new home.  in the process, i overhauled every single page.  i cleaned up all the dead links.  i also redesigned many of the pages to take advantage of the fact that hardly anyone is still using netscape 2.0 (which can't handle colored tables).

the new server is faster and will also allow me to use automation in the form of "active server pages".

2. chapter 8 released of
"how to build the party of the future"

chapter 8 is the first chapter dealing with the period during which lenin was in power.
current plan is to release the chapters a month apart.  will this be realistic?  
(there was a 10 month gap between chapters 7 and 8.)  
all released chapters are now posted at: 

www.leninism.org/pof together with most of the good discussion (and some of the bad discussion).  
instructions for posting your own comments or getting on the "party of the future" email mailing list are on that page.  check it out.

3. cool animated button

you can now link to this site using a cool, animated button.  all you need to do is include the following in your html code:





<!--- cyberleninism ad --->
<a href="http://www.leninism.org">
<img src="http://www.leninism.org/images/button.gif" 
          width=88 height=31 border="0" 
          alt="www.leninism.org">
</a><p>

if you really like the button, you can make it display at twice normal size by using width=176 and height=62 in the code above.  then it will look like this:







4. forum is still frozen

and the links page is still drastically overdue for an overhaul.  the good news, however, is that nearly every single dead link has been removed.

the forum and the links page will be functional, better than ever, as part of the site automation.

5. site automation has been slightly delayed

at least i hope the delay is slight.  it took me much longer than i thought to transfer this site to leninism.org and overhaul every page.  automation will begin (hopefully) very soon now.  does "soon" mean days or months?  i hope it means days.

i've got a lot of work to do tonite before i go to sleep, so i'll sign off here.  
best wishes to all the readers who give me encouragement!

previous report -- 14.nov.97


many readers are upset or disappointed that the forum has been frozen 
for more than 10 months.  here is one letter:

date: wednesday, october 15, 1997 12:45 pm

> dear ben,
>
> hi, i'm a big fan of your cyberleninism page 
> but i'm becoming concerned with the apparent 
> inactivity in the site.  when do you plan to 
> unfreeze your forum if ever and where can i

> discussion until then?


-- ben replies --

here is the good, the bad and the ugly:

-- the good --

the good news is that i plan to "automate" my site--so that 
the forum will operate without my having to hand-code the e-mail i receive into html,
fix all the dumb mistakes that i make and then ftp everything up to my isp.

-- the bad --

the bad news is that before i can start this task--i must finish at least 
the theoretical section of my 

how to build the party of the future series.  
originally intended as a weekend project--it will likely take me thru the end of the year.
i have written 7 chapters so far and am currently working on the chapters
which sum up the period in which lenin was in power.
i have only had time to post the first 3 chapters--but 
will post everything as soon as i have a chance.

-- the ugly --

the best forums that i know of for marxist-related discussion--are in the 

marxism space 
maintained by the spoon collective.
these are e-mail based discussion lists.
the best of these spoon forums is 

marxism-international.
i am not necessarily recommending these sites--because few of the participants
are serious about actually doing anything--and the quality of the discussion
is very uneven--with occasional brilliance side-by-side with unbelievable stupidity.
but until there are marxist forums of higher caliber--this is the best of which i am aware.

ps: if you find a better
forum--please let me know!
