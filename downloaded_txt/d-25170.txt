*many attractions offer
                online discounts and coupons. most of the
                attractions (but not all) also offer discounts to
                florida residents, senior citizens (aarp too),
                military & gov't personel, reduced child
                prices, group discounts (usually 15 or more, but
                sometimes as little as 10+), aaa members,
                corporate and other types of discounts are
                typically available. also, the major attractions
                periodically may offer multi-day passes and
                annual admission pass bargains and other types of
                discounts and incentives. sometimes these other
                types of discounts can be somewhat greater than
                the online coupons/discounts, so you may want to
                seek out and compare them. availability of
                coupons and discounts is through the respective
                attractions websites (and not touristflorida.com)
                and they can and will change without notice.

i
                highly recommend visting the wizarding world
                of harry potter at universal's islands of
                adventure! taste the butterbeer! the main ride is
                fantastic and intense (almost lost my cell phone,
                and i've ridden lots of coasters) ! it's so much
                more than a sim ride! and you'll enjoy the
                attention to detail all along the way too! i don't
                want give anything away, just go!

a tip from touristflorida.com:
you might consider bringing
                cheap plastic rain-ponchos (usually $1 in the
                dollar stores) during the rainy season (summer)
                because ponchos in the theme parks are typically
                more than $5 each.

if you're
                        looking to decompress from the
                        attractions, and looking for something
                        local that's culturally real, try the
                        local art scene just north of orlando in
                        maitland fl at the inexpensive museums of
the art and history
                        museums of maitland.





happenings:
you can see a full ride-through of universal's
                skull island reign of kong at this link.
sea world's mako roller coaster is
                open.

the orlando eye is down on international drive and
                also has other attractions within the building
                such as sealife aquarium and madame tussauds
                orlando (but watch out for the operational hours
                of each if you get a multi-pass.) 

here's the
                knight bus parked outside of harry potter
                king's cross station at universal studios;
                the train ride and the rest of the attraction
                including diagon alley and the escape
                from gringott's roller coaster ride.
                you will need a 2 park pass to ride the
                train. here's a (spoilers) video of the whole train ride .
disney's seven dwarfs mine train at the magic kingdom opened.

this is kang and kodos twirl 'n hurl outside the simpsons ride at
                universal (sped up 2x.)

this is an
                image of the tethered helium balloon at the new
                disney springs shopping and entertainment area (formely
                known as downtown disney) named characters in flight, which takes you up to 400', and is
                a real thrill bargain! it's the biggest tethered
                helium balloon ride in the world.

the wizarding world of harry potter hogsmeade train to king's cross
                station is open.

this is the
                original train at hogsmeade (doesn't move), but
                the new station with the moving version is right
                next to this.
legoland has
                re-opened its duplo valley. they added a few
                attractions but most of all a mini waterpark for
                ages 2-5, which is a little bigger than craggar's
                swamp in lego chima.
universal
                studios has opened their transformers: the ride-3d.

this highly
                detailed realistic full-sized transformer stands
                on top of the entrance to the ride (it looks
                really cool up close!)
sea world has antarctica: empire of the penguin, which combines a live penguin
                exhibit with an indoor spin ride.
new fantasyland is open at walt disney world's
                magic kingdom.
falcon's fury at busch gardens tampa is open.
busch
                gardens triple-launch cheetah hunt roller-coaster
                ride is now open. click here
                for a youtube video from them.
minion mayhem simulator ride is an interesting ride at universal
                studios. tip: we got on line half hour before
                closing and only waited 30 minutes to get in gru
                and a minion crew also pose during the day (with
                my son in this image.)


get thyself to legoland
                florida! they've also opened their
