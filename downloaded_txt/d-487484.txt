roosevelt knew about pearl harbor
before it happened! 




on
december 7, 1941, the japanese navy and air force attacked the united
states army, navy and air force units at pearl harbor, hawaii in what
was called "a surprise attack."

the next day, president franklin roosevelt called the attack "a day of
infamy," and asked congress for a declaration of war.

it was granted, and america was in world war two.

many at the time questioned how "a surprise attack" could have
happened, and whether president roosevelt should have known about it in
advance and warned our forces in hawaii.

nine congressional investigations were conducted, during and
after the war, and each examined the question: did president
roosevelt know about the attack before it happened, and if so, why did
he do nothing to prepare our forces.

and nine congressional investigations all concluded that roosevelt did
not know in advance! 

a few years ago, i saw a photo copy of the hilo, hawaii tribune herald
newspaper of november 30, 1941, the sunday before the attack. i called
the library in hilo, hawaii and they photocopied the top half of their
front page and sent it to me. 

the headline of this newspaper reads:




japan may strike over weekend




meaning
the following weekend, saturday, december 6th and sunday, december 7th,
1941. 

ask yourself this question:

how could this newspaper know in advance, but president roosevelt did
not know? 

one could reasonably conclude that president roosevelt's intelligence
sources were better than the newspapers!

in other words, nine congressional investigations were wrong: president
roosevelt had to have known ......... even a hawaii newspaper knew!!!

(if you want documented evidence that roosevelt did know about the
attack before it happened, please read the pertinent chapter in the
book i wrote entitled the unseen hand, an introduction to the
conspiratorial view of history. it is discussed in the catalog that
follows this report.

thank you for your interest.

the catalog of 
publius press 
publisher of 
books and videos by
ralph epperson
that provides the 
evidence that a 
conspiracy
is causing 
this nation's problems. 




ralph
epperson  is an
historian, author, and lecturer who has been researching the conspiratorial
view of history  (the view that the major events of the
past have been planned years in advance by a central conspiracy) for 50
years. he has written or produced four "best selling" books entitled the
unseen hand,  the new world order,
masonry: conspiracy against christianity, jesse
james, united states senator, six booklets, and 15 dvds.

 he is
a graduate of the university of arizona, but freely admits that what he
has learned since graduation has taught him that most of what he
learned in college in history and political science simply is not true.
he proudly states that his research has proven to him that there has
been an active conspiracy in the world planning major wars,
depressions, and inflations years in advance. 
many of
those who have read his material and viewed his dvds state that they
are the best in the market on this subject. if you want to know how
this conspiracy has operated in the world from one of the best
researchers into the reality of this conspiracy, from one of the best
teachers and writers, you will want to obtain some or all of his
materials.

 another ralph epperson, the
owner of radio station wpaq, was a major player in the country music
field, so successful that he was elected to the north carolina
broadcasters hall of fame in the year 2006. i am sorry to hear of his
passing on may 31, 2006, and wish to apologize for any problems my name
might have caused him and his reputation in the past! but there was
nothing i could do to alleviate any confusion between the two ralph
eppersons. and i wish to salute his major accomplishments!!!

 the bush -
obama bailout
bill clinton supports it!

 the
economic problems facing america (as of april, 2012) are the result of
a bailout planned in at least 1999 by president bill clinton, ........
and that is according to the new york times newspaper! (of course, the
times didn't call it a conspiracy!!!) 
in
other words, this event was planned just like the stock market collapse
of 1929, and for the exact same reason:  they needed a crisis
to further destroy the free enterprise system and hasten the 'novus
ordo seclorus" (the new world order as evidenced on the back of the
american dollar bill.) 
some
believed that barack obama was "discovered" at columbia university by
zbigniew brzezinski, a professor of his during obama's two year stay at
that university. 
brzezinski
is a self professed marxist communist (please read his book entitled
between two ages, published in 1970 wherein he praises marxist
communism at least thirteen times!) (for contrast, i have never praised
it in 45 years!) 
i
have reduced many of the prices in this catalog (in may,
2010) to assist the american who is finding it difficult to earn enough
to pay his bills.  i am hopeful that this will assist in
further proving that the conspiracy is real ........ and that they
planned this event!

 clinton's
conspiracy
bill clinton supports it!

 on
july 14, 1992, during his acceptance speech at the democratic
convention, then candidate bill clinton told the american people that
he knew there was an "international network" at work in the world, and
that "he had no aversion to it."  
 he
said that he owed his start in politics to a professor that he had at
georgetown university named carroll quigley. professor quigley wrote a
1348 page book entitled tragedy and hope while
clinton was a student there (1966) in which he said: 
 






"there
does exist an international anglophile [meaning basically english]
network which operates in the way the radical right believes the
communists act. in fact, this network has no aversion to cooperating
with the communists and frequently does so.






i
have no aversion to it."  





 quigley
tells the reader how this network plans wars years in advance. this
booklet or video provides the evidence that bill clinton learned his
lessons well from the professor and therefore believes the same thing. he
too has no aversion to it!

 the kennedy
assassination 
 the
day is november 22, 1963. the place is dallas, texas. president john
kennedy has come to the city and will be appearing in a motorcade
through the streets of the city. he will be seated in an open air
limousine, driven by a secret service agent. 
 a
spectator named abraham zapruder goes to the park near where the
president's car will be driven, and records the entire scene in his
motion picture camera. 
 you
can now watch the film that he made and see the driver of the limousine
slowly bring the car to almost a halt, turn around, and fire an
air-fired pistol at the head of the president!

god
exists!
there is no other option!

 the humanists, those who believe in the humanist
religion, tells us that they find "insufficient evidence for a belief
in the existence of a supernatural [meaning a god]". they also proudly
boast that "the time has passed for theism [a belief in a god]". 

 john
dewey, "the father of progressive education," america's leading figure
in public education, and a believer in the humanist religion, wrote
"there is no god, and there is no soul."  
 yet
the humanists and john dewey are dramatically wrong! you can know with
scientific certainty that there is a god, and that there is no other
option but a knowledge that he is real!  
 a
belief in god can now be based upon science, logic and reason! this
booklet will prove that even to the most skeptical atheist! the booklet
asks the reader three questions, and by your own answers, you will know
that ...  
 
 god exists!
there is no other option!

 the kennedy assassination
conspiracy and cover up

 
 president john kennedy was not only murdered by a
massive conspiracy that was many years in the planning, but there has
also been a huge cover-up of that fact for nearly 30 years afterward.
this lecture will discuss the evidence that 

 




** lee harvey oswald did not shoot the president
because photographic evidence exists showing that he was on the first
floor at the time of the first show. and the warren commission that said he did, knew that!

** the hit movie "jfk" only told the american people
half of the truth and
blamed the wrong people!

**  various layers
and branches of government destroyed or altered crucial
evidence, and altered the testimony of witnesses.

 vietnam
america's betrayal and treason

 
 the war in vietnam officially ended in 1973, but
few americans know why it was fought. finally, someone makes sense out
of this brutal war. the lecture will discuss:  
 





** why
did the american government plan the war in 1943?
**
why did the american government supply russia with the 20th century technology to wage the war, when they knew
that they in turn were sending it to north vietnam to kill
americans?  
** why
couldn't the american generals and admirals win the war when they
wanted to?  
** how
did three american patriots, not in the government, end the war
years before it was scheduled to end?  
** what
role do drugs, especially heroin, play in the reasons america
fought the war?

 kennedy assassination and vietnam

 
 finally, someone totally connects the assassination
of president john kennedy to the war in vietnam! the recent movie "jfk"
was right in its claims that the president was killed because he wanted
to end the war in vietnam before it started. but the movie was wrong in
its conclusion that it was "the military-industrial complex" that
wanted the president dead. the truth is that there is no such thing! 

 ralph epperson was one of the first to connect the
assassination to the war in vietnam, but he was the first to
identify the real reason the president was murdered: drugs!

secret societies
and the
new world order

 

 the great seal of the
united states, with all of its symbols and latin phrases, has been
reproduced on the back of the dollar bill. yet few in america know what
these things mean. it is a reasonable question to ask why this is so
since the seal was adopted by the congress over two hundred years ago,
in 1782.  
 the key to understanding all of the phrases and
symbols lies in the words "novus ordo seclorum,"
found under the pyramid in the seal shown on the left side of the
dollar bill. this lecture will explain what all of these symbols mean. 

 ralph epperson will discuss how a secret
society, still active in america today, placed those symbols
in the great seal. you will then understand why these
explanations have not been provided to you.

 ralph epperson will present the evidence that the
federal govern-ment and "the seven sisters" (the seven largest oil
companies in the world) have colluded on shutting down america's oil
re-serves, thereby forcing america to seek foreign oil, for it's
gasoline needs.  did you know that:
 
* * opec (the organization of petroleum exporting
countries)
is not arabian (it appears as if only 7 of the nations are arabian)

* * many of the opec nations have signed a cartel agreement with
various members of "the seven sisters" that allows them to produce oil
from that nation and to split the profits with them on a 50 - 50
percent basis

* * there are non - opec nations that raise their prices to equal those
of the opec cartel, even though they have no contractural obligation to
do so

* * mr. epperson will discuss the evidence that many of these nations
have also signed a cartel agreement with some of "the seven sisters"
 
 * * he will also discuss the reasons that gasoline
could rise to $10 a gallon

the
bogus jewish conspiracy 
 
 there are many people today who believe that there
is a conspiracy at work in the world, and that it is led by the jews.
 
historian and writer ralph epperson has discovered
that those who believe this are dramatically wrong!
 
he has been researching the conspiratorial view of
history for over 45 years that traces it's ancestry back to the
egyptians.  that means it predates the jews!
 
he has recently discovered that this 6000 year old
conspiracy, called the ancient mystery religion, is led by a group of
nine "adepts", calling itself the great white brotherhood, and that
their headquarters are in the nation known as tibet!

secrets of history
27 hours of
the unseen hand 
 

 in 1987 and 1988,
ralph epperson and a crew of seven volunteers produced 27 one hour
television programs for a series he called secrets of history.
 
 this series was primarily based upon the material
found in his book entitled the unseen hand, and was
shown for some three years on the tucson community cable station. many
of those who have watched this series have commented that for a bunch
of "amateurs", this series was pretty well done.  
 mr. epperson takes the viewer through over 200
years of american history, by showing how a conspiracy planned the
american revolution, the war of 1812, the civil war, world wars i and
ii, korea and vietnam, among other things.  
 if you want to learn about the conspiratorial view
of history from one of the theory's great teachers, this series is for
you.

the unseen hand
an introduction to the
conspiratorial view of history 
 

 this is the carefully
researched and documented book by historian a. ralph epperson. first
published in 1985, it has now been reprinted 15 times, and is being
published in five european countries.  
 this book, a must read for those who wish to know
why major events of the past have occurred, has been called "quite
possibly the finest book ever written on this subject."  
 readers have praised mr. epperson's writing style,
claiming that it is extremely easy to read for such a controversial and
hard to explain subject matter. he first wrote the book as a textbook
for his community college classes.  
 he has chapters on: 






**
a simple definition and cure for inflation;
** america is a "fascist oligarchy;"
** america's wars from 1717 to 1985;
** american capitalists control communism;
** why evolution is a fraud and a hoax; etc.

 the new world order
the book   
 
 the world has been hearing george bush (a
capitalist), fidel castro (a communist) and mikhail gorbachev (now a
"social democrat") talk about creating a "new world order."
adolf hitler fought world war ii to create a "new world order."
and 50,000,000 people died because adolf hitler wanted the same thing
that george bush, fidel castro and mikhail gorbachev want.

but few in america know what the phrase means!
ralph epperson's book will tell you what it means and how it is
connected to the "novus ordo seclorum" (translated
to the new world order) on the back of the american
dollar bill. 
this book was written to serve as a warning to the
american people because they would not select the new world
order if they knew what it was. 
this book will be very disturbing to the reader.
but it is better to be forewarned.

 government 101
the function of government  
 
 ask a candidate for public office this
question:  what is the function of government? and stand back
to be amazed:  most won't know how to answer you! 
the question is simple and it can be answered in one short sentence,
but in 30 years of asking maybe 50 candidates, ralph epperson has found
only one who knew the right answer! 
 yet they wanted to be trusted with the power of
government!  the booklet
will carefully analyze government and why people create it. 
then ralph epperson will lead you through a discussion of the various
forms of government, and why this nation's founding fathers hated
democracy! 
included in the booklet will be a study of various
forms of economic terms such as socialism, communism, and the free
enterprise system.  if i
asked you after you read this booklet:  what type of economic
and political system do we have in america, your correct answer would
be a fascist oligarchy!

 only
the u.s. has nukes!   
 
for over 50 years, ever since the united states
dropped two atomic bombs on japan to end world war ii, the world has
been caught up in a fear of a nuclear war.  but historian, lecturer and researcher ralph
epperson has discovered that that this threat of a nuclear war is a
fraud, and that the only nation with nuclear weapons is the united
states.  that means this threat is imaginary, that a great act
of deception has been pulled off on the people of the world.

one of the evidences is the intermediate range
nuclear forces treaty (the inf treaty) signed in 1989 by pres. ronald
reagan and russian premier mikhael gorbachev.  the treaty
"eliminates" warheads and missiles without either nation being allowed
to verify compliance that warheads and missiles have been eliminated!

epperson has accumulated in this four hour dvd!  and you will
believe after you complete your viewing of the material!

america's secret destiny

 

 the american
constitution has been called "the finest document ever written by the
mind of men!" the american people have been taught that it was written
to restrict the power of government, and to protect their god-given
unalienable rights to life, liberty and property. 

 but ralph epperson has discovered the evidence
that the men who founded this nation were not god-fearing patriots as
we have been told, but occultic practitioners of a secret worship on
this earth. in fact, he will discuss the evidence that our founding
fathers created two separate governments in the constitution at the
same time, and one of those governments was given absolute
tyrannical power! and that this is the government ruling
america today!  
 he will also examine the great seal of the united
states and its hidden symbols.

 jesse
james
u.s. senator   
 
 the headline of the july 4th 1948 lawton, oklahoma
newspaper reads: 
 jesse james is alive! in lawton 
 
history has recorded that jesse james, this
nation's most famous outlaw, was shot to death by bob ford on april 3,
1882. so this headline appeared to be false. but it is the truth!

the man making that claim was j. frank dalton, who
said he was the real jesse james, and that this shooting in 1882 did
not happen. he appeared in lawton in 1948 because he had made a
commitment to tell the truth if he ever became 100 years old (he was
100 in 1947.) 
ralph epperson has researched this man's story and
has concluded that it is true. and he has discovered these startling
facts as well: 
** jesse poisoned john wilkes booth,
lincoln's assassin, in 1903.

** jesse was elected a u.s. senator from montana (1901 - 1907)
under an alias.

** helped form the ku klux klan in 1867
to start a second civil war.

the shroud is genuine!
evidence of conspiracy and
fraud
in the dating of the shroud of turin 
 

 in 1988, the catholic
church allowed three scientists from laboratories specializing in
"carbon-dating" to obtain pieces of the "shroud of turin," which many
think was the actual burial shroud of jesus christ. tv cameras were
rolling when the piece was actually cut from the shroud in front of the
scientists was taken from the room into a smaller room nearby, by the
cardinal of turin, and two other scientists. these three men
disappeared for one half of an hour, and when they returned, they gave
the samples to the scientists.  
 two researchers have found out that the cloth
tested by the laboratories did not come from the shroud but from a
relic called "the cope of st. louis d' anjou" worn from 1296-1297 a.d.
after the substitute "shroud" was dated at around 1350 a.d. by the
"carbon dating method," the real shroud was called a "forgery." but, the
shroud is genuine, because the piece of cloth tested by the
three laboratories was a garment worn between 1296 and 1297! and these
authors produced photographs to prove it!

shroud is genuine!

 portraits or photographs exist of each of them
giving a secret symbol known as the lion's paw, a symbol that reveals
to the initiates of the ancient mystery religion known as lucifer (also
known as satan, the devil) worship that they are fellow believers.

ralph epperson discovered it and made it public.  you can see

 the u.c.c. connection 
 

 howard freeman,
before he passed away, was perhaps this nation's finest expert on the
constitution of the united states of america.  he often gave
lectures around the country on the document and on the court cases
decided on its provisions.  
someone transcribed one of his 1990 speeches from
off of an audio tape and made it available on the internet for anyone
who wanted it.  ralph epperson has pulled it off, formatted
it, and added his comments, hopefully to add to its impact. 

it is mr. freeman's contention that the uniform
commercial code (abbreviated to the u.c.c.) has replaced the
constitution as the "law of the land".  mr. freeman relates
the story about how president franklin roosevelt called in all of the
federal judges in america in 1938, and told them that the nation had
been declared "bankrupt" by the international bankers.  he
told them to try all of their cases under the u.c.c. but that they were
to "take silent judicial notice of that fact", meaning that they had to
cover their rulings with words that sounded like they came from the
constitution.  
it is ralph epperson's contention that when this
happened, it was no "accident," but the carefully contrived set of
circumstances brought on by a conspiracy dating all the way back to
1787 and the "founding fathers" of america.  he ends by
telling the reader how he/she can get back to the constitution in a
court of law.

 masonry:
conspiracy against christianity  
 

 bob dole, jack kemp,
barry goldwater, franklin roosevelt, harry truman, amongst others, all
have one thing in common:  as members of the masonic lodge: 

they took an oath to destroy
christianity!  
their worldwide organization claims to "ordain
kings and shape the destinies of worlds", and that is why powerful men
such as these have joined it.  
now, for the first time ever in their 6,000 year
history, someone not a member has discovered that the evidence that
this is their goal is from their own literature!  ralph
epperson has read 29 of their books from 12 of their top writers, and
he also has found the evidence that their day of destruction had a
definite date:  january 1, 2000.  mr. epperson will
also explain why this event did not take place!

ralph epperson's books on conspiracy
make excellent gifts for any occasion. if you agree with us at publius
press that there is a conspiracy at work in
america, and because of this fact, this nation is in serious trouble,
and that the only tool a moral people can resort to in a time of crisis
is education, then why not consider giving books and tapes that discuss
the evidence that this conspiracy exists to your
friends, business associates, relatives, and your rabbi, priest or
pastor.
 
 








read ralph epperson's
latest book
jesse james
u.s. senator 

this book contains the evidence
that jesse james, the famous outlaw, was not shot in 1882, but staged
his own death so he could keep living without the threat of a reward
over his head. and until he died in 1951, he was a major player in this
nation's past in support of this conspiracy.
