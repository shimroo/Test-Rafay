sketchy thoughts



and what would you expect?









saturday, april 08, 2023





main blog moved to kersplebedeb.com!




print  pdf


since march 2013, the main kersplebedeb website has been migrated to a primarily wordpress format.

what this means in practical terms is that everything you are used to seeing on sketchy thoughts is now being posted straight to kersplebedeb and simply being automatically mirrored here. so in general, you will probably have a better reading/viewing experience if you head over to kersplebedeb.

for those who prefer the sketchy thoughts blogger layout for whatever reason, this page will continue to be automatically updated whenever something is posted to kersplebedeb, for at least the short-term future. however, as additional functionality is added to the kersplebedeb site via wordpress, the sketchy thoughts page will probably begin to show its age more and more.
