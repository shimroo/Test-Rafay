north 
                creek is famous for the original 'snow train' dating back to the early 1930's. 
                the first snow train arrived at the historic north creek railway depot on march 
                4, 1934, bringing 400 members of the schenectady ski club. later snow trains carried 
                as many as 800 skiers from the new york metropolitan area. the north creek railroad 
                is listed on both the state and national registrar and is remembered by historians 
                as the place where theodore roosevelt learned of the death of president mckinley 
                on september 14, 1901 and of his own succession to the presidency of the united 
                states. the station complex is located in the hamlet of north creek in the town 
                of johnsburg, warren county, new york. the north creek railway depot preservation 
                association (ncrdpa) was formed in the 1990's in order to acquire the depot and 
                eventually restore it. today, visitors can tour the north creek railroad depot 
                museum and learn all about its unique place in new york's history.
