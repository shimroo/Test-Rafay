positive progress towards peacesinn fein votes to back police - a 1stby shawn pogatchnikthe associated press    28 january 2007dublin, ireland (ap)- sinn fein members overwhelmingly voted sunday to begin cooperating with the northern ireland police, a long-unthinkable commitment that could spur the return of a catholic-protestant administration for the british territory. the result—confirmed by a sea of raised hands but no formally recorded vote—meant sinn fein, once a hard-left party committed to a socialist revolution, has abandoned its decades-old hostility to law and order. the vote, taken after daylong debate among 2,000 sinn fein stalwarts, represented a stunning triumph for sinn fein chief gerry adams, the former irish republican army commander who has spent 24 years edging his ira-linked party away from terror and toward compromise. it strongly improved the chances of reviving power-sharing, the long-elusive goal of the 1998 good friday peace pact, by britain's deadline of march 26. ``today you have created the potential to change the political landscape on this island forever,'' adams told the conference. earlier, many speakers said for decades they had dreamed of defeating the province's mostly protestant police force and forcing northern ireland into the irish republic. some ira veterans recalled beatings inflicted on them by detectives during interrogations. others noted they had served long prison sentences for attacks on police, more than 300 of whom were killed during the ira's failed 1970-1997 campaign. but nearly all speakers said they were voting to dump their party's anti-police position for the sake of peace. ``this shows that the war is over. and if the war is over, we have to build the peace,'' adams said in an interview during an earlier break in debate. positive news is pleased with this important step towards peace in northern irelandreport: koreas' nuclear talks to resumethe associated press28 january 2007seoul (ap) - south korea's foreign minister says the next round of international talks on north korea's nuclear program should resume by early next month, a news report said friday. foreign minister song min-soon made the comments to south korean correspondents in beijing, according to yonhap news agency, a day after he met with his chinese counterpart, li zhaoxing, and state councilor tang jiaxuan. the nuclear disarmament talks—which consist of the united states, china, the two koreas, japan and russia—should be held before feb. 10, song said without elaborating. in tokyo, the kyodo news agency reported that the participants are considering resuming their next meeting in beijing beginning feb. 8, citing unidentified officials. the itar-tass news agency quoted russia's nuclear envoy, deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov, as saying the most likely dates for resumption of the talks are feb. 5-8, but the participants must still reach agreement on 'concrete details of the agenda.' a japanese foreign ministry official said he was aware of the reports but denied the date has been decided. positive news is pleased to see these talks resume and we view this as progress towards a peaceful solution.positive enviromental trendsgerman renewable energy sector shows impressive growthgreenprices    on 28 january 2007 greenprices reported: 2006 was a year of impressive growth for the german renewable energy sector. german wind power installations grew by 23.5 per cent in 2006, while renewable energy use grew by 11.6 per cent, leaving the country just 12 per cent short of its renewable energy target for the year 2010. the country overall decreased its co2 emission by an impressive 10 million tonnes. this, together with the above-mentioned results has made germany one of the undisputed leaders of the green energy sector. environment minister sigmar gabriel stated that his ministry would focus next on formulating a plan to for the development and usage of renewable heating. the new program will operate through a series of subsidies and mandatory percentages.can energy projects play a role in reducing poverty?according to the recently released report 'improving lives: world bank progress on renewable energy and energy efficiency in fiscal year 2006' by the world bank. the world bank said that in 2006 it funded renewable energy projects for a total value of $668 million, supporting 34 projects in 61 developing nations. the world bank report also said that affordable energy availability was crucial to the elimination of poverty and malnutrition, since almost all food needs to be cooked to be properly digested. the bank will continue to focus on supporting renewable energy development in asia and africa, giving more attention to 'solar home-lighting systems, small hydropower systems, and wind power and biomass energy production using wood and animal and crop residues'. an example of a successful third world project is a project in bangladesh where 90,000 homes have received solar power systems, which the bank said is regarded as 'the world's most successful solar power initiative'. also the bank has supported a successful forest management project in senegal that produces wood on a sustainable basis, reducing deforestation, and generating local income. through other projects, solar power has been used to light public areas in bolivia and district heating in serb schools has been improved.labels: green news, peace news, positive news
