“lucy walsh has written a lovely, heartbreaking book that shines a light on another era, where self-reliance was a common, everyday necessity, not something to aspire to or pontificate about. pride in family and community; an abiding love between her grandparents, two soulmates, are all captured in this moving book.”  -bette midler
