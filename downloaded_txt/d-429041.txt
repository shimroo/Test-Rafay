      about the center 
      
the baker act reporting center is located in the department of mental health law & policy, de la parte florida mental health institute, college of behavioral and community sciences at the university of south florida. the center is operated on behalf of the florida department of children and families. baker act receiving facilities statewide
            submit to us forms used to initiate involuntary (baker act) examinations.  clerks
            of court statewide submit to us petitions and orders for involuntary inpatient placement
            and involuntary (outpatient) services. 
data entered from these forms are used to produce statutorily mandated reports that
         add insight into florida's mental health systems. the primary purpose of this website
         is to provide information about document submission from mandated reporters (baker
         act receiving facilities and clerks of court) and to disseminate results of analyses
         of the baker act data. a secondary purpose of this website is to provide information
         to address the most common types of inquiries we receive, given the number of inquiries we receive from consumers and families seeking assistance.
