olympic athletes are very inspiring.  the idea of training for an event for four or six or more years, with that one event as motivation - what discipline!  i'm moved to make some long term goals for myself.

these steps connect two sections of hankey st in mt cook, wellington, where i lived in 2004-5.  the street was part of a neighbourhood planned on paper, and it didn't fit the geography of mt cook.  on reflection it seems that uncooperative geography was but one of the problems faced by wakefield's surveyors as they set about establishing the city.  more on wikipedia here.labels: new zealand, wellington
