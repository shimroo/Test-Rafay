rain policy: in the event of rain bay area jumps policy is that a customer can cancel the delivery with no charge. (deposits and payments are held for one year and can be used on future rentals. no refund of payments or deposits) if the customer elects to accept the unit(s) they understand that there is no refund . if it does rain the units are still usable. bay area jump recommends, that in light rain or showers that most of our units are covered and it's fine for kids to jump. if the rain becomes heavy, have the kids exit the unit and go inside and wait for the rain to quit. the units will accumulate water (it will bubble at the seams, this is normal) so have an adult or teen go inside the unit with a towel and dry out the unit and its ready for use again. please leave units inflated until the driver arrives to pick up.
