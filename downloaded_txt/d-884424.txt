about fontana lake
fontana lake rests along the southern border of the great smoky mountains and the northern border of the nantahala forest. three major rivers flow into fontana lake to create the reservoir: the tuckaseegee which flows through bryson city, the little tennessee, and the nantahala river. fontana dam was finished in 1944 to provide electricity to the tennessee valley. during this time towns like proctor and judson were abandoned for the construction of the dam with the promise of the never completed scenic road to nowhere which today serves as an entry into the great smoky mountains.
fontana lake is a popular recreation area enjoyed by the western north carolina community. the lake is approximately 17 miles long and can be seen from miles away at clingmans dome. fontana lake has many coves and islands as it wraps in and around the appalachian mountains.
