the kingdom bank joins metatrader 5 payments

the kingdom bank,  a digital-asset friendly international bank, has become part of the  metatrader 5 payments service. as a new psp, the bank already offers  services to the trading platform users. this latest integration  strengthens our service and unlocks even more opportunities for brokers  and traders. with metatrader 5 payments, traders can deposit and  withdraw funds directly from the platform without leaving the terminal.  our solution significantly accelerates onboarding and reduces steps  required for deposit transactions, ultimately increasing conversion rates, as well as the number and volume of deposits.  thus, brokers benefit from simplified and automated financial  operations without incurring additional costs or requiring integration  with third-party providers.
