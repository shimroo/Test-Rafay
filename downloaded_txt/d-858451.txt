appreciation letter from academy award-winning actress, anne bancroft. 












academy award-winning actress, anne bancroft.





“dear harry:    my most recent play would not have appeared had not your memory systems made it possible for me to memorize an almost impossible-to-memorize script. not only did it make an impossible task possible, but it made what is a usual drudgery – part of the creative art. i would never have believed that memorizing lines could be as exciting – stimulating – and as much fun as acting itself. and in my travels i found that learning foreign words and phrases was a snap with your systems.‘you are a miracle worker!’(signed)   anne bancroft”

what people are saying

 

“harry lorayne is “mr. memory” – he knows more about memory training than anyone in the world. his result-oriented methods make it easy to remember facts - names, faces, numbers,  technical material - anything.”— little brown & co.



“harry lorayne's course is recommended for all managers and supervisors, and is mandatory for all other personnel.”— ruby lauzon, international paper co.



“i was desperate. so i jumped at your course. well, your memory-training systems don't just kinda work – my memory improvement has been awesome. i now accomplish about two weeks worth of school work in a day. i almost don't believe it myself, except that i've been acing all my tests. you have practically saved my life!”— peter zuckerman, customer

 

a powerful letter of appreciation

 


“i was a prisoner of war in north vietnam from september 26th, 1966 until march 4th, 1973. shortly before i was shot down and captured i learned your memory power systems. the prisoners of war had no reading or writing material, so we relied solely on memory for sanity, entertainment, names of other pows, military directives and orders.  during the first months of captivity, while flat on my back in a cast, i applied your systems for my own benefit, and it indeed worked! i then taught it to hundreds of my fellow pows over the next six years. eventually it was spread throughout the camp and was an invaluable aid to all of us. academic classes were conducted by pows entirely from memory. we applied your methods and learned literally thousands of foreign words, poems, speeches, mathematics, electronics, classical music, philosophy, biology – the list is endless.  this opened new worlds of mental activity which was so important to us since we were isolated from the world for such a long period of time.  i am deeply indebted to you for your memory techniques and for sharing them with the public. i needed to tell you how much your work meant to all of us behind the bamboo wall. most sincerely.   (col. ballard [ret.] told this story on the television show to tell the truth. he went on to teach harry lorayne’s memory techniques in south carolina .)”

— arthur t . ballard , jr.,  lt. colonel, usaf
