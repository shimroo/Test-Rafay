announcement

dear valued customers,

we want to share some news about changes coming to our store. from april 2025, martell’s will focus on toys and gifts and will no longer operate as a department store. as part of this transition, we will be closing our first floor and no longer stock beds, furniture, linen and luggage.

to help us prepare for this change starting on tuesday the 11th february 2025 we will be holding a huge floor model clearance sale with incredible deals, up to 75% off*, in store only.

please be assured that any existing customer orders will not be affected, and we remain committed to providing excellent service throughout this period of transition.

thank you for your support and understanding during this time of change. we look forward to seeing you in-store soon.sofas & chairsbeds  & mattressesdining and occassionalrugstoys & games homeware linenluggageremovals & storagevideo toureast grinstead lions charity book shop
