montana hospitalitythank you for your interest in our beautiful part of the world. this country is truly the best of the west and we welcome you to share it with us. the native americans called this valley the “land of the shining mountains,” the locals call it heaven…and the madison river runs through it.in 1863, william ennis homesteaded the site along the madison river which quickly became the town of ennis. mr. jeffers did likewise across the river. the two towns, their bridges, the tall grass, and favorable climate soon attracted ranchers, farmers, and businessmen.by the late 1800’s, three major stage lines freighted through ennis; horse, sheep and cattle thrived; wild game was plentiful; and white clouds tribe of bannack indians were valued as friends of all who knew them. today ennis continues to be the hub of this active region… a community filled with montana beauty, wildlife, ranches, businesses, and many amenities for our residents and guests to enjoy and protect. we are eager to help you enjoy your stay in our community.check out the directory and events tabs on this site to learn more about the area; things to do where to eat, sleep, and drink in and around ennis montana. whether you are planning a vacation or relocation, this area has everything you could ask for.warmest montana regards from the ennis area chamber of commerce

 


“ we love the friendly and independent spirit of the community,  fly shops to quaint stores surrounded by beautiful landscape and clear waters; ennis is our chosen place to express our love”
