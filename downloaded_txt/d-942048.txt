capitalism and freedom
[dec. 29th, 2005|11:00 pm]
afronerd




so, lately i have had a lot of time to simply read and catch up on my thoughts because this job at the my schools athletic complex requires no work or effort. i simply slide cards through a reader or give people sports equipment as they in turn hand over their easily school id as collateral.nothing really interesting has happened there during the break mainly because there is nothing but old folks and foreign students who probably thought it a bit too expensive to make the trip home for the break. i do know that only chinese people play table tennis and time can move surprisingly quick when your doing nothing but reading time and sports illustrated. i have been getting into this book "capitalism and freedom" by milton friedman, a nobel prize-winning economist. it is basically an argument for libertarianism which is a philosphy that posits human freedom as being the supreme value and this is attained by having as little government interference in the lives of men. the only way the government should function is to protect the property of its citizens and to establish rules for honoring contracts in trade. possibly the government should issure money as well. this is the what i get from the reading so far and it sounds good but friedman makes a few minor guffaws and i question the whether the structure of capitalism he envisions is plausible. first, i do advocate human freedom as one of the highest values. i do not believe that a central goverment is necessary and considering human nature, concentrating power in the hands of a few, no matter how well-meaning or "enlightened" the rulers are, will eventually turn to abuse. i see society as being better structured as a net of connected nodes, each representing a seat of autonomy. these nodes can be communities, families, businesses, small states, etc..here power would be more distributed and disruptions in one node will no necessary result in the collapse of society. when the europeans left their continent to conquer the world, the found the nations that were easiest to conquer were those with a strong, centralized hierarchy. this is because all they had to do was take out the king or emperor and the whole state fell apart because so much power, temporal and spiritual was focused on this one man and those close to him. examples of this include the aztecs, mayans, the congo etc.. in contrast to this were nations whose power was localized around a village or market. in this case, taking out one village or kidnapping one chief did no result in the nations downfall. the europeans had to conquer these nations one village at a time. it was  hard and took them an extended amount of time to accomplish. likewise, when power is concentrated its abuses tend to be more extreme and harmful. we only have to look at the great number of wonderful dictators and tyrants out their, who really do believe they have every right to do what they do, sucking their countries resources dry, petrifying their peoples dynamism with their rule by impulsive whim and shallow inclinations.i have full confidence that people can run their own lives and that the people should be most concerned with ruling themsevles rather then others.(more on this later)but i do have some problems with miltons analysis. first of all, this is a little rift, he says that only capitalist societies can produce great feats of engineering, technology, science and art. of course this false. one only has to pick about the ruins of kemit, china and rome to see that tyrannies can produce plenty examples of human magnificence. matter of fact, it is first in centralized bureaucracies that you the rapid development and adaption of new technology and artwork. there are a number of reasons for this but none of them have to do with capitalism. capitalism is a relatively recent phenomenon. but, if he argued that we would not have our current seemingly endless growth of industry, technology and wealth without capitalism, the i would probably concede is argument.probably the most important tiff i have with libertarians is their emphasise on property rights. i think that is good and it all, but it seems here they think property is limited to physical land or good. but to me the most valuable property in the world is the property we all possess, human life. so maybe we should be most concerned with developing, protecting and enhancing this property more then any other. another concern is how he characterizes freedom as having choice. now, i would agree with him on this point. freedom does mean having a choice and making decisions on ones own actions. he also says the more choices or options one has then the more freedom one has. these options include where one can live, what one can eat, wear, go to school, occupation etc...but in a capitalist society having choices requires having capital. and in capitalism there is always those who have far more capital then others and these with capital have actual power and sway over the lives of others and wasn't are concern about the concentration of power? and those with limited capital therefore have limited freedom but aren't we trying to maximize human freedom. i have only read some of the of book so far, so friedman might answer all my questions but those are my thoughts on libertarianism as he lays it out. i am going to try and development my thoughts and concerns a little further in the future.

the truth about my motives
[dec. 16th, 2005|03:13 pm]
afronerd




actually, the truth is i'm just blogging because everyone else is. as much as i would like to think otherwise, the simple, elegant truth is that i'm a social being hence a follower and like to be in on what everyone else is doing at the moment. its useful programming, this herd mentality but programming nonetheless. helps makes the spread of useful memes,  such as good hygiene, manners and  proper dinner etiquette  that much more effective. violation of these protocols leads to embarrassment and possible banishment, both of which can usually reduce ones chances of acquiring resources or even surviving in this harsh world. people need each other, so copying one another creates group cohesion. but it often enough leads to mobs, public hangings, bad fashion, poor speech and the present popularity of noisemakers posing as real musicians. (k to the west, y’all) and it is something that i was born with and had no initial control over. it is one more limit on my freedom and in this sense a more spiritual freedom to mold by one behavior and actions. see, you hear all this talk of freedom but it really comes down to the extent of our control over our own actions. can i really reprogram myself? like some doctor trying to cut out his cancer with his own hands, i need a sort of mirror, a guide, an error-checking program independent of my passions and wants. i need to be keen on the feedback and make the proper adjustments. stop myself sometimes and really think about what i am doing. a psychologist would say that some neural wiring underwrites all of our actions and to think otherwise is pure rationalizing. an executive will is only to over determine human behavior and it is only an illusion born from the complexity of our brains. but, i say bah! that may be true most of the time but i do believe in “will” even if it may be an insignificant force. it has great potential energy and it only takes a drop of it to move continents. this will has to be cultivated because it is not a “natural” thing thou it is very real. so, i have come up with a rough plan. i have to be scientist in how i watch myself. catalog my responses to certain stimuli, monitor my feeling in specific situations,  notice patterns and make the necessary changes. i have to stop when all i want is to go and act when all i want is to chill. i have try my hand at kierkegaards’ motion of “becoming”, ever transforming and expanding.  i must never settle for just “being”, a very handy bag of facts and functions useful for others to use. then my life would just become one big excuse. i must learn how to use myself.i take in the mist like a balloon and i floatafternoon of delight, wonder and playan orange eye takes a peek over stone shouldersshadows in combat breaching a wall of light

[mood
|accomplished]
[music
|eve by steve spacek]as this is only a beginning expecting to much will surely lead to dissapointment. this is a test if you may, an attempt to measure my ability to commit to an endeavor. in this case, i chose a blog because it requires little labor and involves an activity i enjoy, mainly writing. the challenge for me is whether i can be consistent with my entries and having the courage to bare apart of myself to the world. hence, i confront two of my most devastating failures in social etiquette, detachment and a generally noncommittal attitude. in other words i have poor follow through and tend to keep things to myself. there have been exceptions, such as school where i do pretty well but in other areas i fail because of a lack of commitment. take writing: i'm good at it and it makes me happy but i only engage sporadically, scribing here and there and only finishing projects when i have to. if some invisible hand would do me the favor of giving me a cosmic deadline on my own personal adventures it would be much appreciated. left to my own devices all my talents would waste away and i would be none the sadder but the world would be bitter i bet. maybe this blog will be some sort of structure within which i can focus and work. i hope to write everyday and keep my skills sharp while at the same time perhaps venturing into some online conservation with those in the blogging community. whatever, i'm out.
