i'm a recovery support specialist

i wish you had diabetic sandals!! in the summer, during summertime, i don't want to always have to have my feet closed in completely in my diabetic sneakers. that is my only regret / complaint. i wish you would order from the company that makes those shoes again, as i was told that you don't any more.
