a place of healing, help, hope


















from our hearts to yours

welcome to the bethel ame church website. we are glad  you  have chosen  to spend time with us online. we’re known as bethel nation —a nation made up of community and family. we are committed to following jesus and to worshipping him with vigor and joy. we believe in practicing radical hospitality, passionate worship, intentional faith development, risk-taking mission and service, and  extravagant generosity. our hope is that all people will feel loved and welcomed at bethel. and once here, we pray that people will discover their purpose and build their dreams.  please come and visit us. come as you are. check us out; but more importantly, check out what god is doing through us. we are always updating our website, so click around to get a glimpse into what we do and who we are. watch our streaming services online; check out what we’re sharing on social media; even follow what upcoming events are planned. remember, this is only a glimpse. to fully understand someone, you have to spend time with them. so, we invite you to come visit and get an up-close, in-person fellowship that comes when people share time together under the presence of the holy spirit. thanks again for visiting. we look forward to seeing you in bible study or sunday worship service. rev. patrick clayborn, ph.d. - senior pastor and  rev. sheri d. smith clayborn - itinerant elder
