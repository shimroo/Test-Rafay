wisdom news

 
" leisure requires the evidence of our own feelings, because it is not so much a quality of time as a peculiar state of mindâ€¦ what being at leisure means is more easily felt than defined."-vernon lee, "about leisure," limbo, 1908
by this definition it sounds like leisure is the opposite of stress. ah! so, maybe there is an antidote after all! perhaps we can choose to work leisurely and enjoy the time we spend getting things done - rather than work under stress, wishing we were doing something, anything else! perhaps it is a state of mind, one that we can tap into for our own benefit.-lissa coffey
