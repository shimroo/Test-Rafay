praise & reviews

i appreciate the time they’ve taken to understand our business on a deeper level, especially with regards to hiring style, working style, team make-up and organisational priorities. this has resulted in hudson consistently connecting a&g with high-quality candidates who have the right technical skills, but more importantly, are also a great fit with our organisational culture.

david cramp
cloud & network services manager, auto & general

we’ve partnered with hudson a number of times over the years. each time we are impressed by the care taken to get to know us and our business not just the needs of the role. hudson only send candidates through that they know will add to the culture of our organisation as well as meet the required skills and experience. hudson care about their candidates not only their clients, candidate respect and wellbeing is important to them.

the efficient service provided by hudson has impressed me immensely. i really appreciated paul calaby providing the highlights role, and getting back promptly on the queries i raised. he touched base constantly on the interview stages and kept me informed without me having to check in. they also called me and let me know that the pay would be processed, and on what day i would expect it in my bank. overall 5 stars to the team!

last year i was awarded the microsoft mvp award for my community leadership/ contributions. however, this would not have been the case if i didn’t meet pablo in 2016. pablo and i keep in touch regularly to provide honest feedback so hudson can improve in the future. i would consider pablo to be a good mate and would like to thank hudson for such a fantastic employee and the opportunities it created. thank you!

i had nothing but the best service from the fabulous stephanie james. she is incredibly prompt, a great communicator and always looked out for my best interests. 10 out of 10!
