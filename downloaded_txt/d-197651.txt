                    the process was very easy. michelle was able to show us how to restructure our loans to pay off a high interest credit card. this will save us thousands of dollars in interest.

                    the truchoice team has always been a pleasure to work with; they stand behind the true meaning of people helping people. i have always been an advocate of truchoice and will always be. from your member service reps to loan officers, you truly have the best trained staff. i see why you are voted one of the best places to work because they all have such positive attitudes and are willing to listen and help.
