autocross
autocross racing is perfect for amateurs looking to build their experience in competitive racing. taking place on a temporary course – usually airfields and paved parking areas – the aim is to race against the clock one driver at a time. for autocross racing, any car can be used, provided it performs in the correct class based on engine size and speed.





rvs
rv (recreational vehicle) living is becoming increasingly popular for its flexibility and freedom – and a major destination rv park can go hand-in-hand with motorsports. camping is a huge part of family race weekends, allowing fans and participants to stay close to the action. 





orvs
orvs – off road vehicles – are growing in popularity as both a hobby and a fun experience or activity. whether you’re hiring one for a day, doing some work on your own or pushing one to its limits on the tracks, there’s plenty of space for orvs in motorsports.










drag racing
drag racing has always had such a strong presence in the motorsports industry. known for being fast, loud, and spectacular, drag racing usually takes place in specific locations far away from residential areas. boasting an impressive history, drivers race their cars in pairs from a standing start down a straight quarter mile track. the winner is the first car to cross the finish line.





road racing
modern road racing offer incredible experiences all over the world. enjoyed by drivers of classic cars, motorbikes and bicycles alike, road racing involves drivers speeding down a straight track or a closed-off area mimicking city streets. either point-to-point or first to the finish, it’s a strong favourite with motorsports enthusiasts looking to show off their rides.
