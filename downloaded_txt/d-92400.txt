		  mark 
            has been interested in building boats since he graduated from high 
		  school. growing up around shem creek in mt. pleasant, south carolina, 
		  he was drawn to want to build shrimp boats. with limited opportunities 
		  to build shrimp boats, he began studying boat building at cape fear 
		  tech. mark began his boat building odyssey by working in several boat 
		  yards in virginia, panama city, and the charleston area. mark has 
		  built over 100 wooden boats (many of which are seen on this web site) 
		  and rebuilt, repaired, and restored countless other boats.
