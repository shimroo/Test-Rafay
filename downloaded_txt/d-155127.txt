quick, read the draft comprehensive plan
the dryden planning board (of which i am the second alternate) has released a public review draft of the dryden 2045 comprehensive plan.  it's 180 pages of discussion, maps, tables, and pictures of the town, including the part most people want to know about, the future land use plan.
the public hearing will be (too) soon, march 24th, and comments are welcome on the site through march 31st.  the town board also has to review it once the planning board sends it their way, so there will still be room for later comments, but sooner is generally easier.

unnamed
i watched the aprilmarch 18th facilities and infrastructure committee discussion of the freese road bridge.  if all that someone knew about this project came from that meeting, they would conclude that the county was dealing with a town that just wouldnât accept the countyâs wisdom.  there was not even a note of discussion about why the town had spent so much time on this and shifted away from these county legislatorsâ opinions.
in particular, there was a key word that never appeared in the conversation: varna.  apparently the freese road bridge exists in a blank space on the map that happens to be partly run by the town of dryden.
although its residents are poorer and more transient than many neighborhoods in the county, varna is not just a blank spot on the map where the county may do as it will.  the hamlet has been on maps since at least 1829.  varna has been living the impact of increasing volumes of automobiles on our roads since cars first arrived. varna, even the parts on smaller roads, struggles daily under the noise, pollution, and danger of new york state route 366.  
a couple of decades ago, residents were startled to find that the county was proposing another major new transportation corridor through the area as part of the northeast subarea transportation study, which âcould follow sparsely populated sections of hanshaw and freese roadsâ.  thankfully nests was basically rejected, though unfortunately its recommendations seem to keep happening in smaller pieces.
a decade later, the county did a route 13/366 corridor study.  residents were eager to hear that the county was taking traffic seriously.  this turned out, though, to be mostly a study of development possibilities, including my personal favorite, a map that suggested putting a driveway through my house and building dense apartments on the steep slopes above.
this latest conversation began with the town, which started out with the same terrible traffic-encouraging ideas that the county f&i committee wants to inflict on varna.  years of slow and frustrating work by varna residents, other town residents, the town government, and lots of other parties finally brought things to a workable compromise.
i know the f&i committee is very aware of those conversations, but doesnât acknowledge any of it.
this is unacceptable.  varna is not an empty zone awaiting the wisdom of county legislators, planners, and highway folk.  the county is made up of people living in neighborhoods. the county should recognize and listen to them.

about that sign

as visitors come into the town of dryden, they are greeted by signs.  most say âtown of drydenâ. some have an additional âright to farmâ sign and others add âsince 1797â.
one sign is different, and has been for a year now.  when you approach dryden from the town of ithaca on route 366, the town of dryden sign is missing.  in its place, someone put a sign for perchn.com, the student housing website.

sign on route 366, varna (perch'n).

while i would like the town to fix that, it is unfortunately an accurate portrayal of the townâs attitude toward varna.  the town board, despite past claims of award-winning planning, doesnât protect varna. remember those âwe [heart] varnaâ stickers of a decade ago, when the town was trying to convince hamlet residents it cared about their input?  

lately, the town seems eager to shred those plans.  the escape hatches â planned unit development, special use permit, unexpected state bridge grant with bizarre limitations â are open and the town is rebuilding varna for maximum property taxes, and placing zero value on community.  huge privatized dormitories make money faster, and their residents need to be able to get everywhere quickly.  they wonât, of course, generate any traffic, but we should definitely rebuild the roads for those rare moments when they want to go to the mall.

making this even uglier is the slowdown in student housing demand. cornell finally recognized that adding thousands of students without adding their own housing creates some gaps in the student experience, not to mention creating a bubble in local housing prices.  i have a hard time imagining this dormitory thriving, given its distance from most of cornell and its completely student-centric design. varna has done well with vet students, but there arenât that many of them.  one thing that could be worse for the neighborhood than trinitas succeeding would be trinitas building this and failing.  

varna is not, of course, the only part of town to feel burned by the boardâs fondness for big projects, but we seem to be getting the heftiest dose of them.  slow down, and listen to the neighborhood instead of developer dreams. fix the sign when you remember that varna is something more than the collegetown east colony of dryden.

three welcomes to dryden
sign at route 13.
sign on route 366, varna (perch'n).
sign at ellis hollow.
the right to farm sign is a recent addition.  the perch'n sign has been there since at least january, when i took a picture, but i think months before that.

state of the county: democratic primary results
looking at the initial results for tompkins county's democratic primary, the big surprise to me is in the last race. emily adams won the member of state committee 125th assembly district (female) race by 62-38 over diane bruns.

there were almost no signs for that race, no advertising that i saw, though not being a registered democrat, it's completely possible it skipped me. i had a few conversations with active democrats asking what that race even meant. i suspect that a lot of voters just guessed (and 2771 of 10,634 didn't vote that line) but that result is far far away from 50-50 statistical noise.

(zephyr teachout won here with 67%, amanda kirchgessner - state senate - with 64%, jumaane williams with 62%, derek osborne for sheriff with 61%, and cynthia nixon with 56.5%.  overall, cuomo did better than in 2014.)

i know and like both emily (from the sanders campaign) and diane bruns (from her work with the dryden and tompkins county democrats). had i stayed with the democrats, i would have voted for emily because i think she's more likely to push for much-needed change at the state committee, and connected to others to help with that - but wow that's going to be a thankless and difficult job.

years ago, within the county committee, a pair of candidates tried to take the two county committee seats from the party regulars to promote change at the state level. the incumbents argued - plausibly - that they were doing as much as was possible or effective to create change, and it just wasn't possible to accomplish more.

we'll see what happens. good luck, emily adams!



state of the state: democratic primary results
if i was andrew cuomo - and i'm definitely not - i'd be delighted this morning.

not only did he win, but the counties that dared vote against him are fewer in number. still upstate, mostly concentrated in the capital region, plus reliably treasonous tompkins.

his preferred lieutenant governor, kathy hochul, had a closer race mostly because of manhattan and brooklyn, but at least he won't have to deal with his father's alfred delbello headaches. (delbello was ed koch's lieutenant governor candidate, and mario was stuck running with him.)

cuomo's preferred attorney general candidate, letitia james, won. she seems less likely to rattle his donors than zephyr teachout, and i think he can plausibly claim that his party machinery was crucial to her success.

i've seen a few folks suggest that cuomo is likely sad about the defeat of most of the independent democratic conference senators. i don't think he is. the idc was a splendid tool for him, a way to maintain the divisions among democratic senators that let him hide from issues that might rattle his donor base. however, cuomo managed to reunite the democrats formally before the primaries, and the demolition of the idc was largely under the banner of "party unity".

since cuomo is likely to have a democratic senate this time anyway, and since he controls (most of) the party, "party unity" probably puts him in a more powerful position than he would have been otherwise. the idc sacrifice seems likely a good thing for him in the long run, and he can now more easily use party unity as a reliable club against the left.

yes, the candidates who beat the idc senators (and martin dilan) are to their left, but they're newcomers to an institution designed to absorb all who enter. it will take years before there are enough of these folks to make a difference, and by then, cuomo will be enjoying a very comfortable retirement. (or, perhaps, the white house, or prison - but in some way he'll be out.)

clearly, it's great to be cuomo. it's much riskier to be the folks who let cuomo be cuomo, whether they're the idc senators or the staff people who got indicted and convicted of corruption charges that clearly had nothing to do with the governor. you really shouldn't pay close enough attention to notice that.

statement to town board on freese road bridge
it's not very often that i get to say that history has been kind to 
varna. the highway slashing through it has damaged it for decades. the 
community's willingness years ago to build water and sewer 
infrastructure has made it the dumping ground for the town's dreams of 
density and tax revenue.  "so far from god, so close to cornell," or 
something.
however, history did us one massive favor.  the historic freese road 
bridge is both an emblem of local industry and the most effective 
traffic calming device in the area.  the intersection of freese road, 
mount pleasant road, and dryden road has some of the worst sightlines in
 the area, combined with steep hills that make winter driving exciting.
we know that the town board wants to see lots and lots of development
 in varna.  why would you want to draw even more traffic to the area 
than it already has, to an intersection thatâs broken and unlikely to 
get better?
history's been protecting us here.  be kind to history.
don't sell us out and claim the state made you do it. if it comes down to it, don't take state money to make your town worse.

nyseg/iberdrola loses the thread
wow.  i hadn't been to a town board meeting in over a year, and 
thursday night i returned somehow to a meeting that left me wondering if
 a former pillar of the town's economy has completely and utterly lost 
contact with the place and maybe with a lot more.
nyseg wants to build a gas line from the village of freeville to lansing, along route 38 and west dryden and farrell roads.  this is a pretty good summary from last summer of the proposal.  nyseg seems to call it the lansing-freeville reinforcement project.
the line that nyseg wants to lay has a few interesting features:

it's a 10" steel pipe that structurally could carry about 20 times the amount of gas they want to regulate it for.
even at that rating - the 124psi maximum rating for a 
distribution line - the pipe can carry 700,000 cubic feet per hour.  the
 average residence uses 7. this pipe could carry enough gas for almost 
every tompkins county resident. (the cornell power plant has its own separate transmission line.)
nyseg has let the pressure in their local network drift down to 
below 50% of maximum pressure.  they like to run at about 70%.  a little
 less than half of this line's capacity will bring that pressure up to 
above 70%, and rest allows expansion.
the line might bring some residents on west dryden road natural 
gas service, but only those who live within 100 feet will get a free 
installation.

the easement that nyseg wants to use:

pays property owners a generous $1 for letting the line go through.
is for transmission or distribution - and nyseg acknowledged that they could run a larger pipe through the same space.
leaves liability with property owners.
is kinda sorta negotiable, though apparently not on the parts 
that actually bother people.  nyseg would rather not say anything about 
any details on that front ever.

i don't think nyseg helped themselves much at the town board meeting.
nyseg/iberdrola's dryden brain - hint: the management building is empty..
the nyseg building still looms over dryden, but they don't seem to 
know anything about the place any more.  i'd have guessed someone would 
have noticed dryden's battles with frackers and series of court 
victories. someone might have voted in or read about the elections that 
created and held a board that supported that long campaign.  perhaps 
it's too much to hope that they might have noticed dryden's powerful 
combination of activists and residents eager to defend dryden. anyway...
the meeting kicked off with citizen's privilege before a full room.  town supervisor mary ann sumner
 asked speakers to constrain themselves to three minutes.  most of the 
comments were about the proposed gas line, most from town residents, 
esepcially people who live on its route, and are opposed.  (jim skaley 
and i encouraged the board to hire a planner to fill the gap left by two
 departures in the planning department.)  tony ingraffea
 gave the board specific questions to ask about the pipe being used for 
the project, while david bravo-cullen asked the board to ask nyseg about
 the tax contribution the pipeline would make to the town. (that 
question, alas, was forgotten.)
next up was nyseg - community relations manager bob pass, project 
manager dave bovee, and jennifer negus from their real estate division. 
 nyseg presented to the board, not the public, though members of the 
crowd (70 or so?) expressed their opinions periodically, and the board 
called up tony ingraffea near the end of the session to answer some 
questions about nyseg's answers.
bob pass handed out a sheet with "information on how we design, 
install, operate, and maintain natural gas systems".  it had a link to http://www.dos.ny.gov/info/nycrr.html,
  with directions to view the unofficial nycrr, and track down title 16,
 chapter iii, subchapter c, part 255.  following the directions takes 
you to here, which isn't especially readable.
jennifer negus awkwardly stonewalled all questions about the easement
 agreements, proclaiming repeatedly that negotiations were only to be 
between nyseg and individual landowners and secret until complete.  
somehow that was supposed to be a triumph for individual liberty when it
 was painfully clear that it's just a divide-and-conquer strategy.  
insisting that "it's a distribution easement" when samples provided by 
residents plainly said "transmission or distribution" didn't help negus 
either.  (especially when the answer on "what in this easement would 
keep you from replacing this with a transmission line?" was "nothing.")
the board was, um, deeply unsympathetic, with linda lavine
 reminding her that "god didn't write that template" and suggesting 
repeatedly that nyseg might get further in these negotiations if they 
didn't start from the extreme position they seem to take for granted.  
residents and the board challenged nyseg's negotiating tactics, but got 
pretty much no useful response.
dave bovee did a much better job answering questions, sharing facts 
even when they made bob pass grimace.  his data about the pipeline - run
 through tony ingraffea, who the board had speak briefly during the 
nyseg presentation - yielded the information above.  he offered details 
about the pipes, the connection to dominion's pipeline in the village of
 freeville, and how the system would respond overall.
my one doubt about bovee's testimony is his faith that line pressure 
limits, once set, will never change.  yes, there are physical and 
government regulators involved, but both of those can change over time. 
 while yes, it would cost money to change the physical regulators, and 
it might cost money to change the government regulators, neither is 
genuinely etched in stone.  this pipeline, if built, should be around 
for a long long time, and given how overbuilt it is, it's not as hard 
for me to imagine regulators eventually allowing higher pressure in it 
than it is for bovee to imagine the same.
so where next?
after almost everyone had left, the board explored its legal options 
and asked town attorney mahlon perkins and code enforcement officer 
david sprout to prepare opinions based on the zoning and franchise 
agreement.
i hope nyseg listened enough to recognize that their current strategy
 isn't working very well.  their approach and choices have made many 
residents skeptical or hostile in a town that's already defeated the gas
 industry once.  i fear that they will change their strategy to eminent 
domain, which they acknowledged was possible, rather than listening and 
adjusting.
you can see the ithaca journal's report on the meeting or whcu's report.

might assemblywoman lifton be vulnerable to a 2016 primary?
ten days ago, my answer to that was no.  today...
a week after assembly speaker sheldon silver's arrest for multiple federal felony corruption charges, 23 democratic assembly members did something unprecedented in recent memory.  they formed a reform caucus, and asked new candidates for speaker basic questions about the structure of the assembly to come:
for example, should members know how decisions are made inside of conference? ....
should staff allocation information be distributed openly?
how can members have a greater opportunity to weigh in on policy and budget decisions before legislative negotiations?

how can we encourage a real and robust debate in committee meetings and on the floor?

should members have the ability to get bills voted on in committee and on the floor if there is broad support among colleagues?
barbara lifton's name is not on the letter.  perhaps she will sign on later?
lifton's district, though, pretty much screamed reform in september, 
when zephyr teachout thrashed governor cuomo 3464-1415 in tompkins 
county, the bulk of her district, and 444-304 in cortland county, of 
which lifton represent a part.
to put it another way, teachout got more votes in a governor's race with low turnout than lifton got in tompkins county in the 2002 primary that began her legislative career: 3340.
  lifton's total for both counties is higher, but i don't have town data
 to compare for cortland.  however, her margins in cortland county have 
been reliably lower than those in tompkins county, and numbers this 
close are not comforting in any event.
the other complicating factor is that sheldon silver's campaign 
committees stood as a bastion against reform challengers, able to send 
out money to help those silver thought would help him.  it's not clear 
what will happen to those committees and their funds at this point.
state democratic primaries haven't brought a lot of voters to the 
polls for a long time.  perhaps, given real choices, they might again 
someday.
perhaps this will all be forgotten by 2016.  or perhaps it won't.
update: more on the reform caucus here, and we may get to have similar conversations about senate republicans soon.

thank you, dryden
from earlier today:
12:11 p.m.: dec commissioner joe martens reveals local fracking bans a "legal game changer."....
12:30 p.m.: [doh commissioner] zucker says he wouldn't live in a community that allows fracking.
12:33 p.m.: state dec has banned hydraulic fracturing

local politics can make a huge difference, even in - perhaps 
especially in - battles that seemed hopeless.  the town of dryden's 
passing a drilling ban and persevering in its defense wasn't the only 
thing that led to today's decision, but it was a critical component of 
the story.
you can make a difference.

martha robertson for congress
want to make up your own mind?  here's the debate.

this is one of the easiest endorsements i've ever made.
martha robertson has 
impressed me since she first came to my door to ask for my vote in her 
first run for county legislature.  we don't always agree, but when i ask
 questions she either has a thought-out answer or takes the time to find
 one.
i'm jealous of her energy.  she's about the hardest worker i've 
encountered in politics. she reaches out on a regular basis, she takes 
advice well, and she's good at finding common points among people from 
very different backgrounds. i hadn't realized she was a kindergarten 
teacher, which i take to be a good thing. she's learned  lessons from 
that but doesn't talk to people like they're five.
she's been able to tell the difference between her own views and 
those of the people of her district a number of times, and built bridges
 the people in her district and the people inside government. that's 
been especially helpful on varna-related issues, but i've also found it 
important on highway issues and the lightning rod of fracking.
she's worked with every level of government, from town through county
 to state and federal. she's worked with republicans, including chemung 
county republicans, through the association of counties, and fought 
together with them to make albany take a saner approach to medicaid.
i knew tom reed
 growing up, and nothing he's ever done has made me think he should be a
 congressman.  we share a hometown of corning, but little else.  his 
politics irritate me, and his campaign strikes wrong note after wrong 
note.  his constant contempt for tompkins county, where i now live, 
makes me embarrassed that we share a hometown.
as much as i talk about upstate new york, my heart is in the southern
 tier and the finger lakes.  robertson will make sure we still have a 
southern tier and a finger lakes to love, with jobs that last longer 
than a gas boom and at less risk of being exported.  it's an easy choice
 for me.

howie hawkins for governor
i finally saw a cuomo sign this weekend, in freeville.  someone is 
cheering for the governor, but finding strong cuomo fans is surprisingly
 difficult.
here's how i read this year's ballot for governor:

astorino (republican / conservative / stop common core) - gop for real, forever
cuomo (democratic / independence / women's equality ) - gop-lite, bent on controlling everything
cuomo
 (working families party) - gop-lite but desperately hoping that he'll 
be nice or something and that the working families party will get the 
50,000 votes they need to keep their ballot line despite endorsing someone out to destroy them.
hawkins (g) - wow!  someone with ideas about how new york should be different!
mcdermott (libertarian) - well, i can't see libertarians voting for anyone else here.
cohn (sapient party) - their principles are an odd mix of "sounds great" and "what does that mean?"

i'm happy to support howie hawkins.  as a syracuse resident, he'd 
break the curse of nathan miller, our last governor from upstate 
(1921-22). he's a teamsters member loading trucks for ups, and he would 
push new york away from the continuing capture by new york city 
financial and real estate interests that is drowning our politics in 
empty advertising.  there's a lot more in this introduction.
isn't a vote for hawkins a protest vote?  isn't cuomo guaranteed to win?
does it matter?  i don't mind lost causes at all, though.  sometimes 
they're the best causes.  and sometimes they even yield pleasant 
surprises, especially in the long run.

those pesky proposals
another year, another set of constitutional amendments on the new 
york state ballot.  we don't go as far as some states, but occasionally 
it gets interesting.
this year's proposal 1 is the "fake independent redistricting reform"
 option.  it's basically the same terrible broken system we have today 
with a little bit of window-dressing and a fallback to the usual 
corruption. please vote against it.  or listen to kathy zahler or mike lane's gentler tellings.
proposal 2 makes me sad, because the temperature of the 
freshly-copied legal papers hitting legislators' desks combined with the
 lateness of their arrival is a historically important indicator of how 
broken last-minute legislation will be.  i'll probably vote no, but 
kathy zahler's take on why to vote yes is a saner approach.
proposal 3 is also a bad idea.  technology is magical, and needs no 
maintenance right?  so let's go into debt and it'll all be fine even if 
the debts last longer than the tools.  er, no.  again, kathy zahler has the right idea.

death, hell, or canada - rides again november 8th
i'll be giving an expanded version of my talk on the battle of queenston heights at the history center in downtown ithaca, on saturday, november 8th from 3:00pm to 5:00pm.
death, hell, or canada: dryden and the war of 1812.
this time around, i have more information about soldiers from 
elsewhere in tompkins county, notably lansing and trumansburg, thanks to
 carol kammen and a few town historians. i have more about the 
comparisons between the armies, and i'll be including more about the 
canadian perspective on the battle.
i started from this chapter in george goodrich's centennial history of dryden, which made clear that dryden militia had fought at the battle of queenston heights, and been killed (one), injured (at least one), or captured (everyone who crossed).
i'll talk about the many ways in which war was different then, and 
focus on the challenges of a largely militia attack across the niagara 
river.
redcoats firing a musket volley.
somehow, most americans have forgotten about the war of 1812.  canadians seem to have put a lot more effort into remembering.
cenotaph and monument for the fallen general brock.
i've also posted sets of photos i took while doing research for this:

fort niagara
fort george
lewiston
across the niagara river
queenston heights battlefield
laura secord house
fort missisauga

obviously, i won't be showing all of those pictures!
