bendigo, victoria, australia
my mother reminds me often that it was she who ‘discovered’ my artistic ‘talent’ at the tender age of two with random drawings depicted on the many walls of our home.  my preferred medium was permanent texta.

i purchased books to learn the styles of the likes of jack davies and jeff hook.  my heroes.  the corners of those books were certainly well worn.  practice, practice, practice.  i was constantly sketching in the back of my school books during class.  my enthusiasm for cartooning had reached a new and everlasting level.

each day i couldn’t wait to get the herald sun and check out what jeff hook had woven with his magic touch of the brush.  where was that damn hook already!  i was simply awestruck.

showing my sketchpad to my art teacher in year 10 was the moment i realised i might actually have real talent for cartooning.

that teacher must have recognised the potential in my adolescent drawings.  it was upon his suggestion that i started to enter my drawings in competitions and seek publication.

so i did!  and i haven’t looked back since!
