this is my last public post. due to the obsessive nature of people on site i don't even post on anymore (and they call me crazy) i have decided to make my journal freinds viewed only.my thoughts are my own. alot has changed from when i started this journal two years ago. and i never thought that my old thoughts would make ammo for a person who enjoys flaming.tags: troll
