letter from the granddaughter 
  of lcdr eugene sarsfield 
i am eugene sarsfield’s granddaughter, jane 
  vaccaro. my grandfather was the commanding officer of the maddox when she was 
  sunk off sicily in 1943. 

  i understand that your maddox reunion will be coming up in just a few days in 
  philadelphia, and wanted to send you all my best wishes. the men who served 
  on the maddox with my grandfather, as well as their families, are in my thoughts 
  and prayers always. for those who survived that july day, i hope that life has 
  brought you all the blessings and peace you so richly deserve, along with the 
  knowledge of gratitude that is felt for your own great sacrifices.

  the battle of sicily and the loss of the maddox occurred generations ago, now. 
  but time has not lessened the sadness of losing so may dedicated and wonderful 
  men, and it has not lessened the emptiness we still feel by their absence in 
  our lives. for you good men, and for the families who gave the greatest sacrifices 
  of son, brother, husband, friend … know, as i do, that their legacies 
  have made a difference to those generations that followed. my own daughter, 
  jenna, grew up hearing the same stories of my absent grandfather that i did, 
  learning about what a great man he was, and understanding the value of his life, 
  and of the sacrifice made by his family. she calls him “grandaddy”, 
  just as i did and just as her own children will one day. the loss of the maddox 
  on july 10, 1943 set his life and accomplishments, and the lives and accomplishments 
  of all those who perished with him, in stone. he, and they, will forever be 
  the greatest truth of whom they were. 

  i wish you all, all the best. 

  jane vaccaro 


how's this for amazing!!

i 
    received the following email from albercht tobisch: 
i have 
    lived in jamaica for over 40 years. in august 1968 i strolled along palisados 
    beach
    and found the plaque pictured below, half buried in sand. i'm had it ever 
    since. 
with 
    the event of internet i found your website. 
 so the mystery remains: how did this well preserved 
    plaque land on a jamaican beach sometime before 1968. any clues???

  dachshunds in history: meet l.b., who is a very important pup
--- thanks to roy hyer
 l.b., a dachshund under a year old, disembarked 
  in june at long beach, california. she had been aboard the uss maddox, a destroyer 
  that ploughed the waters off vietnam with the 7th fleet. lb was part of the 
  effort to keep shipments of weapons and supplies going to the viet cong. disembarking 
  with lb was marshall lichterman of alhambra, california, yeoman 3rd class and 
  ship's postal clerk. 
  
when the maddox called at wellington, new zealand in may, a 
  newspaper there, the dominion, reported that she was named lb for long beach, 
  the maddox's home port, that lb had 15 assorted sweaters for different kinds 
  of weather, two naval uniforms tailor-made for her at hong kong, and two polo-neck 
  jerseys for really cold weather. 
also, lb had her own miniature lifebelt. she slept in her own 
  bunk. she had her own identification card with pawprints and details of height, 
  length, and weight, her own liberty card, and a service record. though frightened 
  at first of the maddox's 10 guns, she became accustomed to them, but she went 
  to the bow if the aft guns were operating, and aft if the forward guns were 
  firing. "many of the ship's visitors aren't at all interested in the guns 
  or the torpedo tubes," said the new zealand newspaper. "all they want 
  to see is lb." 



two interesting letters
john mckinley downs was my grandfather; and i might add my 
  favorite grandparent. he was kind and fun and loved my sister and i very much. 
  our county published a veterans’ book and my uncle put the information 
  about him in the book. it read in part: “he was a fireman first class 
  on the uss maddox. he enlisted in the navy for four years beginning 20 jun 1918 
  and was honorably discharged from the maddox on 24 feb 1920.” 
  i don't know where he finished the remaining time. he returned home and married 
  and had two children. my mother was his daughter. he was a crane operator by 
  trade and moved around the country as an employee of numerous construction companies. 
  i know he bought a farm in trigg county, kentucky during the 1940's. he lived 
  on part of the farm until his death 05 jan 1970. i also have a painting of him 
  and another sailor. it is hand painted and measures approximately 18-20 inches 
  tall and 10-12 inches wide. any information you could find for me would be greatly 
  appreciated and i hope this information will help you fill in the blanks on 
  his service. i have a 14-year old grandson and he is very interested in the 
  navy. wonder if it is genetic? i look forward to hearing from you again and 
  if i find any new information in his trunk i will certainly let you know. again 
  thank you for your time.

my name is paul barefoot and i live in colville, washington. 
  my oldest brother, edward t. barefoot was on the maddox (dd-622). it was sunk 
  in ww ii. is there any possibility that there is anyone in your association 
  that might have been on her that would have known my brother. it was sunk on 
  the coast of sicily in 1943. i myself was in the korean war from 1948 to 1952. 
  i was on the uss mt. mckinley (agc-7). 
  if you have any info for me, i would appreciate it.
  thank you for you time defending our country.

 maddox history
the following documents and
photos were collected from two sources. the first set of two
documents were sent to dennis stokhaug by dale
kelly who served in uss shubrick dd-639 in operation
husky along with maddox, off the coast of sicily. the first document is the
letter from mr. kelly and the second is from comdesron 17 commending the
squadron for their performance during the attack on sicily, and expressing
sorrow over the loss of maddox and cdr. gene sarsfield,
the maddox co.

message from comdesron 17



the second set of two documents and one photo were submitted 
  by rich pascuzzo, the nephew of leonard pascuzzo, who served aboard maddox in 
  1946. the first document briefly chronicles the maddox ship's history from commissioning 
  in 1944 through the early part of wwii, including the kamikaz attack off formosa. 
  the second document presents the ship's history during the closing few months 
  of wwii.

this photo submitted by don mettler, the web tender for the 
  uss hannock association. don's best guess is that the photo comes from the very 
  early 1960's. the two aircraft midships are either aj-1 or aj-2 savages, which 
  were retired in 1962.  
  








 


take a look at the uss

  the photo were taken between 1969 and 1972 in long beach.

maddox and moore (dd-747) were among a number of tin cans visiting pearl harbor in 1961, when dorman took these pictures right outside his barracks. incidently, when i was transferred off maddox by motorwhale boat in the gulf of tonkin, i travelled 100 yards to my new assignment aboard uss samuel n. moore (dd-747) 
this photo shows the maddox preparing to go alongside. 
 
 great photos - thanks dorman
