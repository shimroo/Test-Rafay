welcome to light up your brain!


hi! iâ€™m chuck brownâ€¦and thatâ€™s my face over there to the right (well, itâ€™s not exactly my faceâ€¦ but people think it looks a lot like me!). iâ€™m your host for this site. light up your brain is about inspiration, creativity, and the fun of being a kid.
iâ€™ve created and assembled some great resources to help kids have fun while learning and developing. our main resource is childrenâ€™s audio stories, which are intended for children in the preschool and early elementary age range, but older kids seems to really enjoy them as well! and, we also have a vast trove of quality coloring pages for free download across a wide variety of topics (some folks have also been known to use them as clip art!). feel free to dive right in by clicking on one of the links above, or keep scrolling down to read our blog of interesting things! comments or suggestions? use the form on the contact page to reach me. en-joy! ðŸ˜‰

tiny girl sings bohemian rhapsody

well, bohemian rhapsody isnâ€™t a song for kidsâ€¦but itâ€™s certainly the kind of song that people listen to over and over againâ€¦and tiny ears have been known to pick up just about anything. the songâ€™s dynamic arrangement and infectious, wide-ranging melody tend to get inside your head and never let go. this precious little girl has no challenge remembering the melody or what she understands of the words, even firmly ensconced in her car seat! ðŸ˜‰
