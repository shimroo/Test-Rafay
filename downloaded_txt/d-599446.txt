easystand standing devices pioneered the sit-to-stand market. sit-to-stand provides a natural, comfortable, and safe transition from sitting to standing for those who are unable to stand unsupported. it also provides a unique opportunity to stop in a partial standing position an acclimate to a position change or due to tightness ( or contractures) in one or more joints. often, manual range of motion (rom) can be difficult so the combination of weight-bearing and passive stretching can help maintain or improve rom over time with regular standing. easystand pediatric and adult standers help improve the quality of life for people with many medical diagnoses including spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, neurological trauma and more. standing devices are typically prescribed for home use and are often covered by a majority of private insurance plans and medicaid.

the justifyit tool generates a comprehensive letter of medical necessity (lmn) for complex rehab technology products (easystand, zing or activeaid products). it simplifies the process and reduces the amount of time spent writing an lmn. justifyit helps you quickly configure an easystand, zing or activeaid product, prompting you to add medical justification for each necessary support and positioning component – then walks you step-by-step through the entire letter process.

zing represents a full line of single and multi-position pediatric standers. the unique multi-position standers or mps pivot two directions which provides an unmatched therapeutic opportunity to go from supine, vertical and prone in one motion – no transfers, flipping pads or adjustments to the stander other than the tray angle, if desired. all zing models are available with an abduction mast, which allows for standing in abduction with independent adjustment up to 30 degrees per leg or 60 degrees bilaterally.

mpsthe zing mps is the only multi-position stander that pivots two directions, allowing the unit to go from flat-to-load supine to 20 degrees prone in one motion. there is no need to transfer the user in and out, flip pads, foot plates and trays. this ability provides a therapeutic opportunity not possible with other standing frames. it is also one of the few standers that provides the option of up to 30 degrees of independent leg abduction.supinethe zing supine is a single position stander but has all the features and positioning and support components available on the zing mps, minus prone positioning. the zing supine provides positioning opportunities from flat-to-load supine to vertical. it is also one of the few standers that provides up to 30 degrees of independent leg abduction.pronethe zing prone is a single position stander but is one of the few to offer a flat-to-load transfer position at a comfortable height of 32″. prone positioning from 0-90 degrees and up to 30 degrees of independent leg abduction.portablebuilding upon the industry-leading innovation and features of the zing multi-position stander, the new zing portable stander is a leap forward in product design. this new early intervention stander is the first “rightsized” product for standing children as young as possible (fits children from infancy to 36″ and up to 36 pounds). typically developing children will usually begin the processes of learning to stand between 9-13 months. the zing portable is designed to fit this age group better than any other product available, but that is just one of a long list of features that creates a new standard of care.
