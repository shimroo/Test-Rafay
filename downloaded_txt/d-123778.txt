we're baaack!
 



metro wrestling is new york city's accessible, gay-friendly freestyle wrestling club for adults.

please wear flat-soled shoes such as wrestling shoes, or alternately you can go barefoot (just wearing socks could get slippery). shoes with higher soles could put your ankles at risk. also as is customary at wrestling practices, street shoes can't be worn on the mats. we clean mats before each practice.


 
 





 all wrestlers of all levels are welcome at all practices.  we have several coaches to work with everyone based on their level (beginners, intermediate and advanced). join us for dinner afterwards! 







upcoming practices and events:





we will be practicing for the time being with the historic twin towers wrestling club at john jay college. the 
schedule is here.
 
metro wrestling will be hosting an open mats at the nyc wrestlefest on february 15 and 16, 2025 at the new yorker hotel, 8 av and 34 st, manhattan.  please click/tap here if you would like to attend.











 
see you on the mats!
