who we are…





nestled in the foothills of the berkshire mountains in central connecticut, buck's rock is really like no other overnight summer camp. we are a low-key, non-competitive haven where artists ranging in ages from 11 to 16 (going into grades 6th-11th grades) are free to choose their own creative and performing arts projects and activities.campers are given the freedom to make their own choices in a day, leading them to discover new art forms and engage in hands-on, experiential learning. working artists and teachers offer world-class instruction in over 30 different arts, including dance, glassblowing, improv, weaving, lighting design, ceramics, and much more. in an environment where they are trusted to take responsibility for their own creative lives, campers flourish and grow into confident young people filled with the potential to make great change in the world.we share the principles of montessori education, and have always believed in young peoples' ability to structure their time intelligently and make self-directed choices that tap their inherent interests most productively. buck's rock's unparalleled program has endured since 1943, growing and evolving with the changing times. yet we have not deviated from the montessori-based founding principles set forth by our founders ernst and ilse bulova: freedom of choice, trust, and responsibility. buck's rock would not be such a profound and life-changing force if these interdependent ideals and fundamental principles were not honored and protected. under towering oak and maple trees, our teen and junior campers discover their passions, find their voice, and experience the exhilaration of endeavor and accomplishment.each summer, we witness countless triumphs and achievements, which are monumental in our campers’ personal growth, future endeavors, and aspirations throughout the rest of their lives. inevitably, as teenagers pursue goals and try new activities, there are also struggles, disappointments, and setbacks that become equally valuable life lessons. the impact of a summer at buck’s rock cannot be easily captured in words, but it is evident in the hundreds of campers who make each summer their own dream of an experience, and leave with a renewed sense of self-worth and self-love.buck's rock's unique freedom-of-choice program could not exist without the trust that is extended to our campers. we trust that they will spend their time wisely and productively. we trust that they will make good choices for themselves, and that with the many freedoms, campers will act responsibly, enjoying their liberties and privileges while upholding and abiding by the reasonable guidelines that govern our community. campers come away from a summer feeling empowered to make thoughtful decisions, and having made friends and family that will endure for the rest of their lives.
