              arc ignitions

power
            arc's proprietary optical ignition systems offer extreme stability.
            a truly different product, you will notice a difference with this
            ignition.  the stability of the ignition helps to increase
            engine life and acceleration.  all ignitions are designed and
            manufactured in the u.s.a.




                    cd4-lm




            two ignition models are available cd2-lm & cd4-lm. the number
            represents how many coil cores the ignition is capable of driving.
            the ignitions have four timing maps. the module is extremely small
            and requires no external box or case see dimension drawing here.
            the ignition can be programmed for use on selected motorcycles
            including harley davidson (single/dual fire), honda, kawasaki,
            norton, royal enfield, triumph & ural.  it can also be used
            on tractors, cars and other 1-8 cylinder engines. the cd2-lm and
            cd4-lm ignitions use interchangeable adapter plates allowing the
            ignition to fit almost any engine with an exposed cam or crank
            shaft.

            ignition coils






 
 
  
  




            power arc has a full line of ignition coils designed to be
            compatible with different engine types and cylinder numbers. 
            both independent coils and coil packs are available.  all coils
            feature:


â zero current
              drain circuitry
â built in
              current overload protection
â integrated
              power/signal terminal strip
â integrated
              internal coil driver
â can be daisy
              chained
â capable of
              80,000 volts of output
â fast rise
              times for high output in multi-spark
â fires at low
              voltages for easier starting 

            coil packs feature:

â
              easy installation (only one coil pack per 4 or 6 cylinders)
â integrated
              ignition map/curve select switch
â integrated
              plug in connector strip

            coils.




            smart point modules


smart
            point modules are designed to work with your existing points. 
            they can be used with either the mc-1 or mc-2 coil.  they can
            also be used in distributor based systems.  click here
            for the smart point owners manual.



            features include:


â snap action
              output which provides high output. improves starting on all
              engines especially if kick started
â automatic
              coil shutoff to prevent damage to the coil if the power is left on
â points draw
              virtually no current so they will last longer and will not pit or
              burn
â static timing
              light to allow for more precise and easier timing
â high energy
              coil
â
              6 volt and positive ground versions available

            product development


we
            are currently developing ignition systems for motorcycles, cars,
            tractors, military vehicles etc. utilizing the ids (ignition
            development system) we can rapidly produce custom ignitions and
            distributors at a low cost. click here
            to see a description of the ids product development. click here
            to suggest a new product for development.
