there is no automatic procedure for purchasing from this site.

			if you are considering purchasing anything from this site let me know the stock number of the item or items you interested in and your location  and i will get back to you with a postage cost and payment methods.

			please contact me at:   ozcamera1@gmail.com 




please note:
			i am not a camera dealer or expert, i am an amateur collector.

			all cameras, flash units, sundries etc. are sold in "as is" condition, i have done my best to give an accurate description of each item, however i have no expertise in this field being only an amateur collector.

			if you are able to pass on to me information in regard to any of the cameras i have listed, thereby enabling me to give a more informed description, such information will be greatly appreciated.

			the cameras and other things in the links on this page are most of the items in my camera collection.

			i am always willing to consider a special deal if more than one item is being considered, please feel free to contact me with an offer.


all prices are shown in australian dollars

			please consider that in setting my prices i have the australian market in mind, depending upon where you are in the world, some items may appear expensive, but.... others will appear very cheap!!!! contact me if there is something there you are interested in. also bear in mind the aussie $ exchange rate at the moment is very favourable to most overseas countries, particularly the usa.

			you will find " a universal currency converter "  here. 



please note that this is not a commercial business, it's a hobby and therefor i am not at my computer 24/7. if you send me an email i will get back to you as soon as possible. there will be occasions when two (or more) people may enquire about the same item, i will do my best to treat such enquires on a first come, first served basis. 



if this symbol  is shown with a particular camera it indicates that i do not wish to sell it, however if you really want to buy it, make me an offer. 


  for reference check my 'feedback' on ebay.  


payment: 

international buyers:
 paypal
				          it is easy, safe and convenient.
				          (the seller carries the cost, there is no charge to the buyer.)





     



   i am sorry but international money orders and overseas cheques are no longer practicable as our banks are now charging between au$15 and $20 to handle them with a clearance time of 30 days.
				even cash in overseas currency is presenting a problem with the australian banks charging $10 to $20 as a fee to convert to au$.  
				 


australian buyers
payment methods:
				     cheque (allowing 5 business days for clearance),
				     money order in australian dollars.
				     cash in australian dollars.
				     "direct deposit" into my bank account.

				 



			 
			for delivery i use australia post

			       
please note , a $9 surcharge will apply on postage to the usa on items weighing over 453gms.this is over and above normal shipping.it is a charge by the us postal service on items in and out of the states to cover "increased security provisions" sorry, but its the way it has to be.shipping to the states will now be $9 more expensive on most items.


please note:
			there appears to be considerable delay which is caused by security checks etc. in the delivery of items from australia to overseas countries. if speed of delivery is concern it is suggested that items be sent by "air mail" with "insurance" attached to each shipment, even then delivery times cannot be guaranteed. 
			 
			



mckeown's law:
						"the price of an antique camera is entirely dependent upon the moods of the buyer and seller at the time of the transaction."
