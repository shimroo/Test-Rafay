land acknowledgement
the university of wisconsin-madison occupies ho-chunk land, a place their nation has called teejop (day-jope) since time immemorial. in an 1832 treaty, the ho-chunk were forced to cede this territory. decades of ethnic cleansing followed when both the federal and state government repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, sought to forcibly remove the ho-chunk from wisconsin.
this history of colonization informs our shared future of collaboration and innovation. today, uw-madison respects the inherent sovereignty of the ho-chunk nation, along with the eleven other first nations of wisconsin.
please take a moment to consider the many legacies of violence, displacement, migration and settlement that bring us together here today. and please join us in uncovering such truths every day. learn more about the department’s mission and values.
