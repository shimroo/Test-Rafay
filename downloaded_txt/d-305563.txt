dragon quest builders 2



i really don’t care for games like minecraft, but let me tell you about this little gem, dragon quest builders 2. hyperbole aside, i’d like to preface this review with a simple statement. i didn’t play the first dragon quest builders game. i did play through the demo of the first game, but i never picked up the full game, and i’m glad i waited. after speaking with some people who have played both, this game is a much superior title. there’s a chance i may have been pushed away from this one had i played that first. i didn’t quite know what i was getting myself into when i…

super neptunia rpg



super neptunia rpg for those unfamiliar with the series is a turn based 2d side scrolling rpg and a spin off of the hyperdimension neptuna franchise. coming in blind to the series myself i was greeted with a pleasing anime art style and some nice music coupled with a very cheesy storyline “an evil organization (bombyx mori) is forcing citizens to churn out 2d video games getting rid of 3d completely and if the games don’t meet expectations they are cruelly banished to soul crushing trial grounds”. our protagonist is a girl called neptune who awakens with amnesia and sets off on a quest to find out what happened to…

longstory



after 2064: read only memories left a rather bad impression of “inclusive gaming” on me, i figured i would give another story-driven game that touts itself as an “lgbtq+ friendly dating sim”. before i begin, i want to preface that i am not a member of the lgbtq+ community, and i don’t think that should matter for someone to enjoy a game that wants to be inclusive. dating sims aren’t really my thing. i have no issue with them, but rarely have found them to be something worth drowning myself in. most are anime or fan-service oriented. this one has its own art style, and looked somewhat appealing. i was…

snk 40th anniversary collection



it seems that everyone these days has some sort of compilation or collection to sell you. very few do anything ambitious. perhaps that is why digital eclipse was formed. if you are unfamiliar with that name, as i was, they are a collective that is dedicated to the preservation and archival of classic games. below is a screen capture from their site, which you can find at http://www.digitaleclipse.com/. as you can see, they don’t seem to be as thirsty for your money as most companies are. instead, they really want to create the most comprehensive products with a bevy of information along with the games in the package. that said, i’m…

pocket rumble



i love fighting games. this may be lost on many of you, but i fell in love with fighters back at a local arcade called aladdin’s castle. like most arcades, it was stocked full of ticket racing games, skill games, and side-scrolling beat-em-ups. alongside all of these were a boatload of fighting games from capcom, midway, namco, and snk. whenever we would go to j.c. penny, i would beg my mom to let me go to the arcade. most of the time, after i had gotten my back-to-school clothes, she would give me a few dollars to go have fun so she and her sister could grab a bite to…

2064 read only memories



so, i read some articles in the past about read only memories and there was a lot of positive stuff out there for it. i had not read the articles in full, but i got that it was a cyberpunk adventure game with a non-binary support character. bravo for being inclusive! that’s what i thought at the time, however, now that i’m playing the game, i’m seeing things a bit differently. i, in no way, feel that people should be ostracized for their sexual or gender orientations. 2064 read only memories feels like it’s trying to send a message more than it wants to be a good game. i think…

yakuza 6



yakuza 6, the latest entry in the long running series has officially made its way state side.  for me this is very special entry in the series as it concludes kazuma kiryu’s story arc.  knowing this i took my time exploring the game and enjoying the story at a slow and steady pace.  with heavy investment into the sub stories and mini games i managed to clear the games story in about 50 hours.  how did yakuza 6 fair?  keep reading to find out! if you are new to yakuza, it must be said that the yakuza series is very much a story driven franchise.  although this is kazuma’s last main series game, yakuza 6 can…

guts & glory



you’ll laugh until it isn’t funny anymore! this game is…odd, to say the least. i want to say that it is a bad game, yet at the same time i feel like that was the whole point to begin with. so in that sense, calling it “bad” accomplishes nothing. it isn’t bad in the “let’s make some trash game that doesn’t work” sense. guts and glory just has this “cheap” air about it, like the developer got a hold of a budget physics program and started playing with it, and this game is the results of all of their demented mayhem (and ooooh, boy, is there demented mayhem here). there…

survive! mr.cube



survive! mr. cube! well, that’s the dream at least… chances are, mr. cube won’t survive. at least, not in the sense that one would often attribute to the word “survive.” because, in all likelihood, for mr. cube to be triumphant, he must die. that is the nature of the mysterious world he finds himself in. a dark and dangerous land, filled with creatures that want to kill him for…reasons. armed with his trusty longsword and, not much else, the odds truly are stacked against our hero’s favor. survive! mr. cube is an action adventure game with some roguelike elements mixed in. you play as the titular mr. cube, a minecraftian…

waterfield switchpack



in my search for a carry case for my nintendo switch, i’ve gone through quite a few different cases. after reaching out to sfbags.com, i was able to get my hands on their latest switch case, the switchpack. the switchpack offers a lot of storage at about the same profile as other cases i’ve had, most notably the takecase and the rds switch deluxe travel. while it is nearly twice the width of the rds switch deluxe travel case, it can hold almost as much as the rds switch deluxe system case. after modding my dock to be more portable, i can even get that in here without adding any…
