at the request of karen's family, acma has set up the karen vanaskie scholarship fund. karen was passionate about the need for case management certification. she actively supported her staff in pursuing the accredited case manager (acm) certification. to continue her legacy, this scholarship fund will cover the cost of their acm certification application fee for those to whom it is awarded. we believe this continues karen's legacy.
