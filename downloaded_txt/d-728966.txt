z-coil - veteran receives gift of pain relief for christmas



“my father is a disabled vet.  he is in desperate need of a new pair of z-coil shoes.  he currently has a pair that is very worn and torn.  he's had them for years.  he only wears these shoes because it helps with his back and knee pain.  i would like to buy him a pair for christmas, but i can't afford the cost.  i ran across this (press release) ad a bit late, but i was wondering what the veteran's day special was and if you would still honor it.” (read more)

seattle: postal worker's job made painfree



scott harris has been a postal worker for the past 30 years. he is planning to retire to the phillipines in four years. he has property there in cebu. about five years ago scott came to z-coil of seattle at the base of capital hill with an appointment to see the onsite consulting podiatrist dr. kerch. he was diagnosed with plantar fascitis and was treated accordingly. since his pain was so severe he was a candidate for foot surgery.scott says, " i was due to go under the knife, but the z-coil pain relief footwear relieved my pain". "i bought my first pair of z-coil's five years ago. now i have four pairs. the regular postal shoes last six months. these 4 pairs are the longest lasting shoes i have ever worn. my four pairs are all usable after five years. even the coils on my shoes, open and enclosed coils, have lasted two years. the z-coil shoes are well worth the money, not even taking into consideration the health benefits." "i prefer the enclosed coils because wearing the open coils delays me an additional 30 minutes to do my mail route. not as many people stop me to ask about my shoes when i wear the enclosed coils. when i wore my solar cap and the z-coil shoes, i couldn't even get out of the elevator because of having so many people asking me questions. -what are those?i've never seen them before.are those the basketball shoes with the springs that strengthen the calf for training? (no, these are mostly therapeutic shoes)now i mostly wear the enclosed coils. i have more energy and i am not so worn out at the end of the day-it's like walking on a cloud." "i'm really satisfied with the z-coil shoes. they are great for walking on concrete." "i tried the rocker sole type shoes, but they do not have the same effect. those rocker soles really aren't for plantar fascitis since they lean you back more toward your heels."

z-coil shoes : we fix traffic tickets blog



z-coil shoes : we fix traffic tickets blog: "most of you know i’ve been a fan of z-coil shoes for about 10 years. we went camping and did some hiking over the fourth of july in joshua tree national park.  i say some hiking because my z-coil high desert hikers literally fell apart during a short hike on the third.  the glue holding the soles to the body gave way and that was the end of any more hiking.  when packing for our triphigh desert hikeri selected a pair of gray z-coil hikers that had been barely broken-in over an older pair of brown hikers that are well worn. who would have thought that a $250.00 pair of shoes would fall apart?"
