a 40 year journey​it all began in phoenix in 1980 when todd cooley and ricardo santana partnered to create de santana stone, focusing on importing carved stone from mexico. jane kennelly joined the company about a decade later, and the collaboration and friendships among all three were solidified. jane moved east in 1997 and proceeded to open an eastern office of de santana stone. since then she grew the market to encompass most of the eastern parts of the united states, with a focus in the southeast. over the decades jane increased the variety of materials offered and the scope of projects we could undertake by partnering with the top talents in the industry, and solidifying her reputation for exquisite, unique and dependable work for residential, commercial and historical restoration projects.cut stone studios is now comprised of the members of that same experienced and trusted team, continuing to offer the unique limestone, cantera and adoquin stones from mexico as part of our ever-expanding lines of architectural stone from around the world.

seay, alfredo, and jane final project walk through







from luxury residential homes to commercial buildings to landmark restoration projects, incorporating natural stone with an eye to design, budget, service and delivery is what our team continues to do best. every aspect of this process, and the resulting relationships, matters to this team.​we are still the same people, but with a new name and broader reach. although many of these projects in our portfolio were sold under a different brand, cut stone studios utilizes the same team of design, fabrication and installation experts so you can expect the same results.  jane and seay are still focused on building strong, lasting, and trusting relationships, and this begins with all the collaborators who have made our many successful projects come to life. the fabricators, carvers, drafts people, technical designers, installers, quarriers, and logistics and shipping personnel, as well as our sales, accounting and management staffs all contribute to the success of each and every project we undertake. it's a tight circle, that keeps on growing and evolving over the decades, allowing us to to take on more complicated, interesting, and important projects.
