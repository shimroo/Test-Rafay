moon  man’s  top secret presidential document reveals the sad fact that the still unrepeatable 1969 “moon landing” was indeed falsified, fully detailed in the deathbed confession of a military eyewitness to this arrogant government deception."if you still believe that we landed on the moon and our astronauts walked on its surface in 1969 after reading this book, i don’t know what to say.  prior to watching joe rogan interview bart sibrel regarding the apollo 11 mission, i firmly believed the story.  i never questioned its authenticity.  suddenly, the lie became so clearly obvious and i delved further into the topic.  that’s why i read this book and it only further confirmed that the whole apollo mission was one big hoax.  while mr. sibrel belabors some points excessively, perhaps that is what’s necessary to get the truth to sink in." -amazon review

aliens from planet xtheir origin and future appearance the culmination of filmmaker and investigative journalist bart sibrel's decades long research about the illusive topic of "aliens", as well as the recently discovered possibility of a dangerous rogue planet "planet x" passing by the earth in the near future, with potentially catastrophic global consequences.sibrel's investigation contained herein reveals how our corrupt world leaders may use the passing of planet x for their long-planned revealing of "aliens", which may actually be inter-dimensional beings rather than extraterrestrial, which have secretly been here for millennia helping their kindred world leaders stay in power.though historic revelations of a secret bloodline of these world leaders, sibrel demonstrates a potential coming grand deception by the prolific liars who run the governments of the world. while the top two ufo researchers in the world finally concluded that ufo's are indeed real, they both surprisingly also concluded that ufo's are not from outer space, rather they are from earth in hidden dimensions, and that "aliens" have been here since the start of humanity, who have as their ultimate goal the eradication of mankind.prepare yourself for startling revelations about potentially life-changing future events that may hold life-and-death in the balance for every person on earth.






















the great earth hoaxthe world's first conspiracy book for children is bart sibrel's "the great earth hoax" about the moon people faking a trip to earth because of political pressure and government corruption within their society.written by bart sibrel the author of "moon man - the true story of a filmmaker on the cia hit list" and the director of the film "a funny thing happened on the way to the moon", which both expose the sad fact that the "apollo moon mission" was filmed at cannon air force base a year beforehand, the great earth hoax illustrates this historical revelation and concept for children with hilarious drawings and rhyming verses.bart sibrel is world renowned as the revealer of the moon landing fraud and has been featured in time magazine, the new york times, the washington post, usa today, hbo, nbc, cnn, fox, geraldo, candace owens, patrick bet-david, coast to coast, infowars, and the joe rogan experience.
