description: religious humor: writer/historian john cowart, a
christian of sorts, pokes fun at his own faith even as he expounds it
through books, newspaper columns, magazine articles and through a
daily journal which he has kept for over 20 years. is he a
fundamentalist or just a plain old fundament? and, in johnâs case,
is there a difference?  the blog section is updated daily;
this site is usually updated monthly â most recent update nov. 2010. jwc
