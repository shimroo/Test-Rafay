welcome to kinder hspva







dr. priscilla rivas, principalphone: (713) 942-1960 

greetings!as principal, it is my great honor and pleasure to welcome you to our website for kinder high school for the performing and visual arts (hspva). we are thrilled to be celebrating our 52nd year of excellence in the arts and academics at hspva! we continue to celebrate what makes us one of the nation's most prestigious high schools: our proud heritage, dedicated staff, successful alumni, supportive parents, and, most importantly, our gifted and talented students. we are thrilled with our new state-of-the-art five-story building in downtown houston, only blocks from the prestigious theatre district! the design and construction journeys from 2016-2019 were amazing as we worked with architects from gensler and our contractors from mccarthy building companies.  i am most excited about starting my third year at hspva and eager to witness the daily artistry that occurs on campus!
