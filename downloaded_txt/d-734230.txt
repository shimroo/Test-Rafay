from poverty to prosperity in one season

watch the video



we’re irrigating africa, one farmer at a time
kickstart is unleashing the power of enterprise with the irrigation tools that enable millions of smallholder farmers across sub-saharan africa to tackle poverty on their own terms. with our innovative water pumps, farming families break their dependence on seasonal rains, harvest high-value crops year-round, withstand droughts and flooding, improve quality of life, reduce hunger, build businesses, and strengthen livelihoods.




80%
of africa’s poor are smallholder farmers
the vast majority rely on seasonal rains to water their crops. irrigation offers a transformative opportunity for them to increase their incomes.






4%
of sub-saharan africa’s land is irrigated
an estimated 20% of farmers can easily access ground or surface water right on their farms–representing +20 million families that can change their lives with the right tools.






5%
of africa’s renewable ground water is being used
by using human and solar-powered pumps, farmers build profitable and weather-resilient agricultural enterprises, without depleting aquifers.
