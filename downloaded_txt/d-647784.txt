scottsdale's finest gated community

welcome to stonegate, a master planned community where the charm and beauty of the private north scottsdale location sets the scene for gracious lifestyles. gate-guarded stonegate includes 400-acres of single-family homes and custom residences, open spaces and recreational amenities rivaling scottsdale's finest resorts.
the landmark stonegate community center and recreation complex, reserved exclusively for stonegate residents and their guests, is situated at the community's hub. the spacious clubhouse, dramatized with 11 life-sized bronze sculptures at its entrance, is an ideal location for socializing with friends or entertaining large groups.
the structure's design features large expanses of glass that open a breathtaking line of site to the outdoor recreation area where a tiered waterfall cascades from the whirlpool spa to the junior-sized olympic pool. a stately ramada with barbecue grills and kitchen conveniences adds to the luxury.
for stonegate's sports enthusiasts, there's the seven tennis courts, two pickleball courts and a half basketball court on-site. in addition, many residents enjoy walking, jogging and bicycling amidst the community's greenbelts, parklands and trails.
set against a backdrop of mcdowell mountain majesty, stonegate is distinguished by its lush greenery and abundant landscaping. nearly 100 acres of the community are devoted to open space.
from luxurious custom homes on oversized lots, to homes that offer low maintenance yet luxurious lifestyles, stonegate offers a diversity of homes by the valley's finest home builders.
