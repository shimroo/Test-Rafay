“those looking for dinner with picturesque water views must make their way over to the ocean house. the dining room overlooks the nantucket sound, making it one of the most wonderfully scenic restaurants on the cape. dennis port is one of the more low key towns on the peninsula, but the ocean house brings true five-star luxury to the area, with an indulgent menu featuring items such as wagyu slider dumplings, lobster tagliatelle pasta, and fresh halibut. the combination of the food and views make for a delectable and breathtaking experience” - observer
