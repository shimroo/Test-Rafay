windshield repair vs. replacement


when should you get a windshield repaired or replaced? the first step is assessing the severity of the damage. while minor chips or cracks can be fixed, more severe damage requires windshield replacement. multiple cracks and holes in the windshield may need to be replaced as they compromise the structural integrity of the vehicle’s glass. if you need your windshield replaced, it’s best to take it to a professional right away.
cracks in the windshield can be repaired or replaced. while a crack can cause your windshield to crack, a chip can destroy it. when a chip is large enough, it’s time to replace the windshield. a repair technician will be able to repair most small cracks or chips, as well as some larger ones. otherwise, he or she will have to remove the entire windshield and replace it.
when you decide to replace your windshield, be sure to consider the cost of the repair. a full windshield replacement can cost up to $1,500, so if you can afford it, go for it. however, windshield replacement is a good choice if your cracked windshield has three or more cracks. if there are only a few small cracks, you may be able to wait a few months before you replace it.
when you have a small crack or chip in your windshield, you may be able to fix it yourself. however, if the crack is too big, you may want to consider a windshield replacement. in most cases, the cost of a repair is significantly less than that of a replacement. and it’s also usually a better option than paying thousands of dollars for a brand new windshield.
while many states require your insurance company to pay for a windshield replacement, most companies consider the repair a no-fault claim and will not increase your premiums or cancel your insurance. if you have a minor chip or crack, you should seek a repair as soon as possible because the chip or crack will continue to aggravate. if you have an expensive windshield, you should replace it right away.
although you can opt for a windshield replacement if you have a small chip or crack, you should never choose to have it repaired. it’s better to get a windshield replacement than a broken one. in either case, it’s better to choose the repair option that will ensure your safety. if you have an insurance, you can choose between repairs and replacements. in addition, windshield repair can be less costly than windshield replacement.
cracks and chips in your windshield are not always considered a serious damage, but if they are too deep, you should opt for a windshield repair. a proper windshield repair will be cheaper than a full replacement. if the chip or crack is more than an inch, the windshield is likely to be a risky investment. in some cases, it may be better to spend a few hundred dollars for a full replacement.
