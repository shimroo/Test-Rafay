glenn land farm dexter cattle & dorper sheep















what's new at glenn land farm?



due to the increasing cost of and decreasing supply of irrigation water and the level of energy of the
        owners, the scope of the livestock enterprises at glenn  land farm has been reduced.â  one hundred,  thirty acres has been leased for an almond orchard leaving 60 acres for  irrigated pasture and 40 acres for winter cattle pasture.â  the  result is that the ewe numbers have been reduced to 100 (50 dorpers and 50  white dorpers) and the cow numbers to 20.   we used this opportunity to just keep the very best ewes and cows.â  in addition, we added some high quality  dorper sheep from powell, holman, otten and hijo. the addition of the fullblood dorpers has given us a much broader
        buyer base. in addition, we currently have an dditional 30 recip ewes because we are adding fullblood
        white dorpers using foundation ewes from texas and embryos from dell in australia.


our sheep are registered with the american  dorper sheep breeders society and we are also members of the western states  dorper sheep association.â  we are charter  members of the purebred dexter cattle association and are also members of the  american dexter cattle association.



our farm is located in the sacramento valley, along interstate 5, 90   miles north of sacramento and 150 miles northeast of san francisco.    traveling from the north or south on i-5, simply take exit 614 (road 27)   just south of orland.  we are on the west end of road 27.  our address   is 6352 county road 27, orland, ca 95963.

future plans:


dexter cattle: the demand for dexter cattle has been brisk and we will not  be able to increase the size of our herd in the near future because of the  drought, so we will have some of our best cattle available in our online  production sale in october.â  watch for  updates on the sale. we will   continue to have lines of black, dun and red cattle, including both   horned and polled animals.  we will continue to do genetic testing to allow buyers to make more informed purchasing decisions. 



our a.i. bulls all come from good milking lines and are all free of   chondro and pha.â  glenn land mr tor and glenn land mr fire man are both   a2/a2. glenn land mr baird is our newest addition to our a.i.  sires.â  he is a2/a2, pc/pc, e+/e+, 39â at  the shoulder at two years of age and quite gentle.
mr redfire, mr shawn and mr fire man are all registered with   both the pdca and adca. we introduced english genetics from beryl rutherford's   hedgehog iii bull and transferred fresh embryos from one of our best   females.    
 the glenn land farm dexter herd was established in 1989 based on   bloodlines from missouri, idaho, oregon and california. original cattle   were selected for their conformation, temperment and calving ease.   during the past 20+ years these traits have been emphasized plus   uniformity of type has been established. we now have a larger   selection of breeding animals and steers available.  our cattle are run   on irrigated pasture in the summer and on native pasture in the winter   and little or no supplemental feed is required. 



 
online sale: we will continue to have our annual online  sale in october and provide the lab test results that our buyers demand to make  informed selections.â  the cattle will be  eligible for registry in the pdca or adca.â   lab testing will be done at the uc davis vet genetics lab.
 


white dorper sheep: the demand for our white dorpers has been very strong and we  are pleased that significant numbers of rams are finding their way into  commercial flocks across the country. the fact that dorpers finish on pasture,  produce mild flavored meat and are easy-care is driving the demand.we have been using australian genetics for several   years through a.i. and will continue to improve our flock in this   manner. we sell ewes and rams to people who want to stop shearing and   have easy care sheep. our market lambs find their way into a variety of   ethnic markets and to upscale supermarkets and restaurants in   california's wine country and the san francisco bay area. 
 


 




dorper sheep: since we get a lot of inquiries for dorpers we have added a flock of high
      quality ewes and rams to meet that demand. through the use of a.i. and the purchase
      of high quality rams we are now able to offer production oriented, fullblood ewes and
      rams that work for graziers, niche market producers and clients that want to be
    competitive in the show ring.
