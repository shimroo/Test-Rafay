vicky barrett savage 
       created an artistic website about her 30 year experience as a gastroplasty patient who was very ill as a result of her surgery (post gastrectomy 
       syndrome). vicky and i enjoyed skyping quite often!  she passed on, 
       in spring 2010. you can read her complete story by clicking on the banner 
       below. her own website is still available. this surgery is one of the 
       least invasive of all procedures but as you will see, in the long term, 
       it had its difficulties.  here is
       her page on this 
       site. below is a banner for vicki's site which is maintained by her 
       family.
