brigid’s day song

-the ruined?

"the ruined" are those countless ones throughout the ages  who  have encountered the presence of the living god to such an extent that they      are "ruined" for the things of this  world.  they can never return for any extended time to what was formerly known as  "normal life."   they are

they seek this in everyone and everything they meet.
