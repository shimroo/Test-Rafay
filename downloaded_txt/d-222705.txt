                  our story                

we exist to revolutionize healthcare, empowering providers and employers to deliver best in class treatment to patients in need.  in 1984, dr. michael leahy developed the treatment system to drive better patient outcomes.  since that time, the treatment has been made available through training other healthcare professionals at art seminars and through our corporate wellness programs.  as a result, millions of lives have been impacted over the years, allowing those touched by art to discover that you don’t have to “just live with” pain, restricted movement, or endure tedious treatment regimens for a chance at full recovery.  rather, there is a solution available to help get you back to achieving your goals quickly and efficiently.

other forms of hands-on therapy — myofascial release, chiropractic, whatever — all work. but we’re talking about fixing 95 percent of problems in four visits, versus 50 percent of them in 30 visits.
 


 
 
 



while playing recreational ice hockey, i fell in an awkward manner and my leg twisted under my skate. i immediately felt pain in my knee and lower leg. for weeks i suffered, limping around and taking medications. with the physical trauma associated with my injury, i thought i was headed for a scope, or worse, surgery. after just two art sessions, my knee and leg are feeling great again, with no pain.

if you’re suffering from a shoulder injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, or any deep muscle injury and you thought surgery was the only way to get relief, think again.
 


 
 
 



the art program has been an essential component to keep our team members happy, healthy, and in top physical condition to perform their daily work responsibilities. the year prior to joining art, we had six osha recordables. since joining, we’ve had two consecutive years with no recordables.

in fall 2017, i was running the kansas city marathon and had to stop due to the worst pain in my right hip. it felt like my bones were rubbing against each other with every step. the following week, i had two sessions of art and was able to run the kansas half without pain the next week. that was my first exposure to art, and i took my first art seminar in january 2018. i was art full body certified by march and use art regularly to help my clients.

i’m partial to art… after a single session, i hopped off the table, noticed that my back no longer hurt, then reached down and touched my toes for the first time in 15 years.
