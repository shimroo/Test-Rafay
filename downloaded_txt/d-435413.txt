										 natural beauty
										 safari egypt offer different safari 
										programs covering all egypt. the western 
										desert with its 5 oasis is known for 
										most of the african safari fans, the 
										african safari trips are usually between 
										5 to 10 days.









egypt, 
										perfect place for your next vacation !



 egypt's geographical 
										location with all its precious ancient 
										antiquities in addition to the pleasant  
										weather during all year,
										encouraged 
										tourism industry. 

										the first recorded tour to egypt in 
										modern history was in 1860 however we 
										know that egypt was a destination that 
										the greeks aimed to visit during the 1st 
										& 2nd centuries.
										 









nile 
										cruises, why ?



 first, tours to egypt were 
										only specified to big cities like cairo, 
										alexandria, luxor and aswan, later on a 
										need was developed to visit other 
										smaller cities (edfu, kom ombo, esna 
										...). as most of the monuments are 
										closer to the river nile, cruises were 
										the best solution for a trip that allows 
										tourists to enjoy the beautiful nature 
										of the egyptian countryside while 
										visiting monument of our ancient 
										civilization.
										

										nowadays, there are more than 300 nile 
										cruises, offering different types of 
										services and prices
										(from 7 to 4 stars). nile cruises trips 
										can be found for 7,4 and 3 nights 
										depending on the visits itinerary.
