same great society – new name
after several years of discussion, the hamilton and district chrysanthemum and dahlia society has finally changed its name to hamilton dahlia society, to better reflect what the society represents and the people they serve.  the members no longer grow exhibition chrysanthemums, and they have grown their membership beyond the boundaries of their “district” to well over 225 members from all over canada (and even alaska!). 

 

 
 
kristine albrecht, ads member (chairwoman genome project), dahlia breeder at santa cruz dahlias, author of dahlias: seed to bloom, and president of the monterey bay dahlia society is a consultant to the stars!  she was recently featured as an expert to marthastewart.com.  see the article here.
 
 













the american dahlia society is 
organized to promote and encourage 
the development of and appreciation 
ofthe dahlia through educational and 
research activities and by supporting 
the local dahlia societies.search
