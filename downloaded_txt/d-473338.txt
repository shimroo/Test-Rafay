the mcdonald institute for archaeological research provides a shared intellectual home for archaeologists at cambridge and their collaborators into all aspects of the human past, across time and space:

as a research facilitator of the department of archaeology, supporting the work of department staff, postdoctoral fellows and students
as an interdisciplinary centre for archaeology in collegiate cambridge, serving staff in a variety of divisions, faculties, museums and colleges (affiliation enquiries and applications should be sent to the mcdonald administrator)
as a postdoctoral research institute within the department of archaeology. in this role the institute independently supports archaeological fieldwork, other archaeological research, research fellows, visiting scholars, conferences and publications

the institute fosters archaeological research through a programme of seminars, workshops, conferences, publications and research grants as well as providing laboratories for a wide range of archaeological research which crosses continents, periods and approaches in its exploration of the diversity of the human past. it produces the cambridge archaeological journal and publishes peer-reviewed books across a range of subjects in the form of fieldwork monographs (mcdonald monographs) and thematic edited volumes (mcdonald conversations).
the mcdonald institute for archaeological research was established in 1990 through a generous benefaction from the late dr d.m. mcdonald.
