as based only on the bible, to provide

the 
exegesis / argumentation proofs in the bible,
the list of all the
polygamists in the bible,
and the examples where
the lord himself is self-described in polygamous terms in the bible,

all in a simple and easy-to-use web-site.


for anyone preferring to have the
layout
of the site's navigation to be a little different,
a simple click of a link will make a change immediately.


in giving credit where credit is due,
this web-site also provides the
copyright page.


may this web-site serve all who would seek to know the truth of the
bible.  for indeed, the scriptures prove that
polygamy really is biblical! sm
