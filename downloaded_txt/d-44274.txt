featured art






"goliath grouper shipwreck"






as a diver, shipwrecks are one of my favorite dives and i have visited many over the last 40 years. shipwrecks are artificial reefs where multitudes of fish life thrive. here i wanted to feature one of the largest, the goliath grouper hovering over the pirate shipwreck. two weeks ago i actually photographed a giant goliath grouper on the edge of a shipwreck in the florida keys. art truly imitates life.
