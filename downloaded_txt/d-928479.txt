birthplace of the miniature silky fainting goatwelcome to sol-orr farm nestled in the beautiful piedmont of virginia, where the concept of the miniature silky fainting goat became reality. in 1998 we began breeding and developing mini silkies for our own enjoyment. later, with the encouragement of friends and farm visitors, we introduced the mini silky to the world in early 2005. we were amazed at the immediate and overwhelming response to this little goat. we opened the miniature silky fainting goat association and registry in april of 2005 and, as they say, the rest is history. for more information on the registry and association go to msfgaregistry.com.
sol-orr farm participates in all the nearby mini silky shows or at least all we  can get to every year. the shows are held all over the country and is a great place to share not only the beautiful animals but also information and new ideas concerning the breed. it’s a day of sharing beautiful mini silkies, catching up with old friends and an opportunity to see goats and kids for sale from some of the top breeders in the nation. we would all love to have you join us. for more information on the shows in your area check out the upcoming show page on the msfga registry website. thank you for visiting my website, i hope you enjoy looking at it.

above is echo. she was my constant companion and best friend. she loved being on the farm and going to goat shows. she had so many friends to see and catch up with there. she was loved by goat exhibitors as much as she loved them. she never met a stranger and was always ready to greet farm visitors. she passed away april 7, 2023 and left a huge hole in my life.

three years ago echo and i welcomed a new friend into our lives. her name is sunshine. she is shown here at the goat show in mi this summer waiting patiently for me to come sit with her. she is a good dog and is learning to be more social as she matures. she will never take echo’s place but will make her own place in time and i’m so glad that i have her as she has been a blessing and kept the farm from seeming so empty. she’s very active and enjoys being on the farm too. she likes going to the goat shows but is not as eager to socialize with everyone as echo was. still i love having her with me and she loves me and loves to ride and go places. maybe we will see you at a goat show soon, i sure hope so.

in loving memory of stephen k orr
october 5, 1950 – august 24, 2009
when tomorrow starts without me, don’t think we’re far apart,
for every time you think of me, i’m right here in your heart.

on august 24, 2009 stephen k orr, co-founder and co-owner of sol-orr farm and the miniature silky fainting goat association and registry, passed away after a two year battle with cancer. steve was a software engineer by trade, working for contractors of the defense department for most of his career, he played a big part in getting the msfga off the ground and into operation. he developed the data base that is used to keep all records and statistics of the msfga today. steve loved animals, he loved to exhibit them and he especially enjoyed the babies. his memory will always be treasured in the hearts of those who knew and loved him.
