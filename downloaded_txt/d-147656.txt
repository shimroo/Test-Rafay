because kids can't fight cancer alone...


annika was diagnosed with neuroblastoma at just 10 weeks of age and has been fighting cancer for more than 6 years. childhood cancer can make children and families feel like they are all alone, especially when low immunity means isolation to stay safe from life-threatening germs and viruses. learn more about annika and how the acco + amazon is making a difference to ensure no child fights cancer alone.

help support kids like annika by raising awareness through signature programs like pjammin. pajamas are the battle uniform for children with cancer. too often it is a lonely battle fought isolated in hospital rooms or confined to staying at home for months – even years at a time. help us let them know they are not alone.

childhood cancer is the #1 disease-related cause of death for children in the united states and many other countries. for those who survive, two-thirds will also endure chronic health conditions from the toxic side effects of cancer treatment, including secondary cancers and other life-threatening illnesses.
