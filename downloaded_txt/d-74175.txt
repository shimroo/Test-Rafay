visualcalc’s mission is to help organizations develop web-based applications that enable their constituencies to make quicker, better-informed decisions.














featured demo
retirement planning calculator
  


the retirement planning calculator shows if a given retirement strategy - including earnings, retirement age, and retirement plan contributions - meets your annual income requirements following your retirement.






why we are



today’s consumers face complex financial decisions at each stage of their life. examples include planning for retirement, buying a home, and saving for their children’s education. the expanding number of financial instruments available today adds to this complexity. it is challenging for consumers to sort through these choices and make the best decision for their specific needs.in response to this, consumers are looking for web-based self-service tools that help them with these financial decisions. every consumer is different, however, so these tools need to align with the unique ways in which they learn and process information.

“these calculator demos have been created with our specific website look and feel as a guide. these are just examples of how we can customize calculators and tools for your specific needs. contact us to discuss how we can create a customized solution specifically for you.” 



























what we do



“visualcalc provides web-based interactive calculators and supporting tools that help consumers make better, more informed  personal finance decisions.”



these calculators and tools are built on a common foundation of visual engagement. financial services organizations can combine these calculators and tools to align with the different learning styles of consumers. for example, visualcalc’s explainer videos may be an ideal entry-point for consumers with more passive learning styles, eventually leading them to our interactive calculators, while direct access to visualcalc’s calculators may be the preferred choice for more active learners.financial services organizations that provide visualcalc calculators and tools to their prospects and clients will improve customer acquisition, retention, and satisfaction. these tools can be customized, branded, and deployed on a company’s digital properties, including websites and applications.
