about leitner-wise







new thinking, timeless designs






we are known for “out-of-the-box” thinking and rightly so, but that’s not how we approach the development and design of a new product.
the key is to identify the problem, and with this done the solution presents itself. just copying what has gone before without fully understanding its limitiations and development is not enough. the greatest compliment we get for our
                      design solutions is when people say “why didn’t i think of that?”
there’s a reason why our customers appreciate our products and manufacturers seek our help and expertise. we do it right, it works as intended, and the designs are timeless.
at leitner-wise we weren’t born to follow.
