                              fisk is family to me. this university is a safe haven for me to truly express my creativity and grow as a student and servant leader in my local community.                             



we are fisk.


the first time i visited fisk university was during scholar's weekend. i saw that fisk shared the same family atmosphere as my own family. i knew fisk was the perfect fit for me, even during the horrible tornado that hit north nashville in march of 2020, i was on campus and was able to see how all the incredible fiskites band together to help out the community. fisk not only gives you an extraordinary education but lessons that follow you past your years on campus.

                               coming here, i realized why i needed to be here even more. i have built a family and a home away from home with both fellow international and domestic students.                            



we are fisk.


one of the factors that influenced my decision to attend fisk was the small class size because i was very particular about receiving one-on-one attention from professors (i prefer one on one tutoring). fisk was my first choice because of the small class ratio of about 12:1, which was the lowest of the other schools i applied to. aside from the small class size, fisk also provided me with a full tuition scholarship. there are numerous activities in place to ensure that each student has a positive school experience and thrives here.

                              fisk has created an environment that feels like home—a place where i am not just a student, but an integral part of a loving and nurturing fisk family.                             



we are fisk.


upon completing my matriculation through my biology program, i plan on attending medical school and ultimately becoming a medical anesthesiologist. this ardent ambition is deeply rooted in my desire to serve as a beacon of inspiration within my community, a testament to the unwavering power of hard work and determination. with each step i take, i yearn to demonstrate to others that every goal, no matter how lofty, can be achieved through sheer dedication and perseverance. 


brandon mims2025














                              i chose fisk because of its close-knit and vibrant and vibrant community that fosters a sense of belonging. fisk is my home away from home!                            



we are fisk.


fisk's stellar academic reputation, especially in arts and sciences, and the inspiring legacy of social justice champions like john lewis and justin jones, irresistibly drew me in. the university's dedicated office of career planning and development resonated with my aspirations. i'm thrilled to embark on the dual-degree nursing program at the galen school of nursing, working toward my dream of becoming a registered nurse. with fisk's legacy as my foundation, i'm committed to a future as a certified registered nurse anesthetist (crna).


faheedah yusuf2027














                              my decision to attend fisk university was influenced by three pivotal factors: the warm spirit exhibited by the admissions office, the students, and the university’s distinguished history.                            



we are fisk.


my time at fisk university has laid a solid foundation of knowledge and skills; thus, i look forward with great anticipation to the next chapter of my academic and professional journey. upon the completion of my political science degree at fisk university, my immediate goal is to further my academic journey by enrolling in law school. this step is pivotal in achieving my aspiration to become a civil rights attorney. fisk stood out immediately, as it was the first institution to extend me an acceptance, merely four days after i submitted my application. this swift acknowledgment marked a significant personal milestone, symbolizing the initial steps towards independence and the advancement of my career objectives, undertaken entirely on my own volition.


julia watson2025














                              fisk university captured my heart as the perfect academic home, where the rich diversity, an inclusive community, and a strong sense of family resonated deeply. beyond academics, choosing fisk granted me entrance into a vibrant community that feels like family.                            



we are fisk.


as i navigate my career, i envision pursuing graduate studies to specialize in an area that captivates me within the tech landscape. i am eager to give back by assisting future fiskites in their professional journeys, leveraging my experiences to guide them. serving on the other side of the table, as a mentor, holds great significance to me.
