our vocational gap year provides young adult men, age 18-24, intensive instruction, training, and real-world experience in skilled trades.
as you master carpentry, welding, or auto mechanics, you also experience what it means to put in a full day’s work and experience the satisfaction that comes with it. you learn how to work effectively for and with people. you learn what happens when corners are cut, when quality is sacrificed when mistakes are covered up. in short, you learn what it takes to have pride in your work.
our program is dynamic and immersive. your course of study is individually tailored to your interests and can shift as those interests shift. because our enrollment is limited, our instructors can give each student the time and attention they need.
our campus rests on a 4000-acre ranch in the mountains of idaho. here you not only receive formal instruction in trades such as carpentry, welding, and auto mechanics, you also have the opportunity to apply those skills on the ranch. there is no better “on-the-job-training”.





after decades of pushing bachelor’s degrees, the u.s. needs more tradespeople.
