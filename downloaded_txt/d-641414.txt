 discover olympic national park

rialto beach, one of the most readily accessible of the olympic national park beaches, is just 3 miles away. from our door, it’s about 40 miles to the hoh rainforest, 45 miles to sol duc hot springs, and 60 miles to either lake ozette, neah bay, cape flattery, and shi shi beach, making us an ideal central location for exploring the washington coast. explore the rain forests, beaches, mountains, and the off-the-beaten-track charm of the nearly uninhabited, still wild washington coast, then return to your haven in the woods at manitou lodge.
