collapse





yet another farm outbuilding has collapsed.

it simply blew over when a sharp wind came in from the west.



the above photo is the far end of the building. here's the full scene of destruction.



and another, one time useful building has met it's end.

twilight on the prairie







one of the shoppers steps outside at nada farm's barn sale to enjoy twilight on the prairie.

montana claims to be the big sky country but the sky is equally big here in illinois. the corn has just been harvested from those fields.
