phenomenal company. our shutters are absolutely beautiful. chad gave us a tour of facility showing us how the shutters were made he then came to our home to measure and gave us a very fair price. we were told up to five weeks to be installed but we ended up having them done in 3 weeks. the installers were very attentive and polite. myself and my wife are not the easiest customers but island shutters was very patient, professional and kind throughout the entire process. chad and joelle are running a very fine business. we are extremely happy we chose island shutters.- vincent j.

i recently purchased window shutters from island shutter company and couldn't be happier with my experience. from start to finish, the process was seamless and professional. the team at island shutters was extremely knowledgeable and helped me select the perfect plantation shutters for our home. and, wowâ€¦they are gorgeous! the addition has upgraded the overall decor exponentially. the craftsmanship is impeccable. i find myself just staring at them sometimes. Â especially in awe that they are built right at island shutterâ€™s manufacturing warehouse in deland, fl. i never dreamed iâ€™d be able to get real wood shutters at such an affordable price. in fact, when chad personally came to discuss options and measure (heâ€™s the owner along with his wife, joelle) he explained why wood would be the preferred application due to the size (weight) of the shutters. and it wasnâ€™t for an upsell. the cost in our case was relatively equal whether we chose wood or pvc. (the company offers both)we were given an 8-week lead-time for manufacturing, though they were completed sooner than that. they even worked with us on installation due to a delay in one of our windows being replaced. installation was quick, efficient, and seamless. the installers were friendly and knowledgeable, and they took the time to make sure the shutters were installed correctly and functioning properly.what i love about this company is they are one of the few these days that â€˜say what they mean and mean what they sayâ€™. i believe theyâ€™re about to celebrate their 30th year in business. theyâ€™ve built shutters for resorts from here (fl) to hawaii, countless businesses, and homes much larger than mine, yet my small job was given the same level of care and importance as if i were their first customer. i highly recommend island shutter company for their exceptional customer service, quality products, and professional installation. they truly exceeded my expectations and i couldn't be more pleased with the outcome.- fawn k.
