march 29, 2024 - port of baltimore atlantic, chesapeake and dundalk terminals closure
            due to the recent francis scott key collapse in the port of baltimore, âkâ line will temporarily suspend service to the above mentioned terminals in baltimore.
            we have arranged a temporary solution for discharging loaded vessels at another terminal within the baltimore region and this facility will be reflected on future arrival notices.
            voyages for baltimore deliveries will be terminated at this terminal.
            until further notice we will be forced to suspend export services from baltimore until the terminals reopen or a suitable solution can be arranged.
            thank you for your support and understanding during this difficult and tragic situation.
            all other ports remain open and operational at this time
             
            november 30, 2023 â     effective january 1, 2024, k line will implement a european union emissions trading system for cargo moving to/from eu ports. this will be updated on quarterly basis based on eu indices.
             
            november 30, 2023 â     effective january 15, 2024, k line will begin issuing revised bills of lading reflecting updated terms and conditions. link to blâs here:
