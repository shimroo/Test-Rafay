    unlocking women’s collective power﻿





   we speak not for ourselves but we are the voice for thousands of woman… for their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated.women’snet is a south african based non-governmental organisation that strengthens the women and girls movements for social change. through the strategic use of information communication tools, we promote access and the right to information and freedom of expression. we believe that deep sustainable change for women’s rights requires women’s collective action.



    our organization
 
women’snet is a feminist organisation that works to advance gender equality and justice in south africa, through the use of information and communication technologies (icts). we provide training and facilitate content dissemination and creation that supports women, girls, and women’s and gender organisations and networks to take control of their own content and ict use.our website serves as a hub of information by women, about women and gender, and has a focus on south african and african content. we help women to find the people, issues, resources and tools they need for social activism.
  equality of women
 
 engage, educate and empower

investing in women is often found to be the most effective means to reduce poverty in developing countries. in fact, world bank data demonstrates that gender equality and economic development are inextricably linked.the data shows that equality not only guarantees basic rights but also plays a vital role in promoting the robust, shared growth needed to end extreme poverty.
