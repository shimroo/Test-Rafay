a bit of chunk-a-lunk to start your working week





i know i'm being a bit mean...but seriously. these people can afford to work full-time on themselves! i just don't understand. they even have enough money to go on a permanent coke-diet :) no excuses!  :)

well, something is working for kim kardashian





she's claiming it's the quick trim pills. in anycase, she's looking relatively buff and lost a lot of her infamous chunk...but tbh, i kinda liked the chunk. she worked it better than anyone i knew.before

it seemed like a good idea at the time





they say white eyeliner gives one that doe-eyed cute innocent look...but ummm...they lied. a d-lister reading about b-listers. beautiful.

tiger...ummm...couldn't you at least get someone decent?





so the guy has a beautiful wife elin and screws around with ms jaimee grubbs, 24, going on meth-45? vom. what is wrong with men?in his latest statement, he said: "i have let my family down and i regret those transgressions with all of my heart...i have not been true to my values and the behaviour my family deserves...i am not without faults and i am far short of perfect."they're also saying she [elin] bashed him up with golf clubs up prior to the crash, which is why he received his various cuts and bruises...and while i don't condone violence, i have to say she has a wonderful  nice sense of irony.honestly, grubbs really is disgusting. i feel like i've caught rather hideous -- just looking at her.

new sex and city movie like "condensed soup"e





errrmm. condensed soup is vom. kristen davis said in an interview"she told mtv: "this one is not going to be that long. it's like condensed soup. it's different, and adventurous and rich, and there's music involved." hmmm...does that mean it will be worse than the first movie? i honestly didn't believe that was possible.bah.

about me





elisita


i'm a girl. i'm 25. i'm a law student. i work. i'm an excellent vegetarian, and a failed vegan. i'm a staunch atheist who happens to believe morrissey could very well be god. i get depressed when people believe in the supernatural - and oddly- find celebrities brain-numbing...though i love models. i don't watch television and stay away from modern fiction. i think richard dawkins is hot. i spend my nights trying to secure a fine and prosperous future by posting on my inane, ridiculous, and mildly irrelevant blog.

love, elisita

p.s...leave a comment! i love comments...and literally read each and every one.
