 read review of
the ark of god 
              by paul crossley in the  burlington  magazine
“ this epic enterprise is   modestly described by its author as ‘an illustrated thesaurus’. in reality these   five massive volumes are opening salvoes in what will be the most comprehensive   history ever written of early and high gothic churches in the limestone regions   of northern france known as the paris basin.”

read exceprt from 
the master masons of chartres - john james
“ "when you examine the cathedral closely, you discover to your immense surprise that the design is not a well controlled and harmonious entity, but a mess. we tend to think of a great work of art like chartres as having been thought through to the end before it was begun. but chartres is not like this, not at all. our vision has been conditioned by the homogenizing eye of the camera, but when we look carefully we see that there are few things at one end of the building that match those at the other.”
