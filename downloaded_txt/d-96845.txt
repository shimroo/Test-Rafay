extremely quick and efficient response to order. very impressive service.ekomi review
the service was superb and price was excellent. indeed i received the 'full pack' rather than the cheaper blister version at the same price. happy to recommend.ekomi review

huge savings on printer toner cartridges
information about our original oem laser toner printer cartridges our best selling lasers are still the genuine oem laser toners. they are made by the manufacturer of the laser printer to produce a high print quality, optimum performance and reliability. all original toner cartridges deliver superior prints with vibrant colours. we have the cheapest original toner cartridges and are the most competitive on xerox, lexmark, samsung, brother, canon and hp toner cartridges.
information about our recycled toner cartridge or remanufactured laser toner we also provide a huge range of recycled toner cartridges (remanufactured cartridges), with savings on the cost of the original printer cartridges. all our recycled toner cartridges are stripped down and cleaned in house at our recycling centre. components are replaced with new ones and then the cartridge is refilled with new toner, so it’s not just a refill. all our recycled toners work just like the original oem cartridges and produce the same or more print yield. using our remanufactured toner will save you huge amounts of money and also help save the planet.
