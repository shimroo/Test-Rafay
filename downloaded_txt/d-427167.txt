julian gonzales - 7th grade
we love ascs because of the family and god-centered atmosphere. julian fell in love with ascs from the very start. in 2017 julian was blessed with the opportunity to shadow the school for the day, prior to enrollment. when i picked up my then second grader he had the biggest smile on his face. he said, “mom, i made friends and everyone treated me kindly!” from that day until today we are proud to be a part of the atlantic shores family. the entire faculty and staff have encompassed one of our go-to scriptures which is proverbs 22:6 “train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it.” as mom and dad, we have been blessed to be able to be a part of his education and share many cherished memories. ~tina, julian's mom
