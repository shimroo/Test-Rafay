discover what makes our homes different








every company has a story. ours is happiness.
while we've earned a reputation for building distinctive homes, much of our company's success is attributed to our unique business purpose: to maximize happiness rather than profit! we're truly focused on our own happiness and the happiness of our customers.

					our mission: bring happiness to ourselves and our homeowners by not only creating exceptional homes and communities but also by providing an extraordinary home buying experience.
				

					happiness is more than a state of mind; it's how we do business. the foundation of schell brothers is our culture of happiness. by sharing happy stories at company meetings - often held on the beach - and participating in bbqs, beach days, turkey bowls, and the laugh-out-loud schellies show, we understand the importance of exercising our imaginations and having fun.
				

check out our culture of happiness








the schellter advantage

					we pride ourselves on building homes that provide a healthier and more comfortable living environment. we are the only builder that includes schellter™ advanced building science in every home, providing an extremely energy-efficient home with unparalleled durability, longevity, strength, and quality.
				
blowing away the standard for energy efficiency.

					schell brothers homes use less than half the energy of a similar-sized home. from our 6" exterior walls with r-23 blown-in insulation to our tankless rinnai water heaters, a schell brothers home includes numerous energy-saving "green" features. these features not only significantly reduce your utility bills, but they also increase the resale value of your home.
