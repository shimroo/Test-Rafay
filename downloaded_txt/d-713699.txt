an american
              backlash!

        november 8, 2016

    for many years i have been hoping and
      dreaming
      of a true american backlash (http://www.americanbacklash.com/)
      against
      the liberal-left miasma into which the u.s. has been sinking.
      enough is
      enough! november 8 was at least a partial realization of that hope
      and
      i am extremely happy about it. it was certainly a repudiation of
      hillary
      clinton, obamacare, the past eight years of liberal-left policies,
      the
      mess that obama and clinton made in the middle east and in foreign
      policy
      generally, and the bigotry of the pro-democrat news media -- as
      well as
      the legacy of scandal and criminal activity of the clintons.
          my concern now is: how lasting is this
        revolution?
        can it be reversed? how stable are the victories in ohio,
        pennsylvania,
        north carolina, and florida? will further immigration/invasion
        by new yorkers
        into north carolina and florida threaten to turn those states to
        "blue"
        forever? what about the political education of the millennials?
      
    how durable is this american backlash?
      
    and, of course, the exact nature of the
        alternative
        response to the past several decades of the liberal
        establishment ruling
        class will depend on president trump and what his administration
        does.
        i would be much more comfortable and hopeful if this were a
        president ted
        cruz, whose ideological inclinations are known and much closer
        to mine.
        what can we expect from president trump? will president trump be
        able to
        keep his campaign promises? will the border be secured? will the
        in-place
        machinery of statism be dismantled, at least in part? with a
        republican
        majority in the house and a very slim majority in the senate,
        this new
        president has more opportunity than any in a long time to
        actually get
        his reforms passed. will the republicans be able to keep those
        majorities
        in future elections? will the new president wimp out and
        negotiate away
        the victory and mandate of november 8?
      
    given the anti-trump/anti-reform negativity
        of the
        media, academia, and the democrat party leadership, which will
        seek every
        opportunity to sabotage trump's reforms, a lot of positive,
        encouraging
        pressures from the grass-roots public will be needed to keep the
        new administration
        on track and to counteract the beltway propaganda.
      
    the propaganda war will become more intense
        than
        ever before. ain't no hate like liberal-left hate. it is pure
        emotion undiluted
        by logic or reason. the media will give communists like van
        jones and professionally
        engineered demonstrations free coverage while putting pro-trump
        news on
        back pages or ignored completely. new conservative,
        constitutionalist tv
        and internet networks must be developed to answer the lies and
        half truths
        of the establishment media.
      
    we do not know the future, but our chances
        of achieving
        less statism are far better with a president trump than a
        president clinton.
        the hope is great.



post-election
              analysis

    analysis
        of
        the 2016 voting in terms of demographics shows that trump
        generally improved
        on romney's showing from 2012. before november 8, the media told
        us that
        women would generally hate trump and not vote his way, and this
        seemed
        logical because of his remarks on an open microphone from eleven
        years
        ago (when he was still a democrat). it turns out that he still
        got at least
        42 percent of women. we were also told that latinos would not
        vote for
        him, but he did better than romney with latinos in 2012. we were
        told that
        if he did get elected that the stock market would crash. not
        only has this
        not happened, but just the reverse -- it jumped up. the
        expectations and
        lies of the liberal establishment media did not pan out and many
        democrats
        toeay arte still in cognitive dissonance because of the jarring
        contrast
        between their ideological template and the real world. too many
        on the
        left believe their own propaganda. the media has so demonized
        trump during
        the general election campaign that some naive college students
        think he
        has horns and a forked tail. as usual, since they do not have
        substantive
        arguments on policy, the democrats resort to claims of "racism"
        and bigotry
        or smear tactics. the depth of denial among out-of-touch
        democrats about
        their stunning defeat is breathtaking.
    what about
          obama's "job
          approval rating"?  what does it really mean?  the
          election results
          seem to contradict it.  obamacare (the so-called
          affordable care act)
          and obama regime policies in general were clearly repudiated
          on november
          8.  the job approval rating is the result of polling, the
          same type
          of polling that proved so wrong about the presiential
          election.  the
          concern about being considered "racist" may have caused poll
          respondents
          to mislead the poll takers by giving a more positive
          response.  when
          specific individual policies afre asked about, the results
          were very different.

    the smackdown
          of the
          liberal establishment on november 8 has revealed many
          assumptions to be
          a phony "potemkin village" of false ideological expectatons.
          outside of
          their echo-chamber bubbles in areas like san francisco, new
          york, massachusetts,
          and oregon, the u.s. of a. is pretty solidly against obamaism,
          liberalism,
          leftism, and anti-americanism in general. the liberal-left
          matrix has been
          exposed to all as a web of lies and fallacies which are
          increasingly rejected
          by the american people. probably if the gop had run a decent
          positively
          conservative candidate in 2008, obama would never have been
          president.



        *   *   *
      
individual
              freedom vs
              bureaucratic socialism

    leftists
        in
        general want to impose their own whims as a central plan on
        everyone else
        by the force of big government . this is the essence of
        socialism. they
        think that government bureaucrats somehow know so much better
        how to run
        our lives and so they  should run everybody's lives and
        spend everybody's
        earnings for them.  it is called tyranny. by contrast,
        constitutionalists
        and conservatives want the government for the most part to get
        out of the
        way of peaceful people and allow them to pursue their own plans,
        spend
        their own earnings, and run their own lives as long as they
        don't use violence
        or fraud. this is the clear distinction politically that must be
        made to
        the american people and between which they must ultimately
        choose.
the cause
            and cure
            of monopolistic

 conspiracies

by sam wells
    special-interest
groups
        and power elites are inevitable as long as the

    political state
        can
        use its power to tke from peaceful citizens and give to

    others for any
        reason.
        as long as people continue to sanction

   
        interventionism/socialism
        as a legitimate means to obtain any goal for

    any reason (noble
        or
        evil), there always will be vested-interest groups

    and lobbies
        clustering
        around congress and the regulatory agencies

    competing for
        favors
        from the public trough at the expense of everybody

    else. only when
        the
        machinery of interventionism and socialism (the

    ultimate in
        political
        interventionism) has been dismantled, and the false

    ideas, myths,
        fallacies,
        and lies behind interventionism/socialism are

    discredited and
        abandoned,
        can the final cure for all monopolistic

    conspiracies be
        realized.

    the ultimate
        solution
        is not more controls and regulations from

    government, but to
        impose on government a policy of "hands off" the

    private property,
        money,
        and all voluntary activities of production and

    exchange among
        peaceful
        citizens. controls and regulations belong on

    government, not on
        peaceful citizens. with the government thus

    constitutionally
        limited
        to dealing with violence and the threat of violence

    (broadly, crime
        and
        external threats), while leaving peaceful adult

    citizens alone as
        much
        as possible, america could be assured a bright

    future of freedom
        and
        progress through market capitalism.

    how to "bell the
        cat"
        of government to its legit functions? the u.s.

    founders were on
        the
        right track. constitutional limits on the scope of

    government, backed
        up by a strong desire by a sufficient number of

    people to keep
        government
        in its proper place -- that's the ultimate

    solution in the
        long
        run. the price of liberty is eternal vigilance on the

    part of enough
        people
        and their leaders to keep government in its

    proper place. not
        to
        blindly trust government officials but to bind them

    down from mischief
        and tyranny with the chains of the constitution.

       
      
       
      



trade deals
              versus freedom
              of trade

    during some of
        the debates
        mr. trump, sen. rubio, and others used

    such terms as
        "trade
        deficit" or "trade surplus" as if those terms meant

    something relevant
        to the economy.  there is no such thing as a "trade

    deficit" or "trade
        surplus" outside of highly artificial and arbitrary

    assumptions. 
        the terms deficit and surplus are legitimate accounting

    terms which refer
        to
        budgets and reflect the balance one way or

    another. 
        they
        do not refer to exchange, either national or personal.

    one does not incur
        a "deficit" when goes to a grocery store and buys a

    loaf of
        bread. 
        yes, the bread can be said to be "imported" to the buyer,

    but aftrer all the
        supermarket imported the dollar as the price for it.  the

    exchange
        automatically
        "balances"; otherwise it would not take place.

    the terms "trade
        deficit"
        and "trade surplus" are just warmed-over

    mercantilist
        fallacies
        refuted in the 18th century by adam smith and

    others and by
        frederic
        bastiat in the 19th century.  yet, the fallacies still

    hang on even into
        the
        21st century.

    if foreign
        governments
        want to subsidize the american economy by

    giving u.s.
        consumers
        lower prices, i say let them do so.  it is true this

    is at the forced
        expense
        of the foreign governments' taxpayers and thus

    harms their own
        economy
        by reducing effective demand and/or

    aggregate savings,
        but it is the u.s. economy i am most concerned

    about after all,
        and
        i have no power at all over foreign governments'

    taxation policies.
        some call such practices "cheating" and object to

    them because they
        are
        seen as threats to those u.s.-based businesses

    which produce
        similar
        products, but no matter how deserving these are

    of sympathy they
        are
        only small special interests and do not represent

    the economy as a
        whole. 
        policies should be judged on how they affect

    the whole u.s.
        economy,
        not just a part of it.   of course i realize that in

    washington, d.c.
        just
        because a legislative package is labeled "free

    trade" does not
        necessarily
        mean it has anything to do with true

    freedom of trade,
        especially
        if its contents are kept secret. i don't trust

    politicians in
        general
        and especially don't trust obama and the

    obamacrats to
        negotiate
        political trade deals for special-interest

   
        corporations. 
        unless there is some real national security issue involved,

    governments should
        not block or impede trade -- nor should the

    government
        artificially
        stimulate u.s. exports with subsidies from the

    taxpayers. such
        federal
        government entities as the export-import bank

    and the commodity
        credit
        corporation should be abolished.

       
      
       
      


why the opec
              oligopoly
              is dead

sam wells

2015

    does
predatory
        price cutting work to lead to monopoly and monopoly

    profits in a
        market
        free of government intervention?  no.  here's why,

    and why i don't
        believe
        we will see $100 per barel oil again.

    in a free market
        of
        voluntary relations a person serves himself only by

    serving the wants
        of
        others.  he cannot receive what he wants from

    others unless he
        produces
        (or already has from inheritance or gift)

    something they
        want
        and are willing to exchange for.  under such

    circumstances, how
        would a businesman acquire an exploitative

    monopoly in the
        absence
        of government favoritism or interventikon??

    what if a large,
        rich
        company kept out its competitors by undercutting

    prices -- selling
        at
        a loss -- to such an extent that its competitors could

    no longer stay in
        business? 
        would it not then be a monopoly in its field,

    and then begin to
        charge
        high monopoly prices in order to recupe its

    loses?  could
        a company lower the price of its product below cost to

    drive out its
        competitors,
        and then later raise its price well above the old

    competitive market
        price to make up for its losses?

    by cutting the
        price
        orf its product below what it costs to produce it, that

    company is taking
        a
        loss, not making a profit, at least in the meantime.

    furthermore, the
        larger
        the share of the market that the company gains

    by this tactic,
        the
        deeper are its losses.  not only is it not making any

    profit, which is
        the
        whole purpose of getting a monopoly in the first

    place, it is
        sustaining
        losses.  not very exploitative so far. from the

    consumer's point
        of
        view, this is a bargain.  the consumer doesn't have

    to pay as much as
        he
        did before.  he has money left over.

    it is true the
        company
        may now be a "monopoly" since it has driven out

    its competitors
        (or
        more accurately, the consumers have driven out his

    competitors by
        buying
        from the price-cutting company and not the

    others), but so
        what? 
        it may be the only seller in  its market but

    consider what it
        had
        to do to get that way, namely sustain large losses.

    it may have the
        satisfaction
        of seeing its competitors driven out of

    business by its
        "predatory"
        price-cutting tactic, but it does not gain any

    monopoly profits
        as
        a result.  it is sustaining losses and in the process

    giving the
        customers
        an excellent sale on that product which they will

    take advantage of
        by
        possibly stocking up on that product at its cheap

    price.

    what about the
        firms
        that went our of business?  they can go into

    another field of
        production
        or temporarily shut down to re-open later

    when the monopoly
        company
        raises its prices to try to recupe its

    losses.  or
        they
        might buy up the cheap product of the dominant firm

    for their own
        inventories
        to sell later when the monopoly company has

    had its fill of
        losses
        and tries to raise its price above a competitive level.

    the mere
        possibility
        of companies re-entering that field of production to

    make money would
        often
        be enough to keep the price down below

    exploitative
        levels. 
        the freer the capital markets, the more likelihood of

    companies, either
        new
        or former producers, going back into competition

    with the monopoly
        company
        when it tries to raise its price too high.  as

    soon as it tried
        to
        raise its price above the market level -- which it would

    have to do if it
        wanted
        to recupe the losses it sustained from its

    below-cost pricing
        -- it would inevitably invite competition from many

    other firms who
        could
        product the same product at a lowr price and still

    make money. 
        the
        competition for market share would tend to bring the

    prevailing price
        down
        to market levels and thwart high monopoly pricing.

    also, the firms
        temporarily
        driven out by the price cutting could go to the

    dominant firm's
        customers
        -- who are presumably now facing the

    possibility of
        being
        overcharged later on -- and obtain a contract to

    supply their needs
        at a more competitive price, thus undercutting and

    thwarting any
        threat
        of monopoly pricing.  these companies have the

    advantage that
        they
        don't have the losses to recupe that the would-be

    monopoly firm has
        sustained.

    no firm can
        continue
        a policy of selling at a loss indefinitely.  its

    investors will
        pull
        out.  even if it is a very wealthy company, if it doesn't

    concern itself
        with
        recuping those losses it will be defeating its original

    prupose in getting
        a monopoly in the first place:  which is to get even

    richer.  on a
        free market a monopoly is an expensive rarity.  it is very

    difficult if not
        impossible
        to achieve and has a very short life if it exists at

    all.

    leftists and
        monopolists
        generally denounce "destructive competition"

    in the
        market. 
        destructive competition is just a label that a firm uses

    when another firm
        is
        selling the product at a lower price and thus giving

    the customers a
        better
        deal.  price "wars" are always to the benefit of

    the
        consumers. 
        price wars are not really wars at all.  a "price war" is

    just companies
        trying
        to outdo one another in offering products at lower

    prices or better
        quality. 
        no one is killed or wounded.   the companies

    are not competing
        to
        destroy.  they are competing to produce and offer

    a better deal to
        consumers. 
        there is no coercion or violence involved.

    people are free to
        accept an offer or not.

    but some
        anti-freedom
        mentalities complain that "cut-throat

    competition" (in
        which
        no ones throat is cut) can be excessive and they

    call for
        government
        intervention on behalf of a company through

    so-called "fair
        trade"
        laws or government-mandated price floors.  at the

    same time
        government
        uses the alleged lack of sufficient competition to

    justify anti-trust
        legislation.  if they don't get you for "too much"

    competiton (price
        too
        low) or "too little" competion (price too high or not

    low enough), they
        can
        get you for "collusion" if your prices are the same

    as the other
        firms.  
        you can't win.  once government is permitted to

    interfere in the
        voluntary
        relations of peaceful people. there is no end to

    the pernicious
        consequences
        that will result.

    newly applied
        methods
        of oil and gas extraction in the united states

    have now made the
        u.s.a.
        one of the main oil producing countries in

    the world. 
        oil's
        price has plummeted from over $100 a barel to less

    than $50. 
        the
        saudis have kept their production up at previous levels

    in the hope of
        driving
        the u.s. firms out of business by keeping prices

    too low for them
        to
        stay in business.  the saudis have little choice.  if

    they try to raise
        oil
        prices back to $100 a barel, the u.s. fracking firms

    will go back into
        production
        and keep supply up and undercut any

    attempt by the
        saudis
        to hike oil prices up high.  if the saudis reduce

    their output,
        other
        major oil-producing countries will supply the

    difference and the
        world price of oil will be kept low.  opec is impotent.

    unless government
        intervenes,
        i doubt we will see $100 per barel oil

    again, at least
        not
        for any length of time, as it would invite the u.s.

    companies back
        into
        production.  opec cannot keep competition out permanently.

hope and
              tragedy

by sam wells

march 2009 revisited

      
        in the past, the hope of the world has been based on two
        things:

    market capitalism
        and
        u.s. military strength. it was capitalism (to the

    extent it was
        allowed
        to exist) that rescued hundreds of millions of

    children from
        short
        miserable lives and death by starvation. it was

    capitalism that
        brought
        england and america out of pre-industrial

    squalor to
        advanced
        economic status with improvements in life for the

    majority of
        people.
        it was u.s. military strength that liberated the world

    from hitler's
        national
        socialism and tojo's imperialist japan, rescued

    millions from
        slave
        labor and death camps, helped south korea to

    remain free from
        communist
        invasion from the north, and it was u.s.

    strength
        (especially
        when reagan was president) that at least pushed

    back the advance
        of
        communist imperialism and helped to quicken the

    fall of the berlin
        wall and the independence of countries once under

    soviet control. it
        was u.s. military capability that dragged the brutal

    dictator saddam
        hussein
        off the backs of the people of iraq.  people

    around the world
        at
        least began to hope that more freedom and

    economic
        opportunities
        would be possible.

           
unfortunately,
        what is left of true market capitalism in america has

    been undercut by
        many
        decades of government regulations, controls,

    monetary
        manipulations,
        taxation, and various socialistic programs.

    america has been
        coasting
        on the momentum from its past more-free

    days when it was
        closer
        to being a pure capitalist economy. the heavy

    burden of
        socialism
        is catching up to us now. the new president,

    barack obama, is
        doing
        his best to destroy what is left of market

    capitalism in
        america
        and will likely destroy the u.s. dollar completely in

    the next few
        years.
        this will mean economic disaster for the people of

    the world as well
        as
        americans here at home.

           
meanwhile,
        president obama is reducing spending on military

    defense and is
        pursuing
        a foreign policy that kisses up to tyrants and in

    effect tells
        oppressed
        people to go to hell -- that he will do nothing to

    help them while he
        pals around with socialist thugs and bows to fascist

    dictators. if
        america's
        strength is allowed to wane significantly, this will

    certainly
        encourage
        a resurgence of both communist imperialism and

    jihadist terrorism
        around the world. i predict terrible times ahead for the

    people of the
        world
        as a result of these policies. and americans will be

    increasingly
        targeted
        by their envious enemies. i wish i could be more

    optimistic. the
        world
        will be a much less safe place now that the u.s.

    has a socialist
        cult
        leader as president.

           
despite
        all the socialistic programs and interventions that have

    been piled on top
        of
        the u.s. economy over the past several decades, it

    is surprising that
        it is still within the top ten most economically free

    countries. sadly,
        with
        the obamacrats now in full control of the

    economy, i predict
        that the united states will fall below the top ten most

    free countries in
        the
        next year or two.

           
i
        do not think it is a coincidence that at least 7 out of the top
        10

    most economically
        free
        nations were british colonies at one time or

    another: hong
        kong,
        singapore, australia, ireland, new zealand,

    united states,
        canada,
        denmark, switzerland, and the united kingdom

    itself. (see the
        current
        index of economic freedom). where there is

    capitalism there
        is
        hope and progress.

           
it
        is also no coincidence that the main troublemaker regimes in the

    world today are
        among
        those countries with the least amount of

    economic freedoms
        (see
        near bottom of list), including mainland china,

    russia, syria,
        iran,
        venezuela, cuba, and north korea.

           
it
        is a shame that instead of the u.s. and u.k. becoming more free

    and less
        socialistic,
        we seem to be following the failed policies of the

    loser countries
        now
        under full socialism. at least that is what the

    election of obama
        and
        the democrats portends here in the united

    states.

           
increasing
        the top marginal tax rates on income (the rich folks)

    does not really
        hurt
        the wealthy people, but makes less capital available

    for funding
        business
        starts and economic growth and results in fewer

    jobs and fewer
        economic
        opportunities for regular people like myself

    who are just
        struggling
        to pay bills. yet, the obamacrats continue to use

    the
        "soak-the-rich"
        mantra to fool their gullible followers. as an

    american, i
        apologize
        to the people of the world for the election of

    barack obama and
        for
        the current backward regime.  it's high time for a

    pro-capitalist,
        pro-american
        backlash but no one knows when that will

    come.


december 5,
              2013

keeping the ideal
            in mind

   as an
            achievable
            goal for the future

    markets
require
        the existence of government for them to operate, but

    let's not blur the
        distinction between proper government functions and

    improper
        government
        activities as there is a clear line of demarcation.

    markets presuppose
        private ownership and well-defined and

   
        government-protected
        private property boundaries, not just in land but

    in all ownable
        things. 
        to own something is to have exclusive right of

    control over
        it. 
        a proper function of government is to protect peoples'

    property rights
        from
        violation.  there are laws against theft, murder (theft

    of life),
        trespass,
        burglary, shoplifting, embezzlement, etc. which make it

    a crime to use
        violence
        or fraud to violate the exclusive right of control

    over person and
        property.

    it is a very
        different
        (and indeed opposite) thing for government to

    contradict that
        proper
        function of protecting private property rights by

    itself violating
        them
        which it does when it seeks to redistribute wealth

    or "organize"
        society
        or meddle in the private affairs or market (i.e.,

    voluntary)
        relationships
        of peaceful citizens.

    the laissez-faire
        republic
        would limit the scope of government to its

    legitimate
        functions
        while socialism (the opposite of laissez faire) seeks

    to
        institutionalize
        the annihilation of private property always and

    everywhere. 
        in
        real-world practice socialism amounts to a monopoly

    clique acting
        through
        positive government intervention to control all

    major industries
        and
        resources.  as gary allen said, socialism is the

    royal road to
        monopoly
        power for the super wealthy.

            constitutional
              republic versus whimarchy

   
            the principle
            of individual rights versus arbitrary whim

    left-wing
activists
        are now in control of the government and these

    arrogant control
        freaks
        pretend that they know so much better than

    everyone else how
        to
        run our lives for us and spend our earnings for us.

    but if we are not
        smart
        enough or competent enough to run our own

    lives and spend
        our
        own earnings, how can we be smart enough or

    competent enough
        to
        choose the politicians and bureaucrats who will do

    all those things
        for
        us? and why would somebody else's vote to do so

    bind the rest of
        us
        who do not choose to delegate those freedoms?

    the statists
        hastily
        pushed through their so-called affordable health

    care act without
        even
        reading it. have they thought their scheme

    through very well?
        apparently not, judging from the on-going failures of

    implementation.
        not
        being content to try to persuade us to part with our

    liberties, obama
        and
        his gang are simply imposing their momentary

    whims on the rest
        of
        us through the full force of political government.

    government by
        whim is
        tyranny. our founders knew this. that is why

    they opposed
        whimarchy
        by binding government officials down with the

    chains of the
        constitution,
        which sets forth the basic rules and

    limitations on the
        scope of the federal government.

     government
        is
        not instituted to do anything anybody's whim happens

    to dictate. the
        legitimate
        functions of government are limited to the

    proper uses of
        violence
        force -- national military defense against foreign

    threats, law
        courts
        for the ultimate settlement of disputes, and the police

    power to defend
        against
        and justly retaliate against crime. the role of

    government does
        not
        extend to those activities and areas of human life

    which by their
        nature
        do not and should not involve the use of violent

    force. it is not
        the
        proper function of government to provide health

    insurance, medical
        care, dentistry, public education, electric power,

    retirement income,
        school lunches, housing, community development,

    day care, etc.

     ignoring
        the limits
        placed on the scope of government spelled out in

    the constitution
        has
        brought america to its current sorry state under the

    present corrupt
        regime.
        the ninth and tenth amendments -- which

    forbid fedgov from
        getting involved in areas not specified in the body of

    the constitution
        itself
        -- are routinely ignored as if they had been

    repealed. and the
        more
        the political schemes fail, the more the

    schemers scheme up
        more schemes to impose.

     the
        constitution
        is just words after all. the ultimate price of liberty is

    eternal vigilance
        on
        the part of enough people to keep government in its

    proper place. i
        for
        one would like to believe we still have enough people

    who understand
        that
        the scope of government must be limited to

    prevent tyranny
        and
        to preserve liberty. isn't it time for a new american

    revolution to take
        back our country?

false
              conspiracy theories

 for
              popular and
              individual manipulation

 the climate
            of left-wing
            hate speech is hotter than ever.

      
        there are political conspiracies of course, but for every
        genuine instance
        of

      
        conspiracy
        there are scores if not hundreds or false conspiracy conjectures

      
        which
        circulate among the populace and are accepted by some people as

      
        absolute
        fact.  unraveling all the phony plots and setting history
        straight

      
        would
        be a full-time job and would take years of research and
        publication

      
        of
        books and articles by an organization of professional historians
        who did

      
        not
        have an ideological ax to grind.

      
        just
        taking the murder of jfk in 1963 as one historic example, there
        are

      
        several
        conspiracy theories which purport to explain what "really"

      
        happened. 
        there is the one that claims that president kennedy was going

      
        to
        tell the public about what our government knows about
        extraterrestrial

      
        aliens,
        and that he had to be killed to prevent that horrible scenario
        to avoid

      
        public
        panic, according to that claim.  there is no real substance
        to that

      
        theory. 
        there is also the claim that jfk wanted to stop the war in
        vietnam

      
        and
        withdraw some or all troops and bring them home, and that he
        wrote a

      
        memo
        indicating that.  but in the real world no such memo ever
        existed

      
        outside
        of the olive stone propaganda movie jfk.  there was never
        any

      
        real
        indication that president kennedy was just about to end the war
        in

      
        support
        of south vietnam against the invading communists, despite what

      
        many
        now believe as a result of stone's fictional movie.  then
        there is
        the

      
        conspiracy
        theory which claims that jfk wanted to stop borrowing from the

      
        federal
        reserve system and instead have the u.s. treasury print its own

      
        paper
        currency.  again, there is no real evidence that jfk wanted
        to do

      
        anything
        like that on any large enough scale -- or that "the powers that
        be"

      
        would
        have him taken out for doing so.  but those who believe in
        one of
        the

      
        above
        conspiratorial tales are not likely to change their minds by the
        lack of

      
        evidence.

      
        i
        would further point out that the same claim has long been made
        about

      
        abraham
        lincoln's assassination -- the notion that president lincoln was

      
        killed
        at the behest of powerful banking interests because lincoln had

      
        signed
        the greenback legislation instead of borrowing from the bankers
        to

      
        pay
        for the war against the confederacy.  not only is there no
        evidence
        at

      
        all
        for this belief, but the greenback legislation itself was
        largely written
        by

      
        a
        banker from albany (then a major banking center) and one could
        much

      
        more
        easily argue that bankers had more of a vested interest in the

      
        greenbacks
        as they would serve as additional reserves against which the

      
        banks
        could inflate in their fractional-reserve demand deposit system.

      
        they
        could make much more money that way than they had done under

      
        the
        partial gold standard which had limited the extent of their
        inflation.

      
        lincoln
        was not "money martyred" at all.  he was assassinated by a
        fervent

      
        supporter
        of state sovereignty and secession, someone who perceived

      
        lincoln
        as a traitor to american freedom and true federalism.

      
        left-wing
        ideologues and professional prevaricators from mark lane and

      
        fletcher
        prouty to oliver stone and michael moore have always put out

      
        whatever
        spin they consider helpful in distracting people from the truth
        or

      
        in
        muddying the waters enough to confuse the public about who
        really did

      
        what
        to whom.  most of the widespread jfk murder stories have
        one thing

      
        at
        least in common:  they all seek to distract the public away
        from the

      
        history,
        personality, and motivations of lee harvey oswald -- either to

      
        claim
        he was not acting alone or to exonerate him altogether as merely

      
        a
        patsy who had nothing to do with anything.  the latest line
        from the

      
        left-wing
        establishment is that lbj was behind the assassination.

      
        again,
        anything to distract the public from understanding that a u.s.

      
        president
        was murdered by a far left zealot.

      
        the
        point is that some of these conspiracy theories or political
        spins -- as

      
        wrong-headed
        as they may be --  are nonetheless taken as gospel by

      
        some
        people -- propaganda being as effective as it is -- and that
        includes

      
        individuals
        who are mentally or psychologically unhinged or unbalanced.

      
        and
        sometimes some of these persons act on their false
        beliefs.  a key

      
        aspect
        of paranoia and schizophrenia involves losing perspective by
        taking

      
        facts
        totally out of context, disengaging from reality, or perceiving
        "facts"
        or

      
        relationships
        that are not true or do not exist at all.

      
        based
        on his reading of various left-leaning internet sites,
        self-styled

      
        "liberal"
        steve kangas believed that businessman richard mellon scaife

      
        was
        the center of a great "right-wing conspiracy" and that he was
        evil. 
        this

      
        belief
        motivated him to try unsuccessfully to murder richard mellon
        scaife.

      
        jared
        loughner, a troubled individual who believed in various
        left-wing

      
        conspiracy
        theories, hated congresswoman giffords because it became

      
        increasingly
        clear she was not left wing enough for him.  she had
        greatly

      
        disappointed
        him when she sided with the conservative republicans and

      
        stayed
        and even participated in the reading of the u.s. constitution
        when

      
        almost
        all other democrats had rudely walked out.  there ain't no
        hate like

      
        left-wing
        hate.



      
        this
        photograph taken by oswald's wife in their back yard shows
        oswald

      
        holding
        up the gun that was later used in shooting president kennedy.

      
        along
        with the gun, the photograph shows oswald proudly holding up two

      
        marxist
        newspapers, the militant and the worker.  the picture was
        taken

      
        after
        he tried to assassinate gen. edwin walker, an outspoken

      
        anticommunist.

      
        lee
        harvey oswald's supposed fondness for president john kennedy

      
        turned
        to anger and hate when he was convinced by the marxist
        literature

      
        he
        read avidly that kennedy had tried to unseat and even
        assassinate his

      
        communist
        idol fidel castro in cuba.  in his attempted assassination
        of

      
        general
        walker and his murder of jfk, oswald saw himself as a

      
        marxist
        hero.  he had motive as well as opportunity in dallas in
        november

      
        of
        1963.   of course i am under no illusion that people
        will not
        continue to

      
        believe
        what they already believe about the kennedy assassination, and

      
        that
        many americans will always be confused and uncertain about

      
        communist
        lee oswald's role in that event.

      
        the
        programming of individuals by propaganda sets them up to do
        things

      
        they
        would not do otherwise.  considering the barrage of
        inflammatory

      
        left-wing
        hate speech and slanderous rhetoric against such outspoken

      
        patriots
        as rush limbaugh, ann coulter, sarah palin, and others, might

      
        yet
        another militant leftist emerge to try to do harm to peaceful
        american

      
        citizens? 
        how many potential loughners or oswalds are out there waiting

      
        to
        be triggered into acts of evil?

      
        one
        should always ask, "who benefits?"   will the result
        be less

      
        government
        interference with the freedoms of peaceful adult citizens -- or

      
        more
        government control over us all?  will it advance a

      
        freedom/constitutionalist
        agenda or a socialist/tyrannical world view?

      
        also,
        another question to ask is:  who will be next?  will
        some left-wing

      
        kook
        try to murder rush limbaugh, ann coulter, ted cruz, or some
        other

      
        pro-freedom
        advocate?  i only hope people will be on their guard
        against a

      
        new
        wave of left-wing violence.

soaking the
              rich?

   
          outside
          of direct confiscation of existing wealth, there is not much
          the

   
          government
          can do to really hurt the rich. hiking the income tax a few

   
          points
          on high earners won't make much difference to their lifestyle.

   
          they
          are already rich. the people hurt by "soaking the rich" are
          the rest

    of
          us
          whose jobs and living standards depend on private savings and

   
          investment
          and more capital accumulation to pay for new and expanded

   
          businesses.
          with less money saved or invested in new tools and

   
          machines
          and wages, fewer job opportunities are the consequence.

   
          targeting
          the rich on the basis of "fairness" does little or nothing to

   
          improve
          the lives of low-income or middle-income families. what it
          does

   
          tend
          to do is to make it more difficult for low-income or
          middle-income

   
          people
          to rise to the high-income level, as income taxes are on
          current

   
          incomes
          and do not affect already-acquired wealth of those already on

   
          top.

   
          behind
          the socialistic idea of "soaking the rich" is the false notion
          that

   
          rich
          people got that way by somehow taking advantage of the poor.
          the

   
          neurotic
          urge to "redistribute the wealth" comes from false ideas of

   
          where
          wealth comes from and the notion that all wealth is static, so
          that

    if
          someone
          has more than others then it must have come from those

   
          others.
          the exploitation theories of marx and rodbertus and others
          have

   
          been
          thoroughly refuted by von boehm-bawerk, von mises, thomas

   
          sowell,
          george reisman, and other competent economists. what

   
          remains
          today is the moribund, dishonest religion of the left still
          being

   
          pushed
          by the momentum of the emotions generated by those past

   
          fallacies.
          the left's stale, counterproductive nostrums are dying a slow

   
          death.
          the control freaks will no longer be able to hide their lust
          for

   
          power
          behind the pretense of helping the common man. in the

   
          meantime,
          will they take the rest of us down with them?

guy fawkes
              masks and occupay
              wall street

   
          it is
          interesting that a mask representing the face of guy fawkes,
          the

   
          most
          notorious of the infamous would-be bombers of parliament and

   
          the british
          government of 1605, is seized upon by some of the occupy

   
          wall
          street leftists as some kind of badge of protest.  if
          fawkes and his

   
          zealous
          cronies had been successful and had had their way and did

   
          manage
          to blow up the legislative, judicial, and executive officials
          of

   
          government
          (since they were all there on that day), the result would

   
          have
          been far more statism, far more tyranny, not less, as these
          radical

   
          catholics
          planned to have the king of spain over and impose the

   
          spanish
          inquisitin and his own religious faith on all, as bloody mary

   
          tudor
          had tried to do.  by contrast, the relatively moderate
          policies of

   
          james
          i helped set the stage for development of protolibertarian
          thought

   
          during
          that century and ultimately helped to make possible the
          glorious

   
          revolution
          of 1688.  if one is a  genuine libertarian one would

   
          assiduously
          eschew the gunpowder plot of 1605 and celebrate its foiling

    by
          burning
          fawkes's image on november 5.

            obama's
            policies discredited

    ideally,
the
        proper function of government, essentially, is not to govern
        peaceful
        people in their private lives or voluntary exchanges. it is
        limited to
        governing criminals -- those convicted of violating the rights
        of peaceful
        people. it is not to set prices, regulate what vitamins we may
        take, establish
        racial quotas, manage healthcare, or redistribute wealth among
        non-criminals.
        if obama's true goal was to help the economy recover, his
        policies of massive
        federal spending and indebtedness have failed. this
        administration has
        spent more than all previous administrations combined. yet, they
        have destroyed
        far more jobs than they have created. trying to "stimulate" the
        economy
        back to health through government spending is like trying to
        gain nourishment
        by drinking your own blood! the government cannot put back into
        the economy
        more than what it takes out of it -- and given the huge overhaed
        and waste
        involved in government programs -- on net it puts back in less
        than it
        takes away while artificially stimulating some sectors at the
        forced expense
        of others. when fdr tried this, it kept the country in
        depression for many
        years unnecessarily and causing widespread economic anguish.
        what must
        be done is to slash federal spending to the bone, cut taxes
        generally,
        abolish the capital gains tax, repeal dodd-frank and many other
        laws, and
        replace the federal reserve legal counterfeiting monopoly with a
        sound
        (golden) monetary system.


2012 year of
            opportunity

    too
many
        "libertarians" nowdays use a lot of the old anarcho-trotskyite
        crackpot
        rhetoric of the seventies and eighties and there is a
        simple-minded blame-america-always
        attitude when it comes to foreign policy that offends many who
        encounter
        these self-styled libertarians.   but there was a time
        when libertarian
        meant someone who supported the classic position of laissez
        faire as the
        proper scope of constitutional government -- that government's
        scope should
        be limited to strongly policing, isolating, and punishing
        criminals and
        defending against foreign threats while leaving peaceful adult
        citizens
        alone as much as is possible.  this was the position of
        those who
        founded the libertarian party such as john hospers and david
        nolan and
        those scholars who influenced the cause of constitutional
        liberty such
        as john locke, james madison, thomas jefferson, frederic
        bastiat, herbert
        spencer, ludwig von mises, ayn rand, milton friedman, f. a.
        hayek, hans
        sennholz, roger macbride, leonard read, isabel paterson, george
        reisman,
        and others.

    the
        anarcho-trotskyite
        leftover types kind of glombed onto the libertarian movement
        perhaps mistakenly
        thinking that "anti-statist" meant "anti-state" and many even
        became active
        in the lp, though one wonders how they squared working within a
        political
        party with their vaunted anarchism.  this is not the only
        reason libertarianism
        has acquired a bad name with the public but it is at the root of
        why many
        of the more rational people have become alienated from anything
        with the
        label "libertarian" on it.   the cause that started
        out with
        so much hope decades ago has become distorted almost beyond
        recognition
        by left-wing reactionaries who claim to embrace free-market
        economics but
        at the same time advocate a whimarchist politics of gang wars
        and unlimited
        violence in which free markets cannot exist.

    since a member of
        the
        lds church is running for president this year, the only real
        alternative
        to four more years of disastrous democrat rule, whatever his
        deficits,
        those who support constitutional liberty must now try to make
        him and his
        candidacy as good as they can be.  i am not a mormon, but i
        strongly
        agree with the political position expressed so eloquently by the
        late ezra
        taft benson, lds leader, in his small book on the proper role of
        government. 
        it should be required reading by all americans, especially in
        the year
        2012.  indeed, given the opportunity before us, this may
        well be the
        best way to spread true libertarian ideas.

the war in iraq,
            libertarians,
            and ron paul

the war in
          iraq
          issue has divided libertarians or has exposed divisions which
          were already
          there. i believe many libertarians and some conservatives
          sincerely oppose
          the war on essentially procedural grounds -- that the word
          "war" was not
          explicitly used in congress's grant of military authority to
          the president
          in going into iraq. even though there is disagreement among
          constitutionalists
          about whether congress's authorization amounted to a "real"
          declaration
          of war or not, this is at least an argument which tries to
          refer back to
          the constitution and i understand it even if i do not
          necessarily agree
          with it. i see that as perhaps their strongest legitimate
          argument against
          the war in iraq. it at least appears to be a libertarian or
          constitutionalist
          argument. (yet some of the same people who claim this as their
          basis for
          opposing the war in iraq nevertheless supported the war in
          afghanistan,
          which had no explicit declaration of the word "war" from
          congress either.
          inconsistent constitutionalism, it seems to me.)
but i also believe
            many of
            the "anti-war" libertarians have accepted certain democrat
            media talking
            points as the basis for their opposition, even though they
            are not true.
            they have absorbed the hate-bush propaganda which is so
            ubiquitous in the
            media, especially democrat party establishment house organs
            such as npr,
            nbc, abc, cbs, time magazine, washington post, l.a. times,
            and the new
            york times, just to name a few. those who rely for their
            news and interpretations
            on such sources are apt to be misled, especially on the
            issue of the war
            in iraq. many americans have been led to believe, for
            example, that bush
            and cheney "lied us into war" and that scooter libby exposed
            valerie plame
            as a "covert" cia agent and that this was in revenge for her
            husband's
            claim that saddam hussein never sought "yellow cake" uranium
            in africa.
            none of these claims of this scenario are true. the
            statements of valerie
            plame's husband, joseph wilson, have been shown to be
            without credibility.
            libby was not the person who "outed" valerie plame (who was
            not a covert
            agent anyway). yet, because most americans get only
            "impressions" of news
            and generally get those impressions from watching television
            every night,
            the constant barrage of propaganda has caused many,
            including even some
            libertarians, to buy into this chain of false claims
            disseminated by anti-bush
            partisans within the federal bureaucracy and their democrat
            allies in the
            media.

a clash between
            the u.s.
            and saddam hussein was virtually inevitable and not
            avoidable in the long
            run. my position has been that the u.s. had little choice:
            either deal
            with saddam hussein and his military buildup now (asap) or
            have to fight
            him years later when confrontation could not be avoided any
            longer and
            when his forces would have been far stronger and more
            destructive in terms
            of weapons of mass destruction and alliances. that being my
            view, i'd rather
            see it done now and with bush 43 as president rather than
            put it off when
            saddam would have been more dangerous and when the u.s.
            president might
            be some doofus democrat like kerry or gore or hillary
            clinton. whatever
            mistakes the bush administration has made in the war against
            the jihadists,
            i am easily persuaded in my mind that a democrat president
            would have done
            far worse. despite my consistent opposition to president
            bush's liberal
            policies on other issues, it is clear that things would be
            far worse if
            kerry or gore had been elected, especially with regard to
            foreign policy,
            national security, and defense. (again, as i have said
            before, it's not
            that i think bush is so good, but that the democrat
            alternatives were so
            bad. unfortunately, too many americans still do not have a
            clue about how
            much damage bill clinton did as president to this country's
            national security
            and too many people continue to underestimate the extent of
            duplicity on
            the part of the current democrat leadership.)

the u.s. (or
            anyone else
            for that matter) had both the legal and moral right to take
            down saddam
            and his regime. in addition, it was in the geopolitical
            interests of the
            u.s. to do so. the iran-iraq war was long over. he had
            ceased to be an
            "ally" long ago. he was harboring anti-american terrorists
            including zarqawi
            and abu nidal. (there is even evidence of terrorist training
            camps inside
            iraq going back to the 1990s.) intelligence from all over
            the world indicated
            saddam's military buildup included weapons of mass
            destruction and programs
            for developing wmds. he had already used wmds against
            iraqis, killing kurds
            in great numbers. how would he use them in the future? might
            some of them
            find their way into the hands of terrorists like those who
            attacked the
            u.s. on 09/11/01? sadam had been properly slapped down by
            bush 41 after
            his unprovoked aggression against neighboring kuwait, with
            whom the u.s.
            had a defense agreement. saddam continued to violate the
            terms of the ceasefire
            after that first gulf war, anyone who claims that the u.s.
            did not have
            a right to strike saddam hussein and curtail his military
            buildup in retaliation
            for his military actions and threats ignores what was
            happening or was
            just not paying attention.

contrary to
            democrat talking
            points and anti-bush partisan political propaganda, the
            evidence indicated
            saddam hussein did have wmds, did have programs for
            developing wmds,
            and was seeking to get "yellow cake" uranium (despite joseph
            wilson's claims
            to the contrary). some wmds and evidence of wmds were later
            found by the
            u.s. military in iraq, but there is evidence that most of
            the wmds were
            transported out of iraq prior to the arrival of u.s. and
            allied troops.
            there was plenty of time to accomplish this as the bush
            administration
            clearly telegraphed its punches.

whether the u.s.
            invasion
            of iraq is seen as a rescue of the iraqi people from the
            tyranny of saddam
            hussein or as an attempt to replace saddam with a reliable
            ally in the
            broader war against the jihadists, or both, it was certainly
            not a case
            of "u.s. imperialism" or unprovoked aggression by the allies
            against a
            peaceful government -- as the anti-american left would have
            people believe.

in his recent
            article published
            in the wall street journal ("libertarians and the
            war:  ron
            paul doesn't speak for all of us" july 17, 2007), georgetown
            university
            professor and libertarian writer randy barnett does not
            appear to address
            the "declaration of war" issue which many anti-war
            libertarians invoke,
            but he does point out quite correctly that "[w]hile all
            libertarians accept
            the principle of self-defense, and most accept the role of
            the u.s. government
            in defending u.s. territory, libertarian first principles of
            individual
            rights and the rule of law tell us little about what
            constitutes appropriate
            and effective self-defense after an attack." and, of course,
            no one ever
            claimed that they do, at least no one i know of in the
            pro-iraqi liberation
            faction among libertarians.

strict
            libertarianism says
            it is wrong to initiate force against a peaceful
            person or regime
            that has not initiated force against others. it does not say
            that you cannot
            use force in retaliation against someone who has initiated
            force, which
              saddam hussein had done on a massive scale. specific
            tactics and strategy
            of war cannot be deduced from such first principles as
            self-ownership,
            private property, rule of law, etc. there is nothing in
            libertarian principles
            or the theory of the laissez-faire constitutional republic
            which dictates
            such matters. such specific issues of tactics and strategy
            are matters
            of judgment and prudence by military experts. other than
            advocating an
            international gold standard, low or no tariffs, and trying
            to avoid (if
            possible) foreign wars as a general policy, there can be a
            wide latitude
            of positions among libertarians when it comes to foreign
            policy and geopolitical
            strategy.

by making himself
            a single-issue
            candidate -- especially on an issue on which libertarians
            are so divided
             ron paul is sadly distracting from other very important
            issues and from
            the bedrock libertarian principles on which we all agree. as
            professor
            barnett writes in the closing paragraph of his wsj
            editorial, those libertarians
            who supported the liberation of iraq and who support success
            in leaving
            behind a stable ally there ". . . are still rooting for
            success in iraq
            because it would make americans more safe, while defeat
            would greatly undermine
            the fight against those who declared war on the u.s. they
            are concerned
            that americans may get the misleading impression that all
            libertarians
            oppose the iraq war -- as ron paul does -- and even that
            libertarianism
            itself dictates opposition to this war. it would be a shame
            if this misinterpretation
            inhibited a wider acceptance of the libertarian principles
            that would promote
            the general welfare of the american people."

i agree. thank
            you, professor
            barnett.

america's thirty years war

who is winning?

by balint vazsonyi

hardcover - 285 pages (july 4, 1998)
        regnery
        publishing inc;

isbn: 0895263548

the publisher, regnery publishing
        book
        summary:

       
    
      
        is
        america on a slow-motion trip toward socialism even as much of
        the rest
        of the

      
        world
        moves away from it? hungarian-born historian and world-renowned
        concert

      
        pianist
        balint vazsonyi, who knows first-hand what it means to live
        under an

      
        authoritarian
        regime, makes a powerful case that it is.

      
        drawing
        heavily on his personal experiences living under different
        versions of

      
        socialism,
        vazsonyi describes how our hard won freedoms are being gradually

      
        eroded.

      
        vazsonyi
        traces the essence of what makes america unique back to the
        founders and

      
        shows
        how those who want america as we know it to fail are undermining
        the

      
        founder's
        original intent.

      
        the
        author documents how america's founding principles of rule of
        law, individual

      
        rights,
        the guarantee of property, and a common american identity are
        being

      
        gradually
        replaced by government mandated group rights, redistribution,
        and

      
        multi-culturalism.

      
        the
        thirty year war is being fought between those who promote
        liberty, rights
        for the

      
        individual
        and a continued need for moral guidance on the one side, and
        those who

      
        believe
        that the supreme power is human reason which, operating through
        a central

      
        authority,
        can and will create the perfect world on the other. while the
        picture is
        not

      
        rosy,
        america has every chance of winning, if the intentions of the
        two sides
        are

      
        exposed,
        and the consequences weighed. this witty, simple-to-follow, and

      
        engagingly
        personal book should aid in the process.

      
        with
        unmistakable clarity, vazsonyi shows how every time america
        moves away
        from

      
        its
        founding principles it moves in the direction of a system where
        a fantasy
        of

      
        "social
        justice" is pursued through ever-greater government control.
        america's
        thirty

      
        years
        war is an inspiration to those who have lost touch with our
        founding principles

      
        and
        ammunition for those who believe that our freedoms must be
        defended every

      
        day.

betrayal: how
              the clinton
              administration undermined

american
              security

by bill gertz

    i don't know what will wake up the apathetic,
      uninformed,
      and politically
      
          naive people who are enamored of the elmer
      gantry
      in the white house,
      
          former president and criminal in chief bill
      clinton.
      some of us have
      
          understood for many years that bill clinton is
      a
      corrupt traitor. maybe this
      
          book will wake up more people to the disaster
      he
      and his advisors have
      
          brought about -- and the serious consequences
      for
      american national
      
          security in the coming decades. selling out
      one's
      country in exchange for
      
          illegal campaign contributions from red chinese
      dictators -- just so he could
      
          have four more years in the oval office -- is
      contemptible
      beyond words.
      
          giving away the military technology store to
      the
      ruthless communist regime
      
          will be bill clinton's outstanding legacy --
      and
      is likely to set back the final
      
          triumph of freedom and progress in the world
      for
      several years if not many
      
          decades. people of the future will curse the
      names
      of bill clinton and sandy

the

what is the proper
            role of
            government, and how should it be limited? with which categories
of
              human activity should political government be
            concerned?

              to enjoy the following: a

"left"
            and "right"?
hey! do you know
            your left
            from your right? many americans don't these days! they are
            like someone
            watching a football game without knowing the rules of the
            game, which team
            is which, or how to keep score! politics is very confusing
            to them.

            do the terms "left"

what
            is the basic definition of "libertarian" in today's
            political arena?  
            and, how are libertarians different from
            conservatives, from liberals,
            from democrats, from anarchists,  & from
            pragmatists?  this
            essay seeks to answer these questions in clear english.

david

            forth
            five essential platform planks which unite all libertarians
            despite any
            differences they may have on other issues.

has the democratic

            state become that great fiction by which nearly everyone
            seeks to live
            at the forced expense of everyone else? government cannot
            give anything
            to anybody unless it takes it away from somebody else, and
            when it does
            this it uses force and coercion in violation of the rights
            of those from
            whom it takes. the political state -- interventionist
            government -- cannot
            bestow any benefit to society as a whole -- it can only take
            from some
            and give to others, minus the overhead absorbed by the
            administering bureaucracy.
