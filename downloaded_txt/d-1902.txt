"why is missouri nicknamed the "show me state?"
missouri became
known as the show me state in 1899, when congressman willard d.
vandiver said: "i come from a country that raises corn and cotton and
cockleburs and democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor
satisfies me. i'm from missouri. you've got to show me."
