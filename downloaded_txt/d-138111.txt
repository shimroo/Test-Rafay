    our mission statement
 the cfoa is looking to cement its place as the hot bed of young and growing talent in the carolinas. this means the focus is back on providing local players with a high quality tournament series where they can gain competitive experience. legendary nxl pro tyler humphrey is teaming up with long time cfoa player andrew gibson to make this tournament series the best it can be. look for larger standalone events designed to bring new players from across the carolinas together. we've updated our venues to provide players and spectators with the top notch 3man, 5man, 7man, and 10man experience they deserve with events for all teams as well as organized practices for players of all levels.

 "i started playing in the cfoa back in 1999. it's always been a great tournament series to improve your team and yourself, while being surrounded by other great people and like-minded players. because of the experience and camaraderie my team gained from the cfoa, my team trauma was able to stick together, learn, and excel in national and international competition. win or lose, i always knew when we went to a cfoa event we were going to have fun and be better paintball players at the end of it. i'm hoping that by throwing professional and fun events, we'll be able to do the same for players in the carolinas in 2019!"- tyler humphrey


   "i've been playing in the cfoa since i first became a competitive player and experienced everything from dead last to the top of the podium.  the cfoa helped mold me into the player i am and the experience my teams gained propelled us towards success.  the regional competition has created some of the greatest players to ever come out of the carolinas and the camaraderie has formed life long friendships.  i want nothing more than to welcome the next wave of carolina talent into a tournament series designed to help them grow and achieve their goals. whether you're just looking for fun or to be the best in the carolinas this is the tournament series for you."- andrew
