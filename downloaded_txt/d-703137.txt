about the professional fire fighters of maryland
the pffmd is the umbrella organization representing all affiliates of the international association of fire fighters located in the state of maryland.
mission:
the primary objective of the professional fire fighters of maryland is to formulate and pursue a state wide legislative agenda to promote the interests of the fire service and its membership. additionally, the organization assists its member affiliates in a multitude of organizational, educational, political and contractual pursuits. furthermore, the pffmd is both an active participant and assumes leadership roles in the international association of fire fighters (iaff), the maryland state federation of the afl-cio, respective local afl-cio central labor councils and local labor coalitions.
overview:
in 1969, a group of local union leaders met to form the state association. their rationale was to create an umbrella organization to deal with state wide issues, and to provide a forum for discussion and exchange of information between the affiliated locals of the international association of fire fighters (iaff) throughout the state of maryland (and, back then, also in the district of columbia). in the intervening years, the pffmd has become a recognized political force in state politics, and a formidable coalition within our own international union. the association's primary objective is to formulate and pursue a state-wide legislative agenda to promote the interests of the fire service and its membership. additionally, the organization assists its member affiliates in a multitude of organizational, educational, political and contractual pursuits. furthermore, the pffmd is both an active participant and assumes leadership roles in the iaff, the maryland state federation of the afl-cio, respective local afl-cio central labor councils and local labor coalitions. the association strives to promote fraternity and improve communications within the fire service. as collateral activities, the pffmd and its affiliated locals are involved in a myriad of community and charitable projects: most notably, supporting muscular dystrophy association and the area's regional burn centers. very succinctly, the pffmd exists to serve and represent the interests of professional fire fighters and ems employees throughout maryland.

october 28th was national first responder day. in recognition of that, local woodworker james shelton of @sheltonwoodworks and his son forrest presented the crew at fire station 31 with this amazingly detailed thin red line handcrafted american flag. 

our members are truly humbled to accept and display this one of a kind custom piece of artwork that represents our devotion to the community which we serve. while they were there, forrest got an up close look at truck 731. 

james and forrest also presented a thin blue line custom flag to our brothers and sisters of the montgomery county police at the germantown 5d station. thank you!
