sailing
fairwind yacht club is a non-profit, all volunteer, civic-minded organization with a mission to provide low-cost access to the sport of sailing. in marina del rey and channel islands harbor, our club owns a fleet of sailboats that are available to our members by reservation.
education
fairwind is an affiliate of the american sailing association. we like applicants to our club to have sailing experience, then we provide intermediate and advanced sailing education to our members included in their membership dues to make everyone better and safer sailors.
community service
fairwind offers free sailing to anyone interested every tuesday and the second saturday of each month in marina del rey. we also co-operate programs with the boys and girls club and with veterans affairs volunteer services each summer.
