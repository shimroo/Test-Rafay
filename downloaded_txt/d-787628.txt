never forget the heroes act passes
we lobbied congress
barasch & mcgarry was proud to join forces with 9/11 advocates, including comedian jon stewart, to successfully lobby congress for the permanent authorization of the september 11th victim compensation fund (vcf).

the vcf has been extended to 2092. claimants may file new or amended claims up until then.
the vcf is required to pay claimants the full amount of their award. those claimants whose awards were cut by the special master because of insufficient funding (after february, 2019) will be made whole.
the bill was passed in the house on july 12, 2019 (h.r.1327), and the senate on july 23, 2019 (s.546).
