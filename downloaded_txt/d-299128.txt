your service was so slick, you had my part, buffed it, bagged it, and my part was on the van that evening…i told my neighbour how cool your service was, i will certainly use logel’s in the future.

brian went to great lengths to get me a seat for a
customer. even through i’m a small fish in the auto pond, he treated
me like gold. so nice to have that kind of customer service. kudos to
all the staff.
