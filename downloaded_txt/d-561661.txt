  what a privilege to introduce to you the tembe elephant national park - a largely undiscovered african wonderland! tembe is a fully-stocked game park which is rumoured to be one of the wildest reserves left in south africa with the least human influence.

tembe offers the best of both worlds... the magnificence of a national game park (managed by a provincial government body known as the kwazulu-natal nature conservation service), with the personal touch and top-class service of a private, luxury lodge - the tembe safari lodge


this luxurious safari lodge consists of luxury en-suite tented accommodation. a thatch-sheltered splash pool, and open barbeque are complete the picture. enjoy tasty meals under the stars - and the dancing flames of the camp fire in the african bush.




african cultural experiences such as zulu / tonga dancing can be enjoyed at the lodge.  visitors can also visit the local sangoma (witch doctor) for ancient herbal remedies or to have their fortunes predicted in the throwing of the bones.......
