g.a. 
              schimpff’s confectionery is one of the oldest, continuously 
              operated, family-owned candy businesses in the united states. it 
              was opened in its present location in 1891 by gustav schimpff sr. 
              and jr. (see history for more information.)
this 
              unique confectionery and lunch room in jeffersonville's downtown 
              historic district comes complete with a 50's soda fountain and original 
              tin ceiling. the old-fashioned candy jars, cases, and turn-of-the 
              century equipment transport you back to the good old days of home-made 
              candy and a real fountain drink.
its 
              candy museum and candy demonstration area offer a glimpse into the 
              world of historic candy making, packaging and advertising. live 
              candy-making demonstrations are frequently given. tours are available 
              and groups are asked to call in advance to schedule a free tour 
              of the candy museum.
schimpff's 
              is famous for its cinnamon red hots, hard candy fish and modjeskas. 
              a more recent favorite is the chocolate, caramel, and pecan confection 
              molded into the shape of a turtle. (see local 
              candy and candy store for more information.)
