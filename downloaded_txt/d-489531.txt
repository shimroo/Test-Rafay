our story



puddlestompers™ nature exploration has served the communities of greater boston for over two decades. we provide interactive and engaging year-round nature programming to young children and their caregivers, with the goal of encouraging kids to get out and explore the natural communities in their own backyards.



our mission statement



puddlestompers™ is committed to connecting the youngest naturalists (ages 2-9) and their parents and caregivers to the open spaces in their communities. by providing the seeds of interest, the tools for exploration, and the caring guidance of our seasoned teacher-naturalists, we hope to help build the foundation for a lifelong enjoyment of the outdoors and stewardship of nature.
