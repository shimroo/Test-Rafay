today's funny line:  you might be a redneck if the taillight covers of your car are made of red tape.

what's on sean's mind today:  i regret that i did not take auto shop in high school. but the members of the gto email list have taught me a lot about engines over the years.

who is on duty now:  sean is currently online and uploading

says marko markowski - "this website has a photo of every gto ever made?  did i dream that?  tonight i've 
looked through just 2,000 gto photos and am certainly amazed."
says richard hammond from the tv show top gear - "muscle cars may not have done much to advance the 
world, but trust me, you wouldnt want to live in a world without them."
gushes ed - "this site is awesome!! i love it and was especially pleased to see how the car pics were even 
categorized by colors as i was only interested in 1970 orbit oranges."
says robert d. - "thanks for preserving the history and beauty of these cars."
says pete aiello - "when [dad] was in college, he had his first '65 taken from him - only three years after 
he bought it brand new.  40 years have passed and now i'm going to get it back for him on his 60th birthday."
says jason daubert - "i used your zone and dealer code for my other 65 gto (a rough one).  another example 
of how useful your site is to the enthusiast."
steve fantasizes - "great site, i could live here!"
says jenn tran - "i can only say a simple "thank you", because 1. words can't really express my love 
for gtos and what you've done to foster a person's love for this gorgeous car 2. i've got to get back to searching 
for the gto sold out from under me (or a suitable replacement). your site has made this 22 y.o. texan very happy."
says spencer schwab - "this is the best website ever! i visit at least 10 times every day and spend at least 
half an hour on it each time."
types matt - "your website is the best . i had a '67 goat in my younger days.  i wish i hadn't sold it.  
who knew the muscle cars of yesterday would be so popular again?  keep up the good work!"
chortles charles barnett - "oh that great i love it n enjoy too longtime"
says ron casey - "great site. at 51 years of age i am getting the urge for another goat. i know i could never 
find my original love or even if it still exists?  i do search from time to time and it gets me all stirred up to 
get one."
says timothy o'dell - "well i think this site is just what all gto people need...a place to come and dream, 
look at the others that are out there compare get ideas. just to get my fix for the day, as the winter sets in and i 
have to park it, i can open a window and drive someone else's for awhile. thanks sean!"
spouts mark blojovian - "i wonder how my name even got on this website?  maybe it's because i once owned 
a 1971 gto station wagon?  what a car!"
says sean's wife - "get a grip. the wives of car freaks support group will be meeting with me at the next gtoaa convention."





send your gto photos to me. i especially want photos of junkyard goats and unfinished
project cars! or britney spears baby. there is a large demand for bikini girls pictured in front
of gto's too.. heh hehhh. please be patient if you submit a picture. it
can take several months for the pic to finally appear on the site.
do not re-send pictures. sending me duplicate pics is very unappreciated.
in other words, don't send duplicate pictures to me!
