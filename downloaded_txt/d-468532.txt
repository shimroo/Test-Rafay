note from the pastorit's a privilege to lead this wonderful congregation and to witness the tranforming power of the gospel in lives of our members. it's also a delight to welcome you and to share how faithful god has been to tremont temple!our mission isn't one of our own making—jesus, in matthew 28:19-20, calls his church to make disciples of all nations, baptizing and teaching them to obey all of god's word. we have found that focusing on this great aim fosters spiritual growth, unity, and fellowship rooted in love.i invite you to explore our website, learn about our ministries, and join us for worship and fellowship. feel free to reach out if you have questions or simply want to connect. we look forward to getting to know you better and hope to see you soon.- jaime owens, senior pastor
