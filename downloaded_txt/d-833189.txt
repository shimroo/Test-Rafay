welcome to buckland manor
 | 
one of the most elegant country house hotels in the cotswolds, buckland manor is tucked away in a tranquil corner of the village of buckland, next to the old village church. set in 10 acres of grounds, which blend seamlessly into the village, the beautiful manor house is unmarked by the passing of time; it is an idyllic setting from which to enjoy an exceptionally warm welcome, tantalising menus lovingly crafted from the ‘market garden of england’ and breath-taking cotswold scenery.
buckland manor truly encapsulates the feeling of being at the home of a friend. a very good friend who produces afternoon tea on request, fine tipples before dinner, suggests the perfect wines and doesn't mind how late you get up before serving a hearty breakfast.
