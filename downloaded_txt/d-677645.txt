pm cit 2-hour delay schedule change
attention pm cit students and families!  this change only applies for 2 hour delay days.
beginning on tuesday, february 18, 2025, pm cit students will attend block 1 and half of block 2. pm cit students should remain in block 2 until 11:30 am and buses will depart nahs to cit at 11:35 am. lunch will still be served at cit. attending block 2 is mandatory for all students, regardless of how they get to cit (bus or student driver). the hra attendance code will no longer apply and attendance will be taken by their block 2 teacher, just like any other school day. 
this plan was developed in conjunction with cit and will have minimal impact on their instruction at cit. on the nahs side, students gain the ability to see their teacher for half of block 2 on two hour delay days.  click here for the updated detailed 2-hour delay schedule.

11th grade parents - february reminders from the nurse
the commonwealth of pennsylvania requires that all students have a physical examination in 11th grade. if you have not already provided documentation that this is complete for your child, please make an appointment with your physician to have this completed. 
eleventh grade students are also required to have a second dose of mcv (meningococcal vaccine) prior to the start of their senior year. letters have been mailed to students needing their mcv#2.
if your child has not received a second mcv after the age of 16, please make an appointment to have that completed as soon as possible and notify the nurse’s office with the appointment date. this will prevent future notifications in the mail.if your child has received this second dose, please make sure we have the documentation on file. please be sure to send in all updated documentation to the nurse's office. 
please reach out to mrs. johnson in the nurse’s office at 610-759-1730 ext. 2360 or via email: jljohnson@nazarethasd.org with any questions.
