yes, i misspoke about the "new" cure album.  turns out it's a new vinyl reissue. suddenly, there are loads of new top-quality vinyl reissues coming out of england and japan these days, including never mind the bollocks, the entire catalog of the police (start with outlandos d'amour),  classic u2 (war,   joshua tree) and loads more.  so, pull the old l.p. collection out of the garage, order a new copy of  combat rock, and have yourself an old wave night.i know, i know...if you're like me, the old turntable died years ago.  well, like old wave music, you can still buy old skool equipment.  this sony ps-lx250 fully-automatic turntable comes with a built-in pre-amp so you can hook it up to your new skool receiver (that doesn't have a phono in jack).
