“come and see why this engaging poet / guitarist / philosopher / singer / wise-ass has endured in the sometimes-cruel and always-fickle music business for [five decades]. but be prepared to feel emotions you may not have let yourself feel in a while – feelings that may scare you a little. his songs hit the heart like a wrecking ball!”
