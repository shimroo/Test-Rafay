we have seen rigs reduce their downtime, the threads on the pipe are not having as many issues and our customers are overall extremely happy since standardizing on jet-lube. our clients know that we will always have this product on shelf and they know that it's going to be the same consistency no matter what, they know that they can trust the product that's being delivered and with that trust, they have trust in us.

after i found deacon, i never went back to anywhere else, they've helped us out through the years with the responsiveness. leak repair is 24-hours / 365 days a year - they needed you five minutes ago. when we call, they help us figure out what it is we need to get, they have a lot of different specialty sealants to help us out with compaction rates, volumes, things like that. they get some of this stuff done for us ahead of time - figure it out so that when we show up we're ready to rock and roll. i can't say enough good things about the service and that really goes a long way when you're trying to work across the country like we do. what i found with deacon products was that they have a variety of products that allow us to pick that temperature range and not get things so hot that it gets hard and it's been a big seller for us.

over a 35-year career on the oilfield drilling rigs we've used jet-lube products a vast majority of the time. it's always been a good product, not just for basin drilling but through a bunch of drilling companies. at basin drilling, we think so much of jet-lube products that management encourages we use it all we can.

we've been partnered with jet-lube for southeast asia distribution for 25 years, over those 25 years i've experienced lots of growth with jet-lube. the name recognition has really grown and expanded throughout the region and we've experienced year-on-year growth more or less uninterrupted for many years now. more and more regions are requesting the products by name so it's become less a function of converting customers to jet lube to people actually requesting jet-lube i think what sets jet-lube apart is staying ahead of the curve. the reliability, the reputation is there, the availability is there.

once the word gets out amongst the rigs and our customers that we're offering jet-lube and the success that they've had on their rigs, it becomes contagious and other customers and other rigs start expanding their product line and wanting to use jet-lube products. definitely top shelf quality for sure.

we are in partner with jet-lube from last year, it's a short time but it's very good mileage on our company business. it's value added, we've got very reach with potential clients. they support us without any time delay, we are planning to keep very good inventory in saudi arabia to promote jet-lube further.
