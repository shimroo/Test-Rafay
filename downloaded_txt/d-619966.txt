darren rizzi






fa
special teams









personalize your rotoworld feed by favoriting players





broncos hired former saints interim head coach darren rizzi as their new special teams coordinator and assistant head coach.

the signing reunites rizzi with broncos head coach sean payton, who hired rizzi with the saints back in 2019. the broncos already featured a solid special teams unit, ranking eighth in the nfl with an 87.5 pff special teams grade. rizzi’s top-tier coaching should only further strengthen it. the assistant head coaching role will help rizzi develop his leaderships skills and increase his odds of securing a future head coaching role.













raheem mostert






mia
running back
#31









dolphins released rb raheem mostert.

mostert spent the 2022-2024 seasons with the dolphins. his miami tenure is highlighted by a highly productive 2023 showing in which he rushed 209 times for 1,012 yards and 18 touchdowns and caught 25-of-29 targets for 175 yards and three touchdowns. the 32-year-old could find work as a speedy, part-time player but it would be unsurprising to see him retire at this point. with mostert gone, second-year rb jaylen wright steps into the no. 2 role behind de’von achane.













allen lazard






nyj
wide receiver
#10









the athletic’s zack rosenblatt believes allen lazard will be a cap casualty for the jets this offseason.

rosenblatt lays it out pretty clearly, writing that lazard “was always getting released after the second year of a disastrous four-year, $44 million contract he signed as a free agent in 2023.” the price for playing ball with aaron rodgers when the team traded for him was to sign his long-time buddy lazard, who spent five seasons with rodgers in green bay. as many expected, lazard hasn’t proven to be much of an offensive upgrade for the jets through two seasons, amassing 60 catches for 841 yards and seven scores thus far. after getting off to a strong start in 2024, in which he posted a 30-412-5 line through the first seven games of the season, lazard became an afterthought following the trade for davante adams and only cracked 50 receiving yards once after week 7. the jets can save $6.6 million in cap space if they designate him as a pre-june 1 release while taking on a $6.5 million dead cap hit. however, the savings move to $11 million with a dead cap hit of $2.1 million if he’s designated as post-june 1. regardless, it won’t cost the team much to part ways with a receiver who has struggled to live up to his gaudy contract thus far.













c.j. mosley






nyj
linebacker
#57









the athletic’s zack rosenblatt believes jets lb c.j. mosley is “most likely” to retire this offseason.

in an article where he looked at the jets’ 2025 cap situation, rosenblatt said mosley is likely to be released by the team or retire this offseason while adding that “the most likely outcome is that he retires.” mosley’s 2024 was limited to just four games due to a neck injury, and he managed just 17 total tackles in the games he appeared in. it wouldn’t be the first time we’ve seen neck injuries for early retirements, as the cowboys saw a number of neck injuries prematurely end leighton vander esch’s career last offseason. mosley will turn 33 this off-season and has just one year left on his deal. if he is released, the jets can save $4 million against the 2025 cap while taking on a dead cap hit just north of $8.7 million.













trevor lawrence






jax
quarterback
#16









espn’s michael dirocco reports a jaguars source called any rumors of a trevor lawrence trade “ridiculous.”

the jaguars source added that there was “no chance” they would consider trading lawerence. these comments were spurred by a report earlier in the day that said the steelers reached out to the jaguars inquiring about a potential trade for the fifth-year signal-caller. while anything remains possible, the idea of the jaguars trading lawrence seems highly unlikely given that he was just signed to an extension last offseason. the steelers need help at quarterback, with russell wilson and justin fields both set to hit free agency, but early reports are they will attempt to re-sign one of the vets this offseason.













clyde edwards-helaire






no
running back
#23









saints signed rb clyde edwards-helaire.

ceh will be back with the saints for the start of the 2025 offseason. the former first-round pick was active for two games last season for the saints, rushing 13 times for 46 yards while adding another three catches for 24 yards. with new head coach kellen moore now in town, the saints are sure to have some roster turnover this offseason, but edwards-helaire could have a chance to battle for a roster spot if he sticks around until training camp. 













alvin kamara






no
running back
#41









saints coach kellen moore said alvin kamara will “continue to be a really important piece” to the saints offense.

kamara will be 30 at the start of next season but still turned in a solid 2024 season, racking up 1,493 yards from scrimmage and eight total touchdowns while catching 68 passes for 543 yards and two scores. kamara’s fantasy managers have long profited from his work in the passing game, as the veteran back has caught 68 or more passes in six of his eight years in the league. kamara signed a two-year, $24.5 million extension last october. as long as he’s still producing at a high level, we would expect him to see workloads similar to what we’ve seen in years past.













maxx crosby






lv
defensive end
#98









maxx crosby said he is expected to be out of his walking boot on february 17 as he continues to recover from surgery on his left ankle.

crosby underwent season-ending surgery in december to fix an issue he had been dealing with for a significant portion of the season. when asked about his recovery on thursday, crosby said, “i’m a-plus across the board, as far as everything with dr. anderson...i’m in a great place right now.” the 7.5 sacks crosby totaled last season were his fewest since 2021, but it directly coincides with the fact he only played in 12 games — also a career-low. crosby will be 28 at the start of next season and appears to be on track for the start of training camp.













kellen moore






no
head coach









saints coach kellen moore plans to call plays for the offense this season.

this was expected to be the case, but moore confirmed it at his introductory press conference on thursday. the first-time head coach made a name for himself as an offensive play-caller and is fresh off leading the eagles’ offense to 33 points in the team’s super bowl win over the chiefs. moore and the eagles leaned heavily into the ground game last season, but during his 2023 campaign with the chargers and his four-year run with the cowboys (2019-2022), his offenses were ranked in the top-15 in early-down pass rate. how moore decides to run his offense with the saints could depend on how their off-season goes. while alvin kamara isn’t getting any younger, it’s hard to imagine any coach trusting derek carr to lead a high-volume passing attack.







brandon brown






nyg
front office









jaguars interviewed giants assistant gm brandon brown for their general manager vacancy.

brown just completed his third season as the giants’ assistant general manager and also interviewed with the raiders for their gm opening earlier this offseason. before joining the giants in 2022, brown spent five seasons with the eagles (2017-2021), starting as an assistant director of pro scouting before working his way up to director of player personnel in 2021. brown has fielded several gm interviews over the last several seasons and nearly landed the chargers’ gm role in 2024 before the team hired joe hortiz from the ravens. while the last two seasons have proved challenging for brown and the giants, the team’s unexpected success during the 2022 season, in which they went 9-7-1 and made the postseason, caught the attention of teams. as the jaguars continue to vet their gm candidates, it wouldn’t be surprising to see brown make another deep run that could end with him being tabbed as the man to replace former gm trent baalke.
