in 2025, we will bid farewell to this website after twenty-seven years. it has been a joy sharing our love for janis with you and seeing the friendships that have blossomed, especially those formed by len, who is no longer with us. we hope this site has brought you happiness. though this space will cease to exist, we will always have the music.

about usjanisjoplin.net was founded in 1998 out of boredom, curiosity about the web, and an insatiable need to know all there is to know about janis joplin. my name is anna and i started this website at sixteen. len, my co-conspirator, joined me a few months later. he is a graphic designer who lives in vancouver, and i am a web developer who resides in chicago. although a constant work in progress, we are proud of the massive amount of information we've gathered here. hopefully, we can preserve the memory of a figure who is slowly being forgotten. this website is for fans by fans and a non-profit passion project.
