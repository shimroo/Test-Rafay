 developer communities


how to build a developer community?

          the critical step for attracting and exciting developers in your community is helping them compile the
            code. here's the simple test: if an end user is slightly
          interested, but not religious, about your project could they contribute something useful within 7 minutes?
        

          if so, great! your project is growing!
        

 case study: in the ethereum community, we:

helped to standardize how nfts work
evangelized and onboarded developers
built the standards process for new standards
improved solidity, the smart contracts language

and now today, nfts are the primary onramp for new developers to blockchain. and it is the only legal use
            case in china.
my work was sponsored in part by ethereum foundation and microsoft/github.


          the seven-minute test is easy to say and hard to pass.
        
how to make hackathons and community events

          like any great party, you need a great theme. don't pick the theme "a bunch of college kids showing up to
          learn about your product and do your work without pay," that's so 2010's! instead, try "career development,"
          "apprenticeship," "serene getaway" and nothing wrong with "performative," "experimental," or "turnt."
        
i build communities for technology events and products. this includes hackathons like the tron dao hackatron and exciting, interactive workshops
          to explain what is nft/blockchain.
usually these events are public, see some past appearances.
here is a paid promotional video i did for tron vs.
            ethereum.
