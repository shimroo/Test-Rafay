welcome to skywagons






the international 180/185 club is a social organization whose 1200+ members have one thing in common:  they all own or have a passion for cessna skywagons.  pilots pride themselves in flying these “workhorses” of the sky.  these planes have fixed gear and a tailwheel framework.  the skywagons’ unique characteristics require these planes be flown on the ground as well as in the sky.

our social club sanctions fly-ins throughout the united states, canada and mexico offering members an opportunity to enjoy the fellowship of individuals with diverse occupations and interests—all sharing the common thread of flight.  affiliated clubs with over 120 members are also active in australia and new zealand.  



about us
the international 180/185 club, inc. was founded in 1977 exclusively for owners of cessna 180/185 skywagons as a social club.  today, we have expanded our membership to include aviation enthusiasts who have a passion for these taildragger airplanes.  we want “to promote and share the enjoyment and adventure of flying cessna 180/185 aircraft.”  we are a non-profit organization run by volunteers.  there are no paid officials.

our club awards annual scholarships through our future aviator scholarship program. to apply or donate click on the future aviator scholarship tab in the above menu.  


our club holds one major social fly-in convention each year located somewhere in the u.s. or canada.  regional events are held throughout the year.  organized by club members, these fly-in gatherings offer an opportunity to enjoy the camaraderie of friends and serve as a platform for sharing flying adventures.  


our club newsletter is published six times a year.  the newsletters contain information on flying events for members, reports on travel and incidents by members, technical information and maintenance hints, and a classified section listing planes and parts for sale or wanted by members of our organization.  


as a club member, you can use this website to search for published technical articles and tips, old newsletters, and use our online classified section. (note: stcs and other faa documentation are available for sale to club members only through this site.) the forum blogs allow members the opportunity to share information on numerous subjects from performance to maintenance issues for these planes.  


our club offers three levels of membership—regular, sustaining and associate.  (visit our membership page for information and registration.)  there is an annual membership fee.


we welcome you to join the international 180/185 club.  and hope to see you soon at one of our events.
