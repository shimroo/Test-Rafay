streetcats is still not able to move into and open our new facility but we are keeping in touch with the city to ensure all they want us to do is being done.  we do receive mail, but we cannot get packages at 3105 s. winston ave., tulsa 74135-2028.  thank you for continuing to think of us and we hope to be able to see everyone soon. our new facility is beautiful and the remodel has been completed. we look forward to showing it off when we can and having the kitties enjoy their new home. you can call our message line 918-298-0104 with any questions or  send us an email to cats@streetcatstulsa.org.all family members in a home (including all children) need to come in when a family is looking to adopt. we do not adopt to homes out of oklahoma. all cats have tested negative for feline leukemia (or feleuk) and fiv and are current on rabies and fvrcp vaccinations. all kitties that have not been microchipped prior to coming into the streetcats adoption program have home again microchips implanted by feline specialties and streetcats will register them at no charge to the new owner. if a chip other than from home again has been implanted, the new owner will need to register with the specific chip supplier, but there should not be a charge for the owner to do this.













streetcats, inc. believes that all cats deserve a home. we wish to reduce the population of unwanted cats by maintaining a spay and neuter program for feral cats and by sheltering cats who no longer have people to care for them. we seek adoptive families who value animals and who will love and protect our streetcats.streetcats, inc is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to shelter cats that have been abandoned or lost and to find new homes for them.  the cats that we accept into our adoption program are adoptable cats only (we cannot take in feral cats and we do not go out and pick up cats on the streets).   we are an organization that does not place a time limit on a healthy cat's life; we keep them until a home is found.

winter cat shelter













it seems every year i hear from someone who started feeding a poor, lost kitty that showed up in their yard in the spring.  as winter approaches, they realize they have a cat who continues to come for food.  unlike the hummingbirds who conveniently leave for the winter, if you've been feeding a cat, you have an animal dependent on you.  but besides food, this kitty will need shelter from the cold, wind, snow or sleet.  don't worry - building a winter shelter for outdoor cats can be both simple and inexpensive. learn to build an outdoor cat shelter here.
