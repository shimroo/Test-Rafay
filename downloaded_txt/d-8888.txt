why wvu?





    “


i am actually a fifth generation wvu student. my grandma went here and her whole family went here as well. they're from boone county, west virginia. it's an honor to carry down the tradition of being a mountaineer, because my family were all mountaineers. it's a beautiful state, i love the school and i'm honored to be a mountaineer.
