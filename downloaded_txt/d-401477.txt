historic christianity in the anglican traditionlearn more





our beliefs are based on the bible and the time-honored creeds of the church. we uphold family values and new testament morality and use the 1928 book of common prayer for our worship services.

 

with jesus christ and his sacrament of holy communion at our core, we worship god and preach the gospel in the beauty and ordered dignity of christ-centered service. we are a sacramental church, believing that god works through matter in the waters of holy baptism, in the bread and wine of the holy eucharist. he works through each of us as his body, the church.
