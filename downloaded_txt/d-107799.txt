theantipsychiatrycoalition
the antipsychiatry coalition is a nonprofit volunteer group consisting of people who feel we have been harmed by psychiatry — and of our supporters.  we created this website to warn you of the harm routinely inflicted on those who receive psychiatric "treatment" and to promote the democratic ideal of liberty for all law-abiding people that has been abandoned in the u.s.a., canada, and other supposedly democratic nations.
