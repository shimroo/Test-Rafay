at wine vault & bistro, our menus are based on whatever is fresh and seasonal and change weekly. all of our menus are multi-course and each course is paired with a different wine.  we are open for dinner only on weekends.  on weekends that we’re hosting a winemaker dinner we’re typically open saturday and sunday.  on the weekends that we’re not hosting a winemaker dinner we’re typically open on saturday only for a chef’s 5-course tasting menu.  the best way to see what’s upcoming is to sign up for our email newsletter or check our calendar frequently as dinners are typically only posted 2-3 weeks in advance.  all wines poured at any dinner are available for purchase to take home.








21 and up only please
