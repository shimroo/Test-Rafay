john’s grocery has been integral to the history of iowa city since john and erma alberhasky bought the grocery business in 1948. but the history of the building goes back a century further. in fact, the state of iowa itself is only two years older than 401 e. market street, which was built in 1848. since then the building has been a grocery store, a fire station, an apartment building, a saloon, a barbershop, and even a toiletry factory for the ernste manufacturing company. no matter what variation the building has always functioned as a service to the community. we honor that history by continuing to provide iowa city and surrounding communities with great products and service.
