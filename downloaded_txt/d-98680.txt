‚Äúbridge over troubled waters‚Äù with tasha cobbs leonard is out now!!!!!tasha is a powerhouse and it is such an honor to release this song with her. i think my favorite thing about this release is that it was recorded entirely live in studio! the recording was all one take, no fixes or anything, recording live with the band at the same time. we had so much fun making this song exactly how they would've done it in 1970 ü§óüíï go listen now wherever you stream music!
