showtime skittles





showtime skittlesyes! i have now tried the new "showtime skittles" similar to the america's "carnival skittles" but with different flavors. red:jam donut.pink:fairy floss or cotton candy.light yellow:popcorn.green:toffee apple.blue:bubble gum. i don't really like donuts or such but this small red candy rekindled my love affair with donuts.the others were quite nice and very alike to the flavors they were made of, but bubble gum did not live up to the tastiness of the others, bubble gum flavor has yet to be mastered. being a limited addition i would buy yours now to taste the fun and the flavor of carnival, so in conclusion i would give this candy a....8.
