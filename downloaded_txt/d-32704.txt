                                    why cs?
                            






students who earn a degree in computer science develop many valuable skills and depending on their interests and experiences, can market themselves to work in many different types of industry. remember that computer science is all about inventing and problem solving. a good way to think about computer scientists is that they develop the brains that actually run the computer programs people use. for example, when you search for a book online and you find the book you want and the website also tells you about similar books you might enjoy, computer scientists were the people who developed the brains for that website that give you those other recommendations based on your interests. this is just one example of the countless inventions that computer scientists develop every day.
we encourage prospective computer science students and their families to meet with a department representative before making a decision about what college to attend or program to study.  our goal is to give you a better understanding of what computer science is, explain the details of the computer science program and curriculum, and answer any questions you might have.  you will also have the opportunity to take a self-guided tour through the computer science floor to see what our labs, classrooms, and student areas are like.
we encourage you to call our student services office in advance at +1.585.475.2995.  a member of our staff will be able to assist you in setting up a one hour appointment with our manager of student services. unfortunately, we cannot accommodate same day appointments and availability during the week fills up quickly.

                                    change of program into cs
                            






if you are a current student at rit and are interested in possibly changing your current major to computer science, please review the following information. the bs curricular flowchart can be found here. 
ntid students in an associate degree program who are seeking admission to the computer science bs program should review the information and follow the process below, substituting the intent to enroll form for the change of program form.
entrance criteria
bs program

1. students must have at least a 3.0 cumulative gpa and a 3.0 gpa in technical courses (computing, math, and science if applicable).  it is expected that you have completed or are currently taking an intro sequence computer science course (ap computer science a; csci 141; if your current major requires a different introductory computing course, that course may apply) prior to applying for change of program.  computer science is not for everybody, nor does everyone find that it is what they expected it to be.  having completed a computer science course will help you confirm your interest and proficiency prior to applying for change of program.
2. students in their first term of their first year at rit may not apply for a change of program into computer science.  they must wait until they are in at least their second term to apply.
3. students in the computing exploration program must have at least a 2.0 cumulative gpa.  there is no gpa requirement for individual technical courses.
4. students who were once in computer science, then completed the college restoration program (crp), and who are now applying to re-enter computer science will have their own individualized entrance criteria, as noted on their original crp referral.

 **computer science programs are in demand across the country.  rit is no exception.  space is limited.  it is important to note that we cannot guarantee acceptance into computer science even if the above entrance criteria are met, as it will depend on the demand and on the space available in our program from term to term.  the exception to this is for computing exploration students, who are guaranteed entry if they meet their entrance requirements. applications for the cs bs program must be sent by the last day of classes in the term to lucieann condino-stollery lcsseo@rit.edu. we cannot accept any late applications or personal statements.

ms program
applicants must satisfy prerequisite requirements in mathematics (differential and integral calculus, probability and statistics, discrete mathematics, and computer science theory) and computing (experience with a modern high-level language [e.g., c++, java], data structures, software design methodology, introductory computer architecture, operating systems, and programming language concepts).  if an applicant lacks any prerequisites, bridge courses may be required to provide students with the required knowledge and skills needed for the program.

change of program process 
if you believe computer science is the right fit for you, please follow the following process: 
1. you are required to attend a change of program into cs information session.  we anticipate holding two such sessions per semester, one around week 4 or 5, and another around enrollment week. contact us (at cs-dept@rit.edu) for details on when and where the information sessions will be held, or if you are unable to attend one of the sessions.
2. meet with your assigned academic advisor from your current home program and file an official change of program application form.  your home department will sign off on the form and will send it to us for evaluation.
3. your application must also include a one-page personal statement to be submitted along with the change of program application form.  the statement should include the following information:

your name and contact information
why you are applying for change of program
your academic strengths
why you believe you will be successful in the computer science program
your professional goals and interests


applications that do not contain this personal statement will not be considered.
time frame for change of program processing:
the computer science department will process change of program requests twice per year:

applications received no later than the last day of classes for the fall semester will be considered for change of program beginning in the subsequent spring semester.
applications received no later than the last day of classes for the spring semester will be considered for change of program beginning in the subsequent fall semester (although technically the change of program will be processed beginning with the summer term.)

in each case, applications received by the deadline will be held as pending, and processed once grades for the fall (or spring) term have posted.  please send your completed documents to lucieann condino-stollery (lcsseo@rit.edu) for processing. 

 generally acceptable coursework

bs program

all coursework will be evaluated on an individual basis, however, there may be alternative courses used in place of required courses as noted below. students who do not take the typical courses required may need to learn some topics on their own in order to be fully prepared to take additional computer science courses.

1. general education coursework as well as yearone and wellness can be applied. keep in mind that computer science has specific math and science requirements.
2. in place of csci 141/142 (computer science i/ii), students may use igme 105/106 (game development and algorithmic problem solving i/ii), iste 120/121 (computational problem solving in the information domain i/ii), gcis 123/124 (software development and problem solving i/ii), cpet 121/321 (computational problem solving i/ii) (students who substitute this course sequence will be required to take an additional computer science elective).
3. in place of math 190 (discrete mathematics for computing), students may use math 200 (discrete mathematics and introduction to proofs).
4. in place of math 181/182 (project-based calculus i/ii), students may use math 171/172/173 (calculus a/b/c), math 181a/182a (calculus i/ii). 
5. students in majors that require co-op may be allowed to apply their co-op experiences to satisfy the computer science co-op requirement, but these experiences are evaluated on a case by case basis.
combined accelerated bachelors/masters degree
1. in fall 2021, rit launched an accelerated scholars program, through which some students are admitted to rit with a conditional early acceptance into a combined bs/ms dual degree program.
2. any effects that this program and the change of program process may have on each other are still being determined. contact your academic advisor if you are part of this program and have questions. 

further steps and contact information
once you have read the above information and have reviewed the curriculum flowchart for either the bs program or the ms program, if you still have questions and would like to meet with someone from computer science, you may contact an academic advisor listed below.  please note that advisors do not schedule meetings for prospective change of program students either the week before enrollment or the week of enrollment.

if you feel comfortable with this information and do not feel the need to meet with someone from computer science, then you do not have to, and can go ahead and submit your official application. you can start to plan to enroll in appropriate computer science courses for the upcoming term, but please note that computer science courses are restricted initially to students currently in the major. if your change of program application into computer science is ultimately accepted, you will be able to enroll in computer science classes once this change is processed by the institute.  if you need enrollment in csci 141 in order to satisfy entrance requirements to apply for change of program in a future semester, you may contact the manager of student services, jennifer burt (jnbvcs@rit.edu), for enrollment assistance.







                                    advanced placement & placement exams
                            






the department of computer science evaluates and awards advanced placement (ap®) credit based on the following chart:
ap credit chart for semesters
placement exams when entering rit
rit math placement exam (aleks or mpe)
the computer science program at rit requires a calculus sequence as part of your course requirements. in an effort to enable you to succeed in your college math courses, the math department has developed an on-line calculus placement test. the purpose of this exam is to assess mastery of some of the fundamental mathematical concepts that you may have seen in your high school math courses. in particular, it tests skills in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and functions, all of which are crucial to succeed in the various calculus sequences at rit. the placement exam has no effect on your gpa. it simply provides a strong recommendation to us in the cs department regarding the suitable course to begin your required mathematics sequence.

all entering students whose program requires a calculus sequence, including those who have ap credit and those who may have transfer credit, will need to take this exam online (once credit is received and processed, this may affect a student's course placement). the computer science department will not be able to register you for a math course until you have taken this exam.

failing to take this exam may affect your ability to be placed in the appropriate course at a later date because seats are limited. in addition, your financial aid may be affected if your schedule does not include the minimum number of credits (12). therefore, the placement exam will be available for your convenience online at http://mathplacementexam.rit.edu/ each year. technical support is available monday-friday, 9:00am - 4:00pm by calling 585-475-7060.
 
rit writing placement exam (wpe)
the purpose of the wpe is to determine whether students are able to be registered directly into a writing course or if they must take the basic writing course first. the wpe is a writing test in which the student is asked to write an essay of four to five paragraphs. students may have fifty (50) minutes to write the essay. students may take the wpe only once, so they should endeavor to do their best on the exam.

students do not have to take the wpe if they meet the following criteria:

- an sat verbal score of 560 or higher
- an sat essay exam score of 6 or higher
- an act english portion score of 23 or higher

the wpe is available online at http://mycourses.rit.edu only during the month of june. to access the exam, students use their rit username and password to log in to mycourses. all students were sent a postcard in may outlining the exam details.
