news



i'm currently finally at long last working on some new projects again.
the oxford handbook of improvisation in dance edited by vida l. midgelow is out in print! it includes a chapter by me. it is a groundbreaking publication that finally puts dance improvisation on the map as an area worthy of theoretical reflection and inquiry in its own right.
the special edition of french magazine sport & vie (no. 49, december 2018), "la danse, comme on n'en parle jamais", includes an interview with me. the entire issue is well worth reading. so, if you speak french, get yourself a copy before it's out of stock. you can order it online.
