success stories

johni carolyn eberlycomputer information systems, '22, overcoming community college stigma to achieve her dreams



“i always thought, i’m not going to a community college when i can go to this very
                                 well-known four-year university, but now i realize it does not matter where you go.
                                 i thought i was too big for terra state, and now i am paying for it with all my student
                                 loans.






andy moyaarchitectural construction engineering, '06, terra state was the stepping stone for future success



“one of the best parts about terra state is, that i am still using the education that
                                 i learned 20 years later in the field almost every day. i truly believe that terra
                                 state helped me achieve my goal of working in the construction and engineering field
                                 by laying down the foundation to get to where i am today.






kari steeleexecutive office administration, '17, passion for office administration leads to dream career



“terra state was one of the best decisions i have ever made. earning my degree fit
                                 my schedule, it fit my family's schedule and it allowed me to grow in a way that i
                                 would never have thought was possible. if terra state was a four-year institution,
                                 and i could receive a bachelor's degree, i would go back there in a heartbeat.






taylor snyderregistered nurse, '22, hands-on experiences lend a helping hand



“the advantage of a degree from terra state is that each student has the opportunity
                                 to move on after you get a degree, whether that be transferring to another school
                                 or using the degree you earned to find a job. since everything is so hands-on, you
                                 feel really prepared for what you are wanting to do next.






andrew stainbrooksocial work pathway, '09, found passion to become an entrepreneur at terra state



“i think just being able to know that change is going to happen whether we like it
                                 or not and we just need to be able to adjust to that change. it sure does make a big
                                 difference when you have a great support system like terra state.






megan johansenpre-mortuary science, '19, terra state’s first last responder



“the most appealing part to me was knowing if i passed and graduated from the college
                                 under the mortuary science pathway that i would automatically have a seat at ccms.
