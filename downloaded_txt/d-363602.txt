history

exceptional style
















a setting for all occasions
white sails above the entrance to the hampton roads convention center provide a visual reminder of the first settlers to reach this area by sea over 400 years ago. today’s visitors to this impressive facility travel here for a variety of purposes; to share ideas, compete in athletic competitions, and introduce new products, just to name a few, in surroundings as inspirational as they are functional.
a model of flexibility, the center’s 344,000 square feet and 35 event spaces contain three exhibit halls, a multi-configurable grand ballroom, a conference center with private access and an enormous amount of pre-function area.
