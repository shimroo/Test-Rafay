are radar jammers legal?
we are often asked whether it is legal to build radar jammers that disable the police speed measurement radar systems. is such a device even possible? radar jammers have been used in the military ever since radar came into wide use. the purpose was to protect aircraft from enemy targeting systems. radar used in the warfare industry was very accurate and could be used on cannons to target and shoot down enemy aircraft. if one could disable these systems, friendly aircraft could be protected. in later years radar was used to accurately track aircraft around airports to improve air travel safety.
speed limits
as more and more automobiles started using the nation’s highways, the concern for driver safety promulgated the need driving rules and limits. to enforce speed limits doppler radar systems were developed and sold to police departments. naturally, drivers were not happy about being forced to obey arbitrary (in their opinion) speed limits. when the municipalities started assessing fines for the speeders the ‘war’ began. many drivers felt that the use of radar to get a vehicle speed was a violation of privacy and there were even a few court battles over that view â the courts usually sided with the cities.
radar detectors
meanwhile, cities quickly learned that radar could be used to fund their police departments and help them balance their budgets. during the 1960’s radar detectors were developed to give the driver advanced warning when police were operating speed detection radars. as detectors became more effective the industry developed more radar bands, then more technology-driven ways to avoid detection and maintain the income stream.
the detector industry responded with ever increasingly capable detectors to combat this technology explosion. with the use of ‘instant-on’ radar, however, detectors were relegated to a backup position. after all, they could not react to a signal that was not there. when the officer triggered the instant-on pulse, the car was already too close to take corrective action. therefore the need for radar jammers arose. 
police radar jammers
basically, radar jammers are devices designed to block or interfere with the proper operation of a radar transmitter. car radar jammers specifically target the doppler radar systems used by police officers to measure the automobile’s speed. police radar jammers are usually transmitters very similar to the radar system they are designed to block. they generate a radio frequency signal very close to the police radar frequency and try to overpower or confuse the radar. the radar jammer then emits that signal in the direction of the police radar to try to keep it from getting an accurate speed reading.
the two most popular techniques for police radar jammers are amplitude modulation and frequency modulation.
 







how to make a car invisible to police radar?

police speed radar guns work by using doppler radar technology. the device sends out a radio wave at a certain frequency towards a moving vehicle, the frequency of the wave is altered due to the doppler effect. the change in frequency depends on the speed... continue reading. 

how to make a car invisible to police lidar?

police laser guns, commonly known as lidar (light detection and ranging), work on the principle of time-of-flight to measure a vehicle's speed. unlike radar guns that use radio waves, lidar relies on light in the form of a narrow, focused laser beam... continue reading.
