foods causing depressions and sleeplessness





in short
when you consume too little fat, cholesterol or sugars, your body punishes you with depressions and / or
sleeplessness, through receptors in the brain, to force you to consume more of these essential nutrients.
elevated blood-protein levels impair neurotransmitter metabolism regulating sleep and feelings of happiness. beta-carbolines from prepared food
(proteinacous prepared food in particular), opioid peptides from wheat- and dairy products and cadmium from vegetables and
grains do exactly the same.

to be happy and sleep well : consume as little (especially at night) prepared food, vegetables, grains, milk and
wheat-products. (you don't need these at all ;see waisays.
wake up when the sun rises, and eat as much fruits as you want and sufficient fresh raw egg yolk (mixed
with avocado) or fresh raw salmon. (raw animal food requires an hour rest to digest by the way!)

great 'happy fruits' are : dried date, -fig, papaya, banana, strawberries, sweet cherries, orange, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and
hazelnuts. (for optimizing serotonine production)

diet suggestions



in detail :
 
  

sleep is essential to reconstruct lost body-protein
and to decompose and deport wastes from the body. also, when you are asleep,
body-fat is transformed into available energy, to support the processes
mentioned above. 

if you want to be beautiful and slim, you need lots of sleep

cholesterol
being happy is much more
than just a feeling. feelings of happiness / depressions tell you whether your
diet is okay. and if you dont sleep well, again you have to take a look at
your diet first.
for example :cholesterol
is an essential nutrient ; 10 to 20% of the brain is composed of cholesterol,
and vitamin d and the sex hormones are also composed of cholesterol. that's why
the body needs sufficient cholesterol all the time.  

and to make sure you consume sufficient 'clean' cholesterol
, your body warns you if you don't; through causing depressions and mood-swings. (1) a number of
scientific investigations have proved that in people trying to commit suicide,
cholesterol-level is lower. (2)
 
but how does that happen?
cholesterol-products like
progesterone, estradiol and testosterone increase serotonine-receptor
activity. (3) low cholesterol level decreases serotonine-receptor
activity. (4)
and feeling happy is partly
regulated through serotonine-receptors in the brain. (5) serotonine is a
neurotransmitter not just regulating feelings of happiness, but also the
ability to fall asleep, and partly influences cognitive abilities, pain, fear
and appetite. (6) 
fibers in wheat (7), potato,
maize (8), oat, rice (9), pea and soybean (10) inhibit
cholesterol absorption, what can make you depressed and sleepless. 
logically, bad-functioning ovaries
(producing progesterone and estradiol) can also cause depressions.
to make sure you absorb sufficient
cholesterol, consume some fresh raw egg yolk every day (mixed with avocado for
example) ; it will make you sleep like a baby. be sure the eggs are fresh and
obtained from hens fed natural foods only (like raw grains and grass).
you can also consume sashimi. (fresh
raw fish in japanese restaurants)
 
 
does only a low
cholesterol level cause depressions and sleeplessness ?
 
no ;
 
 
 
sugars
sugar for example is as essential as
cholesterol is ; sugars are the main source of energy for the brain and muscles;
dietary sugars (sucrose, starch, and even most fructose) are mainly transformed
into glucose. to assure sufficient sugars are consumed, glucose is essential in
composing serotonine, the happy-maker' ;
 
serotonine is composed of
tryptophan, an amino acid. (protein commonly is composed of 18 different amino
acids) when blood-glucose level is low, muscles and organs do not absorb amino
acids from the blood for maintenance. and among all those other amino acids, it
is much harder for the brain to pick up tryptophan. glucose stimulates amino
acid absorption by the muscles and organs, and therefore tryptophan absorption
by the brain. (11) the sweet taste of sugar and honey is the promise of
happiness. (and sleep) 
 
fat is as essential as
cholesterol and sugars are ; fats are the main source of energy for the heart
and the colon. to assure sufficient fat is consumed, a particular fatty acid,
oleamide, is required to activate serotonine receptors. making oleamide, and
therefore fat, essential to fall a sleep. (12)
if you wake up in the middle of the
night for no reason ; consume something both fat and sweet, like raisins with
butter. it will probably make you sleep like a baby.
 
 
so it's all about
cholesterol, fat and sugar ?
 
not entirely ;
 
 
 
too much protein
but yes, being grumpy, you first
need to make sure your diet contains sufficient clean cholesterol, -fat and
sugars. however,
consuming too little essential nutrients is not the only cause ; 
consuming too much proteinous
food in general, can also cause depressions and sleeplessness. here are the
reasons why ;
 
-    to
transform tryptophan into serotonine, vitamin b6 is required.
     consuming more protein than you need,
requires extra vitamin b6
     (and b2 and folic acid). consuming too much
proteinous food
    
inhibits serotonine production.
-    consuming
too much increases blood-amino acid levels, making  
     
it harder for the rain to
specifically pick up tryptophan. 
     the amino acid phenylalanine
inhibits serotonine production,
      through inhibiting decarboxylation of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophane
into
    
serotonine.
-    consuming
too much protein increases blood-phenylalanine level. 
     the amino acid phenylalanine
inhibits serotonine production,
      through inhibiting decarboxylation of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophane
into
    
serotonine.
-    consuming
too much protein increases blood-leucine level. the
     amino acid leucine enhances
tryptophan-pyrrolase, irreversibly
     decomposing tryptophan.
unfortunately, the liver cannot   
    
decompose leucine, tissues like muscles can.
-    prepared food contains lots of
beta-carbolines (13) inhibiting tryptophan transport by albumin. (14)
free tryptophan not transported by albumin does not reach the brain ,and is
decomposed. especially consuming prepared proteinous food can make you
depressed and sleepless.
-    besides methionine (an other amino acid)
,tryptophan is easily damaged by heat. every time food is re-heated, tryptophan
gets lost.  
-   
beta-carbolines from prepared food can
occupy serotonine receptors (15), because many beta-carbolines are
composed of tryptophan (or its amines ; serotonine and tryptamine) ; the basic
properties are equal.
-   
beta-carbolines from prepared food can
directly disturb sleep through blocking benzodiazepine receptors. (16)
-   beta-carbolines
from prepared food can also disturb sleep  by
    
 causing stress through the noradrenergic system. (17) 
 
consume as much fruit,
and sashimi or fresh raw egg yolk (gently stirred through a fruit shake for
example), instead of prepared food. and especially do not consume prepared food
at night, to prevent prolonged digestion to impair sleep.
 
 
 
and
waking up late can make you depressed
and sleepless too ;
 
-    your
body is strongly influenced by daylight ; when the sun has
    
set, serotonine is transformed
into melatonine. when the sun
    
rises,
this process stops, if not asleep.
     that's
why everybody is much more happy in the summertime,
     providing us with much more
daylight. (18) if you are depressed or
     sleepless ; wake up when the sun rises.
     optimum
melatonine production requires optimum serotonine
     production. logically, also impaired melatonine
production comes
     with depressions and sleeplessness. (19)        
     optimum
melatonine metabolism also prevents prolactine,
     oestradiol and egf from causing breast cancer. (20)
 
 
consuming vegetables and
grains
can also make you depressed and sleepless ;
 
-    even a low intake of cadmium decreases
serotonine level. (21) grains and vegetables in particular can contain
high levels of cadmium (from phosphate fertilizers). that's why 'health freaks'
consuming lots of vegetables and grains very often are not exactly 'shiny happy
people'. what we nowadays consider a normal intake of cadmium, is already 50%
of maximally admitted amounts. (22) you're not a cow, nor a pigeon; you
don't need any grains or vegetables at all. fruits and some animal foods
combined contains all the nutrients you need. (see site3)
 
 
consuming wheat- and /
or dairy products can also make you sleepless and depressed.
 
-    endorphins are opioid peptides made by the
body. the anesthetic effects of endorphins is required to make you fall asleep.
damaged (due to heat) wheat-
and milk-opioid peptides can occupy
and destroy endorphin receptors in the brain. 
     therefore
endorphins cannot bind to their receptors, what impairs 

     falling asleep.
endorphin- and serotonine-metabolism are closely related, and opioid peptides can directly
inhibit serotonine release. (23) therefore, besides sleeplessness,
opioid peptides can also cause depressions. in chronically depressed people,
free endorphin level is 3 fold higher (24) (because part of endorphin
receptors have been destroyed)
 
 
 
long-term hormonal
contraceptive use can make you depressed and sleepless too.
 
-    hormonal contraceptives act through
dominating production and secretion of hormones by the body. it is very
possible that after menopause adrenal gland estrogen production does not recover from being
diminished through long-term contraceptive use. while estrogen (and other
hormones) enhances serotonine-receptor activity. (3)
-    oral contraceptive use increases cortisol
level, increasing transformation of tryptophan into xanthurenic acid, kynurenine
and hydroxykynurenine. (25) therefore less tryptophan can be transformed
into serotonine.
 
 
use of antibiotics
can cause sleeplessness too. (26)
 
-    bacteria in the colon produce factor s,
inducing long-wave sleep. (27) antibiotics kill both bacteria causing
diseases and bacteria producing factor s. antibiotics should only be used in an
emergency situation.
 
 
too little vitamin b3
enhances serotonine deficiency.
 
-    vitamin b3 deficiency commonly comes with
serotonine deficiency, for both substances are composed of tryptophan. if
sufficient b3 is available, no tryptophan needs to be transformed into b3,
leaving more tryptophan to be transformed into serotonine. like meat and nuts,
raw salmon, -tuna and -mackerel are loaded with b3. 
    
happy-
and sleepy foods improve both serotonine- and vitamin b3 production. 
 
 
 
 
'happy-' and
'sleepy-food' 
the body actually doesnt need much
tryptophan to compose serotonine. and yet you can consume lots of protein
containing lots of tryptophan, with serotonine production remaining far too
low. simply because protein also contains amino acids inhibiting serotonine
production, like leucine and phenylalanine in particular. optimizing serotonine
metabolism therefore is not about consuming protein high in tryptophan,
but about consuming protein containing relatively more tryptophan than leucine
and phenylalanine. consuming such proteins improves serotonine metabolism,
allowing you to feel happy, and sleep well.
 

 

great 'happy- and 'sleepy-foods
are fruits like dried dates, -figs, papaya, banana, strawberries, sweet
cherries, orange, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and hazelnuts, combined with
fresh raw egg yolk (because of the cholesterol), alternated with fresh raw
salmon (because of the vitamin b3).
of course the best 'happy-foods' are
easy to digest and should be consumed raw.
mushrooms and potato crisps  are best
happy-munch-food (crisps combine well with egg yolk and avocado), but
consuming mushrooms can cause cramps.
 
 
 

why are these foods 'happy-' and
'sleepy-foods' ?

 
because these foods are high in
tryptophan and low in leucine and phenylalanine. (and contain cholesterol, fats
and sugars when combined)
to know what foods can improve your
sleep and happiness, you have to look at their spf. spf = serotonine-production
factor = tryptophan / (phenylalanine + leucine). 
for example : if the spf of a
certain food-protein is 50%, this protein contains exactly as much tryptophan
as the average of phenylalanine and leucine, strongly improving serotonine
production. all foods with a spf below 10%, more or less inhibit serotonine
production. whether these low-spf foods actually do inhibit serotonine
production, depends on how much protein they contain.
to enhance serotonine production,
you should consume as little low-spf foods, especially when high in
protein. (avocado isnt) so, consuming corn flakes for breakfast, bread
for lunch, and pasta with lobster or horsemeat for dinner, is an extremely
bad idea ;

warning : besides tryptophan,
happy foods like papaya, banana and pineapple also contain lots of
serotonine, which you cannot utilize as serotonine in the brain. if you are not
used to eating much of theses fruits, your body needs time to produce more
enzymes decomposing the serotonine from these fruits. so, if you are not used
to eating much of these fruits, increase consumption gradually to enable enzyme
production keeping up with serotonine consumption. if you dont, exogenous
serotonine is not decomposed sufficiently, and can harden heart-muscles,
causing mild heart pains.
