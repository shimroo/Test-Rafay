5 starsvery impressive! lots of old-school charm in a clean, comfortable, clubby, great way. excellent service and excellent steaks cooked to *perfection*. top-shelf mac & cheese, too. i hope they never lose the authentic wood-burning fireplace, dinner carts, and classy decor. if you love abe & louie's, morton's, del frisco, and g23 you should do yourself a favor and spend a night here in brighton for a change - you will not be disappointed! ps extra props to our waiter walter who took exceptional care of us this week- thank you!jason karle visited on 2024-12-08
