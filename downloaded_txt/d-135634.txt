who we are


we work to ensure that all wild animals, whether living in captivity or in the wild, are treated with compassion and respect and are able to live their lives according to their needs.
not only does our conservation work occur in communities, classrooms, courtrooms, and the halls of congress, we also operate one of the largest primate sanctuaries in the u.s.

our primate sanctuary
at born free usa's primate sanctuary – one of the largest in the united states – our mission is to provide monkeys as high a quality of life as we can. the 175-acre sanctuary, located in south texas, provides a safe, permanent home to hundreds of monkeys, many rescued from abuse in roadside zoos or as pets in private homes or retired from animal experimentation.

meet the monkeys
