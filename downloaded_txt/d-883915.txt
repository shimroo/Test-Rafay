my creative playgroundnow that i am happily 'retired' i have time for interesting, challenging, exciting creative pursuits.  since most of them involve at least some connection with the internet, the name 'netscapades' (escapades on the 'net) works. imagine ceremoniesmy current focus is on providing non-religious weddings and other ceremonies as a humanist officiant (certified by humanist canada and licensed by the province of ontario.)  from grand galas to woodland elopements, each ceremony reflects the unique personalities of the participants.
