updates for summer 2025




     


established in 1941, wabanna camp and retreat center is a non-profit, non-denominational christian ministry located in edgewater, maryland, on a 23-acre point where the rhode and west rivers converge into the chesapeake bay. wabanna’s ministry encompasses two primary methods of outreach: a summer residential and day camp for boys and girls and a retreat center ministry which operates through the fall, winter, and spring. throughout the years, wabanna has sought to glorify the lord by using all facets of its ministry to point to the saving love of jesus christ and to proclaim the truth of god’s perfect word.
