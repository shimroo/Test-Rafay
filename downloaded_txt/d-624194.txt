  welcome to admiral marine 




admiral marine inc.
admiral marine inc. represents various feeder steamship lines operating from ports in europe to africa, baltics and black sea.
we have reversed the traditional shipping concept by using transatlantic lines as the âfeederâ carriers and then transship the cargo on the vessels of our respective principals to the final destination ports. this concept allows admiral to communicate directly with the discharge ports/overseas agencies and allows us to have more control over the cargo.
quality customer care, extensive cargo solutions, and innovative shipping services, make admiral marine your best choice in the industry. contact us today.
