reminiscences and a 
            final goodbye

week of october 17, 2005




            
            "from researching the major news media on the topics i've covered 
            over the years i have learned that all the world's problems  war, 
            famine, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, avian flu  have 
            one of only two causes:  global warming or president bush.  i wish 
            i'd figured it out a long time ago; could have saved a lot of 
            fact-checking time."

evolution:  so 
            many scientists, so few einsteins

week of october 10, 2005




            
            "completely lost was the fact that science and religion, properly 
            practiced, seek the same thing:  truth.  i have no idea why a truly 
            dedicated scientist would waste time defending a falsity any more 
            than a devout worshiper would wish to serve a god who doesn't 
            exist.  shouldn't both want truth, wherever it leads?"

victims

week of october 3, 2005




                        "as the social worker on duty my wife would have had to 
            locate and notify the families of both the woman and the dying 
            3-year-old.  she would have seen their injuries.  she would have 
            comforted the families and prayed with them.  she would have helped 
            as much as anyone could.  i know, truly know, she would have been a 
            rock."

gizmos galore

week of september 26, 2005




                        "most of my gizmos are tools of some sort.  the best of 
            these is a pressure washer that could strip the bark and first few 
            rings off a redwood.  when i first brought it home i washed 
            everything that stood still and a few things that didnt:  the deck, 
            driveway, sidewalks, garbage cans, yard furniture, cocker spaniel   
            ok, i let the dog pass even if he is the main reason everything else 
            needed cleaning."

katrina in progress

week of september 19, 2005




                        "i, for one, admit to being sucked in by grim reports of 
            massive death.  ten thousand at least, we were told.  discovering 
            who first threw out that number is like trying to find the inventor 
            of the wheel but it quickly became an article of faith."

the battle of new 
            orleans:

the good, the bad, 
            and the ugly

week of september 5, 2005




 







why, mr. mayor?



                        "in a disaster of this unimaginable scope, failures are 
            inevitable at all levels.  there will be plenty of blame to go 
            around when theres time for it but in a less decent country this 
            hateful nonsense might have brought volunteers and donations to a 
            halt.  fortunately, a nation is greater than the sum of its 
            politicians."

and another flaming 
            cat

week of august 29, 2005




            
            "associated press reports an increasing number of infants are being 
            prevented from boarding airplanes because their names are the same 
            or similar to those on the anti-terror 'no fly' list.  'i know they 
            have to be careful, but come on, he's a baby for pete's sake,' said 
            the father of 6-month-old carlos the 
            jackal anderson.  ok, i made that up, but a little common sense 
            shouldnt hurt national security too much."

atheists get 
            religion:

court ruling a head-scratcher

week of august 22, 2005




                        "i would like to welcome my atheist brothers and sisters 
            to the fold.  yes, you too may now shut up.  oh you can still 
            speak, as long as you're careful about saying why.  bye-bye to legal 
            abortion, which could not exist without the now-religious idea that 
            there is no soul.  forget federal funding of embryonic stem cell 
            experiments, which treats human embryos as if they are of no more 
            eternal value than rats."

cindy sheehan and the 
            rolling stones 

week of august 15, 2005




                        "what happened?  it's simple: media that didnt give two 
            hoots about cindy sheehan or her son when she supported the 
            president are giving her the rock star treatment now that  and 
            because  she doesnt."

how men hear women

week of august 8, 2005




                        "(conversely), men process male voices in a more 
            primitive part of the brain that is usually used for choosing between cheesy nachos and extra 
            cheesy nachos.  the research did not address how women analyze a 
            man's voice but i suspect they mainly hear it as a series of grunts 
            and clicks."
