"i quickly realized that the solid foundation and values i had within wellstar did not carryout with other healthcare facilities. overall, the decision to return back to wellstar was the right call." 

- roxanne, bsn, rn, admission care coordinator










"as a previous wellstar employee, i am so excited to be returning 'home'. after working for other health systems, i believe wellstar makes not only its patients' health and safety a top priority but it's employees also. this is especially important as we navigate our way through covid-19." 

- ashlan, rn
