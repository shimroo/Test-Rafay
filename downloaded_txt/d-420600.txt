angry scalia doma dissent quote of the day 










angry scalia quote of the day


“it is one thing for a society to elect change; it is another for a 
court of law to impose change by adjudging those who oppose it hostes humani generis, enemies of the human race.

when the court declared a constitutional right to homosexual sodomy, we
 were assured that the case had nothing, nothing at all to do with 
‘whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship
 that homosexual persons seek to enter.’ now we are told 
that doma is invalid because it ‘demeans the couple, whose moral and 
sexual choices the constitution protects,’ ante, at 23 — with an 
accompanying citation of lawrence.”

 -- justice antonin scalia
