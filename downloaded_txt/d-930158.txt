janitorial 
          bidding secrets
 precision 
          pricing methods for increased 
          sales and profit

 
clean-pro industries announces a major breakthrough in commercial 
            janitorial service bidding. 
did you know that there are ten methods for accurately and profitably 
            bidding janitorial services?  
most contractors have only used one, two, or three methods at the 
            most.  very few have even heard of four methods, and never before 
            has anyone revealed ten methods of bidding.  
clean-pro industries, inc. announces the release of its new book 
            entitled janitorial bidding secrets: precision pricing methods 
            for increased sales and profit.
