      lauren’s hope reinvented medical alert jewelry in 2001. over the last 20 years, we’ve perfected 
      the art of conveying your personal medical info to first responders through stylish 
      medical alert bracelets, 
      medical id necklaces and 
      medical dog tags. wearing your medical information 
      is a great way to alert others with your details which can help prevent an event from turning into a life-threatening emergency.
    

      first responders are trained to check your wrist and neck for medical alert jewelry. all of our medical id designs 
      incorporate the medical caduceus symbol which is easily recognized. this symbol is what alerts first responders to your 
      custom engraved emergency id. engraving the details that are relevant to your personal medical status is what matters most
      when choosing which pieces you want to own. our medical id tags hold up to 6 lines of 
      engraving with 25 characters per line allowing you to inscribe what matters most.
    

      you can read our engraving guide for more information about what to engrave.
    

      we offer medical id jewelry that suits every lifestyle. our range includes durable 24/7 waterproof medical alert necklaces 
      and bracelets, stylish and on-trend medical id jewelry as well as a full line of med id bracelets that are designed to help 
      those who have trouble putting jewelry on and off by themselves.
    

      lauren’s hope is located in america’s heartland and available to answer any questions you may have. each piece comes 
      with a one year warranty, and resize service if needed. our hope is that anyone who needs to wear a medical alert bracelet 
      finds the one that makes them feel safe and comfortable everyday. we believe that the best medical id is the one you want to wear.
    


what medical alert jewelry is right for me?

what is medic alert jewelry?
what is the best medical alert bracelet to buy?
what style of alert jewelry is right for me? 


medical alerts are bracelets and necklaces marked with a medical caduceus or staff of life symbol, which indicates the presence of medical information. 95% of first responders check the neck and wrist for medic alert jewelry, which can include pendant or dog tag necklaces as well as a variety of bracelet types, such as hypoallergenic cuffs, classic med id chains, stretch styles, silicone med alert bands, and more. 
the best medical id bracelet is one you like and will wear daily. here are a few other things to consider when shopping for the best medic alert bracelet:

• how much engraving space do you need? our interchangeable styles have some of the largest engraving allowances.
• will you wear your medical alert bracelet around the clock? if so, look for a stainless steel or silicone medical alert band for water-friendly, 24/7 daily wear.
• will your information change? interchangeable med ids allow you to replace your medical alert tag without replacing all of your bracelets.


deciding on a style of medical alert jewelry will help you narrow down your choices. consider who will be wearing this medical alert. are they:

• stylish, fashion-forward: consider an interchangeable medical alert bracelet. made of a bracelet strand and medical alert tag, both pieces can be mixed and matched with others, allowing for a fresh look every day.
• active and sporty: silicone and stainless steel med alerts are best for highly active individuals who want to wear their med alerts during outdoor, water, and sports activities.
• young and growing: kids who like their medical alerts are much more likely to wear them. help your child choose a med alert by visiting our boys’ and girls’ sections.
