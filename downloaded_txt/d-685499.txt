bcs is preparing students to engage the culture in winsome, articulate, and christ-honoring ways for the glory of god and the good of the world. 



since 1983, byne christian school (bcs) has provided families with a christ-centered education. in 2018, bcs began a transition to classical christian, equipping students to navigate a changing culture. now, with a traditional 5-day, a hybrid 3-day, and an à la carte program, there are flexible and affordable options to suit every family! 

byne school preview
























uniquely classical.



a classical, christ-centered education is more concerned with formation than information, with teaching children to love the good, true, and beautiful rather than simply knowing facts. it equips students with the most important tools of learning: the ability to read, memorize, understand, think, reason, write persuasively, and speak eloquently. classical methodology is built upon the three stages of the trivium: grammar (gaining knowledge), logic (discovering truth), and rhetoric (defending the truth).















distinctly christian.



distinctly christian -  byne christian school assists christian parents with the spiritual formation of their children and equips students with skills that last a lifetime. in addition to learning truth, students develop a love for the beautiful and are equipped to live a life of goodness unto the lord. bible is not just a separate subject – rather, the word of god is the center of everything we do and teach.

what parents are saying









god is in every aspect of the learning process here. the christian environment, faith-based curriculum, small classes, and awesome teachers make byne the school to beat. there is no other school for my child.






to have my children in byne christian school where there are small classes, excellent teachers, and impressive security is rewarding. to have all the above along with an atmosphere and leadership in which the education of children is for god is to me the most important and priceless education on earth. byne christian school is awesome!






in order to build a strong foundation, we wanted our children to have the best opportunity at higher education with christ being the center.




























































student life is abundant life.



students experience robust student life through teams, clubs, and special events.
