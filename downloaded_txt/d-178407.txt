welcome to…north wilkesboro


welcome to north wilkesboro, north carolina. located in the foothills of the blue ridge mountains, north wilkesboro was founded when norfolk southern built its terminus railroad depot near the banks of the yadkin river. the depot still stands in the heart of downtown, and we have been the key city to western north carolina since our town started in 1891.our history is remarkably unique when compared to other towns in the foothills of western nc. textiles and furniture factories fueled our early growth, while bootlegging laid the groundwork for the start of modern-day racing. that industrious heritage is the foundation of the values we still hold today - we are hardworking, fiercely independent, and our focus on family, faith, and resourcefulness binds us together.
