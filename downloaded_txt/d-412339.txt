ecological paint is friendly 
            to the environment, adults, and children, and pets. it also performs 
            well during and after application. its netonian rheology allows exceptional 
            flow and leveling qualities with virtually no sag and is splatter 
            free. it is a one coat and fast drying paint. (can vary with color 
            and atmospheric conditions). when ecological paint is fully cured, 
            it has enviable performance with "hideriffic" technology, durability, 
            strong adhesion, excellent weather-ability, and exceptional scrub 
            resistance. ecological paint is an excellent choice for most painting 
            situations including interior dry wall, plaster, concrete, and most 
            masonry surfaces. it can also be used to cover properly primed wood 
            and metal and is ideal for commercial, residential, and institutional 
            applications.
