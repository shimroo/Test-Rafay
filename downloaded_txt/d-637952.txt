 *we process all of the uk sugar beet crop. to meet demand, we use sugar from eu and non-eu countries in addition to the sugar we refine from the british crop.







making sugar in
the uk everyday
in the uk, sugar beet is grown in east anglia and the east midlands. sown in the spring to grow through the summer, the harvested crop is processed at one of our four advanced manufacturing plants in bury st edmunds, cantley, newark and wissington. to meet demand, we also use sugar from eu and non-eu countries.

our approach to sustainability
our sustainability framework is about setting local priorities and programmes to meet demands on the ground and create long-term stakeholder value across economic, social and environmental pillars. this creates a beet sugar value chain that enables us to build rural economies and create thriving, healthy communities, whilst using our resources responsibly.
our approach to sustainability





making sense of sugar
our 'making sense of sugar' campaign was launched in 2014 to help inform and educate people about sugar and the role it can play as part of a healthy balanced diet. our aim is to provide information based on robust science for everyone, so that we can all make informed choices about what we choose to consume.
