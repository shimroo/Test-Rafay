ems pilot career change questions
monday, february 17, 2025
here is a good resource for you that will answer quite a few of your questions.  https://justhelicopters.com/career-development/pilot-ebooks


ems pilot career change questions
friday, february 14, 2025
hello everyone,
 


	not to give tmi, however its kind of relevant to my questions. i am 30 years old and i currently make about six figures in sales at a work from home job, and me and my wife are thinking about adding a little one soon. my sales help people and i like what i sell, but i want something more steady, more direct in helping the community, and kinesthetically demanding. i have just started looking into this career and i love the "idea" of it, yall are basically super heroes. there are just some questions that id like some updated information on, because a lot of the information i am finding has aged a bit. 
 


	 1. i am 30, i realize that getting to 2,000 hours and a cfi & cfii certification can take me well into my 30s. is that too late? is there a specific thing that i can do to accelerate this, but still have the skills to be a dependable pilot?
 


	2. i am looking to make a lateral move in salary. i like my life financially and honestly the first time i've been here and i am scared of changing career's and losing that. is this usually a six figure job? i see some people that say it is and some people that say it isn't so i am just seeing what current people in the profession make, round about of course. the job description is epic, so i think it would be a no brainer, but you never know.
 


	3. i know a lot of ems pilots work on 7-days on and 7-days on. do you usually find that you accrue vacation time on top of that? like if i wanted to take 2-3 weeks off for a family vacation, is that possible since you already get so much time off?
 


	4. are helicopter pilots in high demand still? i know they were a few years ago, but things can change very quickly. i am currently in houston, honestly i'd like to stay here, but beggars cant be choosers. so, what do you find the current job market is like?
 


	5. also, a big one. what is life like getting from 200 hours to 2,000 hours. is it job flights, do you have to pay for flight time? how do you even get there when you have the bare minimum experience?
 


	6. last one i promise. do you think i can keep my 9-5 while i take this journey? its pretty flexible and i am actually finishing my bachelors now and working full time so they are pretty accommodating, but will that be enough in your opinion?

bell 206/505 for tall people?
friday, february 14, 2025
at 6’7” (202 cm), cockpit space is definitely something to consider, especially when transitioning to bell or airbus helicopters. 
 


	if the bell 505 is within budget, go for it. it’s way more comfortable for your height than the 206 or r44, and it’s a modern training platform. if cost is the biggest factor, try to sit in a 206 first before committing, it’s a step up from the r44, but might not be enough. hope that helps


am i competitive for the sep 2024 board
thursday, february 13, 2025
hello dylan312 
 


	i'm ros rity i'm also putting together a strong warrant officer packet to be an aviator.
 


	but the only thing i'm missing so far has been getting any letter of recommendations! i was wondering how you managed to get so many? and even one from a cw5, please tell me any details that might help me even in the slightest, what websites or forums, or if you chased them down through other connections.
 


	or if you even can ask the other chiefs if its ok if i emailed or got in touch with them for an interview. that would be a tremendous help!
 


	so far getting an lor has been the hardest part for me and nobody talks about it enough.
 


	i apologize for not being of any help to your original post.
 


	thanks for your consideration,

whats it like working in chile


warrant officer flight training
wednesday, february 12, 2025
hi, i am new here, never posted on a forum before, but i wanted to ask some questions about the woft process, especially letters of recommendation. i do not come from a military family, i do not live nearby any large military bases, as such i don't really know much of anyone in the military. it is a bit of a problem for my chances of putting together a good packet for woft. however i do have family members that work with military members every day, my uncle works at several defense contractors in fairly high up positions and knows many people in the navy, going all the way up to admirals, as well as senators. both of my parents work at a government contractor that works with the air/space forces, and subsequently know a few people as well, including a general, but only on a professional basis. i do not know any of these people personally, but if i discount them and rely on people i've known for years, i'm not left with much. 
 


	so my question is this, how much does the length of time you've known the people writing these letters matter? i am worried that if i submit a packet filled exclusively with acquaintances then i'll basically be rejected on the spot, but i am not sure if i have much of a choice. thanks.


schweizer 300cbi starter electronics issue
sunday, february 9, 2025
i posted this in the manufacturers forum.  not sure where it would be best. 
 


	
 


	i recently blew out my starter and the solenoid seemed to be welded closed.  so we replaced both the starter and the solenoid.  i worked once.  but when i went to start it up the other day.  the solenoid seems to have welded itself in the on position and i had to shut off the battery.   fortunately the engine didn't start so i didn't blow the starter again.  but the solenoid is toast again.   i think whatever is causing that might be the issue.   
 


	i haven't replaced the "varistor".  i am not sure what that does but could a bad varistor cause this problem?   the button on the collective switch goes in and out per normal.  that switch has not been taken apart yet.  i will probably order a new varistor and solenoid. 
 


	does anyone know what the problem could be?   has anyone ever had this issue and solved it before?   
 


	does anybody have an electrical schematic covering the starter wiring?   i haven't been able to locate one yet. 
 


	any thoughts on this would be appreciated.
