traffic school in florida and how it works

              technology today makes driver safety and traffic education easy and better than ever.
            

              florida has 67 different counties and they all have different rules - be sure to follow them! generally speaking, you have 30 days from the date you receive the ticket to elect the traffic school option. you'll still need to pay the election fee to the court (and sometimes an affidavit for eligibility) and then you'll be give extra time to submit a certificate of completion to show that you successfully finished a class.

 complete the course on your schedule and get a certificate of completion.
 submit your certificate to the court where you paid the ticket.








the best reasons to elect a traffic school course in florida.

              electing to take a basic driver improvement (bdi) course in florida can have several benefits. here are four of the best reasons to consider taking a bdi course:
            

 avoiding points on your driving record: one of the primary reasons to take a bdi course is to avoid having points assessed on your driving record. when you receive a traffic citation for a moving violation and elect to take a bdi course, you can prevent points from being added to your driving record. this can help maintain your insurance rates and reduce the risk of your license being suspended if you accumulate too many points.
 insurance discounts: completing a bdi course in florida may make you eligible for an insurance discount. many insurance providers offer discounts to drivers who voluntarily complete defensive driving courses because they are seen as lower-risk drivers. contact your insurance company to find out if they offer such discounts and how much you can save.
 fulfilling court requirements: in some cases, a court may require you to complete a bdi course as part of your sentence for a traffic violation. by completing the course, you fulfill this requirement and may avoid more severe penalties, such as fines, probation, or even jail time.
 improving your driving skills: bdi courses are designed to enhance your knowledge of traffic laws, safe driving practices, and defensive driving techniques. even if you haven't received a traffic citation, taking a bdi course can refresh your knowledge and improve your skills, making you a safer and more responsible driver.


              it's important to note that the specific benefits of taking a bdi course may vary depending on your individual circumstances and the nature of your traffic violation. before electing to take a bdi course, you may want to check with the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles (dhsmv) or the court handling your case to ensure that it is a viable option and that it will meet your needs. additionally, you must complete the course within the allotted timeframe and follow any other requirements imposed by the court or the dhsmv to receive these benefits.

florida's easiest online traffic school
completing our traffic school course online offers several conveniences and advantages compared to traditional in-person classes. here are some of the key benefits:
  flexibility: online traffic school allows you to study at your own pace and on your own schedule. you can choose when and where to access the course material, making it convenient for people with busy lifestyles or irregular work hours. this flexibility is particularly helpful for those who have other commitments, such as work, school, or family responsibilities.
accessibility: online traffic school courses are accessible from any location with an internet connection. you can study from the comfort of your home, a coffee shop, a library, or any place that suits you. this eliminates the need for commuting to a physical classroom, saving you time and transportation costs.
24/7 availability: online courses are available 24/7, allowing you to log in and study whenever it's most convenient for you. this means you can fit your coursework around your daily activities, including evenings and weekends.
self-paced learning: our online traffic school allows you to progress through the material at your own pace. if you understand a particular topic quickly, you can move on to the next section. conversely, if you need more time to grasp a concept, you can take as much time as necessary without feeling rushed.
interactive content: our online traffic school course incorporates multimedia elements such as videos, animations, and interactive quizzes to engage students and make the material more interesting and accessible.
immediate feedback: online courses often provide instant feedback on quizzes and exams, allowing you to track your progress and identify areas where you may need additional study.
cost savings: online traffic school courses can be more cost-effective than in-person classes. you don't have to spend money on transportation or potentially take time off work to attend classes.
easy documentation: completing an online course allows you the option to have the certificate of completion emailed to you electronically. this eliminates the need for physical paperwork and simplifies the process.
no need for childcare: if you have children or dependents, online traffic school allows you to study without needing to arrange for childcare or find someone to cover your responsibilities while you attend classes in person.
multiple attempts: in many online courses, you have the opportunity to retake quizzes or exams if you don't pass on your first attempt, providing more flexibility to successfully complete the course.

frequently asked questions




 is this traffic school certified by the state of florida? 


                  yes, this online driver improvement (also known as traffic school and defensive driving) is state-approved in florida. the 1safedriver.com course we use is certified by the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles and our certificates are accepted in every county and court in florida to satisfy a 4-hour basic driver improvement class.
                



 how do i know if i need to take traffic school? 


                  if a driver receives a non-criminal moving violation and does not have a commercial driver license, they may elect to attend a flhsmv-approved basic driver improvement school once every 12 months or a total of five times within their lifetime. a bdi course is mandatory when cited for one of the following reasons: (1) electing to attend bdi school instead of having points assessed from a citation; (2) drivers who were cited for a crash in which they were found at fault and resulted in anyone being transported to the hospital; (3) drivers with two crashes within a two-year period that resulted in property damage greater than $500; or (4) drivers who were convicted of one of the following (in florida or in another state while they held a florida driver license):  passing a school bus when it displayed a stopped signal;  racing on a highway; highway racing â spectator; reckless driving; or running a red light.
                



 what if i've already paid my ticket? 


                  contact the court in the county where you received and paid the ticket to see if you are still eligible to make the traffic school election. it depends on the county.
                



 why don't i see yellow ticket on the dmv website list? 


                  yellow ticket traffic school is an affiliate of the 1safedriver.com program. the dmv website only lists the approved bdi providers and not all of their affiliates. 1safedriver.com is the provider we use and that name is on the dmv website.
