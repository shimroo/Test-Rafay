        managing biological contamination in machining coolants




    extend the life of your metalworking fluids - rapid bacterial test kits

    

real time biological test results are the most important parameter in getting long lifetimes and safe operation from metalworking fluids. the hmb rapid tester is easy to use and gives results in 15 minutes

  

additives are almost always necessary for long term control of biological growth in metalworking fluids. here you can learn about biocides and non-biocidal stabilizers.
