1st trimester abortion
first trimester abortion patients (up to 13 weeks) first have an ultrasound to confirm gestational age, then after counseling undergo a two-day outpatient surgical procedure using laminaria to minimize the need for cervical dilation.

2nd trimester abortion
second trimester abortion patients (up to 27 weeks) also receive an ultrasound exam and counseling, then undergo a three to four day outpatient procedure.

3rd trimester abortion
patients coming in for a later abortion (28 weeks and over) are often seeking services for termination of a desired pregnancy that has developed serious complications.  we perform either a four-day procedure similar to our second-trimester approach, or in rare cases offer an induced fetal demise.

our staff have extensive experience working with people who have recently discovered, late in a pregnancy, a catastrophic fetal anomaly or genetic disorder that may cause death, suffering, or serious disability for the baby that would be delivered if the pregnancy were to continue to term.

i came in here not feeling too great about the whole thing, but the nurses made me feel, really think about and realize that this doesn’t make me bad because it’s the best thing and it’s my choice. they made me feel better about myself.


patient comment





it was a very emotional time for us and we are thankful to the wonderful staff. your receptionist was the first person we talked to. her positive and caring attitude was conveyed over the phone. again thank you for allowing me to be able to make the choice.


patient comment





i put a great deal of thought in before coming. the staff here was understanding and willing to listen, making the procedure easier to go through. i’d call this a very positive experience. i also appreciated all the info i found on your web site. learning more about the procedure and dr. hern calmed any residual fear/anxiety i had.


patient comment





the facility was great in general, we felt safe, and everything was clean, soothing and the music in the waiting room was comforting.


patient comment





the doctor is the greatest person i have ever met or will ever meet. the procedure was smooth and never did i feel as if i was not to be heard.
