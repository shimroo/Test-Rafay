*during the promotional period of 12:01am aest on 1/06/2024 to 11:59pm aest on 30.06.2025 (promotion period), velocity members will earn 250 bonus points on an eligible purchase at any 7-eleven store in australia, when they first scan their velocity linked my 7-eleven card in the my 7-eleven app. members who have previously shopped and scanned their physical or digital velocity membership card, but have not linked their velocity membership with the my 7-eleven app, are also eligible for this offer. the bonus points are not available to velocity members who have previously earned points using their velocity linked my card in the my 7-eleven app prior to the start of the promotion period. 
all velocity members will continue to earn 2 velocity points for every $1 spent on in-store eligible purchases, 2 velocity points per 1 litre of premium fuel purchased or 1 velocity point per 1 litre of regular fuel purchased. premium fuel includes mobil supreme+ 98 and mobil extra 95 only. regular fuel includes all other fuel types.

eligible purchases are purchases at 7-eleven stores made using an eligible payment method, other than purchases of excluded products.

excluded products include tobacco, prepaid transport tickets, mobile phone products, gift cards and vouchers, parcel and hire services, purchases made online or via any home delivery services platform, and other excluded purchases specified in the partnership terms and conditions.
an eligible payment method is any payment method other than: 7-eleven fuel pass, any fleet card, motorpass, vouchers, free offers or any other excluded payment method specified in the partnership terms and conditions as ineligible for velocity points. for a full list of exclusions and full partnership terms and conditions visit www.7eleven.com.au/velocity.

a member must scan their velocity linked my 7-eleven card in the my 7-eleven app or their velocity membership card (either their physical card or using the velocity app) before completing the transaction to receive velocity points. retrospective claims for points will not be accepted, even in case of technology malfunctions. bonus points will be allocated to your velocity account within 24 hours after the transaction. the exact number of points to be awarded will be calculated after excluding any products or services which form part of a transaction which are not eligible purchases. fractions of velocity points will not be allocated. the total points awarded is calculated by applying the relevant points earn rate to the actual number of litres of fuel purchased and the purchase price paid for in-store eligible purchases, before rounding the combined points up to a whole number.
to earn velocity points, you must be a velocity member. velocity membership is subject to the velocity membership terms and conditions. use of the my 7-eleven app is governed by the my 7-eleven app terms and conditions.
