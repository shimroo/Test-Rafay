we hand delivered our son at camp for the very first overnight, week long experience. we pulled in to be greeted by camp staff, led to the parking lot to meet the rest of the staff and then immediately greeted by our sons camp counselors. they helped our son feel at home and as i looked up to make eye contact with my son, i witnessed first hand his comfort as he was laughing, chatting and walking off to get settled in...never looking back. now that's #tanugamagic
