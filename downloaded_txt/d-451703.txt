official survivorcongratulations! you scored 74%! 

whether through ferocity or quickness, you made it out. you made the right choice most of the time, but you probably screwed up somewhere. nobody's perfect, at least you're alive. 

 


my test tracked 1 variable how you compared to other people your age and gender:







you scored higher than 52% on survivalpointslink: the zombie scenario survivor test written by ci8db4uok on okcupid free online dating

take the quiz: "which daria character are you?"brittanyyou're brittany! you're the resident airhead blonde. you love being energetic and silly, and are probably viewed as vacant, as well. your hobbies include your partner, shopping, and listening to the wind blow between your ears!
