russell's for men | unique gifts for men








welcome to russell's for men

what began in 1998, as an offshoot of the renowned a.g. russell knives, has become a preeminent men’s gift company offering unique, high-end items for the man who has everything. we are a traditional, family owned and operated business in northwest arkansas. we strive to bring our loyal customers as many made-in-america items that we can find, but also those of the highest quality when manufactured elsewhere.  from fine leather goods to watches to gun accessories, we endeavor to offer product to those with discriminating tastes.
traditional values, exceptional quality - russell’s for men.





 we’d love to hear from you

many of the items found in our catalog were direct requests or suggestions from our customers. if you have an item that your father or grandfather owned that is no longer available to you, let us hear from you.  we value your input and will work diligently to source premium products. use our contact us page and let us know what products you would like to see next!





 excellent customer service

our customer service department is very knowledgeable on the products you see in our catalog.  if you have a question they can’t answer, they take the time to find you the information you need!  we are here to make your shopping experience a pleasant one.  let us assist you in finding that perfect gift.

                    “cowboy travel bible - very disappointed. the leather is very nice however inside it's nothing but a cheap paperback new testament slid inside. so basically i bought a leather cover with a $5 paperback bible.
the description could be much better along with a picture of the bible opened showing the inside. to me it's nothing more than an expensive bible cover that limits you to one size bible should you wish to purchase a better bible. rating: 2/10

rating: 9/10
