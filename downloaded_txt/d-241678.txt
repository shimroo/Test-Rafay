florida lakewatch
florida lakewatch is a citizen volunteer lake monitoring program that facilitates "hands-on" citizen participation in the management of florida lakes, estuaries, rivers and springs through monthly monitoring activities.
coordinated through the university of florida's institute of food and agricultural sciences/ffgs fisheries and aquatic sciences, the program has been in existence since 1986. in 1991, the florida legislature recognized the importance of the program and established florida lakewatch in the state statutes (florida statute 1004.49.). lakewatch is now one of the largest lake monitoring programs in the nation with over 1800 trained citizens currently monitoring 525 lakes, 175 estuary stations, 125 river stations, 20 coastal dune lakes and 10 spring runs in 57 counties.
