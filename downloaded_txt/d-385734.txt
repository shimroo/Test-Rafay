diana the bermuda angelfish, charles the hogfish, gollum the squirrelfish and herb the hind await, out in the wild, ready to perform their magic. some you actually pet or hold, some pose for photos, a few do tricks, and others simply hold you in awe, by their grace, beauty, and fluidity.
 





helmet diving as a boat tour was started by the hartley family in 1947. this shore excursion is not really a water sport because it is so easy and effortless. our undersea walk is in 8-10 feet of tropical water, less than 2 miles from bermuda’s western shore. the dive is about 30-40 minutes long and the trip is 3-4 hours depending on how many divers we have. with the return of ships, dive vessel, rainbow runner will again use the dock adjacent to the heritage wharf, up in dockyard. the price is $150 per person ($135 for 12 and under), and includes photos with said celebrity fish, with a short video. it is an excellent value, where money is involved, but not the central issue. our aim is to give you an inspiring, educational, entertaining, new, different, yet awesome experience. with hartley’s undersea walk, your head stays dry and you can wear glasses, while you connect with tropical, marine life in bermuda, all while having loads of fun.
