welcome to greencroft communities




welcome to greencroft communities
we know how to take care of people. our continuing care communities are home to belly laughs with neighbors, delicious chef-cooked meals, beautiful green gardens, farmers’ markets, cozy abodes, and – most of all – really kind people.
each of the greencroft affiliates was started by individuals from various faith traditions who wanted to make a difference everyday in their community. they each answered a call from god to serve.  you will find that the leadership team at each campus has answered that same call to serve today as our founders answers all those years ago.  please, feel free to explore each vibrant community to see which one you might feel like calling home. 
here, we’re a family. and, because of that, we care enough to ease your worries, so you can be free to really live. that’s the magic of greencroft life.
at any one of our communities, you can live independently or with as much help as you need.   
 





                                                    feel free to ask us anything.
                                                    we mean it.

what do we do?
being a continuing care retirement community means that we’ve got what you need. our communities offer a range of care, from independent living to assisted living to healthcare services for those who need daily help from trained, compassionate professionals.  enjoy comfort, security, peace of mind and socialization.   we sweat the small stuff, so you don’t have to.
 
we partner with local communities and local non-profit corporations to improve the quality of retirement services. we believe that healthcare decisions are best made locally for people served locally. we offer managerial, financial and board expertise to strengthen an organization and the services it provides a local community.
