wrapping things up

the calendar view has been removed, as well as some of the ways to enter the forums. it's still possible to create dated event listings and new forum posts, but i am de-emphasising the content. 
for some time now my interest and ability to mantain the site as an active resource have been waning and the amount of user-created content has been approacing zero and i spend far too much time removing spam. in other words, after nearly 25 years, gothic bc is dying. read more about wrapping things up…

for 25 years gothicbc was a resource for goths and other lovers of the dark alternative scene from victoria to fort st. john. promoters and patrons of b.c. events could upload pictures to personal albums and share them in the public photo gallery to showcase these events and we have a photographic history of the goth scene in b.c. (mostly vancouver) spanning 1984 to 2022.  we feed our content to our facebook page and instagram pages.
for more information, read the faq.
