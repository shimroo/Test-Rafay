mandy
                youtube            throwback to summer 2022 when, out of the blue, i developed an obsession with the barry manilow song mandy (which, don’t you know, was written by scott english and originally called brandy) and created this playlist with 28 versions of the song. anyway, i know what i’ll be listening to probably all day.
