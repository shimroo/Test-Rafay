rotech is proud to sponsor ugracing, the university of glasgow's formula student team for 2023. as part of our sponsorship, we have manufactured (in-house here at rotech) bespoke prototype racing parts for their 2023 electric vehicle entry. 

                ugracing competes annually at the formula student competition, the most established student engineering competition in europe. the formula student competition takes place at silverstone racetrack and attracts teams from over 100 universities worldwide. the competition involves the ugracing team designing and manufacturing a single-seat ev race car from scratch, which is no mean feat! ugracing won last yearâs competition, the first scottish team and only the third british team to do so.
                 
                this year they are shifting focus from their championship-winning combustion vehicle to a new electric vehicle. they believe that this decision will solidify ugracing's dedication to being the most cutting-edge team in scotland and will help them to retain the championship victory in 2023.
                 
                best of luck to ugracing from everyone here at team rotech.
