	 excellent news!
	 
    


pastor roberts got some great news today!  his ct scan came back clear...no sign of any cancer or anything to cause concern.  his doctor even said he wasn't sure pastor even needs to have radiation on his nose, but a couple of other doctors on the cancer board want him to see a radiologist.  so, pastor will be meeting with a radiologist soon.  god has been so good!  thanks to you all for your prayers!  god hears the prayers of the righteous!kendra

	 wonderful news!
	 
    


thank you all for being patient and waiting for my news. guess what?  pastor robert doesn't have lymphoma!  the u of m cancer board met last night, and they've decided that he has something that mimics lymphoma, but is not.  whatever it is, it is more localized, and will only need to be treated with a small amount of radiation!  thank god!  he may have a gene that generates cancer, and if that is the case, katie and i will have to go and be tested for this gene.  we will find out about that on tuesday, i believe.  pastor will still have to go for a ct scan on his head because he's had a head cold that will not clear up, but i am believing that god is going to take care of that as well!thank you all for your prayers and concern.i will keep you posted on further updates.kendra
