welcome to belleayre ski patrol





the belleayre ski patrol is made up of hard working, dedicated members.  bsp has both full time paid and part time volunteer members.  although many members are from the local catskill mountains and hudson valley areas, some members travel from as far away as staten island,  new york city, new jersey, and connecticut.  like the belleayre ski area, the bsp is family oriented with an outstanding young adult patroller training program. 
the bsp members have a wide range of experiences, jobs, and life styles.  this diversity results in strong friendships, team work, and camaraderie which makes the belleayre ski patrol second to none.
members of the bsp are trained using training material provided by the national ski patrol,  american red cross, and belleayre mountain ski center ski patrol policy and procedure manual.   this education includes both basic life support and ski area procedures.  the ski area procedures cover areas such as lift evacuation, toboggan handling, skiing/snowboarding skills, ski area safety, summit dispatcher, and various other daily procedures.  basic life support includes outdoor emergency care, cpr, and local aed equipment.
 
belleayre and belleayre ski patrol are proud to welcome "catskill thunder":
