why straw bale construction?



straw bale construction offers exceptional benefits over conventional buildings. the high insulation value of straw bale walls helps keep homes warmer in winter and cooler in summer, reducing energy use by up to 30% compared to standard insulation. plastered straw bale walls also have high fire resistance, naturally limiting flame spread without additional treatments. with reinforced design, straw bale homes are seismically resilient, meeting or exceeding earthquake standards in areas like california.built from renewable, biobased materials, straw bale homes resist pests and mold and maintain superior indoor air quality by avoiding the synthetic materials common in conventional construction. with the right protection against moisture, these homes offer durability comparable to wood-frame houses, creating an eco-friendly, carbon-sequestering option that reduces environmental impact while enhancing comfort and health.straw bale construction is officially part of the international residential code.Â  find much more here.

j. johnson
what we learned at the workshop will benefit us from years to come. what we experienced will benefit us for the rest of our lives






tc martindale
now this is what iâ€™ve been waiting for! iâ€™ve read all the straw bale books on the market and theyâ€™re all good, but they just canâ€™t compare to the detailed step-by-step instructions in your videos. keep â€™em coming!






david noe
the three videos are absolutely the best thing iâ€™ve found in the straw bale building industry. thanks again for all your hard work helping others with their straw bale dreams.






i. kirkpatrick
i must say i think thatâ€™s the fastest iâ€™ve ever had a response and resolution via email ever and i spend around 95% of my money online so thatâ€™s an awesome feat!
