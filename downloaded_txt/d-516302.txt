for me, history has always been a process of learning about my heritage, ancestors and roots. cambridge has opened my eyes to all of that whilst also giving me the critical tools to truly question and embrace the world around me.

history and politics at cambridge is a dynamic way to study both the past and the present. i study some of the most iconic events in history whilst also being equipped with the skills to consider their contemporary political influence.
