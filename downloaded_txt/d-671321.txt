gardendelights:quality garden decor-fountains, wind chimes, patio furniture
a beautiful backyard decor is a great way to extend your indoor living to your outdoor living area. this is just an extension to encompass the beautiful backyard that you have created. backyard patios/decks and gardens can be easily created into a beautiful outdoor oasis and with the right plan you can make your backyard look like it was professionally landscaped.
by adding a few decorations you can create a theme for your backyard, you can combine a variety of different water fountain features allowing for beautiful tranquil running water sounds with the combination of unique wind chimes producing a variety of different sounds of music.
 think about using outdoor pottery touches and unique outdoor decorations or garden sundials with a variety of different water features, statues and whimsical animals to create your own professionally landscaped yard you can be proud of.
successful outdoor lighting is a well-thought-out lighting plan
use patio and garden lighting to bring your deck and backyard to life at night time. lighting is essential for your outdoor rooms function and beautiful accent. functional outdoor lighting such as down lights mounted in trees or along a house eave, garden lanterns  mounted on a wall or string lighting hanging from tree limbs or on  garden arbors or to mark pathways allowing it to make it easy to move about safely. accent lighting creates an ambience in your outdoor rooms allowing you to highlight architectural features of your home and garden. the secrets to creating successful outdoor lighting is to provide enough light and create a subtle effect well still not having it overwhelming.

wind chimes create beautiful tuned music for your backyard
wind chimes can be created from a variety of different materials (metal, wood, bamboo). feng shui sounds from the fountains and wind chimes are the starting point of a calm relaxing backyard experience, paying attention to feng shui rules will show you how to place your fountains and chimes and the type of material they are made from plays a big part.
windchimes should be placed in areas that tend to have a breeze flowing by it in order to make them work properly. you may consider solar wind chimes if you cannot wait for the breeze to create music. try a combination of different materials for your beautiful wind chimes as you will find that they will have quite the different sounds.
  aluminum wind chimes  will come tuned to different frequencies depending on the size and shape and length of the metal tubes, the thickness of the tube and what is striking it will also vary the sound.  wooden/bamboo wind chimes tend to give a beautiful lower tone wood clapping sound, it kind of reminds me of the tropics (hawaii, barbados, and tahiti).





water fountains is living art for the sole
water features bring the sound of running water into your backyard. this will bring a beautiful relaxing sound to your outdoor living area with the benefit of getting rid of (white noise) that can be generated throughout a neighborhood. when you are shopping around for your  garden water fountains 
 i recommend placing a few water features in your yard as each one has its own unique sound. you can create a focal point for each one by adding flowers, plants and small rock features around. 
 typically the more affordable fountains for backyards are made of fiberglass allowing to create wonderful shapes that can resemble real stone/rock. you can have waterfalls that flow over rocks or you may decide that you want a statue water feature that brings it to life.
benefits of these  unique water fountains is that they are a self-contained unit that you just fill and put in the pump then and plug-in, this allows you to be able to choose anywhere you want to put your water fountain in your yard.
remember if you put your fountain in a place where it has a lot of direct sunlight water will evaporate that much more quickly and you should always check to make sure water levels are up so that the pump can work properly. pumps are a very simple thing and if they are left running dry they typically tend to be okay, water is what lubricates the pump and by replacing the water back into it a pump typically will start pumping again.

birdhouses and birdfeeders bring your patio to life
garden decor and backyard accessories are only limited to your creative imagination of what you can use. this means that you can make this your own unique paradise and outdoor living experience. bringing some feather friends into your backyard world is another fantastic way to bring your patio to life. 
decorative birdhouses and feeders will attract a variety of different birds depending on what part of the country you live in. the sounds of birds chirping and whistling can put a smile on your face anytime of the day. 
do some research to find out what birds live in your area and provide the appropriate housing and food so that you will be able to attract them into your environment. consider your water fountains not only for their artistic living art beauty and wonderful sounds but also for the  drinking and bathing  of the birds.

patio furniture provides a place to relax and dine
patio furniture allows you to relax and enjoy your outdoor living area with your friends and family.this is one of the biggest purchases that you may take on.
  outdoor furniture sets comes in a variety of different materials (aluminum, wicker resin, cast-iron, teak) and you will find that each one has its own maintenance to help keep it looking great and to help protect your investment.
when you are planning to purchase your outdoor furniture set you need to decide on how big of a set you need .maybe you are looking at a 7 piece patio suite or a small little cafe bistro set. do you need a regular seating area with four or eight chairs and a patio table with an outdoor umbrella to help protect from the sun’s rays or maybe you need to expand off that with an outdoor love seat or sofa. chase lounge chairs are very comfortable and popular choice but you may not have the room for it.
