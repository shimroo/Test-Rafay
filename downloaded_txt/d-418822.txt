how cogeneration works

a natural gas engine turns a generator to make electricity
heat from the engine is recovered as usable hot water
electricity is fed into the building, reducing the facility’s electrical consumption and utility bill 

think of this as a generator that gives you free hot water or a boiler that gives you free electricity. by getting two outputs from the same fuel input, you double the efficiency. 
we can also use the engine to turn an air-conditioning compressor. then you can make chilled water and hot water. this is how our engine driven chillers work. if you want to control temperature and humidity such as in an industrial facility, or where you have a cooling and hot water load such as in a hospital, the tecochill engine driven chiller can provide you tremendous savings. afterall, you would buy a chiller anyway. with tecochill, you have a chiller that saves you money.
