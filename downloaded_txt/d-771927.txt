memoir monday: growing up adopted, adored, and afraid with author and adoptee, janice jones8:00 pm - 9:00 pm et | monday, january 27thjanice jones reads vignettes from her memoir, dr. beare’s daughter, that illustrate how being adopted caused her to silence her own voice in her struggle to be that elusive, golden child she believed her parents really wanted—their own. she shares insights into life as an adoptee, that she gained from writing her story, and how publishing it finally gave her real self a voice in the world and helped her become whole. she invites questions and offers encouragement for participants to share their own stories as part of a healing journey. read more about janice here.
