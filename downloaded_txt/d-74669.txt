"made a difference "
sam

                                                                bought it to control biting gnats as much as mosquitoes. does a very good job of attracting them and fair job of trapping them. i added 2 sticky traps to sides and the results were amazing. front yard still has swarms of gnats but back yard around patriot magnet is significantly better. have 2 acres total. just need to get my neighbors on board to help.
