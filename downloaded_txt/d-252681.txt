benefit and negative effects



apr 19, 2021




when we practice to the gohonzon with faith, the great life condition of buddhahood will manifest in the depths of our lives. we can expiate our negative karma from the past and experience it as a lesser effect.

the underlying cause of calamities



apr 19, 2021




from the standpoint of buddhism, especially from the perspective of nichiren daishonin’s buddhism, there is a deep causal relationship that exists between common mortals and their immediate environment. it is said that this relationship can cause disasters to arise.

cause and effect



apr 18, 2021




…actions from our past existences become causes that manifest as good and bad fortune in the present, and actions in this life become the causes that lead to effects in the future.

earthly desires: the root of unhappiness



apr 18, 2021




in buddhism, while it is taught that there are four sufferings from which no one can escape – birth, old age, sickness, and death – there are many other hardships and worries, in addition to the above mentioned four, with which we are constantly beset in our daily lives.

the middle path



apr 18, 2021




the fundamental meaning of the term “middle path” is to walk the indivisible middle way, not only unswayed by such extremes as suffering and pleasure, existence and void, or impermanence and eternity, but also based on correct buddhist wisdom, which comprehends that all things manifest and become extinct because of causal relationships.

do not be swayed by the eight winds



apr 18, 2021




the “eight winds” are eight influences that agitate and inflame the human heart and mind. they consist of four favorable circumstances (prosperity, honor, praise, and pleasure) and four setbacks (decline, disgrace, censure, and suffering).

myoho-renge-kyo



apr 18, 2021




the buddha expounded his teachings in order to reveal the true law that leads to buddhahood, so that people could practice those teachings and manifest the buddha nature within their own lives. the true buddha nichiren daishonin revealed that the entity of that law is embodied within the five and seven characters of nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

apr 18, 2021

the origins of buddhism



apr 18, 2021




the word “buddhism” carries two meanings: “teachings expounded by the buddha” and, “teachings for becoming a buddha.” further, there are various explanations of the word “buddha,” depending on the sutra being examined, and the word is not necessarily limited to shakyamuni, who made his advent in india.

how to overcome bad feelings toward others



apr 18, 2021




buddhism teaches that one’s attachment to the idea that “the self equals the ego” is an incorrect view, and strongly urges people to get rid of that idea, since it is an illusion of thought. ill feelings like hatred and jealousy actually arise out of a type of illusion of thought called egocentric views.
