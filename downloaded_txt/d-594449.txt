security camera registration
the louisville police department would like your help to prevent and solve crime.  security cameras can be a powerful tool in crime deterrence, your participation in this program will expand our investigative abilities and help identify potential witnesses or suspects.  this program is completely free and open to residents and businesses.  registering your cameras in this program does not give us free or unrestricted access to your cameras. the security camera registration program will allow our officers to create a readily accessible list to aid them in locating crucial evidence to help them solve crimes.  when a crime occurs officers will reference this list to aid in their investigation. we will then contact the camera’s owner and request they provide security video from the date and time of the crime.  this process greatly expedites and enhances the investigation and may lead to quick apprehension.  at no time does participation in the program alter your rights to privacy in any way and is completely voluntary. the louisville police department will not have access to your footage unless you provide it. your information is kept confidential and can be withdrawn at any time by emailing policedetective@louisvilleohio.gov.
please note: registering with this program does not grant the louisville police department direct access to your security camera(s) or security camera system.
