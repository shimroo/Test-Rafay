t.r. mckenzie’s exclusive
home buyer program for renters





  







  





the trm home buyer program was created to help residents at our apartments transition into home ownership. timing purchasing a home around when your lease ends can be difficult and expensive. if you rent at one of our properties for at least six months and decide to work with one of our realtors, you will be released from your lease when you purchase you home (some exclusions apply).
