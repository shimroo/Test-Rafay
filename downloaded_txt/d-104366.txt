about home loans
va helps veterans, servicemembers, and eligible surviving spouses become homeowners. as part of our mission to serve you, we provide a home loan guaranty benefit and other housing-related programs to help you buy, build, repair, retain, or adapt a home for your own personal occupancy.
va home loans are provided by private lenders, such as banks and mortgage companies. va guarantees a portion of the loan, enabling the lender to provide you with more favorable terms.
read our guide for buying a home
before you buy, be sure to read the va home loan buyer's guide. this guide can help you under the homebuying process and how to make the most of your va loan benefit. download the buyer's guide here.
main pillars of the va home loan benefit

no downpayment required (*note: lenders may require downpayments for some borrowers using the va home loan guaranty, but va does not require a downpayment)
competitively low interest rates
limited closing costs
no need for private mortgage insurance (pmi)
the va home loan is a lifetime benefit: you can use the guaranty multiple times


benefits
