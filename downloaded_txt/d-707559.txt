weâre bullish on passenger trains.

travel by passenger train in north america, as in civilized
      countries around the globe, can serve as an essential part of our
      domestic transportation network. we are just now entering a new
      golden age of rail travel. not for over half of a century have so
      many opportunities for good, reliable passenger train service been
      available.
as every mode of transportation has its strengths, so, too, does
      passenger rail. passenger trains work well for long, medium, and
      short distances of travel, both on a national and regional
      basis. cities and states across this great nation are starting to
      understand the limitations of our highway and airway systems, and
      to see the profound and proven economic, social, and environmental
      advantages of railways.
the united rail passenger alliance is dedicated to the viability
      of a new golden age of rail travel.

          subject: amtrak
mr. shipley--
i read with despair bloomberg's editorial on amtrak. nearly every statement in it was factually false, or materially incomplete or distorted. you did your readers a severe disservice, propagating myths and falsehoods about intercity passenger rail service.
here are the relevant facts; all but the market share data below are drawn from the amtrak website, and readily available public sources such as the us dot's bureau of transportation statistics. the market share information is computed from amtrak, aaa, dot and other public sources.
amtrak has three operating divisions, the nec, the regional corridors sponsored by states, and the inter-regional trains.
of these, the largest and by far the most commercially successful by all objective metrics is the inter-regional group. they have by a wide margin the greatest output of annual passenger miles (last year, half-again the output of the nec), the highest load factors, three times the market share in their respective corridors of amtrak's nec trains, and the same number of intercity passengers as does the nec. (three quarters of amtrak's nec passengers are commuters, not intercity passengers.)
          in many if not most years, the regional corridors also outproduce the nec, leaving the nec as objectively the smallest division amtrak operates.
in the covid epidemic, only the inter-regional trains have recovered to their pre-pandemic levels of demand, despite amtrak's best efforts to drive away those customers (that would be the subject of a separate discussion; get in touch if you'd like to pursue that). amtrak's regional corridors, except in california, and particularly the nec continue to suffer severely degraded use.
your editorial ironically made self-contradictory (and false) statements about the financial performance of the three operating groups.
the nec is emphatically not "profitable" in any rational sense of the word. amtrak's ceo himself lamented last year that the nec had, pre-covid, "almost" recovered its direct operating costs in the nec for the first time in fy'19.
          "almost" is not the same as "more than." in fact, despite its political propaganda suggesting otherwise, amtrak has never recovered its direct operating costs in the nec.
worse, amtrak's claims, like your editorial, fraudulently omit from the financial reckoning of the nec all of the costs associated with the fixed facilities of the nec. these costs total in a typical year more than $1.5 billion, and even that does not cover another $300-400 million in deferred maintenance and purchasing that occurs every year in the nec.
the only source of revenue amtrak has to cover the enormous fixed facility (infrastructure) costs in the nec is its annual federal subsidy. 100% of the nec's revenues are not enough to cover its direct operating costs; no revenues remain for infrastructure costs. all or nearly all of the annual subsidy therefore is spent propping up nec infrastructure.
your editorial blithely asserts that amtrak has a $38 billion maintenance deficit in the nec. that is a very large deficit for a purportedly "profitable" enterprise, yet it passes without comment. in fact, the upkeep deficit in the nec is the sum of decades of annual cost deferrals totaling up to a half billion dollars a year. even amtrak can't spend cash it doesn't have.
your editorial also claimed, without factual basis, that the inter-regional trains lose large sums of money. that claim is false. several amtrak ceos have publicly stated otherwise. some 35 years ago, w. graham claytor, jr. publicly stated, unequivocally, "the long haul trains operate in the black." later, david gunn made a similar statement when he told congress in writing that without the full annual subsidy he had requested, amtrak would have to immediately shut down not the inter-regional trains but the nec. more recently, wick moorman told congress in writing that if all of the inter-regional trains were eliminated, amtrak's annual loss and subsidy need would increase (not decrease) by $423 million in the first year. shutting down a money-losing venture does not increase the enterprise's net loss.
amtrak fraudulently asserts that the inter-regional trains lose large amounts based upon reports generated by its apt (amtrak performance tracking) route accounting system. apt, however, does not conform to generally accepted accounting principles, and therefore is categorically incapable of--and does not--reflect the financial results of operations of any train or route in a given period of time. apt cannot and does not produce financial statements, and its results are not statements of profit or loss as those terms are properly understood. amtrak's representations that they do are false and fraudulent. (apt uses management-determined algorithms to allocate and assign costs to numerous activities, but it largely omits capital and fixed facility costs; what it reports, therefore, is no more than what management thinks or would like costs to be, not what they are under gaap.)
because the inter-regional trains on an annual basis consistently operate near the limits of the artificially and intentionally-capped capacity they offer, turning away thousands of would-be passengers every year, they are the most under-capitalized trains in the amtrak system. because the nec trains never sell more than about half of their annual inventory (they run statistically half-empty, according to amtrak's published data), the nec is plainly over-capitalized. amtrak produces in the nec twice the inventory that they are able to sell. (in the current epidemic, the empty seat miles are much higher). squandering new capital on an operation that is already over-capitalized and consistently under-utilized (by half or more) is foolish beyond comprehension, and is understandable only as the fruit of political influence hat defies economic sense.
as a leading business publication, bloomberg has displayed appalling ignorance and gullibility on the subject of amtrak and its misuses of public capital resources. you owe your readers far better.

 statement
      of
      united rail passenger alliance
to
the united states senate committee on commerce, science and transportation
hearing on the current status of the rail network

united
      rail passenger alliance (urpa) respectfully submits this statement to
      the committee, for the record in the captioned hearing. urpa is an
      independent national research and education organization on rail
      passenger transportation issues.
amtrakâs
      response to the covid-19 epidemic has been schizophrenic. at the same
      time it undertook a campaign to clean its stations and trains and a
      masking requirement for employees and customers to reduce the risk of
      virus propagation, it has also prejudiced the mobility needs of the
      american public by withdrawing the majority of its train services in
      the only part of its business where americans have returned to using
      trains in large numbers. it makes no sense for amtrak to reduce
      operations in its largest, most productive and most
      commercially-successful business segment, the national system of
      inter-regional trains, just as demand for these services has
      rebounded much more strongly than demand anywhere else in the system.
urpa
      applauds amtrakâs cleaning, masking and social distancing
      initiatives. but urpa condemns
      amtrakâs abandonment of the demonstrated transport needs of the
      american public at a time of crisis brought about by the covid-19
      epidemic.
amtrak
      has deceived the congress in respect to the performance and prospects
      of its three operating divisions, the inter-regional trains, the
      state-sponsored intra-regional corridors, and the
      federally-subsidized northeast corridor (nec).
contrary
      to amtrakâs misrepresentations, by all objective measures the
      inter-regional group of trains is amtrakâs largest, most productive
      and most commercially-successful segment.
      these are also the trains to which americans have turned during the
      covid-19 epidemic.
the
      inter-regional group of trains (sometimes referred to as
      âlong-distanceâ trains) is amtrakâs largest businessâit
      carries the most
      intercity
        passengers
      of any segment of amtrakâs operation. nec trainsâ passengers
      consist predominantly (as much as 75%) of customers who are
      classified by the department of transportation as commuters,
      not intercity
      passengers; the intercity
      component of amtrakâs nec traffic is no more numerous than the
      intercity component of the inter-regional trains, and in some years,
      less. (in many years, the state-sponsored corridor trains also carry
      more intercity passengers than do amtrakâs nec trains, leaving the
      necâin terms of true intercity passengersâas amtrakâs smallest
      division.)
the
      inter-regional trains are also amtrakâs most productive.
      inter-regional
        trains have the
highest
        load factors
      in the entire system (50-60+%, in a sector where an annual load
      factor of 65% is a sold-out condition due to the large number of
      stations served and the regular turnover of passengers en route on
      each trip; on the western inter-regional trains, it is customary for
      each seat and berth to turn over on average 2 â½ times per trip). the
      annual load factor in the nec by contrast rarely exceeds 50%, and
      south of philadelphia and east of new haven amtrakâs nec trains
      arithmetically cannot have annual load factors that exceed 28%--i.e.,
      more than two-thirds of their proffered inventory goes unsold, a most
      unproductive use of scarce federal subsidy capital. in the traffic
      vacuum in the nec during the covid-19 epidemic, these nec load
      factors are even lower.
the
      inter-regional
        trains also always produce 150-200% more
transportation
        output
      annually than do the nec or state-sponsored corridor trains. output
      is measured in annual
        revenue passenger miles
      (not âridership,â which merely measures transactions). this is
      the most important index of size and productivity of a passenger
      transportation network, and nothing else that amtrak does comes even
      close to the inter-regional trains in producing annual passenger
      miles. this is doubly so in the covid-19 epidemic. (the
      state-sponsored corridors produce about the same output each year as
      does the nec.)
the
      interregional
        trains are also the
most
        commercially successful trains
      that amtrak operates, measured by their market
        share
      for intercity passenger transport. in their respective corridors, the
      inter-regional trains ordinarily generate market shares of 5 to 6%.
      in the nec, amtrakâs market share (not the air-rail end-point modal
      split that amtrak sometimes publishes) for intercity passenger
      transport in the region rarely reaches as high as 1 1/2 %, and that
      has shrunk for decades. unsubsidized intercity buses carry more
      passengers in the nec than do amtrakâs trains.
in
      the current covid-19 epidemic, amtrakâs transaction volume
      (âridershipâ) and output (passenger miles) plummeted. but they
      did not do so uniformly across the system. amtrak has tried to
      deceive the public and the federal government by emphasizing its
      system totals rather than breaking out the separate performance in
      the epidemic of its three operating divisions. the inter-regional
      trains initially fell far less than did the shorter corridor trains,
      and the nec fell the furthest. at the same time that acela demand
      dropped to zero, the inter-regional trains initially retained 15% of
      their demand, and then quickly rebounded, in some cases to
      near-normal levels.
as
      the system struggles to recoverâas americans regain their
      confidence to make intercity tripsâthe inter-regional trains have
      recovered far faster than the corridors, and especially the business
      travel-dependent nec, which remains severely depressed. urpa research
      suggests that the western inter-regional trains, by sharp contrast,
      recovered to normal, pre-epidemic, traffic levels during the late
      spring and summer peak period.
    
this
      finding is corroborated by the fact that in the four months ending
      july 31, 2020, the inter-regional trains brought amtrak more revenue,
      and more revenue passenger miles, than all
      of the other trains (including in the nec) combined.
based
      on these objective and relevant criteria, therefore, the
      inter-regional trains are, and remain during the epidemic, amtrakâs
      largest, strongest, most successful, and most relevant group of
      trains. the inter-regional trains, in fact, appear to be the trains
      that serve the demonstrated demand of a clear majority of american
      travelers for rail transport during the covid-19 epidemic, just as in
      more normal times. yet these are the very trains that management
      chose to slash.
against
      this background, amtrakâs decision to use two billion in federal
      subsidy dollars to charge ahead with procurement, testing and
      deployment of costly new high-speed avelia trains for the business
      market in the necâa market for which demand has dropped to and
      remained near zeroâwhile eliminating even once-a-day services in
      its largest, most productive, and highest-demand segment, the
      inter-regional routes (except auto train), is bizarre, biased and
      irrational. amtrak could not have more disserved the american public
      during the covid-19 epidemic or more misused federal financial
      support than by reducing the frequencies of its inter-regional
      trains.
amtrakâs
      coy hints that the interregional trains might be restored if only
      congress appropriates massive new subsidies is exactly the same ploy,
      in almost exactly the same terminology, that amtrak used in 2002
      after the roll-out of the acela program in the nec exhausted the
      companyâs cash and rendered it insolvent. congress should not allow
      itself to be taken in again. instead, congress should insist that
      amtrak use its existing
      resources first
      to sustain the trains that customers are actually using:  the
      heavily-used national network of inter-regional trains.
respectfully submitted,
