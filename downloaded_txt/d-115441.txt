junior high orchestra
"our junior high orchestra at bacs is a force to be reckoned with! over the past year, this group has more than tripled in size.  these enthusiastic students work together to create an excellent musical product and have fun together while they're doing it. i'm so proud of their musical growth, and i can't wait to see what they accomplish together as they continue in their orchestral pursuits!"

varsity swim team
"although it's been many years since the first bacs swimmers and parents started paving the way for a swim team, this is officially our 7th year with a boys and girls varsity swim team and we have more than tripled in size since that first year. in each of the last three years, our boys team has been 2nd or 3rd in the state and our girls team was 4th and 5th in the last two years. having only graduated one senior last year, we're positioned to do well at the state level again this year. with no pool of our own, all our practices and meets are off campus, but these kids work hard and would love to have our bronco family cheering us on at our upcoming "home meets" at clear springs high school pool on december 12 and 14 and january 11.

 @fbcwichitafalls · feb 14, 2025we are thrilled to focus on mrs. jenn hall for this week’s “focus on the faculty & staff”! 

position:
athletic coordinator

hometown and hs you graduated from:
santa fe high school in santa fe, texas

career experience:
my background is in nursing. i was an rn in the nicu at texas children’s hospital before deciding to stay home with our boys. i’ve been at bacs for 10 years! i love sports so when this opportunity came about, i was so thankful to the lord. it’s rare that people get the opportunity to have two careers they love! 

testimony:
i gave my life to jesus when i was 8. however, i didn’t really understand what that meant until i became a young adult. at the age of 20, i rededicated my life to christ, went through the waters of baptism and chose to follow him. we have been members at clear creek community church for the past 15 years.

family, hobbies, fun facts, etc.:
reading is my favorite hobby! and i love almost all sports, so watching our boys compete in whatever athletic season they’re in is where we spend most of our time. our family also loves to travel, preferably to warm destinations! we also love our dog, frank, and spending family time in the texas hill country!

why do you love working at bacs?
i love working at bacs because it feels like family. i enjoy watching our athletes grow, develop and have opportunities to compete in sports they’re passionate about while representing our school with pride!
