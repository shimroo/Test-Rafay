alum '19
mr. baughman’s ability to present the bible in an authentic way and to be honest about the struggles that all christians face, challenged me to be honest with myself about how i needed to grow in my personal relationship with god.   he demonstrated genuine care and concern in and outside of the classroom and carries himself in a way worth emulating.




alum ‘20
scs has been a place of growth for me. i have learned so many things about life, relationships, and independence. i will never forget this place.  




parent of alum
i’m glad my son was blessed to be able to attend sc for his academic career. the school became his family really, and he has made friends with his teammates and classmates that will surely last a lifetime. now that he is in college, we can clearly see how sc has helped to prepare him academically and as a christian. as you know, college life will challenge you and your beliefs. i have seen my son grow exponentially as a young man and am so proud of him! 




student '22
i am thankful that dr. matthews takes the time out of her day to make sure that i am on the right path academically and just to know that if i need any help, i can go to her.  i appreciate ms. hostetter for making developing my love of reading and making reading fun.  the old me hated english, but now i literally love it!




scs parent
it was tough finding my very bright and compassionate child the right middle school. several friends and colleagues suggested scs. we couldn’t be happier with this choice. the school supports and challenges my child academically and spiritually. the course work is rigorous and consistent. my child is learning more about the bible than even i know. it is a safe environment and each time i volunteer, the student’s behavior towards me and each other is impressive.




alum  ‘20
attending scs has ensured that i feel prepared for college. i have had the opportunity to take challenging classes and to really push myself in order to see what i can achieve academically. i have been constantly surrounded by supportive teachers and administrators who have helped me grow into who i am today. 




scs parent
after searching for the "right fit" christian school based on diversity, rigorous christ-centered college preparatory academic excellence, safety, staff, gifted/talented teachers, and the fostering of positive peer relationships, our family already feels indebted to scs for proving to be authentic and not compromising their christ-centered core values.
