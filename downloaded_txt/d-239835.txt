                            "by far the closest you can get to knowing what’s actually happening on the water." --jay, homer, alaska










weather stations where you sail.

                    over 50,000 weather stations worldwide, including our exclusive pro stations: built
                    ultra heavy-duty by our own mit engineer, and sited by our meteorologists for the
                    highest possible quality of wind reports.
