please note: 
when ordering, you will find 2 separate shopping carts for 
		stationery items & handmade items.
i apologize for any confusion this may cause.

		when building the web pages for my handmade items (bummlies, sweater 
		vests, barkclava hats and add-on badges), it was 
		necessary to create a different yet equally secure checkout system than 
		the shopping cart used for my stationery items (address labels, signed 
		prints, books, 
		note cards & gift wrap).

		i did this to ensure that inventory numbers for the handmade items are 
		kept up-to-date & accurate while allowing the flexibility that you have 
		always enjoyed when choosing images for my stationery items.

		please rest assured that when purchasing stationery & handmade items at 
		the same time through the 2 separate cart systems, that all items will 
		be combined in as few packages as possible & that all extra shipping 
		charges will be refunded to you when i process your orders.
