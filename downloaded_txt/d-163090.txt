worker owned since 1972
we’re a worker owned cooperative in operation for 40+ years. to quote our friends at equal exchange,

“a worker cooperative is an alternative for-profit structure based upon standard democratic principles. it is not designed to maximize profits, nor returns to investors, but rather to bring to the workplace many of the rights and responsibilities that we hold as citizens in our communities. these principles include one-person/one-vote equality; open access to information (i.e., open-book management); free speech; and the equitable distribution of resources (such as income).”

because of this we adhere to the 7 cooperative principles which includes upholding worker rights and participating in our community for the better. 
walking into a bicycle shop for the first time can be an intimidating endeavor for many, which is why broadway strives to create a welcoming environment for all persons that come through our door.
