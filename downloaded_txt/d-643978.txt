									the san joaquin county historical museum reveals the rich heritage of the region, from the miwok and yokuts indians, to the development of modern agriculture and to charles weber – the founder of stockton and the first farmer in the area.

nestled on 18-acres in beautiful micke grove regional park, the atmosphere and the charm of the museum encourages friendly family outings, picnic lunches and strolls through our many exhibits and buildings while you gain valuable knowledge of the rich history of san joaquin county.

the museum offers educational experiences that showcase the county’s traditions of ingenuity, innovation, and invention – with emphasis on san joaquin county’s singular contributions in agriculture – to promote community pride, continued learning, and an appreciation of regional history among county residents and visitors.
