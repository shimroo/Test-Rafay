our students, their stories



rylee
 when she enrolled at wayland she knew what she was looking for – a school where she felt comfortable and where people cared for each other. what she found was something special. 

kevin
 kevin mcconic was born to lead; it was just a matter of nurturing those skills and finding a place to exercise them. now, as the chief diversity officer for covenant health, mcconic has found a home. 

emily
 “i wanted to make sure that i wasn’t just choosing the easy thing, staying in my hometown with those connections, i wanted to make sure it was where god was calling me for the next phase of my life.” 

christian
 stepping out in faith may be a concept that is unfamiliar to non-believers, but christian vaughn, whose christian background and desire to enter the ministry, knew exactly what it meant. 

calista
 she was looking for a christian university where she could find a strong sense of community and grow stronger in her faith.
