it has been a pleasure working with the bond agency for over a decade in conjunction with green diamond builders. they are a local, family owned and operated business just like green diamond builders and we love doing business with companies based in our "neighborhood". even when the projects are complicated they have worked with us to get the necessary documentation together to get our bonds approved.
