into every life comes a little pussy



the day has finally come--a day that was five years in the making.  girlfriend has officially moved in with me--along with her cat.now, i'm not a cat-person; i'm not even pet-person.  come to think of it, i'm not much of a people-person, plant-person or unicellular-life-form-person.  i don't want my furniture covered with hair or bowls of tuna-flavored mush on my kitchen floor; and if anyone is going to shit in a sand-filled box in my bathroom it's going to be me.however, i made a deal with girlfriend: if one of her two cats died, she could bring over the other one.now girlfriend has essentially been living with me for several months, but she kept her nearby apartment solely for her cats (those felines enjoyed a spacious one-bedroom, one-bath with attached garage).  while it may have been a waste of rent money, it was a small price to pay for my sanity.  that sanity saw its final day last week, when one of the cats passed away, and in moved the surviving cat, maxie.so far it's not as bad as i feared, although there is a bowl of food on my kitchen floor and a box of sandy cat shit in my bathroom.  i visit petsmart often and continuously browse the internet for the latest, greatest pet hair magnet, sweeper or vacuum.maxie and i have a love-hate relationship: she hates me and i love that.  she seems to be afraid of me and runs out the room whenever i enter, not unlike girlfriend did when we began dating.  so now i have a pet, for better of for worse.  to be continued ...

shit!  we now live in a swayze-less world.



it is with deep sadness i announce that at 6:28 this evening, in my mesa, az, home, with my girlfriend at my side, i read an associated press article reporting the death of patrick swayze.  he died of cancer.as will every account of his death, this article labels "dirty dancing" and "ghost" as the highlights of his acting career, but for me there are two other films that will always be classic swayze:  "road house" and "point break."in 1989's "road house," swayze ruled the double deuce bar with his quick fists and even quicker smile--a style of leadership and authority not often found in today's roadside bars.  as an adolescent, i found confusion in the wonderful sex scene between swayze and kelly lynch:  i couldn't keep track of who was who--they had the exact same hair."point break" successfully assembled a magical combination of elements to create the perfect film:  surfing, rubber masks of former presidents, a pre-insane gary busey, keanu reeves jumping out of a plane with no parachute, and an extraordinary soundtrack featuring ratt's timeless "nobody rides for free."tonight i mourn the loss of patrick swayze, but tomorrow i celebrate the life of patrick swayze.  and this saturday afternoon--as with nearly every saturday afternoon--i will honor the career of patrick swayze when i turn on tbs (or tnt) to catch an airing of "road house" or "point break", unless it's one of those saturdays when nicholas cage's "the rock" is on instead.click here to read my other "road house"-related posts.

my memory of michael jackson



as the world mourns the loss of michael jackson, i would like to take a few moments to share my fondest memory of the king of pop.when i was a young drunken cripple, i got a "thriller" cassette.  then i went on to never buy another piece of michael jackson music ever again.

chick flick sunday



i haven't had a good chick flick day since july 5, 2005 when i watched the epic drama "the notebook."  so, girlfriend and i were driving aimlessly around town and decided to take in "the proposal."i'll admit, this one was not too bad.  it's a romantic comedy about sandra bullock and ryan reynolds pretending to be engaged but they can only communicate through a magic mailbox at a lake house.it also stars betty white who reprises her role as ancient white-haired lady, a character she made famous decades ago in the hit sitcom, "the golden girls."

big movie saturday



yesterday was a big movie day for girlfriend and me.  we took in a matinee showing of the hilarious "the hangover" and then were going to rent the critically acclaimed clint eastwood movie, "gran torino."  roger ebert says this film is "about the belated flowering of a man's better nature. and it's about americans of different races growing more open to one another in the new century."  unfortunately, it was all rented out so we had to settle for "paul blart mall cop."  it's about paul blart, a mall cop.

an age-old question



if a team wins a championship in a sport no one cares about, did they really win?
