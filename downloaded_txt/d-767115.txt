entertaining: the grinch!





so, i sewed up this grinch costume! well sort of. i bought the slippers, gloves and mask. the mask is really scary but it was scarier at first. it had yellow teeth and yellow eyes which made it too demonic. so, i found some paint at about 2 in the morning before the party and painted them white. a bit better. not much but worth the effort. i sewed the green furry pants and the green furry neck cover. i had a red fleece hoodie but i cut the hood off and cut off thte hand pouch. then i sewed on all those medium sized pom-poms.  it came out perfectly. my twin club's holiday family party was a grinch theme. merry grinchmas! thank god one of the moms volunteered to wear this very hot costume.

i am so very sorry that this round up was so late. life got seriously in the way! my husband is feeling much better and is doing really well so far. i had two holiday parties to organize and they went off without a hitch. then i myself collapsed with a cold for a few days. now i am back to blogging a bit and thought i best get this round up, well, rounded up.thank you to everyone who participated in this little event. there all look delicious and i want to try them all!blog: a french foodie in the cityrecipe: warm rattes saladaurore, brings us a potato salad with a simple vinaigrette. i had never heard of the ratte potato from france. to me it looks like a fingerling potato and from her description it sounds like one too. but you know that there are loads of little differences in all things on this bountiful earth.blog: kitchen infernorecipe: autumn salad of mesclun with st andre and hot walnut dressingmickey has made a salad that i could eat all the time. you just have to mention st. andre cheese and i drool. i like to eat it with pears after supper. but now i am going to have it for supper.blog: eat drink talkrecipe: salad of red grapes, feta, rosemary and pumpkin seedsjennifer does not have an actual blog but she runs a cooking school in england. she has made this delicious sounding salad. she says that "the combination of the sweet grapes, the salty fetaand the rosemary might seem unusual but it really should be tried. it's especially delicious if the pumpkin seeds are still warm when you assemble the salads."blog: cooking in westchester the flavorful, spicy wayrecipe: persimmon, apple salad with a ginger lemon vinaigretterinku has made a salad with persimmon, a quintessential fall fruit. i bet the ginger lemon vinaigrette rounds out the smooth musky flavor of the fruit.blog: chronicles in culinary curiosityrecipe: 1,000 calorie saladdolores who mentions the salad making pitfalls on top chef makes what she calls her 1,000 calorie salad. i had to laugh because i love this kind of salad. toasted nuts err, i mean candied nuts and all the fixings!blog: savoury snackrecipe: pink fingertip saladamanda made a scrumptious beet & feta tabbouleh salad. a classic combination of flavors. the sweet beets and the sharp feta are a perfect match.blog: küchenlateinrecipe: pear coleslaw saladulrike made a delicious coleslaw in which she added pears. this is a very inventive addition which i will have to try as soon as i can.blog: jumbo empanadasrecipe: roast beet saladbrilynn joins us in the love of beets during the fall. i like the idea of adding fennel seeds to salad. that would add a nice twist.blog: up the creek without a patlrecipe: wilted spinach with warm bacon dressingpat makes a salad that i would call comfort food. when it is a really cold fall day and you are thinking it could be winter but the calender says it is still fall, then this is the salad for you.blog: gluten-free by the bayrecipe: roasted butternut squash, marconna almond and pomegranate saladby the bay roasts up some squash for this salad and sprinkles pomegranate all over. marconna almonds are sometiems hard to find but they are worth it.blog: married ...with dinnerrecipe: pear and arugula saladanita made one hearty salad but did not care for it which is surprising coming becuase it sounded delcious. but she made a new salad and came up with something she really liked, i think adding the guanciale is what did it.

about me





g


yes, a i am a reluctant housewife but i would not change it for the world. i love my husband and my twin toddler boys. i have yet to get a thrill from laundry or vacuuming. making three meals a day is a chore but i still love to cook. 

please pass the bon bons and hire me a maid.

i have had a passion for cooking since the day my mom let me pound down the freshly risen dough created from my grandmother's bread recipe. in fifth grade i chose julia child as my hero to write about in english class. growing up in the heart of new york city i was able to avidly explore the foods of the world. since then i have catered small parties and spent hours writing and testing recipes to share with my loyal audience. i began writing about food, its culture and history for a couple of websites before i had my twins.
