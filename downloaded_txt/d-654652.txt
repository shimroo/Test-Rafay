my paternal merkel families 


my paternal merkel line cab be traced back to the late 1600's with joseph merkel from iffezheim, germany. jacob merkel was my great grand father who left iffezheim and came to rochester in 1867. jacob had 11 children in rochester to continue the merkel ancestry.
           jacob's brother, anton, arrived in rochester in 1882. his wife was magdalena weber. the weber's are also from iffezheim, germany. i've followed the weber's back to the 1700's in iffezheim, germany.






my maternal merkel families 

my maternal merkel family begins with valentine merkel born 1789 in langenbrand, germany. valentine merkel arrived in rochester in 1851 along with his entire family. most of his children went on to have large families in the rochester and irondequoit areas. other families on my maternal side that i'm currently interested in are the sippel, pabst and dill families.
