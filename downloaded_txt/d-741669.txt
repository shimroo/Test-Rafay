bad wolf





god its been a minute since i posted or even payed attention to this blog. but maybe i'll bring it back as a place to update some artwork or just maybe ramble on about a thing or two. do people even still use blogger? idk. if you do, check in here once in a while. i may still surprise you.
here is a fairly new piece, the first of a series of girls i'm working on.

lorraine: pink cupcake





so, lots have been going on probably since i last blaaaggghed on here. i seem to be floating between industries right now. tattooing, gaming, tattooing, gaming. both have their ups and downs and i think i'm trying to find whats best for me and my family at the moment. bunch of drama on the gaming side of things but that comes with the territory. having a few issues right now at the company i'm at just trying to get paid and whats owed to me. but i'm passed trippin on that. that anger is just not doing anybody anygood and just stressing me the hell out. but i digress. anyways, seems like painting is therapeutic as usual. so here's a painting of the lovely miss lorraine tully. i know its been a minute since my last post, but thanks for your patience.

hourglass and forget-me-nots





cool little hourglass and forget-me-not flowers i designed up. this is the linework session on brittany's skinny little arm. seemed to give me a degree of difficulty. not as clean as i like but i'll tighten up everything on the color session.
