expository preaching
resources
powerful expository preaching
series, by ray stedman
part 1: the glory of
preaching
part 2: preparation of
expository sermons
part 3: the
accountability of the preacher
ray delivered these
talks at the first congress on the bible, held in 1982 in san diego. i've
transcribed them (with virtually no editing) from pbc tapes; realaudio files
are available at the raystedman.org. invaluable advice from one of the best expository
preachers. 
in these talks ray recommends two books on
expository preaching: preaching
and preachers by martyn lloyd-jones and between
two worlds: the art of preaching in the twentieth century by john stott
(originally entitled i believe in preaching). to these two fine books i
would add my recommendation for john piper's the
supremacy of god in preaching. order any of these through amazon by
clicking on the link.
i also highly recommend john piper's mullins
lectures on preaching at southern baptist theological seminary, september 14 to
16, 1999. two of his three talks are available as mp3 files at the sbts
website: "why does
preaching have such a prominent place in worship" and "a zeal that accords
with knowledge." 
an email list to encourage expository preaching:
expositor's quote of the week. follow this link to
join the list, or to read inspiring and challenging quotes on preaching from
the likes of martyn lloyd-jones, john stott, charles spurgeon, ray stedman,
john owen, and john piper.
