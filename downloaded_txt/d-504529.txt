what our customers are saying







i’ve been on many exodus trips and this ranks as one of the very best! 



sue duncombe

									
										cycle the back roads of sri lanka
																			






what a beautiful country with such a variety of things to do and see. incredible buddhist sites and sights, glorious scenery and wildlife.



patricia little

									
										sri lanka: wonders & wildlife – premium adventure
																			






children (and many adults) universally waved and hollered hellos as we pedaled past–one man giving a few of us a tour-de-france running push when he saw us struggling up a hill. we had a jam-packed schedule of riding, hiking, visiting temples, photographing elephants on a safari, getting a cooking demonstration (and recipes!), going on an epic train ride, swimming in the indian ocean, visiting a tea plantation and processing plant, seeing coconut husks turned into rope; taking tea, stopping for fresh pineapple, eating delicious sri lankan curries….it was an amazing adventure with really lovely, fun, game people.



kathy kranzfelder

									
										cycle the back roads of sri lanka
																			






a most enjoyable trip made excellent by our guide george (jorge).  i was not sure what to expect of belize so everything was new and interesting. a good balance of nature, culture, history and tropic island.  the people of belize were very warm and friendly and helpful so nice to travel amongst them.



helen ritter

									
										belize reef & ruins
																			






a brilliant trip that shows the diversity of  costa rica. from lagoons to rainforests to dry forests and cloud forests and beaches we saw so much of this lovely country and its flora and fauna. highly recommended.



peter & liz rooke

									
										discover costa rica
																			






2 weeks of breath taking scenery, superb quiet back roads , being guided round by a superb team , left wanting for nothing, excellent 



alan warne

									
										cycle the back roads of sri lanka
