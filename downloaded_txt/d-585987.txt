welcome to carb counter

carbohydrates, fat and protein are the basic building blocks of the foods we eat. carbohydrates come in many forms. sugars and starches are forms of carbohydrates. examples of foods that are high in carbohydrates include breads, pasta and cereal.
counting carbs is important to those on high-protein, low carb diets like the the atkins diet.  the basic premise of these diets is that we eat too many carbs and that we should instead eat high protein foods.
some research suggests that people with diabetes have a strong incentive to count carbs: when combined with exercise, a low carb diet might promote weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risk factors associated with diabetes. 
low carb diets are not for everyone however.  many athletes, especially those engaged in streneous aerobic exercise, purposely try to eat a high carb diet.  in fact, some athletes practice carbohydrate loading (carbo loading) in order to prevent the onset of fatigue during endurance activities. 
with carbohydrate information on more than 6000 foods, carb counter has the information you need whether you goal is a high carb diet or a low carb diet.
