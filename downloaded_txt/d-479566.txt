the ira allen house 



the ira allen house, featured in the boston globe and newsday, is a cozy country inn in the battenkill valley of southern vermont. it is one of the oldest inns in vermont and a state historic site. the tavern and the bedrooms above are over 200 years old. it was built by ethan allen, of green mountain boys fame and ira allen (ethan’s brother) who was the surveyor-general of vermont.the large hand-hewn beams and the handmade bricks of the fireplace testify to the age and history of the original building. the “new” part of the inn was added in approximately 1846, with wide-board floors throughout, and some handblown panes of glass still evident.
