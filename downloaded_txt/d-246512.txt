why hire robert ortiz photography

 

i’m a master of my own artistic craft      born in 1959 from a family of cuban immigrants, my dad and mom were divorced soon after being born. it was in 1960 when my dad left for cuba leaving behind a young impressionable son, many reels of 8mm movies, and a box full of photo negatives. it was these treasures, found 15 years later, that inspired me into a life of capturing life moments; being a photographer. this was the moving force behind my decision to go to college to earn an arts and communication degree. while at college, i learned about light, composition, and design. i also developed a love for black and white photography; owning my own darkroom for many years. photography, like most disciplines, requires much practice. in 1982, i was hired at a local camera shop in south florida. i worked in the photo retail business until 2004 acquiring technical skills that i still use today. with me, your wedding photography will be timeless, artistic, unique, and properly exposed. when you hire me, you’ll get a “master of the craft of wedding photography”, i’m trained and award winning!

   nh wedding * brewster academy



 

i love being a real & honest wedding photographer       over time, talking to other wedding photographers, i’ve observed they hate to do weddings. the reasons, they say, are due to the long hours and the high pressure causing them fatigue. they claim they only do it for the money. in this case, why are they doing something they don’t enjoy doing? shooting for me is quite different, i love doing weddings, i’m passionate and unobtrusive about it. it’s all about telling the special story of your wedding day.    wedding guests always tell me how much they enjoy watching me work at weddings, i guess they can tell i am having fun. i have a company motto, ‘show me the love” which i recite all day long. by the end of the day, i have half the guests and wedding party reciting the motto back to me!!! you’ll get superior service and wedding images lasting a lifetime. when you hire me you’ll get someone that “loves to photograph weddings” and….. don’t forget, “show me the love”
