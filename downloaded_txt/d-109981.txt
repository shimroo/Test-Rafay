11 things only a coffee snob would understand





i  got this article "11 things only a coffee snob would understand" from my cousin nina ha, and i like to go through each point and share what i think about them.
1, pre-ground coffee is not an option. a brew from the pre-ground coffee is a flat brown swell. grind your beans just before brewing. i am not like some who have their grinders in their offices. that is hardcore!

2, making morning pour-over is actually kind of meditative. who are these people? who meditates in the morning? it is go-go-go. a double shot espresso or a cappuccino (if i have extra few minutes.)

3, the crema is one of life's greatest joys. crema is a sign of properly made espresso. the sight of crema does not mean it is good, however. i can only count with 2 hands for those memorable awesome espresso. they will blow your mind, thus, they are called "godshot!"

4. how it feels when someone says 'expresso'. a sign of non coffee drinker, and don't get me start with how to spell "columbia." :)

5. you are way more interested in how recently the coffee was roasted than how dark/caffeinated it is. yes, coffee is like bread, the fresher the better, but, we usually allow 2 days for "degassing." it is kinda like resting the grilled meat. no, i am not trying to be funny. the peak flavor comes in 7th day after roast. if the bag has opened for 2 weeks, then you are drinking some flat brown swell.

6. "coffee creamer" will do no such thing. i don't judge, but i prefer my coffee, black.

 7. the stuff in here is a last resort. you are not a coffeesnob. you are a caffeine junkie.

 8. this is one of the nicest things someone can do for you. i appreciate a nice poured latte art, but the foam has to be melt marshmallow good!

9. this isn't coffee. again, i don't judge. actually without starby, there would be no coffee like what we have now. my first starbucks' coffee was an iced americano, next to chicago board of options exchange, because it was easy for me to pronounce it, but i had no idea what it was. starby is like mickey d's, you know what you will get. i do drink charbucks!

10. this mostly gets used for cold brew now. french press is the easiest way to prepare and enjoy a nice cup of coffee. it can be messy to clean though. i have a design in mind, and i need find a good product designer and a good patent lawyer. cold brew? it is winter now!

11. you know what this is called and how it works. yes, yes, yes! i have seen it when i was a kid. it is nothing new in far east, it is only here because some folks think they are cool and cutting edge. that is silly!

as for the video at the end, there are some goofs..one example, coffeesnobs will not drink a "piping hot" coffee.

so, am i a coffeesnob? i think it depends on who the person i see myself in the mirror. i am guilty to be caught up in the moment from time to time. i had spent $10 for a cup of highly hyped panama hacienda la esmeralda ,and all i can say is been there, done that.

 i enjoy a nice cup of coffee from "colombia" or my favorite zesty ethiopia’s idido misty valley that don't command over $100 for a bag.

 i think coffeesnobs will drink the coffee from the beans coming out of some cats' poochutes. i don't drink that sh*t. :)
