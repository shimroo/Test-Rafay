one reason old people don't update their stuff






walk into an old person’s home and chances that it feels
old: old furniture, old decor, old everything. 
i used to think that it was because once you get old you don’t care
about keeping up with things, or maybe you don’t have money to keep updating
stuff, or maybe you don't want to spend money again on something you already updated when you were younger.
now i realize there is another reason old people don’t
update their stuff: they don’t realize how fast time is passing.  i
ran into this exact experience with my home wifi network of all things.
i spent a lot of time putting in a mesh wifi network into my home
in 2018.  i got it working, then pretty much forgot about it.  when i turned on my
home devices, they got internet.  if i
got a new  gadget, i hooked it up to the network and it worked. 
now 2018 doesn’t seem too long ago (to me), but it is six
years ago, over 2,000 days.  when i was a
kid six years took forever, and i got not one, but two college degrees
in six years, which also seemed to last forever when i was a young adult.
and in tech, six years is definitely a huge amount of time, and during that time wifi got updated,
faster, could go further, and so on.  
time had passed me by, and i didn’t even know it since to me in my 50s, six years
now seems like six months.
i would have still been oblivious about my ancient wifi system but i ran across an online
bandwidth tester, tried it out and saw it was much lower than the big number
that my cable company justifies for their ever increasing monthly rate.  so i spent a whopping $200 at amazon for a new
system and took all of ten minutes to upgrade my home network.  my home network is now five times faster than it was, with a noticeable improvement in buffering and latency.
now this was cheap and easy to do, so it was not about money or technical ability.  it just never occurred to
me how much time had
passed since i installed it.  if you had asked me when i put in my wifi system i would have said it felt like a year or two ago. 
so i was getting old inside my house and not even knowing it,
which i now realize happens to a lot of old people.  they are just fine with what is going on
inside their house, they just don’t realize how fast time is passing outside of
it.

you can’t bequeath kindle books





 after my dad passed away i had to go through the mess that
was his office.  buried in one of his
desk drawers was my mother’s ipad.  she
passed away in early 2022, so her vintage 2018 ipad sat buried in a drawer for
two and a half years.
thinking i might be able to ebay it for $50 i re-powered the
battery and booted it up and spent all of one minute cracking the pass code using
her birthday.  once i was in i found my dad
did delete her email before throwing it into a drawer, but he didn’t delete her
kindle ap. 
kindle was still was linked her unused amazon account (separate
from my dad’s) and has over 100 books, a treasure trove of reading that she
would have paid over $1k from the time she started migrating from paper to
electronic around 2012.  the problem is
how to get $1k of content off the old $50 ipad over to my ipad?
turns out that when you buy an ebook, you don’t own it.  you only are getting a license to use it untilyou die.  that’s right, ebooks and similar content cannot be passed down or transferred,
so i can’t tell amazon i am the rightful heir and to send that $1k of ebooks my way
post haste.  in fact, if you tell amazon
someone is dead and prove it they will clamp down their account right quick. 
the obvious way around this would be to pretend she is still
alive, log into her amazon account, and put me on “family sharing”, which is
how you normally share ebooks in a household. 
i luckily found her old amazon password on a piece of paper in another
drawer, which sat idle for the past two and a half years.  the bad news is after 2.5 years without activity
amazon wants two-factor proof for me to log in, and both the email and
phone that are on her account were shut down long ago.  
i could try to social engineer amazon support into
updating her account with a new email and phone (and over the phone is the only
way to do this), or i could just use her old ipad as a reader until i get
through her content.
before deciding what to do i went through the content and
deleted anything i already read, which removed over two dozen books (mostly
books we recommended to one another, so makes sense).  looking at what was left, turns out her
tastes were a bit different from mine. 
the remaining library is a good 2/3 police procedurals, which i might
grab for a plane flight, but otherwise find boring (same story over and
over).  the remaining 1/3 has a few
novels which look interesting, but in the end it is definitely not the full $1k
in content i was originally expecting.
at the end of the day i will skip trying to cheat my way
past amazon and just keep the ipad as a reader until i get through the books i
want to read, then finally get rid of it. 
by the time i sell the old ipad its value will be less than the $50 it
is worth today, but i will make up for that by reading a few books off it.

youtube category “scantily clad women playing piano”





i (re)started playing piano ten months ago as a hobby.  my mother made me take lessons as a kid,
which i hated, then half a century later i tried it again and was like “wow,
i really enjoy this, why didn’t i do this sooner?”  my second thought is “how good can i get
before i die?”  
my main interest is classical, so right now i am working on –
count ‘em – four chopin pieces.  some youtuber
i was watching early in my hobby said “every serious piano student has a special
relationship with chopin”, which i thought “yeah, whatever”, then
three months later i was going ocd on chopin.
my main piano teacher is mr. youtube, which carries just an
amazing array of teachers.  whatever your
style, musical interest, or main learning method, there is someone out there making
videos for you (usually with a come-on to subscribe for custom content or
remote lessons).  what i really like is
pulling ideas and techniques from multiple people: this guy had a great comment
that made my mind “click” on chord inversions, that gal has an interesting
technique for fingering, etc.  and when i
get stuck on something simple (two handed fingering for the non-standard b-flat
scale), there is always a video with the answer.   i think a lot of my quick progress is having
this wide an access to teachers and techniques instead of just old, tired mrs.
lassiter when i was seven.
since youtube is feeding me piano lessons and techniques, it
started feeding me similar subjects like “scantily clad women paying the piano”.  now, i get why these are out there.   for men, having an almost naked women
playing beautiful music in the background while you relax is practically a
jungian archetype.  i just find the existence
of the content amusing and wonder if the audience is music nerds who need eye
candy, or people who are looking for eye candy and put up with the classical
music.

for the record the performers are talented, and i give them
extra marks for being able to concentrate with high drafts.
my guess is the audience is just lonely male musicians as
there are plenty of other youtube topics that throw in babes.  case in point is there are a bunch of “home
repair do it yourself” videos that instead of having bob or frank walk you
through how to replace a water heater, it is instead a woman in a bikini.  and if a guy has to watch a youtube video of
something, why not add some eye candy?
