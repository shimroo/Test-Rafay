be at the center of a dynamic legal landscape!
touro law center’s long island campus, adjacent to a state courthouse and federal courthouse, offers full-time, part-time day, and flextime jd programs, providing unique opportunities for teaching and learning. the work of the federal and state courts is integrated into the daily law school experience and students are in the courtroom from their first year of school. additionally, our hybrid, 4-year flextime jd program is offered at our state-of-the-art cross river campus in times square in manhattan. being in the center of the global and financial capital of the world enhances learning opportunities from some of the top legal minds in the country. at both campuses, students gain doctrinal knowledge and develop skills, professional values, and early practice opportunities through simulated and real lawyering experiences in our classrooms, clinics, and field placements.
if you’re looking at law schools in new york and would like to schedule a tour, visit a class, or communicate with a current touro law student, faculty member, or another member of the touro law alumni community, please contact our admissions office at admissions@tourolaw.edu or (631) 761-7010.
