benefits of choosing genex diagnostics 














 




							save money by ordering direct from the dna laboratory						







the complete cost for a dna is $79 (results in 3 working days) 






 




							we are one of the largest providers of legal and private dna paternity testing services and we sell more dna home testing kits than any other company.						







we are one of the largest and most experienced dna testing facilities in the world.we have sold thousands of testing kits to patients throughout the world, process over 100,000 individual patient samples every year and have maintained a perfectly flawless record.we have lived up to our promise for each of the tens of thousands of patients that we have helped over the years. 






 




							genex is not a broker						








brokers forward your samples to another laboratory for testing and charge a marked-up price for the test or provide very low quality tests for low prices.
buying directly from genex allows you to save time and money by dealing direct with the testing laboratory.
usually resellers do not have an address or operate from postal mail boxes. just look for the address. if the address for the company is missing or if the address has the letters “pmb” (stands for postal mail box), it is likely you are dealing with a online reseller, not a laboratory.
do not be fooled. by ordering directly from the testing laboratory you pay less than with a broker, but the quality of testing is much greater. your test is important to us. do not settle for less.
 






 




							by choosing a large and well established laboratory, you will benefit from our years of experience and our vast resources.						








our laboratory is equipped with the most modern instruments and utilizes the newest dna technology.
smaller testing facilities often do not have the resources to purchase expensive automated laboratory equipment and cannot produce the high quality testing offered by larger labs.
 










 




							we offer a full 100% money back accuracy guarantee.						








we guarantee >99.9% for inclusions and 100% for exclusions, ensuring that conclusive answers are provided for every paternity test.
 






 




							our home testing kits are easy to use, allowing the dna testing process to be fast, simple, and hassle free.						








collection is fast and simple, and results are available as soon as 3 days after testing.
 






 




							if you proceed with private testing and decide later that you need to have a legally admissible test performed, we will deduct the price of your private test from the cost of the legal test so that you do not need to pay twice.						








all legal dna tests are aabb accredited and iso accredited with a strict-chain-of-custody and are fully admissible in court in every state in the world.
the legal tests are recognized for use in immigration, child support, and estate dispute issues.
 






 




							our laboratory ensures the highest testing standards						








our testing laboratory participates in the paternity testing proficiency program of the college of american pathologists (cap) which includes rigorous laboratory proficiency testing three times each year.
the complete dna fingerprint and laboratory data is provided for every test.
if you are not satisfied with the services associated with a kit from another company, be informed that swabtest is a trusted dna laboratory which will be able to provide you with a much higher quality test at a lower cost and faster turnaround time using the swabs that you have received. our laboratory will be able to assist you directly at staff@swabtest.com we perform 3 out of every 4 private tests and we are one of the largest and most experienced dna testing facilites.
