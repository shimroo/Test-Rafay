bill's marine service
serving deep creek lake for 60 years
since 1958, bill’s marine service has seen many changes on deep creek lake, but our mission remains unchanged. we find the perfect balance between maximizing customer experience on and off the water while creating an empowered, fun, & safe environment for our team of experts. new customers, returning customers, and employees will all be treated equally as an important part of our family.

bill’s marine service has three locations on deep creek lake stretching across garrett county, md's beautiful, scenic views. all three locations offer service for a wide range of boats purchased from bill’s marine service, including pontoons, stern drives, and inboard boats. we also service the surrounding areas, expanding our family tree onto cheat lake, tygart lake, tygart river, the monongahela river, and indian lake.

the main showroom, located on garrett highway, is home to the full lineup of boats offered at bill’s marine service. we proudly offer bennington pontoon boats, cobalt boats, moomba boats, and nautique boats for sale. whether you want to wakesurf, waterski, cruise, or sit comfortably at your dock, bill's has the perfect boat for you.

bill’s marine service has fun rental options for people of all ages and interests. if you want to go for a nice, relaxing cruise, catch that monster fish you will talk about for years to come, or even paddle the lake yourself, we have you covered! we offer rental options for pontoons ranging from 75 hp to 115 hp, lowe fishing boats, single & double kayaks, stand-up paddle boards, and tubes that can be added to any boat rental.

let our family maximize your time on the water!
