a healthy lifestyle (hls) is a person’s lifestyle aimed at preventing disease and promoting health. no matter how perfect medicine is, it cannot rid everyone of all diseases. man is the creator of his own health, which must be fought for.
healthy lifestyle
according to the definition of the world health organization (who), “health is a state of physical, spiritual and social well-being, not just the absence of disease and physical defects.” it is known that our genes determine 10% of our health, the environment in which we live by 20%, the level of medical care for another 10%, and the remaining 60% – a healthy lifestyle.
these are the main components of health. remember: a healthy lifestyle allows you to largely reveal those valuable personality traits that are so necessary in the conditions of modern dynamic development. this is, first of all, high mental and physical performance, social activity, creative longevity. a conscientious and responsible attitude towards health as a public domain should become the norm of life and behavior of all people. the widespread adoption of a healthy lifestyle is a matter of national importance, nationwide, and at the same time it concerns each of us.

regime of the day and human health.
a rational combination of the elements of the mode of life ensures a more productive work of a person and a high level of his health. the whole organism as a whole participates in human labor activity. the labor rhythm sets a physiological rhythm: at certain hours the body is under stress, as a result of which the metabolism increases, blood circulation increases, and then a feeling of fatigue appears; at other hours, days when the load is reduced, rest comes after fatigue, strength and energy are restored. the correct alternation of load and rest is the basis for a high human performance.
rational nutrition and its importance for health.
proper nutrition is, first of all, a varied diet, taking into account the genetic characteristics of a person, his age, physical activity, climatic and seasonal characteristics of the environment. it allows the body to maximize its genetic potential, but the body is not able to surpass this potential, no matter how well the nutrition is organized.
it should be noted that there are no foods that are good or bad in themselves. all food products have nutritional value to one degree or another, but there is no ideal food either. it is important not only what we eat, but how much we eat, when we eat and in what combinations we eat certain foods.
influence of physical activity and hardening
physical culture has an important impact on a person’s ability to adapt to sudden and strong functional fluctuations. in total, a person has 600 muscles, and this powerful locomotor apparatus requires constant training and exercise. muscular movements create a huge stream of nerve impulses heading to the brain, maintain the normal tone of the nerve centers, charge them with energy, and relieve emotional overload. in addition, people who are constantly involved in physical education look more attractive outwardly. physical education is the best measure to prevent alcohol consumption, smoking and drug addiction.
the duration of exposure to the sun should initially not exceed 5 minutes. it is gradually increased to 40-50 minutes, but no more. it should be remembered that excessive exposure to the sun can lead to overheating of the body, sunstroke, and burns.
