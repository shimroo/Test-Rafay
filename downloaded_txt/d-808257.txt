north central kansas community network
the non-profit internet solution for rural communities
north central kansas community network, also known as nckcn, is a public/private partnership with the north central regional planning commission (ncrpc). nckcn
							is a non-profit private organization that currently serves 14 communities within north central kansas with high-speed fixed wireless internet as well as
							provides other great services, such as: email, web hosting, etc. to these and other locations. nckcn is head-quartered in beloit, ks.
						
nckcn was organized in december of 1995 as a non-profit organization in the state of kansas and is registered as such with the secretary of state.
							it is managed by a board of directors.
						
"the mission of nckcn is to make available and promote the use of informational technology, the open development, evolution, and use of the internet and
							other related services in order to foster economic development for the benefit of the citizens throughout north central kansas."
mission revised: 10/18/2017
adopted by nckcn's board of directors
ian draemel, former president (2016 - 2021)

nckcn has set forth and continues to adhere to the following goals since its inception:
â€¢ to benefit those individuals and communities that find themselves left out of the technology revolution at the current time and thereby begin
							the immediate process of developing a cultural awareness of informational technology in rural communities.
						
â€¢ to broaden everyone's view of community and lessen the sense of rural isolation by heightening local awareness of the human and physical
							resources possessed by the whole of north central kansas that can be accessed to address local need.
						
â€¢ to broaden the application and use of informational technology within the education and business structure of north central kansas through
							demonstration and education.
