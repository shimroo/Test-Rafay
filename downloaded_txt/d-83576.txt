foster care
it is instinct. it is common sense. children belong in families. children are simply unable to care for their own needs. they require and deserve the support, knowledge, love, and nurturing care that only a family can provide. a child needs this care to grow and mature as a healthy person; to thrive.learn more



 




 











adoption and permanency
daunte culpepper, dave thomas (the founder of wendy's restaurants), eleanor roosevelt, george washington carver, nancy reagan, and sarah mclachlan... what do these famous persons have in common? they were all adopted! each one of these people is an example of how a child can rise above trauma, and flourish under the loving care of a family.learn more



 







 











maryland respite care
respite care keeps families together by providing temporary relief from the rigors of raising a child with special needs.  as a respite caregiver you provide a vital service in the community and help prevent children from entering long term out-of-home care.learn more
