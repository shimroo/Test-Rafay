welcome to taste of health! i’m glad you are here.
did you know taste of health has two websites?
you have landed on my ministry website www.tasteofhealth.net, which was created for people looking for information on how i survived crohn’s disease. you will also find recipes here that were created during my seven years of cooking programs on three angels broadcasting network. if that is what you were searching for, then you will find that info on this site.
my office website can be found at www.tasteofhealth.biz. after completing my holistic health practitioner certification and live blood cell microscopist studies, i opened an office downtown columbia, sc. i now offer cryo t-shock fat freezing, toning, and cryofacials, in addition to nutritional counselling, live blood cell analysis, alcat food sensitivity testing, bemer micro-circulation therapy, and biomat far infrared therapy.
my  office is located inside the brazilian wax & spa 
at 2301 devine street, columbia, sc. 803-936-1714 est
i look forward to serving you! feel free to call me to set up your appointment or book online through my office website.
