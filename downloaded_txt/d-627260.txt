financial assistance for service members


we understand the challenges that our active-duty service members (to include activated guard/reserve members) and their families can face, and we believe that experiencing financial difficulties should not be one of them. that's the premise behind the vfw’s financial assistance for service members program.
the financial assistance for service members program is here to help america's active-duty service members (to include activated guard/reserve members) and their families who have run into unexpected financial difficulties because of deployment or other military-related activity or injury. the program provides financial assistance up to $2,500 to assist daily necessities in the form of a grant – not a loan – so no repayment is required. to further ease the burden, we pay the creditor(s) directly.
the needs of our active-duty service members (to include activated guard/reserve members) and their families should never go unmet. let us offer you a hand-up when you need it!
for additional information, and to see if you or someone you know qualifies for a grant through the financial assistance for service members program, please review the financial assistance for service members eligibility criteria.   
 

if you have any questions, please send us an email or call us at 1.866.789.6333.
