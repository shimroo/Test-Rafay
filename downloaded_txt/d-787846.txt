who we are
kintura is a nonprofit organization formed in 2024 from the merger of brightspire and the well-spring group, enabling us to more effectively meet the needs of older adults.
 
at the heart of our mission are our life plan communities, which offer a wide range of independent living options. each community has its own unique environment, culture, and amenities, ensuring that residents can find a space that truly feels like home. we also provide a comprehensive continuum of care, including independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing, and memory support.
 
in addition to community living, kintura is dedicated to supporting a diverse population of older adults. through well-spring solutions, we offer adult day services, respite programs, home care, and caregiver education. as a majority partner in pace of the triad, we provide all-inclusive care in multiple north carolina counties. we also work on affordable housing initiatives in raleigh, further strengthening our commitment to the community we serve.
