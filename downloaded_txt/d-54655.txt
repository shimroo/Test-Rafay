 volkwagen type 2 bus fire warning:



have you just bought a bus? are you excited about going camping? it's never too early to change those 40 years old fuel lines before your big trip! maybe you think this fires are a rare ocurrence? it happens all the time.
you must carry a fire extinguisher at all times (if not for you, for the poor vw you see on fire). finally, do not take the risk of driving your newly purchased bus home without changing the fuel lines first.
