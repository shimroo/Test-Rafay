adopt a boxer rescue

          we at aabr, believe that a boxer is just about the perfect friend. however, he or she will demand a lot from you. they’ll rely on you for nearly everything; food, water, shelter, protection, training, exercise, grooming, veterinary care, and of course love and companionship. while it is important to choose the right boxer for your needs, it is equally important to ensure that you can meet theirs. you must prepare for their arrival, and make them a well-mannered and welcome member of your community. the responsibilities of being a guardian of any dog are great, but the love and
          friendship you’ll receive in return is priceless.
        
be a hero
