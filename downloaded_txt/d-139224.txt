bilingual searches are now possible


    					we have added a feature to help you to conduct searches simultaneously in english and french. this will enable you to use more terms in your search query and will provide you with a longer list of results. our improvement will help those of you who know your search criteria in one of canada's official languages but not the other. if you do not wish to use the bilingual search feature, you can do a simple basic search. for more detailed instructions, please refer to the 
    					searching with english and french criteria 
    					 section.
