repeatedly recognized as the online source for baseball related history: national geographic said, "everything you want to know about baseball is on this site." sports collectors digest said, "this site doesn't have any rivals. every historical information or feat you want on baseball is right here." yahoo once wrote, "if god were a baseball fan, this site is what his attic would look like."



"baseball almanac: this site offers one-stop shopping for facts, statistics, and trivia on professional baseball. organized by categories such as all-star games, awards, fabulous feats, famous firsts, hall of fame, player stats, record book and year in review, the site also features current baseball news and 'today in baseball history' notes. all of the information on the baseball almanac site itself is free. this is a useful site both for baseball fanatics as well as for those just wanting to check a fact or brush up on their baseball knowledge." - library of congress. library of congress online catalog (lccn 2003557424). 18 august 2020.
