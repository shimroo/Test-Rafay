what our clients say:






 besides great features, the ruggedness and service life of wheeler-rex threading machines is outstanding. company-wide we probably operate over 200 or more machines. weâve tried all major brandsâ¦ but without question, wheeler-rex model 6794 threaders are definitely the best for a host of reasons. our distributors canât afford to have a threader that wonât stand up the work load.”
bill sendtko, fabrication trainercrane resistoflex corp.







 wheeler rex hydrostatic test pumps are the only pumps we use for testing and have done so for 21 years. we get them with the honda engines and are one pull starts all of the time in any weather. we do a lot of high concentration disinfection for long runs of large diameter pipe and i can say that i have had our pumps continuously pumping for over 23 hours. never a problem. we own four of them and still use the one we purchased in 1995.”
donna d'amore and ed hannigansouth shore pipeline services, inc.







 employees from our many locations compliment the ease of use of wheeler-rex pipe threading machines due to their ease of set up and lightweight design. not only is the price point competitive, but wheeler-rex pipe threading machines are easier to handle than ridgid. as a plumbing and heating supply company, we are completely satisfied with wheeler-rex.”
aaron colaluca, presidentsmithfield supply







 i am the manager at a prefabrication shop for an electrical supply house. we purchased your 6790 threader a few months back and i just wanted to let you know how awesome the machine is. i had never used a large threader before, just cheaply made hand threaders. in no time at all after watching a couple videos and reading the instructions i was threading away. now i am threading all sorts of pipe for custom customer orders. thanks for making such a great product.”
ryan cruz, prefabrication managerstandard electric
