in 1999 at the ripe ol' age of 20... i started my first business (in the direct mail world) and since that day (now almost 25 years ago) i have been officially unemployable!

having my own online business has given me a freedom i’m completely addicted to, and i thank god on a daily basis that he put me on this path. i’ve had more opportunities and experiences in my 40+ years on this earth. it would take several lifetimes to do, see, and be what i’ve been in this one single amazing life and i owe it all to always having my own business.

the first few years of my journey were great, but things really got popping in 2004 when i started my first online business and since then have created several more online business in over 20 different niches. 

i’ve done everything from creating and selling digital product and doing affiliate marketing to creating and selling websites and being a blogger. there’s not many online businesses i haven’t tried my hand at.

bottom line…

i’ve got a lot of experience with creating online businesses that make money and change lives and my big purpose in life is showing up and helping people like you who want to do the same thing.

if you want to create an online business and turn your life into your own creation then follow me and i’ll tell you everything i know!
i look forward to helping you on this journey!keepin' up with liz...want to know the truth behind liz tomey (that’s me)?
