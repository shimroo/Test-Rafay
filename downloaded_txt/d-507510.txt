adopting is one of the best things you can do.when you adopt, you’re not just giving a deserving dog a home. you’re also reducing the demand for puppy mills and other industrial-scale breeding operations that put profit before animal welfare. not able to adopt?  volunteer at our shelter or as a foster hero!
