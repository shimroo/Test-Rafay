           "the prosecutor is a servant of the people and the government. he is 
            an advocate for both. he must be vigilant in the quest to seek out 
            and convict the guilty, but must also ensure that the innocent are 
            not wrongly convicted or oppressed. he must strive to preserve the 
            public welfare and safety of all citizens. he must always seek justice."
