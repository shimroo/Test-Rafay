on september 9, 1941, bern leon gentry, sr., was born in 
a goldsboro, north carolina farmhouse, to theodore and 
ruth (taylor) gentry.  bern was the oldest of two children, 
he and his younger sister, lois.
the family moved and he grew up in camden, new jersey, 
where he attended powell elementary and burrough junior 
high.  he graduated from woodrow wilson high school 
and attended both temple and rutgers universities.
from the tender age of 8, bern was an entrepreneur.  
he started his first business selling italian ice out of his 
wagon outside his uncleâs pool hall. even then, there were 
signs of the ultimate salesman. he would later become 
sales manager over several sears stores during his 20âs.
