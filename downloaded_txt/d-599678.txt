who we are 



a family operated fish camp 











grape hammock is a family-owned marina on the south end of lake kissimmee in lake wales, florida. lake kissimmee is known for its lunker bass, plentiful pan fish and spectacular scenery. grape hammock fish camp is far enough away from the city to enjoy tranquility and breathe fresh air, yet only and hour and a half away from central florida attractions.the camp has a boat ramp and parking area. at the bait shop we sell gas, ice, snacks and drinks. fishing licenses can also be purchased. our bait includes worms, minnows, shiners and crickets (seasonal). our camp consists of a mobile home park, rv park, tent camping sites, boat slips, dry storage and cabin rentals. there are public restrooms, showers, and a laundry facility onsite. 











we are ranked #1 florida fish camp by onlyinyourstate.com

"this air boat tour is well managed, and professionally run. the knowledge of the lake, and wildlife make it personal,and up close . the loop around brahma island was rewarded with views of large deer with antlers."

trip advisor review 







 



"this is a good place to stay when fresh water fishing on lake kissimmee. the place is for fishing and is away from towns; great if you just want to fish and do the "nature" thing. they have grills by the cabins so you can cook out. "
