meet lyndalynda tait randle, as bill gaither has fondly introduced her for over a decade, was born in the inner city of washington, d.c. she is the middle child of seven and feels blessed to have had the privilege of being raised in a christian home. despite being led to the lord at the young age of 12, it would be years later before she really experienced the freedom from bondage that only god could give. music became a way out of pain and heartache for lynda and as a result of this god-given gift, many doors of opportunity have opened up for her.lynda’s distinct alto voice has created opportunities for her to minister across the united states and around the world. her gift has allowed her to share the stage with musical and spiritual legends such as andre crouch and billy graham, and she has been a cherished favorite on the gaither homecoming videos and tour since 1993.
