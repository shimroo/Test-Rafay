from george davis and michael clark
"...the voice of one crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the lord" (john 1:23)
"for he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is god" (hebrews 11:10)
thank you for visiting our site.  since we often share what the lord has shown us and write together on many of our books and articles, we combined our two web sites into one. god has given us an exceptional fellowship in his son as we continue to walk in the light he has given us.
we try to listen to the lord and share articles that speak to you who are seeking him with all your hearts. this site is dedicated to the dear saints who are pressing into god's kingdom and allowing him to change them day by day into the image of christ. many are hearing the call of the lord to discard the old wineskins of tradition and follow him. much of what is written here has come from our own personal trials and wilderness experience where the lord taught us things that will not be heard in seminaries or found in the average bible commentary. thus the name of this site, "a wilderness voice in search of a city."
for those of you who might want to read our articles offline, we have put them in pdf format.  if you don't have the adobe reader already, download it now.
