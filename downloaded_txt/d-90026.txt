what makes drake unique
for 40 years the drake institute has made biofeedback and brain map guided neurofeedback the centerpiece of its treatment programs. it gives us a safe and non-invasive method to access brain functions to facilitate neurophysical improvement, thereby reducing or eliminating symptoms. this is the cornerstone of our treatment programs, not simply an add on to other therapies or medications. our goal is to reduce symptoms and ultimately decrease or eliminate medications when appropriate. because it has been the central treatment for our patients for 40 years, it has enabled the drake institute to develop leading edge knowledge and clinical experience in its applications for adhd, autism spectrum disorders, and stress related disorders or diseases. all of these disorders have one thing in common: at their core is irregular brain function.






brain mapping



non-invasive qeeg brain mapping is analogous to a physician performing a throat culture on a patient with a throat infection to determine which antibiotic would best eradicate the infection. brain mapping gives answers to what’s going on below the surface. the brain map analysis gives us important information to more effectively help improve the quality of life and productivity of each individual patient. qeeg (quantitative electro- encephalogram) or brain mapping is an essential diagnostic procedure for developing non-drug treatment protocols for add / adhd, autism, learning disorders, anxiety, substance abuse, depression and stress related illnesses.

neurofeedback
brain mapping data guides our development of neurofeedback treatment protocols which will enable the patient to strengthen and improve brain functioning, reducing their unwanted symptoms. we have used this technology for over 35 years because we know clinically it produces the best long term results for many disorders. neurofeedback is safe and can lead to long term improvement, unlike the drugs, because neurofeedback uses a learning process that strengthens and develops the synaptic connections in the brain.

“david f. velkoff, m.d., our medical director and co-founder, supervises all evaluation procedures and treatment programs. he is recognized as a physician pioneer in using biofeedback, qeeg brain mapping, neurofeedback, and neuromodulation in the treatment of adhd, autism spectrum disorders, and stress related illnesses including anxiety, depression, insomnia, and high blood pressure.

dr. david velkoff earned his master’s degree in psychology from the california state university at los angeles in 1975, and his doctor of medicine degree from emory university school of medicine in atlanta in 1976. this was followed by dr. velkoff completing his internship in obstetrics and gynecology with an elective in neurology at the university of california medical center in irvine. he then shifted his specialty to neurophysical medicine and received his initial training in biofeedback/neurofeedback in neurophysical medicine from the leading doctors in the world in biofeedback at the renown menninger clinic in topeka, kansas. in 1980, he co-founded the drake institute of neurophysical medicine.

seeking to better understand the link between illness and the mind, dr. velkoff served as the clinical director of an international research study on psychoneuroimmunology with the ucla school of medicine, department of microbiology and immunology, and the pasteur institute in paris. this was a follow-up study to an earlier clinical collaborative effort with ucla school of medicine demonstrating how the drake institute's stress treatment resulted in improved immune functioning of natural killer cell activity.

dr. velkoff  served as one of the founding associate editors of the scientific publication, journal of neurotherapy. he has been an invited guest lecturer at los angeles children's hospital, ucla, cedars sinai medical center-thalians mental health center, st. john's hospital in santa monica,
california, and chadd. he has been a medical consultant in neurophysical medicine to cnn, national geographic channel, discovery channel, univision, and pbs.”
