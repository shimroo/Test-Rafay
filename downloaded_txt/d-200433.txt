seeing your real estate needsfrom a different perspectivelearn more



 









 

vision + grit.

 

50 years ago, when bart simon decided to leave the classroom as a high school teacher to become a real estate developer, he had no money and no experience.  nothing more than grit, some great ideas, and the ability to see things from a different perspective.  today, north pointe realty continues that legacy.  vision + grit. and nearly five decades of experience of seeing real estate from a different perspective.
