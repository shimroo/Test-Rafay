after
  10+ years and 120 feature articles, radical middle newsletter has come
  to an end (see goodbye article here).




but
  because political change in the u.s. is so slow, most of our articles are as
  timely now as ever!  ive linked
  the best ones for you below, then introduced and provided links to my earlier
  work  visionary work that paved the way to radical middle and, more
  broadly, pointed the way to a new political philosophy that takes everybody's deepest needs
  into account.  many of us are still working on that.  m. s.

writing
  in opendemocracy, policy analyst michael
  edwards argues for a new, trans-partisan politics  and (beginning
  at paragraph #9) shows that satins work is foundational to that politics.

ii.
  letter from mark satin about his work from 1974 to now




picture below: satin guest-lecturing at u.c.-berkeley, 2010.




dear viewer,




i
  have spent my entire adult life attempting to articulate the life-giving new
  post-liberal, post-socialist political ideology that i believe is arising just
  beneath the surface of things.




in my youth i expressed
  it in new age politics: healing self and society (dell 1979, orig.
  canada 1976).  that book, which
  received over 50 mainstream and alternative media reviews, and which led to more
  than 90 public and radio appearances, is still under attack from
  conservative christians and left-wing intellectuals. 
  you can now see much of it here:




to bring my feminist,
  ecological, decentralist, world-order, and human-growth ideas into the
  political arena, i helped organize and run a national political organization
  called the new world alliance (1979  1983). 
  although political observers today remember it as a precursor to the
  u.s. green party, it was in fact a more politically diverse and more genuinely
  beyond-left-and-right type entity, even a proto-radical-centrist entity, as
  you can see here.




in my washington,
  d.c.-based international political newsletter new options (1984 
  1992), i examined innovative policy proposals, groups, and books through my
  transformational lens.  new
  options  which won utne readers first alternative press
  award for general excellence: best publication from 10,000 to 30,000
  circulation  was notable for its influence and honesty, which didnt
  endear it to some activists.  you
  can now view much of it here.




as the 21st century
  began (and i entered my 50s!), i developed a more pragmatic version of the
  emerging political ideology.  the
  book that resulted, radical middle: the politics we need now (westview
  press and basic books, 2004), was named outstanding book for 2004 by the
  ecological and transformational politics section (section #26) of the american
  political science association.  you
  can see excerpts here.




to help develop my
  version of radical centrism, and apply radical-centrist ideas to the issues of
  the day, i produced radical middle newsletter (1999  2009), stopping
  because of an eye condition.  fifty
  representative articles are linked above, and all 120 of them can be found here.




my writings are
  unusually rich in ideas and information. 
  i hope you not only enjoy them, but are able to make good use of them.




best,  mark
  satin




p.s. 
  i am working on a final political book, as steadily as my macular edema
  will allow.  my working title: this
  revolution will be for adults.

  by jeremy berg.

new
  age politics:
  our only real alternative ... stands as the first comprehensive
  articulation of a transformational political ideology. 
  it shows, in great and systemic detail, how we can depthfully
  understand our world of crisis and  get to a world of collaboration and
  wholeness.
 david spangler, foreword to
  the 4th edition of new age politics,
  2015
 
in
  60,000 words satin has made a comprehensive critique of north american society
  and outlined [one] to replace it. ...  at
  30 hes already miles ahead of the academics and intellectuals who cling to
  the marxist vision.
 robert nielsen, toronto star, january 26, 1977 


[a[n
  extremely valuable contribution to contemporary political dialogue.
 john mcclaughry, reason [libertarian magazine], august 1980


the
  themes of new age politics were first articulated in the late 1970s by mark
  satin, ... [after] it dawned on him that the ideas and energies from the
  various fringe movements  feminist, ecological, spiritual, human
  potential and the rest  were beginning to come together in a new way.
 harvey wasserman, the nation [left-wing magazine], august 31,

  cover art for our 102-page transformation platform was contributed by
  rarihokwats, co-founder of akwesasne
  notes.


[satin] joined
  [management consultant] marc sarkady and others in an attempt (in sarkadys
  words) to embody a new holistic vision of politics in america: the new
  world alliance.

   annie gottlieb, do you believe in magic?, simon & schuster,
  1988




[the alliances]
  political vision included healing, rediscovery, human growth, ecology,
  participation, appropriate scale, globalism, technological creativity and
  spirituality.

   sara parkin, green parties: an international guide, heretic books
  ltd. (britain), 1989




in 1981 the group put
  forward a transformational platform, which was the first attempt [in the
  u.s.] to take ecological, decentralist, globalist, and human-growth ideas and
  translate them into a detailed, practical political platform with about 300
  specific proposals.

  mentions, and more.

  cover of issue #67.




mark
  satin publishes a highly influential newsleter, new options, that
  tracks transformational social change, while avoiding the usual dogmas of the
  left, the new age, and the fading 60s.

   kevin kelly, whole earth review, winter 1988-89


 
new
  options is one of the hottest political newsletters in washington. ... 
  [it] has gotten a fair amount of attention, and perhaps even some
  influence, because it self-consciously styles itself posty-liberal.

   george weigel, american purpose, vol. 3, no. 3. march 1989


 
over
  the years, satin has unabashedly challenged tired thinking on any part
  of the political spectrum  particularly the liberal-left shibboleths that
  many new options readers may have held dear. ... 
  [and he] has not been hesitant to infuse political issues with what
  many activists consider soft, peripheral concerns about love, sex, and
  relationships.

  popularized, and personalized, with frequent asides about satins [activist]
  background. ...  [a] fresh and
  often original voice.

   michael marien, future survey, april 2004


 


[t]he
  policy proposals cataloged here dont fii neatly into the standard left /
  right model. ...  the most
  provocaive ideas combine a leftist concern for the commonwealth with a
  conservative instinct for individual responsibility and self-reliance. ... 
  despite the occasional lapse, this book is moderate in tone and
  intelligently reasoned  shockingly so.

viii.
    bonus sections: manual for draft-age immigrans to canada and
    the toronto anti-draft programme (1967  1968)




see here
    for tadp;




see here
    for the manual.




if
    you are wondering how a small-town boy from the midwest could be driven so
    far from the dominant us-against-them paradigm as to help invent and
    spread the now finally emerging transformational / radical centrist
    paradigm, then these sections are a good place to start. 
    the years 1967 and 1968 were a kind of shock therapy for me. 
    i had already watched my beloved sncc cast off its white volunteers. 
    now, as a vietnam war draft refuser, i not only had to confront the
    hostility of most liberals and conservatives. 
    i also had to contend with the arrogance of most pacifists and
    socialists, who wanted draft refusers to go to jail or at least go
    underground and live half-lives with fake ids. 
    the manual and my 24 / 7 work with american war resisters in
    toronto were my immediate responses to this overwhelming lack of empathy and
    connectivity that i felt in the world. 
    they would not be my last.




in 1968, satin
    wrote what would become an underground bestseller, the manual. ... 
    he quickly became the medias go-to guy for draft-dodger
    information, the [tadp] office a drop-in center for teenybopper
    volunteers. ...  but he
    did himself no favours back home.

go here.
"i wrote
[this short story]  in 2015 and offer it here as my contribution to the deep truth-telling
that needs to take place, by people of all races, if this nation is ever to
become healthy and whole.  [it]  differs from many fictional and non-fictional accounts of
the movement in ways i feel are important and true. ...  i
was a civil rights worker in holly springs, mississippi, in the spring of 1965,
and it has taken me all this time to fully come to grips with
my experiences there."

 from my introduction

  ... and here are my 12 best political writings ever





just look here.




what youll find
  there: brief descriptions of each of the 12, and links to them all


[o]ccasionally i
  would write more encompassing or more reflective or more self-critical pieces,
  and as ive grown older ive begun to think of that as my best work. 
  in addition, ive begun to see that what i was doing in those uneasy
  pieces evolved over time, in ways that i think the radical social change
  movement itself needs to evolve, if we are ever going to ... take the lead in
  healing and transforming this nation.
