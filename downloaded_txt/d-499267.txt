more about us









investment philosophy





since 1958 we have been driven by our duty to investors to generate long-term performance with strong downside mitigation through market cycles with a multi-generational horizon. we call this our sustainable growth philosophy. it relies on the realization that markets overvalue short-term unsustainable growth and undervalue the more moderate, but sustainable, long-term growth that leads to greater capital appreciation. we believe that compounded earnings growth is the single most important factor in equity investing. this frames our philosophy, leading us to seek out dominant companies in attractive industries with superior earnings growth at attractive valuations. to us, it’s a personal and professional commitment.
