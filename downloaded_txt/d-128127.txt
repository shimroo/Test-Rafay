storytelling:
passport to success in the 21st century
why is there a resurgence
of interest among today's business and organizational leaders in the ancient
art of storytelling at a time when electronic communications might seem
to make it obsolete? human beings have been communicating with each other
through storytelling since we lived in caves and sat around campfires exchanging
tales. what is new today about the art of telling stories is the purposeful
use of narrative to achieve a practical outcome with an individual, a community,
or an organization. four of the world's leading thinkers on knowledge management
explore how storytelling will become the key ingredient to managing communications,
education, training, and innovation in the 21st century.






introduction: storytelling 
          and the knowledge economy 
the role of storytelling
and its relationship to knowledge through the ages. the importance of narrative
communication as opposed to abstract modes of thought in society today
and in the coming decades. 






the organizational 
        perspective 
why has knowledge become
the key driver of the 21st century economy? how did this happen? what do
organizations know? can knowledge be managed? what role does storytelling
play in the creation and sharing of knowledge? 
larry prusak, executive
director of ibm's institute of knowledge management, author of working
knowledge and in good company, is widely credited with having invented
knowledge management.






the scientist's 
        perspective on knowledge and storytelling 
the implications on storytelling
when incorporating technology into
the process. how the world
has changed from descartes' 
proposition, "i think, therefore
i am," to the current "we participate, therefore we are." 
john seely brown,
chief scientist of xerox and chief innovation officer of 12 entrepreneuring--a
new entrepreneurial operating company in san francisco, and is the co-author
of the social life of information. 






the storyteller 
        as agent for change 
springboard stories that
enable individuals to make a leap in understanding how an organization,
a community, or a complex system can change. how and why storytelling works,
what sort of stories work, and what is involved in being a storyteller.
seminar coordinator steve denning, former program director,
knowledge management, at
the world bank, author of the springboard:
how storytelling ignites
action in knowledge-era organizations. 






the filmmaker 
        as storyteller  
how filmmaking uses personal
storytelling to communicate
complex information. why
a good story makes us laugh,
listen, participate, learn,
and remember. how storytelling in a video
is different from oral or
printed storytelling.
katalina groh, 
filmmaker and head of groh
productions.
