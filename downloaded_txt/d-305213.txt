amma is love
exploring amma's theory and practice of love as a way of life

pure selfless love is the most effective and most powerful path to the divine. it is the substratum of all of existence and it is the bliss and innocence that shines like the sun in the center of our hearts. love is the primary practice taught by amma.  this book is an exploration of her words and teachings to understand the profound nature of love and how to actually practice it - how to cultivate it.
also discussed is the fact that love has been dismissed both culturally and in our psyches. it has been locked in a box and put up on a high shelf in the back of humanity's warehouse. and there is a reason for this.

the path to bliss
over 5,000 years ago, rama, the god man / avatar,walked the earth to restore truth and dharma.  as a young boy not yet 16   years old, he ponders the nature of the world.  pulling back the   curtain of maya, exposing the underbelly of the psychosis of human kind,   he is astonished to find that we are living in a dream world wholly   divorced from reality.  in the opening pages of the classic hindu   spiritual text yoga vasistha, he explains his disillusionment and his   dispassion toward worldly existence to his father and his guru sri   vasistha.  he does this with astonishing force and poetic beauty.  this   book, ramaâs most excellent dispassion, presents ramaâs oration and   follows with an exploration of the meaning and scope of ramaâs   disillusionment.  ramaâs dispassion is both radical and blissful.  it is   the agony and the ecstasy.  it is a precious opportunity for the reader   to unfold spiritually and swim in the ocean of cosmic love and light.

now you can use electro acupuncture to stimulate acupuncture  points in order to treat physical, mental and emotional problems.â  restore balance and harmony in your  body.â  this can be done every day in the  comfort of your own home.

  traditional chinese medicine (tcm) is ancient â at least  5,000 years old.â  it is a very complex  and thorough system of healing based on the view that everything in the  universe is composed of pairs of opposites such as hot and cold, male and  female, inner and outer and dry and wet.â   these pairs of opposites also compose our human bodies and are  summarized in the concept of yin and yang.â   also fundamental in this ancient system is the flow of a life force or  life energy known as qi or chi.â   this is the same life force identified in indian yogic practices and  ayurvedic healing known as prana.â  
 when the balance and flow of chi is disturbed in the human  body, discomfort and disease are the result.â   we can use various acupuncture points to restore our health and  well-being.â  this book is a catalogue of  formulae designed for that purpose.â

amma
the most powerful spiritual light the world has ever known
never  in the history of humankind has one person done so much for so many in such a  short amount of time.â  amma â mata  amritanandamayi â is a cosmic dynamo of spiritual light, love and power.â  to say she is the greatest spiritual light  the world has ever known is a bold but provable statement.â  
also known as the âhugging saintâ she travels  the world having hugged more than 35 million people in the last 40 years.â  these are not ordinary hugs but  transcendental hugs â hugs flowing with the nectar of incomprehensible love,  compassion and supreme power.â  she has  given tens of thousands of people diksha or profound spiritual transmission, insight and vision.â  she has fostered a vast charitable  organization known as embracing the world which includes schools, hospitals,  orphanages, free homes for the destitute and feeding tens of millions of  starving people â all from a woman born into a very poor family and who never  made it past the fourth grade in school.â  
amma is a person who rarely sleeps and is only givingâ¦ givingâ¦ givingâ¦  day after day.â  she does not take even  one breath for herself.â  it is a great  opportunity to sit in ammaâs presence because the profound light and love that  radiates from her constantly will transform our minds and open our hearts  without our having to do anything.â  amma  is unprecedented, unparalleled and without equal anywhere or at any time.â  this book is a journey into the life of a  glowing white-hot incarnation of the divine who walks among us now â a phenomenon  that becomes available to us perhaps only once in 10,000 years.

spirituality is something we feel
a collection of 32 meditations on the feelings of spirituality. love, bliss, joy and deep self-luminous happiness are but a few of the manifestations of our spiritual nature. the door to these is the heart. the obstacle is the intellect because the intellect can never understand the realm of the heart. spirituality does not exist in scriptures, rituals and dogmas. it is something that one feels at the core of one's own being.

the upanishads
in the light of the divine mother
the upanishads have been a door  to the divine mysteries for thousands of years.â   it has been studied by mystics, yogis, philosophers and physicists.â  âin the whole world there is no study so  beneficial and so elevating as that of the upanishads. it has been the solace  of my life. it will be the solace of my death.ââ   - arthur schopenhauer (1788-1860) german philosopher.â  âi go to the upanishads to ask  questions.ââ  - neils bohr (1885-1962) â  nobel prize winning danish physicist.

  this version of the upanishads  has been adapted and rewritten by ethan  to clarify and simplify the  truth contained therein.â  there is also  the addition of the divine mother of the universe as the creatrix and the actor  on the stage of awareness.â  brahman is  awareness â changeless, motionless and empty yet that which grants aliveness to  all things.â 

  the divine mother is all that is  form â eternally changing form.â  she is  the cosmic mind that directs all things.â   brahman, as pure, primordial awareness, is that which is eternally  changeless.â  the divine mother is that  which is eternally changing.â  together,  brahman and the divine mother are not-two.

big love and spiritual bliss
every spiritual path, every endeavor to understand, every  word ever spoken leads to love.â  every  moment of joy and every drop of suffering lead to love.â  every desire and every fear; every pleasure  and pain â all of it leads to love.â  love  is the very pinnacle of human existence â there is nothing higher nor nothing  deeper.â  it is the subtlest of the subtle,  beyond reckoning â formless and unchanging â yet it gives meaning to the  endless dance of existence.
 this love is the thread upon which the bead of every soul is  strung and it is the fire in every star.â   it is the light of non-duality manifesting in the realm of the  many.â  it is at the core of every heart  whether human, plant, animal or mineral.â â 
 
  we have been wandering in the dark catacombs of our minds  for far too long â separated from the cosmic mind - our beloved - and so we  find ourselves endlessly plying the oceans of our burning discontent in our ships  of vacant dreams. this book is a knock on our door where life waits to take us  in its arms; where love simmers in the cauldron of our remembering.
 our very being is that love which frolics as an innocent  child and it has come for us at last. â in  this book is a map to endless bliss.
