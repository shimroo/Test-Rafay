âbrent went above and beyond working to minimize disruption to our neighbors. he also met us at our convenience when signing off on drawings and picking out materials, etc. claire and all of the office staff were polite and helpful. charlie was very thorough with âpool schoolâ. rainey delivered on everything promised, with no hidden costs and giving us a wonderful pool and hot tub in a very small yard. i recommend to everyone.â

âwith very little room in which to work, rainey pool co. did an outstanding job building a small lap pool alongside our house. mollie raineyâs beautiful design (especially the water feature) and creative suggestions regarding the placement of our pump and heater transformed an unused and unattractive part of our property in a gorgeous retreat! we are very happy with our new pool and enthusiastic recommend rainey pool co. to anyone looking for a trustworthy and dependable vendor.â

âthe pool you built us is the first pool weâve ever had. rainey made the whole process very easy. over the years weâve heard about bad experiences other people have had building a pool with other companies, so we were somewhat apprehensive when we started the process. you made us very happy. you helped us choose colors and features that enhanced the house. everyone from your company with whom we had contact was always pleasant and helpful. i would very happily recommend rainey pool company to everyone.â

âi cannot say enough great things about rainey pool company. we had an excellent experience with them. from the very first visit, to tim coming to our home to show us plans and pictures of his work. the office staff is wonderful also. they were always very helpful and ready to answer any question we had. claire was very punctual about getting back to us regarding the schedule of the pool progress. the rains last year did not always cooperate with our plans, but claire would always call or email us to let us know what the next plan of action would be. when picking out the stone and tile, tim rainey was a very honest and would always let us know if something was an upgrade. no surprises! we always knew payment schedules, job schedules, and completion date towards the end. the workers were very thorough, cleaned up daily and were very respectful to us and our neighbors while on the job. after completion, we had someone come out and give us instructions on our pool, equipment, and maintenance. questions were welcomed and the staff was always helpful. the end result was a beautiful pool and spa that we have enjoyed for almost a year.â

âlet me start this review by saying that i have no relationship with anybody at rainey pools. iâm not a stockholder or anything like that and i hadnât even heard of rainey until they did work for me. i make this clear because i am going to give the kind of review that normally only a parent would give. they undertook a large and complicated job in my rear yard. they started by correcting the architects drawing errors, then they consulted with me in a way i could understand and easily follow. then they managed to make up for time lost to rain- so important because they were under a very tight deadline due to a major family event scheduled in our new pool terrace. at all times i was kept fully informed of everything that was going on and their people just exude confidence and professionalism. the end result? a difficult job that was delivered early and on budget, a fair price, and first class people who know their trade backwards. everyone there from the front desk staff to the workers are at the peak of their game. that cannot be coincidental- my impression is that this is ingrained within raineyâs cooperate dna and it makes them as absolute pleasure to deal with. i would recommend them unreservedly to anyone. i have an outstanding product as a result of their work and the only reason i am giving a rating of 5 out of 5 here is that it is not possible to give them 10 out of 5!!! absolutely magnificent service from start to finish.â

ârainey pool company did a fantastic job start to finish. everyone was very friendly and helpful from brent, our sale representative to charlie, our foreman, to claire, our office contact. 60% into the job, we decided to host a dinner party for my momâs 70th birthday. we asked rainey if there was any chance they could complete the pool (at least clean up) prior to our party. because of good weather and their scheduling technique, we were able to showcase our pool for the party and there was no debris left behind. great job rainey pool company!â

 choosing a builder for your new pool can
be an easy decision when you follow
these guidelines...
 
look for longevity in the business
 
being in business for many years says a lot about the builder. builders that continuously fail to meet or exceed their customers' expectations don't stay in business for long. longevity indicates that the company has achieved a high level of stability in the management and operation of the company and the delivery of their service.
 
rainey pool company has been building pools in the texas gulf coast area for thirty seven years. they are the largest independently owned swimming pool builder in the area.
 
ask about the builder's reputation
 
reputation is the strongest reference a builder can have. it can either make or break a builder. pool owners have high expectations and are not shy about sharing their experience when asked.
 
rainey pool company has built over 2,500 pools in the texas gulf coast area in the past twenty years. we have over 2,500 clients who trusted us to fulfill their dream of owning a pool. does the builder belong to any industry organization or guild and build to industry standards?
 
one of the missions of an industry organization is to protect the reputation of the industry and to support its members. industry organizations are very protective of their reputation, which is why have established policies for their members. builders who belong to organizations or guilds have to maintain the highest levels of professionalism to retain their membership. rainey pool company belongs to the master pools guild and the national spa & pool institute.
