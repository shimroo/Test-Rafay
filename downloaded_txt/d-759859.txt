dsba initiative to assist clubs






familiar faces, familiar places — time to get back to the tables! 

the future of bridge in delaware depends on our clubs, but they are facing significant obstacles to reopening for face-to-face play. attendance is down from pre-pandemic levels at those clubs that have reopened. some players are playing online but are reluctant to return to the clubs in person.  some have stopped playing altogether. the delaware state bridge association (acbl unit 190) has started an initiative to help delaware clubs who have novel ideas for drawing former and new players back to the clubs.  the dsba will offer financial backing and other support for experiments by clubs intended to get them back in operation quickly.  

if you have an idea that you think will help revitalize face-to-face participation, please contact your local club or kim holm (kimrholm13@gmail.com), who heads the dsba’s initiative. in the meantime, support your local club by playing there in person!

you can read more about the dsba initiative in the minutes of the most recent dsba board meeting, here.
 
see you at the tables!
