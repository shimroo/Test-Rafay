dogs feel very strongly that they should always go with you in the car, in case the need should arise for them to bark violently at nothing, right in your ear. 
– dave barry


 there are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.



– albert schweitzer


never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.



– margaret mead
