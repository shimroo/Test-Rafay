the hope for a cure is through clinical research.





























our mission



to advance the development of diagnostic tools and new treatments for patients with neurodegenerative conditions through clinical research.



how we helpind stands as a premier clinical and imaging research facility. a focus of our research is to develop innovative neuroimaging tools to detect neurologic conditions before symptoms appear, make an accurate diagnosis and monitor disease progression. in addition, ind participates in the evaluation of new symptomatic treatments and the development of medications with the potential of slowing disease progression.



how to participatethere are numerous opportunities at ind to participate in a variety of research studies. during the past year, over 1,000 individuals participated in our research program. while many of these research participants are from new england, nearly half of our participants travel from throughout the us and canada.

who we arethe institute for neurodegenerative disorders (ind), founded in 2001, is an independent 501(c)3 nonprofit research institute based in new haven, connecticut. its team of expert researchers includes neurologists, nurses, study coordinators, neuropsychologists, and nuclear medicine technologists working together to accomplish ind’s mission. we envision a future in which research provides methods of early detection and effective treatment and ultimately the prevention of these neurologic conditions.
















our focus



neurologic conditionsneurological conditions are disorders that affect any part of your nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves extending throughout your body.   learn more about parkinson’s disease, alzheimer’s disease, and huntington’s disease.
