view all"i first met perry purely by coincidence on my very first visit to sarasota 4 years ago.  it was a fortuitous meeting.  he immediately struck me with his low key, friendly style and his extensive knowledge of all things sarasota.  he’s a great listener, able to connect to my priorities, and patient.  shortly after our first meeting perry found us a new ritz-carlton condo we fell in love with. gracious and generous, he was an invaluable resource for helping us to get acquainted with sarasota. a year later i mentioned to perry we were so happy with our decision, that we would be interested in upgrading if there was one at the ritz-carlton residences, sarasota. once again, perry was able to find the perfect place. its been a pleasure to work with such a great professional as perry twice. i strongly recommend him."ritz-carlton residentnewsletterfor exclusive news and market updates sign up for our newsletter.
