why vegetarian shoes and not vegan shoes?

vegetarian shoes was established in 1990 at a time when veganism was not as widely recognised - it was a battle just to try and get some soya milk for a cup of tea locally!!
   as a small, but long established company, it is now a massive undertaking to get our name and identity changed around the world.
   we are a vegan-friendly footwear company (as the majority of our vegan staff will testify), and we are proud and privileged to make the highest quality vegan footwear possible for our wonderful customers! 
   please go to about us for further info.
