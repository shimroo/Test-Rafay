meet a scientologist
                    
                    








                                                    
                            julie—administrative coordinator
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet julie, an administrative coordinator from belgium.“i can do much more and i produce more simply because the tools which i get by doing scientology—it makes me more happy. i understand life better. and i’m much more able.”








                                                    
                            rony—entrepreneur
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet rony, an entrepreneur from belgium.“the first time i discovered scientology, i knew—this is what i need,” says rony. “it’s very special, you have so much data, you are so aware of things. it helped me to make my decisions much better.”








                                                    
                            patrick—business consultant
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet patrick, a business consultant from belgium, living in the usa.“to me, scientology is simply a meaning of life. what scientology has given me is that i recognize, on a daily basis, that i am a spiritual being. and i actually feel much better as a businessman, as a father, as a husband, as a friend.”








                                                    
                            evelyne—account manager
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet evelyne, an account manager from belgium.“being a scientologist is another life. i was already having quite a good life,” says evelyne. “with all the technology i am much more stable and i can achieve things, which before was very uncertain. the knowledge gives you certainty. and when i have got all this knowledge i saw solutions where there were problems before, i saw questions where i got answers. so it is so much an eye-opener to have the knowledge.”








                                                    
                            meddy—comedian
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet meddy, a french comedian.
“i used to be much more timid,” says meddy. “after dianetics i was more myself. on stage when i communicate with the audience it is much easier to communicate, to imitate someone, the different personalities. i am more aware, more alive.”








                                                    
                            jive aces—musicians 
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet the musical group, jive aces.
they say, “i think the first book we all read was dianetics. and it works so well the first time that i actually thought ‘no, they’re kidding me.’ we’re really enjoying ourselves. we just make people happy."














                what is scientology?

            

scientology is a religion in its highest meaning, as it helps bring man to total freedom and truth. the essential tenets of scientology are these:

you are an immortal spiritual being.
your experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. and your capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.
furthermore, man is basically good. he is seeking to survive. and his survival depends upon himself and his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe.

dianetics: the modern science of mental health
by l. ron hubbard
indisputably the most widely read and influential book ever written about the human mind, dianetics fully describes the reactive mind, the previously unknown source of nightmares, unreasonable fears, upsets and insecurities, and how to get rid of it.
