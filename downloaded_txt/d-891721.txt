golf features





fairbanks ranch country club boasts a truly unforgettable golf experience for players of all skill levels. the valley, lakes, and ocean “nines” combine 27 picturesque, walkable holes into three different course layouts. from wide, sweeping fairways and undulating greens encircled by palm trees to pristine, sparkling lakes and elevated tee shots—it’s more than a golf destination, it’s a lifestyle. already a member and ready to book your next round? simply click here.



the valley nine
set below the scenic hills of fairbanks ranch, accurate tee shots are crucial to shooting low in the valley.



the lakes nine
the lakes are only matched in beauty by the incredibly designed holes surrounding them. stay out of the water and you’ll shoot well.



the ocean nine
the shortest and straightest of the nines, but don’t let that fool you as it’s just as challenging as the rest.
