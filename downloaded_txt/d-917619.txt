supremely greennew zealand aquaculture is one of the most efficient and most sustainable forms of protein production on the planet. 




    sustainable
  














seriously good for youour mussels, salmon and oysters are nutritional powerhouses, full of nutrients essential for living a long healthy and happy life.

 









 






















heart of communitiesaquaculture is a lifeline for some regional towns, supporting thousands of kiwi families with meaningful jobs, and propping up vital services and causes. 














growing togetherwe have a tremendous opportunity to grow exponentially in the coming years to meet global demand.  we are working with communities, iwi, councils, government, scientists and conservationists to unlock that opportunity for the benefit of all new zealanders.
