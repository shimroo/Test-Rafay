what guests are saying about breitenbush










the most important part of breitenbush is the healthy feeling it creates from the vegetarian food, silent rooms/pools for reflection, and the lack of technology use. all of these allow me to temporarily remove myself from the burdens of chaotic city life.
breitenbush guest












breitenbush has always felt like a “home away from home” to me. it’s a safe potent natural environment that allows me to connect deeper w self. the foundation & principles community stands on are unique, inspiring, & admirable.
breitenbush guest












breitenbush is sacred land that is lovingly cared for by the community and one of my favorite places on the planet. it is where i go to renew my body, mind and spirit as often as i can. it is well worth the 5-6 hour drive from seattle.
breitenbush guest












it has been a place to go to when deep nourishment and replenishment are needed, it has been a place to reconnect to self, nature and good friends. in essence it is a true retreat so that i may better face the challenges of every day life in the world we all live in.
breitenbush guest












one trip my sister and i kept taking the “wrong” path from the parking area to the lodge and turned around to go another way. the third time we did it i felt a pull to keep on that path and we had an amazing encounter with an owl. she was majestic and sat on a branch allowing us to be in her presence for 10’ or more. we just sat at her feet, bowing before her magnificence. truly magical!
breitenbush guest












i fell in love with breitenbush when i moved to the north west; i was actually searching for a hot springs experience as a gift to myself for my birthday. i just thought what breitenbush was special in terms of what it has to offer and how unique it was. i remember thinking "this is it!" my first experience was amazing!
breitenbush guest












the first time i came to breitenbush i was about seven or eight years old and it was very rustic. my body and senses remember this place though and every time i come, it’s like coming home. the ravens speak to me, the river soothes me, the wind in the trees stirs me and the water transforms me. i leave with clarity and a fresh sense of being alive.

[one of the most important things about breitenbush is] being able to be naked and not have the judgment around it or sexual tension.
