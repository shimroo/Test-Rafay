mission

believing in the limitless potential of girls, hockaday develops resilient, confident women who are educated and inspired to lead lives of purpose and impact.


the four cornerstones

miss ela hockaday identified the four cornerstones in 1914, one year after the school opened. they continue to serve as the foundation for hockaday's vision and mission. 








character
character is the pursuit of a moral and ethical life; it promotes within us a self-assurance and strength to withstand life’s pressures. 




courtesy
courtesy is the quality equated with dignity and generosity of spirit; it is our outward expression of respect not only for others, but also for ourselves. 




scholarship
scholarship is the search for knowledge that brings a wise understanding of a complex world; it fosters in us a creative, discerning, and resourceful mind. 




athletics
athletics is the endeavor to lead a healthy, active, and balanced life. it embraces challenges and inspires us to display sportsmanship in both victory and defeat. 



why hockaday?












embrace opportunities
a hockaday girl believes in herself and dares to follow her dreams and make a difference in the world. hockaday was founded on a transformative academic program, and our girls’ achievements are inspiring. from robust classroom experiences to team competitions to ensemble productions, hockaday girls are celebrated for their individual and collaborative talents.learn more













find your voice

create lasting friendships
at hockaday, girls form lifelong friendships that will carry them through their lives. hockaday's many storied traditions connect the past with the present and provide connection and community-building for each daisy. these traditions are meaningful for our students, faculty, families, and alumnae, and provide a bridge between generations of students.learn more
