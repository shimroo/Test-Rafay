welcome to pakboats.com
since 1995 pakboats has been designing and manufacturing a wide range of folding canoes, folding kayaks and accessories. in everything we do, we strive to provide the most functional gear possible at a fair price. the pictures in the slide show, below, show pakboats in action around the world. for more detailed information about us and our boats, click on the menu items above. thank you for visiting our web site.
                                      
did you know?
many pakboats fans did not buy their boats because they can be packed in a bag. they simply treat their pakboats as very lightweight replacements for the plastic boats that are too heavy. the fact that pakboats seats are much more comfortable is an added bonus, and so is the generous amount of secure built-in flotation.
pakboats ride on top of a car just as easily as hard kayaks, but their lighter weight makes it easier to get them up there. paddling performance is similar to hard kayaks (and much better than inflatables), except that the light weight makes a pakboat more responsive.

try one – you will like it.
we have found that our customers prefer kayaks that can be used equally well by one or two paddlers. the saranac is our best seller, and it can be used with or without a deck, by one or two paddlers. unlike other kayaks where a solo paddler has to paddle from the stern cockpit, pakboats solo/double kayaks can be purchased with a solo or double deck – or both. this way, you can always get your kayak trimmed properly.
a few words about packable boats:
canoes and kayaks that you can pack for travel are generally folding or inflatable. both have their special advantages, and pakboats combine the best features of both. in each pakboat, a complete aluminum frame provides efficient lines and rigidity, while inflatable tubes provide tensioning and flotation. the combination of frame and inflatable tubes make a much more compact structure than air alone, and a pakboat has much more interior space than a similar size inflatable canoe or kayak. the unique pakboats structures are also much lighter and pack smaller. similar size inflatables weigh about 50% more than a pakboat.
