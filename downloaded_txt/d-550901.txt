the printing, publishing, and media workers sector of the communication workers of america and the graphic communications conference of the international brotherhood of teamsters make up the allied label.
look and ask for the international allied printing trades council label – the familiar “bug” – on all printed material. it’s your assurance of quality and craftsmanship. the bug also guarantees that the men and women who work on your printed materials receive good wages and benefits in plants that practice responsible labor-management relations. when you patronize the union plants listed in this directory, you are helping to maintain the union advantage in the printing industry.
