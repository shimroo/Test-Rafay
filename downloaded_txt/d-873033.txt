i woke up this morning, feeling more love in my heart than at any other time in the last ten years. the future is open wide, and i want to treasure every moment.i don’t want to waste a single second focusing on negativity or anything other than what i know in my heart and soul to be true. so here’s the truth:i have never committed a crime against anyone else, nor have i ever been charged with a crime. i have never abused another person in any way, shape or form.in reality, i care immensely about the wellbeing of other people and i hope to spend the future giving back to the world around me and reflecting what i love most about life.so, in the future i hope to not waste my time being asked about all the things i never did or never would do. instead i hope to continue spending my time making art and music and sharing it with our community.to celebrate this, our team has decided to launch the first annual holiday for everyone of us, and everyone of you who is a part of our universe. let’s make today, february 18th bassnectar community day to the kick off to an amazing interactive future of celebrating life, enjoying our right to thrive, promoting love, radiating kindness, connecting with each other, welcoming old friends back, and inviting new friends to join in. share your stories, speak your mind, open your hearts in celebration of the future together.this is only the beginning…
