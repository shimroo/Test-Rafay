	 blogging vacation
    


okay, so work and school are proving to be too much for a blogger to handle.  so i've decided to go on a blogging vacation for a couple of months.however, i have decided that once i come back, my big fat chance website will be bigger and better than ever.  i'm going to be spending my time off creating an all new web page and with a more defined theme and purpose.when i've done this i'll be sure to pop back here with an update to let everyone know.untill then, cheers!

	 8-week goodlife challenge
    


so we've decided to have a bit of fun at work.  myself and the rest of the management trainees have each been assigned a personal trainer, and starting today we will begin an 8-week program with our trainers to help show the benefit of training.so today myself and my trainer liam had our first meeting, were liam basically did a fitness assessment on me.  this is something i really wish i had done before i began trying to lose weight because it was really cool.anyway, i've decided to post the stats from todays assessment:height: 5'5''weight: 217.6 lbsbody fat: 33.9%resting blood pressure: 124/90resting heart rate: 72 bpmupper arm: 35.5 cmchest: 110.5 cmwaist: 107.5 cmbuttocks: 113.0 cmthigh: 67.0 cmcalf: 41.0 cmso after the assessment we decided that my main goal during the challenge will be to improve my body composition by losing 15 pounds of fat, and two improve my muscle mass by 6-8 pounds.but besides for that the club is open and it is a world class facility.  i've never been in a nicer club.  since we opened last week i've circuit trained twice, completed my first group cycling class (and that class kicked my ass hard), and a couple of days of cardio.all in all, it's safe to say i'm back on track and can't wait till june when i finally graduate and can focus on performing well at my job and on running the marathon!

	 new year, new attitude
    


okay, so it's a new year, and i'm going to have to make an effort to have a better year than 2006.in the first half of 2006 i accomplished a great feat in running in the tely 10; and in the process i nearly lost 40 pounds.in the second half i haven't been working out as much, or eating as healthy, and i've gained back about 15 pounds that i had lost.  thats why i've decided to start to take some bigger steps to help succeed.as i've mentioned in the more recent posts i'm working for canada's largest fitness club, and our new club is going to be opening in just over a weeks time.once the club opens up i'm going to begin working out with a personal trainer on a regular basis and i'll be running more often.i really miss running, and i haven't been doing as much lately.  i imagine that if i had to run for 10 minutes i'ld barf.well, as i keep saying in almost every post lately, this needs to change.  so i obviously need to find something to encourage me.  i've already decided that next "big fat chance" is to complete the newfoundland and labrador provincial marathon, so i may as well start training for that now.heck, it worked last time.p.s.- how come no one leaves comments anymore?
