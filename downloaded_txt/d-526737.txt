a big welcome from hank the monkey:    

ever wonder
what it was like for those who served in viet nam?   imagine



please take a moment to read
this synopsis and learn how an extraordinary irish woman, 2nd lt. pamela donovan, did what some
u.s.
citizens couldn't do during the vietnam war and how her family
supported her. pamela's mother, joyce donovan, wrote a book (also
available at amazon.com) about the donovan family and their faith.
there is a chapter in the book where joyce tells pamela's story. 

please
also visit these other sites with information:
pamela's grave
and memorial

there is always much discussion on flag
etiquette. we've gathered some information together to try to make it
less confusing. however, the rules themselves are confusing, but please
read on.
