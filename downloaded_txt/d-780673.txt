what is kidney disease?
chronic kidney disease (ckd) occurs when kidneys are damaged and are less efficient at doing their job. ckd is called a “silent killer” because there are few symptoms, and by the time people realize they have a problem, much damage has already been done. high blood pressure and diabetes are the two leading causes of ckd. heart disease, family history of ckd and obesity are other risk factors.

improve access to care
dpc advocates for improving the quality of life for dialysis patients. we want patients to have access to the best healthcare options available, including improving access to additional services such as care coordination, transportation and dental care.
promote financial security
with many dialysis patients unable to continue working, financial hardships are common. dpc advocates for improved access to medigap and protection of charitable assistance from assaults by insurers.
increase quality of care
dpc supports an adequately funded dialysis infrastructure that offers stable and convenient sources of care that rewards performance and incentivizes quality outcomes. we favor policies that encourage research and innovations to provide patients with hope and new treatment options.
advance patient choice
dpc promotes preserving and expanding patients’ autonomy where alternative options are or should be available, including choice of treatment modalities, choice of providers, choice of health plans, and access to transplantation; as well as protections for donor and recipient patients.
protect patient care
dpc works to elevate the patient voice with state and federal lawmakers, while also challenging those decisions in state and federal court that undermine patient care.
