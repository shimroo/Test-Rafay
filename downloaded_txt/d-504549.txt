pelekas is the village that has something for everyone. for more than 40 years it has been a favourite hideaway for independent holiday makers who return year after year. if you are looking for sandy beaches and traditional tavernas, fringed by the natural beauty of timeless olive groves; water-sports and nightlife; budget or top of the range accommodation; the excitement of high season or the languid early and late summer months; you will always find a warm welcome in pelekas.  video by nikos vergis
