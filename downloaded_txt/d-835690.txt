our work in literature

we work with the uk literature and publishing sectors to create opportunities for international networking and collaboration. 
we introduce the sector to new international markets and audiences, and support them to develop experience in working across cultures to form new creative partnerships.
our programmes reflect the excellence and diversity of the contemporary uk literature sector and improve access to world literatures in the uk. we work across the full spectrum of literature, covering creative writing, translation, publishing, festivals and performance, literature development, reader development and libraries.  
our work is delivered through a range of partners and includes programming for international festivals, residencies, study tours, networking opportunities and grants for collaborative working.
