"jungle" jay
                hamilton
                ched edmonton
                february 16/82 (unscoped)
(contributor:
                charlie ritenburg)



energetic and entertaining,
                "jungle" jay hamilton was a popular
                presence on edmonton radio.
it took just four years for
                hamilton to reach the big time at ched, after
                getting his start at age 17 at cfsl weyburn,
                saskatchewan. hamilton ruled the evening airwaves
                in edmonton for many years, even as am music
                radio was beginning a slow fade. he stepped back
                from radio in 2013 after being afflicted with
                huntington's disease.
enjoy "jungle" jay
                hamilton on ched from february 16, 1982
                (unscoped) ... in the aircheck
