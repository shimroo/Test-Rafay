castleguard history & our team
about us

why? why in the world would a whole family spend every, waking moment with dogs?  why would they invest their hearts, resources, and years, on a dog breed? why are they willing to share everything they have learned, and yet still be selective about who they accept into their dog family? why? because once you have loved a cane corso, you are never the same.

decades of titles and accomplishments
we win!

in our tireless efforts to produce the finest corsos in the world, we have accomplished much. in the pre-akc years, we earned countless championships, awards and coveted difficult breed club titles. after akc recognition in 2010, we stepped up our game.  few breeders can compete with castleguard cane corso in akc titling. to date, we have produced well over 100 akc titled corsos!  we hold the record of reproduction championships produced.  every year, castleguard has a top 10 akc corso. we produced the only american born corso to earn multi-championships and win best in show in the eu. 
there is always a castleguard corso winning somewhere!

our sophisticated puppy experience
raising puppy

it really does matter how a breeder raises their puppies. what happens every moment of those first few weeks determines the dog's lifetime experiences. wonderful family companions and top competitive dogs all need the same full-time, detailed care and experienced dedication. raising puppies is our hobby, yes. but we are committed to doing so in the utmost professional, loving way. few breeders dedicate as much time, resources and love as we do... and our discerning castleguard clients reap the rewards of owning an extroidarinary puppy.
