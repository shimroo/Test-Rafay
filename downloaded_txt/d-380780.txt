concordia has shown me how important it is to teach the entire person in mind, body, and spirit. i feel well prepared to create a god-centered respectful community in my classroom.

having the same christian values as the people who are teaching me and guiding me through my education was very important to me. there’s nothing more i could have asked for from my concordia professors.
