snipercraft









welcome
nearly everyday, somewhere in america, a swat / sniper is learning a valuable lesson from 
first hand experience in the field. it could take place outside an electronics store, or on a city 
street, in a crowded shopping center, or any one of a thousand other locations. somewhere 
a sniper is learning a limitation in his equipment, a fault in his training regimen, a dubious 
tactic, or just the fact he is a policeman with a rifle, not a sniper.  he is learning to succeed, 
or he has learned that he has failed.
whatever the lesson, the unfortunate part is, because of the fragmented and secretive 
nature of the tactical community, the lesson may never go any further than a few close 
associates. a lesson which may someday save the life of an officer or civilian is lost because 
there is no mechanism in place for learning, evaluating and sharing information which is 
unique to our special community.
snipercraft was born in 1992 with resolving this situation as one of its primary objectives. 
we gather snipers from all over the country together on a regular basis for competitions and 
seminars. we have used those occasions to make contacts, share information and to have 
some fun. we publish a newsletter with an international circulation, to regularly update one 
another on the latest lessons learned, as well as lessons available through schools, 
seminars, videotapes and books. we provide products and training which will aid the sniper 
in accomplishing his mission.
snipercraft is a nonprofit organization comprised of active police snipers and tactical 
personnel.  our desire is for snipers to be recognized and respected as the trained 
professionals they really are. our goal is to enhance the level of proficiency and 
professionalism of the police sniper.  our plan is to give them the tools to make them safer 
and more effective.
snipercraft started three decades ago, dedicated to helping the working police sniper.  
today, we remain committed to our original mission.  we teach snipers.  
our job, the police sniper, is the most unique function in the most difficult of circumstances 
in all of police work. we are part of an elite community and should take great pride in what 
we do and what it takes to do it. we have made a commitment to do a job which few want, 
and even fewer can.
