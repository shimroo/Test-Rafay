	 roskilde '09 - 3 days to go
	 
    


frightened rabbit (sco)friday 03.07.09 - 19:00 - pavilionfrightened rabbit is not easy to put in a box. their latest album span from interpretations of bluegrass, over  alt. folk to uptempo pop songs. a pretty weird mix, but somehow frightened rabbit pulled it off, and midnight organ fight became one of the absolute best albums last year.now we get the chance to see frightened rabbit live in denmark. last time they should have played here (at loppen in october) the concert was cancelled.it's really frustrating to sit here and watch the entrance arm band on my left arm, knowing that i have work my ass off for 3 more days before i can use it. the next couple of days i will run through the bands that i'm going to witness on roskilde '09. and since i'm making a mixtape for the camp, i guess i can just as well share it with you guys. enjoy.roskilde '09 mp3 mixtape - part 01mikael simpson – slaar skaarmikael simpson – medicinmikael simpson – koldt (lulu rouge remix)m. ward - magic trickm. ward - never had nobody like youfleet foxes - blue spotted tail (live)lucinda williams - joyyeah yeah yeahs - art staryeah yeah yeahs - y controlyeah yeah yeahs - maps (acoustic version)cut off your hands - nostalgia (live on woxy.com)cut off your hands - let’s get out of here (live on woxy.com)cut off your hands - it doesn’t matter (live on woxy.com)cut off your hands - you & i  (live on woxy.com)deerhoof - offend maggiedeerhoof - kidz are so smallthe dodos - foolsdungen - festivalelbow - ground for divorceelbow- the bones of youelbow- on a day like thisfrightened rabbit - the modern leperthe above listed mp3 files are not hosted by docopenhagen.-----------thanks for the links friends:http://woxy.comhttp://ninebullets.nethttp://www.soundonthesound.comhttp://citizendick.orghttp://forwardmusic.wordpress.com/http://trashbagskids.blogspot.comhttp://thefmly.comhttp://kinosport.tv

	 the airborne toxic event
	 
    


sometime around midnight - the airborne toxic eventi strongly encourage you to take a listen to the new self titled album from the airborne toxic event.after pitchfork gave the album the historically low score 1.6 out of 10, calling it a complete ripoff of arcade fire, bright eyes, interpol and the strokes, i must admit that i completely wrote this album off. but through the last couple of weeks i've really come to like it anyway. it's not like tate have reinvented the wheel or anything, but they've got some really nice dark and catchy tunes. and hey, the above mentioned bands aren't the worst sources of inspiration are they? and i really feel that's all it is, a source of inspiration and not a rip-off.furthermore they are not a bad live act at all. i took some pictures at the concert in lille vega a couple of weeks ago:   -------------http://www.theairbornetoxicevent.com/http://www.myspace.com/theairbornetoxicevent

i feel like it's time to make a little bonnie prince billy update. that guy is just releasing records at rocket speed isn't he? i haven't had the chance to listen to his new critically acclaimed album "beware", but judged from the first single "i am goodbye" it's really promissing. as on his last album "lie down in the light" the album is a bit more uptempo and light than the old albums "i see a darkness" etc. bonnie prince billy's duet with indie folk singer scout niblett, is one of the greatiest songs so far this year. just amazing!--------------------http://www.myspace.com/princebonniebilly
