centrally located
the marshall house is located in the center of the historic district on broughton street.  there's shopping and dining right outside our door, and beautiful squares and antebellum architecture at every turn.   river street is just a few blocks away, and city market is nearby too.   most guests do not need their car until it's time to leave.

a nice change
from the usual hotels




we loved staying at the marshall house. it was a perfect location.  they had amazing amenities, such as coffee, tea and water anytime during the day, along with social hour, sharing stories, trivia games, and listening to music while indulging in some wine, cheese, crackers, and fruit. every staff member we interacted with, was not only polite and friendly, but very helpful and so much fun! the atmosphere was classy, but yet comfortable and welcoming. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
