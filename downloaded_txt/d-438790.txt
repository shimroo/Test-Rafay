margin exists to promote  young upscale streetwear and directional tailoring   
 labels.  the trade fair exhibition  margin london was established to help new labels reach a wider buying and press audience. the trade shows margin london were created out of necessity.  
retailers travel the  world looking for "the next big thing"  but are never going  to find it at a fashion tradeshow   
whose costs prohibit fresh talent  which is where the margin upscale streetwear  exhibition  plays a vital part.  

the main drive of  margin london was to establish a show where  new fashion brands and "up and coming" design talent 
could find an affordable platform  to exhibit at margin london and expose their collections with a directional edge to the uk & international fashion trade and press. margin is a fashion exhibition in london presenting fashion collections from fashion labels based in london and internationally.

margin in london is now a firm must-visit fixture on the international trade show and fashion fair calendar for directional independent boutiques, multiples & department stores across the uk, europe and japan looking to source pure design talent outside of the mainstream +  


the london fashion exhibition in london is long-standing and has been running since august 2002. 
the august 2013 edition marks the occasion of the 24th show of the fashion exhibition in london and marks 11 years of margin. margin is a clothing trade show taking place in the uk in london in august 2013. 
most exhibitors, menswear and womenswear, are new designers launching their ranges for the first time globally, some of whom treat their tailoring ranges of clothing, including jackets, with a couture-like attention to detail, personally creating their pure vision, stitch by stitch, with the required skill set for directional menswear and womenswear. new brands at margin means brand new, other shows generally mean new to them: margin means new to the world and making their global debut.



margin london features the following categories of exhibitors as well as others: 
upscale streetwear, directional tailoring,  skatewear, boardwear, surfwear, urban wear, london fashion, international fashion , youthwear, menswear, womenswear, lifestyle products, jeanswear / denim, giftwear, t-shirts / tees, accessories such as bags, jackets, jewellery (jewelry), hats / headwear, footwear / shoes, directional pattern cutting, creative elegance and street couture; most of which are stitched with love and care by the designer-makers themselves.
