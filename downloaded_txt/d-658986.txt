            simulating cmos image sensors with synopsys
          
        


        
          cmos image sensors (cis) are very common opto-electronic devices that appear in numerous consumer devices. modeling cis devices requires process, optical and electronic simulations. synopsys tcad sentaurus and rsoft photonic device tools are well-suited for this application.
