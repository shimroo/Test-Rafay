who we are
university christian church takes seriously god’s call to love, affirm, and welcome every person. just steps away from the university of texas campus, ucc is a vibrant place to be. as part of the christian church (disciples of christ), we are a movement for wholeness in a fragmented world, welcoming all to the table as christ has welcomed us. we hold that christians are free to follow our consciences, guided by bible study, the holy spirit, reason, and prayer. ucc is a progressive, affirming, inclusive church, learning to love, serve, and walk in the way of jesus together. at ucc, you are invited to engage the divine and encounter christ in challenging—but meaningful and joyful—ways.
