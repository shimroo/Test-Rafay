mood music: josé gonzalez



two days in a row my friends. what now!? **chest bump**yesterday, i talked about my love of eastern european sounds... you know horns and percussion, blah blah blah. today, i wanted to talk about an acoustic sound that is another one that i just can't get enough of - josé gonzalez.his second album is called in our nature and it was released in late september. this dude knows how to play the guitar - his pronunciation is a little fucked - he slurs everything he says and i'm already not that great at figuring out lyrics on my own. i was looking up lyrics to the song teardrop the other day, which by the way is an old massive attack song, and i was way the fuck off on the lyrics i thought he was singing. whatever. this album is amazing.so, apparently josé wants to put out a series of music videos about "the sins of humanity." here's the second in the series - the video for teardrop. enmuthafuckinjoy.
