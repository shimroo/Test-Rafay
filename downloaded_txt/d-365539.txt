the teapro programming language 
and the opentea technology



read about the opentea technology

opentea technology is what makes 
teapro so simple and solid.



the interpreter for the programming language teapro is written in c90 and can be compiled for any computer.

teapro does file processing, terminal i/o, string processing, 
and calculations. 

the teapro interpreter, teapro.exe, is a small single file 
program which can be merely copied to any pc for free. 

it does not have to be installed.

the source code in c90 for the teapro interpretor is below. it is the file teapro.c and may be compiled for any computer.
 
a program in the teapro programming language is a single text file which can be created with any word processor or text editor. 

the teapro programming language is much simpler and 
easier to program in than most other programming languages. 

teapro requires the programmer to write strictly structured 
programs which makes it much more reliable than many 
programming languages. 

the teapro programming language uses the opentea technology to be simple and solid. 

people need computer software that actually works.

the c90 source code for the teapro interpreter is available below.




teapro4.html

what is teapro and teapro.exe ? here is a collection of articles 
explaining the teapro programming language in great detail with 
explanations of all of the commands in teapro. you can learn to program in teapro from these articles. several of them 
explain what makes programming with teapro simple and solid.

c90tea 

c90tea is a webpage telling how the teapro interpreter program written in c90 actually works.




tinytea.cpp

the source code in c90 for the program tinytea.exe which is the beta version of the next improved version of the teapro interpreter. usually, this is compiled on a c++ compiler even though it is c90.




tinytea.exe

the beta version of the next improved version of the teapro interpreter program.




tinytea.tea

a teapro program to test teapro, find 5tp39s and other primes.
it uses the teaquad method for larger primes.




fixran.tea

oklaqtp.tea this teapro program is currently used to find 5tp39s



valqtp.tea...this program is for testing.



testgap.tea this teapro program is used to find gap400 numbers


these teapro programs are to find 5tp39s, hargrave primes or qtps.

a 5tp39 is a twin prime cluster of five twin primes in 
39 numbers.

these four programs use the teaquad method to find the larger primes.




teaprime.tea

a teapro program to find prime numbers, 5tp39s, pnq30s, etc.
it uses the teaquad method for larger primes.




oklaprim.tea

another version of the teapro program to find prime numbers, 
5tp39s, pnq30s, etc. it uses the teaquad method for larger primes.

download the teapro interpreter program teapro9.exe. it runs the same teapro programs as the other teapro interpreter listed above. the program teapro9.exe was written in delphi instead of c90. 




teapro91.pas

look at the delphi source code for the 
teapro interpreter program teapro9.exe




oklatea.cpp

free to use source code in c90 for the program oklatea.exe
which is a teapro interpreter. it ends with .cpp because 
it is usually compiled on a c++ compiler.




oklatea.exe
