wiseli acknowledges that our work is taking place on the ancestral ho-chunk land. this university exists because of the forced 1832 ceding and colonization of their territory and forced removal of the ho-chunk people, who nevertheless resisted.  we honor the legacy of resistance and resilience of the ho-chuck people, and respect the inherent sovereignty of the ho-chunk nation and the other 11 first nations within the boundaries of the state of wisconsin. wiseli encourages all visitors to this website, and to the university of wisconsin-madison, to learn more about the ho-chunk people by visiting the our shared future website.
