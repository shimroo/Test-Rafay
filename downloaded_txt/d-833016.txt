map to churchwe  are happy that you have found our website!  here you can find  information about who we are and what we believe. all  are invited to come and learn of our lord and savior, jesus christ.  we gather together in devotion and reverence for our lord and in joyful  fellowship with one another. as we do, we pray and trust that blessings will  follow as we humbly bow before him, remembering him, seeking his  forgiveness when we fall short of keeping his commandments, and praying  that his holy spirit will always be with us to protect and guide us.  when we seek him out in humble submission, his grace and mercy are granted  freely. please  come and study in fellowship with us as a church family striving to  build his kingdom. we know his promises are sure if we will humbly seek  after him and reach out to each other with brotherly and sisterly love.  may his will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.      in gospel bonds,  the oak grove restoration branch
