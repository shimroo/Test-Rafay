                   including their coloured and scented surf wax, waxmate. 

the
                  principals were garth murphy, mike doyle, and rusty
                  miller.
                  doyle and miller were outstanding surfers,with
                  substantial competitive careers and regularly
                  appearing in magazines.

                      mexico,  rusty to kauai,
                      and garth murphy emigrated to

                      box in byron bay, circa 1970.

                  rusty contributed to witzig's ground breaking tracks

              mia, circa 1999: my first contact was a highly
              complimentary email from rod rogers of baltimore,
                maryland, who had recently begun his web page,
            my paipo boards and ... more, now at http://mypaipoboards.org/
unfortunately, the original has
              disappeared from my files.
              rod recently noted: my, how things have changed in 13+
                  years !!!! 
 i clearly remember your early pages as they were
                  one of the few to contain any paipo information much
                  less so much rich data on surfing.

although surfresearch.com is a messy, cut-rate,
                hard-to-use site (at least of this writing), it is
by
                far the best single source of information for early
                australian surf history.

hi geoff, i don't think we've ever communicated, but
                having turned 60 i have to factor in
                memory loss become making any kind of declarative
                statement.
anyway, i have been a regular and avid
                reader-user-content-stealer of surfresearch-com for as
                long as it has been up.
what a godsend of a website.
thank you so much for all the time and effort
                you've put into the project, and i hope it goes without
                saying that you can likewise take any content your find
                on encyclopedia of
                  surfing.
he also added:
            i saw a week or so ago, on your site, where you mentioned
            that surfresearch has become part of the national library.
            what an incredible honor, and well deserved. 
- matt warshaw, december 2020.

 hey surf research how about you apply your anglophilic
            focus to surfing by our sydney region guring-gai and
            darawhal kooris.
 i know you find this unpallatable. 
 hint; start with kayee mai gal clan (manly) at bombora
            (place where waves thunder) maybe quote a credible witness,
            say an officer of his majesty"s navy or two (easily found
            just look).
 also consider marou-bora and wamberal (wam-bora) by
            tarra gal clan. 
 dont be shy now ...you can apply your menzies era view
            of the world to some real surfresearch.

geoff cater's great website surfreserach.com.au (sic) has
            been an invaluable resource, and many times all lines of
            inquiry, and google searches, seemed to lead me back to it.
          
 i'm pleased to learn the national library of australia
            has seen fit to archive this treasure.

get over yourself mr serious.... and by the way the
              'rudimentary' style was also exhibited by duke and co. 
 the quality of the waves was also 'poor' in both
              cases. 
 you are a pompous ass and youtube or a viewer
              flagged your comment as spam... lol! 
 get back to me when you've ridden a 17 foot 70 pound

first of all i got to say
            is what an amazing job of reaserch you guys do, an second
            that is the easyest webpage to use, scroll up &
            down,  click on pictures etc.. 
            you can really feel the passion for the sport, the histoy
            & for those who has made what it is today.

surf
              international, volume 1 number 12, circa 1969.

in the winter of 1967-1968, nat young and bob
        mctavish took their recently developed wide-tailed vee-bottom
        boards to hawaii.
        joining them in maui were george greenough and manly'sted
        spencer, his flight to hawai'i courtesy of surf
          international's first place prize for the windansea
        contest, held on sydney's northern beaches in november-december
        1967. 
shaped






































































































































        by spencer and mctavish at keyo surfboards in mid-1967,
    it was an 8ft 4"
        x 23" stringered rounded pintail.
        fitted with a greenough fin, it had a clear deck and red
        gel-coat on the bottom. 
their surfing was
        documented in paul witzig's hot generation (1968)
        and eric blum's the fantastic plastic machine
        (1969), as well as in numerous magazines and books.
despite the
        extensive promotion of the vee-bottoms, in fact, variations of
        ted spencer's pintail were to be the dominant design in
        australia for the next twelve months.
      this rare photograph of mctavish riding spencer's board is just
      one gem in john witzig's fine portfolio of surf
        photography.

 
errata

the board was previously described






































































































































      on this page as:
          ted spencer's 'little red',  8ft 9" x 22" stringerless
          rounded pintail. possibly shane surfboards.

i also noted: the board itself,
          however, broke in two at the honolua bay sessions.

the dimensions were an estimate and
        the manufacturer was an educated guess, based on
        multiple viewings of the footage.
        the board's demise was based on bob mctavish's account of the honolua bay
      sessions, a
          plastic drinking straw... , surf international, vol. 1. no. 3  february - march
      1968, page 11. 

in november 2003, ted spencer emailed:
for what it's
          worth, so called little red board was 8'4" in length single
          stringer 23" wide and 
was shaped by bob mctavish and i
          at keyo surfboards in brookvale australia.
it didn't break badly in hawaii
          and i took it back to oz.     
          regards, ted.


      many thanks to ted spencer for this invaluable contribution.
