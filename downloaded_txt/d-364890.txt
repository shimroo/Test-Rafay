c-drumpad
is a drum machine that features custom
play with your keyboard or joypad including a good reaction speed. with
five record-slots you can save, load and also mix together your custom beats.

      
   














magnetic pong-tennis,
as the name already suggests, is a pong/tennis-like game for one or two
players featuring joystick support, spin and variable levels of
difficulty. the actual version is 1.1.
                            







 






mousemaster23k is a
small but variable game to predict the best mousemovers. you have to
move the cursor through a 400x400 pixel maze as fast as possible. it
features time, speed and distance of your trial and a simple level
crator for your own levels. there is also the possibility to design
levels with external graphic software ! 20 levels are included and even
more can be found on this website.the actual version is 1.2 beta1
                    







 






netherland marihuana connection ii
is  a "coffeshop simulation"   with more than 40.000
downloads yet. it is about living in the netherlands, owning an illegal
coffeshop and dealing with marihuana. you buy it, you grow it and sell
it. nmc2 features joint building, events, cops and best of all an
online high-score for the best weed dealers to compete. the version is
2.1 (final)!
                    







 






joystick tester / joypad tester
measures the quality of your joystick.

a high analog resolution isn't nessecary for jump n runs, but
if
you wanna go for e.g. heli rc simulation you may find it to be useful.

  









 






commodore 64 sid chip programming
(german version) 















wanted resisor.
for what it does i give you an expample. you have bought a multipack
of  120 ohm and 1700 ohm resitors. now you need right now an
1000
ohm resistor. dr saves your time by telling you : best appoximation
with 3 resistors: (1700 + 1700) parallel + 120 in reihe ergibt 970
->difference: 30. best approximation : ((1700 parallel zu 1700)
in
reihe mit (120)) in reihe mit ((120 parallel zu 120) parallel zu (120
parallel zu 120)) ergibt 1000 ohm. difference : 0. (the second answer
is of course senseless....). 
                  


(this app is only
available in german language, version 1.0)

all software on this page is made out of the
simple purpuse that i wanted to play games that did not exist. so i
made them up and can play them now. would like to make more but were
would that end...................
