welcome to the pennsylvania live steamers



            the pennsylvania live steamers, inc. was established in 1946 as an all volunteer organization dedicated to the
            preservation of the nationâs rich mechanical and engineering heritage. we are incorporated as a 501(c)3 non-profit
            organization.
          

            our purpose is to formulate and carry out plans for the construction and operation of a live steam railroad and
            to foster a sprit of cooperation among live steam railroaders.
          

            we are a group of people who enjoy trains and railroading. our members operate various scales of miniature railway
            equipment, with one-eight scale, one-twelfth scale and gauge-one being the most prevalent.
          
some of our members own locomotives and/or cars. however, owning equipment is not a requirement for membership.

            our 5-acre club site has 3,200 feet of 1â½″ scale (7â¼″ gauge), 3,000 feet of 1″ scale (4â¾″ gauge),
            an 800-foot multi-gauge loop and a 219-foot dual-tracked gauge-1 loop. there are multiple unloading facilities as well
            as handicapped facilities for our members and visitors.
          










pls celebrates 75 years

              by an overwhelming majority the membership voted to reschedule our 75th anniversary celebration
              for the fall of 2022. this item was taken up by the board of directors and was approved. looking at this decision
              today it looks like we have taken the best path for a successful celebration. unfortunately, hurricane ida washed
              out our fall 2021 meet. hopefully in 2022 things will return to normal and we can invite other live steamers
              and vendors to an event that can be celebrated by all.

2022 annual picnic




            our 2022 annual picnic on july 16th was a huge success. after enjoying a cookout hosted by member john forsythe and his family,
            everyone gathered for a group photo with the newly rebuilt and repainted club locomotive which suffered extensive damage from hurricane ida last year.
            the dayâs photos are available in the gallery.
          


2023 fall meet




            the weather was perfect, but the attendance was down a little for the 2023 fall meet. the meet took place from september 1st
            through 3rd. there was a saturday memorial service for long-time member dave sclavi. several of daveâs family members were in attendance.
            photos from the meet are available in the gallery.
