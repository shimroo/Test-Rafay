introduction
to totty roots

(digging for our totty roots and finding the
leaves
on our totty genealogy tree)

the totty root's research group is an
informal,
non-profit entity consisting of our totty-families research group
mailing
list members (subscribers).     our primary goal
for
"totty roots" is to fully document our totty-families and their
associated
lines.   the secondary goal is to utilize our totty roots
mailing
list to share records which we then discuss, analyze and add to our
totty-families 
aka totty roots research group web site where you will find our records
and documented genealogies.   we at totty roots are dedicated
to protecting the rights and privacy of our living relatives. 
we encourage all involved in genealogy research to omit vital
information
on any of our family members who are still living,
unless
you have their express and or written permisson.  we need to
protect
our descendants, while we search for our ancestors. please
do your part to protect and respect the privacy of everyone
when
placing information on the web.

please be aware i am slow, which makes me
get way behind as i work for my husband, plus have children and
grandchildren,
that i dearly love, who take up a lot of my time.   my
intention
is to be as correct as humanly possible, but i may make unintended
mistakes
or errors when i type, so please do not be offended, please call the
error
to my attention and i will gladly make the correction asap.

december
of 1998.  they are also dedicated to all those totty &
associated
family researcher's who have sent family information, documentation,
deeds,
wills, census records etc., on all the totty family lines.
