 shiplights were both beautiful and built to last.while the product was perfect, i never expected to be offered such responsive customer service.  the showroom was opened to accommodate my day off, and once the order was placed,  the communication -- from fabrication to delivery at my doorstep -- was unparalleled.my lights reflect the nautical style i was hoping to achieve, they add value to my property, and will offer me years of enjoyment.  each time i approach my doorway, i will be certain to smile.  my light fixtures from shiplights bring a touch of a nantucket vacation to my home but they're something that i will be able to enjoy 365 days of the year.thank you shiplights!read morejeff carlton23:42 15 mar 21we were looking for a way to make the refresh of our...  beach house fireplace wall. we didn’t realize the answer would be in our own back yard. we purchased two of the brass nautical sconces and couldn’t have been happier.  the product was as authentic as you could want.  alicia was extremely accommodating.  we are on the lookout for other projects where we could use their lights.read morecourtney fields19:42 10 mar 21i was blown away by the amazing custer service i...  received from shiplights!
