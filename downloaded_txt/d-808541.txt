students and faculty in astronomy seek answers to fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the universe and the advancement of space science.
students and faculty conduct significant research in the field of astronomy. many students remain on campus during summer breaks to work on projects with faculty members. their findings are frequently shared at conferences, in posters, and through publication.
access to facilities on campus such as the foggy bottom observatory and the ho tung visualization lab supports these research efforts.

foggy bottom observatory






the campus community flocks to the foggy bottom observatory for events like the venus transit

the university’s location on a rural hilltop with limited light pollution grants us an incredible view of the night sky, even with the naked eye. students and faculty take full advantage of this feature of the university’s location with the foggy bottom observatory.
students and faculty utilize the advanced research equipment at this facility to conduct high-level research and educate members of the community about the features of the sky above them. researchers maintain detailed online records of the work they do and the history of the facility.
