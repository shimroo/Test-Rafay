emerson braaksma from tahoe tv's outside adventure joins chris in bobo's backcountry department to dive into the critical essentials for a safe and rewarding backcountry experience. together, they emphasize that preparation is everything when heading into the backcountry. the conversation starts with trip planning-mapping out your route, checking weather and avalanche conditions, and understanding your terrain. next, they cover the “big three” must-haves for safety: a reliable shovel, a beacon, and a probe. these tools are non-negotiable for anyone venturing off-piste and are vital for locating and rescuing individuals in the event of an avalanche.
the duo also touches on the often-overlooked danger of tree wells-hidden hazards that can quickly turn a powder-filled day into a dangerous situation. they stress the importance of skiing or snowboarding with a partner, staying in visual contact, and always being prepared to help each other out. whether you're a seasoned backcountry enthusiast or new to the off-piste world, this is a must-watch conversation to ensure you're equipped with the knowledge and gear you need to stay safe while exploring the mountains. remember, preparation and awareness are key to enjoying the beauty of the backcountry while minimizing risk. stop by bobo's backcountry department to gear up and learn more!
