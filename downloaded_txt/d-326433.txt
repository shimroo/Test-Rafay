fierce flora: tales of survival and demise



      most plants are relatively harmless, but beware some of the unique survival features plants have evolved to defend themselves against herbivores, infection, and plant competitors! explore this new multisensory exhibit that shares the ferocious side of the bright and beautiful plant world. plants have engaged in a millennia-long evolutionary struggle with their animal and plant competitors, and some people can experience negative consequences from touching, consuming, or, in rare cases, sitting beneath them. but some of the chemicals that cause harm can also be used for human good: more than half of pharmaceutical drugs are originally derived from plants. it’s a plant’s world; we are just living in it!
