project-based learning





preparing students for post-graduation success

hands-on experience


project-based learning is an integral part of the curriculum for every program in
                           the college of engineering and technology. our students work in teams with faculty
                           and staff, corporate partners, and project sponsors to discover solutions to problems
                           that will have impact far beyond the classroom. we offer students and partners access
                           to incredible facilities with the latest engineering technologies. as a result, we
                           have undergraduates who have received patents for new inventions and others whose
                           work has been published in prestigious journals. thanks to our project-based approach,
                           our graduates have a distinct advantage in the job market.
