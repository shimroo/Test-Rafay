from our customers

the report was extremely useful and i wish i had it long ago. it delivered the results i expected but the detail of the report was a very pleasant surprise. i think this software is excellent. the customer service from dr. wise has been timely and friendly. my expectations have been exceeded.
ashlei m., m.sc. educational psychologist
we have been using our reading success lab tools and love the results. it is an excellent program at a fraction of the costs of other programs, yet much more comprehensive.
ali h., ph.d., attention & achievement center president
my  daughter started your system as a 3rd grader with a fairly severe reading disability, far behind her peers. she used your intervention system throughout her school years. since entering high school, maeve has been on the honor roll each and every semester. 
i always thank our lucky stars that we met you.
katie f., parent
the reading success lab program is a success for disadvantaged readers. i assessed my at risk readers and was amazed that a few of them were diagnosed as dyslexic. the follow up one-word practice certainly helped.
kathleen r., tutoring center teacher
the schools report very favourable on the use of the software and its ability to encourage, support and monitor the increase in automaticity and understanding of fundamental skills of low-achieving students in numeracy and literacy.
professor john p., director simerr national research centre, university of new england, australia
i think the automaticity training is excellent!
michael g., elementary school sped teacher
…the use of rsl has given my students the confidence to take risks and engage with books and poem charts as they are able to recognize sight words and feel successful.  they are able to practice daily and look forward to improving their scores  and take great pride in showing that they ‘got more words today’.  it was that little extra push that they needed to show them that they can read!
