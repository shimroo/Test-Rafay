service

2022 update 
please note that in 2015 and 2017 we endured disruptive climate events and 
for much of 2020 to mid 2022 tourism was again impeded by covid related lockdowns 
and travel restrictions. as a result, many of the private rentals we previously offered for 
short term holiday lets have been repurposed for long term lets. 
we currently offer only 2 private rentals for short term lets. these are:- 





          tranquile villa        pete's casa       
















.








note:-  
this
english speaking island is not to be confused with the  dominican
republic 





   
     









































































the english speaking 
island, 
commonwealth of
dominica 
(pronounced domineeca),
is located south
of antigua,
monserrat and
guadeloupe in the eastern
caribbean.

long
regarded as
the nature island of the
caribbean,
it is truly a nature
lovers dream... a mountain range with several peaks approaching
5,000ft. cloaked in tropical rainforest
and lush vegetation.
dominica boasts a
river for
each day of the year. waterfalls, lakes and thermal hot springs
are in abundance.

nature
island destinations is based
in 
and dedicated to dominica. to you, the visitor, 
this service costs absolutely nothing to use.

our aim, through the pages of
this website and our personal service, is to make planning and booking
your visit to dominica not only easy, but fun, so that when you arrive,
you don't waste any of your precious holiday time.
we'll guide
you through a choice of places to stay, all
personally
inspected by nature island
destinations. 
you'll learn
all about how to get to dominica, how to get about, where to go and
what
to see and do in our beautiful island paradise, where crime is scarce
and
locals tend to be friendly, polite and helpful to visitors.

we have provided features on what there is to enjoy whilst on vacation
in dominica - such things as scuba diving, whale and dolphin seafaris,
birdwatching and botany tours with foresters, on our world heritage
site -
the morne trois pitons national park, rainforest aerial tram, the
world's second largest boiling lake, carnival in february, walt
disney's pirates of the caribbean, a lot of which was filmed in
dominica...  and more.
