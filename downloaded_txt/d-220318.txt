28 years of mdpdance

we are grateful to all of the teachers and students who have participated in past workshops and intensives.
we look forward to seeing you at one of our many mdp events this year.

probably the best money we ever spent on... dance education. can not possibly say enough wonderful things about the teachers. mdp rocks!!! we will be lifelong fans!!

mdp is a top-notch, rewarding experience for dance students. the faculty is passionate about teaching dance and that is apparent with their lively, devoted instruction, challenging choreography, and professional experiences. mdp provides a unique workshop opportunity where students receive personal attention and encouragement and are engaged in every moment of class.

i just want to say thank you for everything... giving me the confidence by just making me believe in myself. i wouldn't be the dancer i am today if mdp weren't apart of my life.
