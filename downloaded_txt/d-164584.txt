crucible's roots trace back to 1776, when the naylor and sanderson steel mill was established in sheffield, england. a century later, the company – then known as sanderson brothers - was exporting increasing quantities of tool steel to america and it was decided to establish a steelmaking plant in syracuse, new york. one hundred and thirty-three years later, we have been reborn as crucible industries llc.     although we have changed and evolved since that time, the one thing we have not changed is our relentless commitment to quality and to our employees. we believe that our steelworkers are the finest in the world. when you work with crucible industries you can be sure you are getting the finest steel, as well as the finest customer service in the specialty steel industry. crucible industries is an as9100d/en 9100:2016 / jisq 9100:2016, iso 9001:2015 – ansi/iso/asq q9001-2015,
