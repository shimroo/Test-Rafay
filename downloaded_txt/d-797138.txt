funding mental health research in arizona since 2001.

the necessity of mental health researchin the summer of 1999, governor jane hull and the arizona legislature created a commission called the bush commission to review and make recommendations on the state of mental health services in arizona. one of the commission’s key recommendations, suggested by commission members mike meyer, a private businessman and dr. alan gelenberg, past chair of psychiatry at the university of arizona was to establish a world-renowned institute to conduct mental health research and support young investigatorsin the ensuing two years, co-founders mike meyer and dr. gelenberg met with state legislators, scientists, business and community leaders to explore the creation of the institute. in 2001, success was achieved with the passage of senate bill 1391 by the arizona legislature and signed into law by the governor. senate bill 1391 provided for $5 million in state funds to the institute to be matched by the private sector. founding/initial board members included lauren meyer, joan shapiro, md, cheryl collier, michael zent, robert hess, chris wertheim, patty weiss, and james bush. governor hull, state legislators carolyn allen, ruth solomon and susan gerard were instrumental in passing the legislation to establish the institute. since 2020, imhr has been focused on identifying and funding research that investigates the mental health impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. the institute remains nimble and able to partner, create named funds both large and small, and work with endowments specified for unique areas of mental health including neurological approaches that may be areas of passion for specific donors. imhr is also dedicated to grantmaking for research that explores mental health care disparities, and the needs of vulnerable populations. this work is vitally needed, and findings from research in this space will make a life-changing impact for millions of people in the sate, the nation, and beyond.

imhr anti-racism statement “the opposite of racist isn’t ‘not racist.’ it is ‘anti-racist.’ being anti-racist requires persistent self-awareness, constant self-criticism, and regular self-examination."       –  ibram x. kendi, phd, founding director, boston university center for antiracist researchthe institute for mental health research is committed to being actively anti-racist, with a resolve to decrease the mental health burden engendered by systemic racism, and to ensure our behaviors as leaders, researchers, educators, scientists, philanthropists, and administrators meet these ideals. by very deliberately choosing to be anti-racist, we become actively conscious about race and racism, and are compelled to take actions to end racial inequities in our daily lives and the lives of the communities we serve.
