oak forest, illinois
is a suburban city that is located just 22 miles south of downtown chicago. the town's name came from the lush oak forests in the area, a portion of which remains today as a forest preserve. oak forest began primarily as a milk stop at the train station by farmers of bremen township in cook county. a turning point came in 1894 when the dupont family purchased property on the east side of the tracks, where they built what was billed as the world's largest gunpowder magazine and factory. the entire complex blew up in 1906.  a more lasting development came when the oak forest infirmary was completed in 1910. this hospital accommodated nearly 2,000 persons who were destitute due to mental illness, alcoholism, poverty and other problems. by 1932, there were more than 4,000 patients at the infirmary, including 500 with tuberculosis. the oak forest hospital continues to be an important part of the town today and one of the best health care systems in the country. by the 1920s, several residential subdivisions were built in oak forest, and in 1947, the community was incorporated as the village of oak forest.  the population slowly grew and in the 1960s, oak forest saw a dramatic growth in population. today, approximately 28,000 residents call oak forest home.
