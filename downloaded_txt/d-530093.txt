boston heights issues & candidates for november election (27 oct'23)

            all boston heights village voters will decide issues 39 and 40, renewals of the village's two fire levies,
            and consider the election of mayor, and of two members of village council. the last election for these
            council seats was in 2019; those seats became vacant and were filled by messrs. ron dick and david maccarone.
           
           the following are on the 7 november 2023 general election ballot:
boston hts village council, 2 to elect:
           
chris fenn (olde eight)
            
rich lyon (carlsfield way)
            
david maccarone (olde eight) (incumbent, by appointment)
            

boston hts village mayor:
           
ron antal (ianwood cir)
            
bill goncy (olde eight rd) (incumbent)
            


            village citizens will also choose members of their respective school boards. hudson school district voters will 
            also consider issue 9, a proposed 5.5 mill continuing operating levy.
           

            an explanation of the two boston heights levy renewals on the ballot tuesday, 7 nov'23:
            • fire levy, issue 39: 3-year, 0.75-mill levy renewal.
            this levy is a renewal of the current fire levy for operations, primarily payment of fire department staff.
            last renewed in nov'20 and now up for a vote again.
            • fire levy, issue 40: 5-year, 0.5-mill levy renewal.
            this levy is a renewal of the current fire levy for capital equipment, primarily purchase and maintenance
            of vehicles, equipment and facilities. last renewed in nov'18 and now up for a vote again.
            both of these fire levies now help finance the village's firefighting and ems contract with valley fire district.
            the balance of that contract is paid from general village funds.
            there is no change in the tax rate for either of these two village levies. because each would be a renewal
            of an older levy, if passed the state of ohio would continue to pay a portion of the millage through rollback
            reduction in the rate paid by the property owners. under current law, if the levy is not renewed and is later
            re-instituted, the entire millage would be paid by property owners. additionally, the effective millage
            is less than the voted millage, because as a renewal the levy can only raise the same total amount per year,
            despite increases in the tax base and valuations.

boston heights village still has discounted electric service!
           a discrepency in an online listing at energy harbor left some residents wondering if boston heights still
           had an electric service aggregation agreement, to provide discounted electricity for the residents. both
           mayor goncy and betty-lin fisher of the akron beacon journal have independently confirmed with energy harbor
           (nã©e first energy solutions) that boston heights does indeed have an electric service aggregation agreement
           with them. according to the mayor, this runs another two years.
           check your residential electric bill from first energy (ohio edison) to ensure you are receiving your
           electricity supply from energy harbor, currently at slightly less than 5 cents per kwh.

village council agenda for the

update! boston heights village council tonight interviewed candidates for the council seat vacated by
           mr. polyak's resignation. after discussion in executive session, it was decided to seek further information
           from the candidates, and to vote on the appointment at the next council meeting on 29 november 2022.
           an unexpected development: council decided to appoint current council member ron antal to the seat vacated
           by mr. polyak, and then to appoint a new council member to mr. antal's then-vacated seat. this notion,
           broached by mr. fenn, was intended to ensure that council benefited from mr. antal's prior experience
           through 2025, while ensuring that a new council member would have the opportunity to appear on the ballot in
           2023. it was not clear whether mr. antal formally resigned his current seat to enable this arrangement.

update: mayor goncy swore in mr. ron dick as member of village council, to fill the position left
           vacant by the resignation of ms. heather davis. he will serve the balance of that term, through 2023.
           after a lengthy discussion, council passed an revision of the anti-idling ordinance first passed in june;
           this version narrows idle-time restrictions solely to commercial vehicles (as defined in the ordinance) and
           only within 500ft of particular locations such as residences, parks, medical facilities, etc. (24 aug'22)

           zoning appeals, among other roles.





 
          

planning commission agenda for 3 august 2022
           meeting

update! the sheetz representative appeared at the at the 3 august pc meeting only to
           request a continuance of their application(s) until the next regular pc meeting on 7 september 2022. the
           planning commission granted that continuance. it was explained that the ohio department of transportation
           (odot), which controls dean memorial parkway, has demanded changes in the delination of turn lanes that
           would require substantial changes in the proposed sheetz site plan. sheetz had been advised that the pc was
           unlikely to be able to make a determination solely on the proposed conditional use without a substantially
           firm site plan, and so the entire matter is to be deferred until september. (4 aug'22)
note! this planning commission meeting was to only consider the sheetz proposal, continued from june
           2022. there will still be an additional pc & bza meeting on 18 august 2022 to consider any other
           business. (27 jun'22)

           the planning commission has deferred the sheetz application until its 3 august 2022 meeting, at the
           applicant's request. at the june meeting, the applicant's representatives and the pc had agreed on a set of
           issues that required further information from sheetz.
           in lieu of a formal meeting, the planning commission will convene for a work session at village hall, at the
           usual scheduled time of 7pm, 6 july 2022.

matthews-thomas park pool will not open this summer 2022.
           after a number of discussions at recent council meetings, the village has determined that it will not
           re-open the swimming pool at matthews-thomas park. the mayor's view is that the pool cannot be economically,
           and timely, made safe and usable in light of its age and condition. most of council concurred, and the pool
           area will be closed and "remediated".
           
            given the mixed views on the need, desirability, and fiscal support of a village swimming pool â with many
            residents quite vocal in their support â it has been suggested that the village field a bond levy at the
            ballot box to determine whether there is sufficient public support to cover the costs of building and
            operating a new pool. the mayor has asked the fiscal officer to look into the nuts and bolts of such a levy
            issue; if determined to be practical, this may be on the november 2022 ballot. the village administration
            may also seek other types of contributions.
           

            as to financial considerations, the village engineer has pointed out that no state or federal grants would
            be available for this type of project (as opposed to certain other types of park improvements, such as
            walking paths and parking). year-to-year reports on pool operations have shown that the majority of users
            are not village residents; though non-residents do pay more for pool memberships, those fees do not cover
            operation and maintenance costs, and the balance comes from general village funds. however, many residents
            who do use the pool, and others, are quite enthusiastic in its support.

            an explanation of the boston heights levy renewal on the ballot tuesday, 2 nov'21:
            road levy, issue 15: 5-year, 2.75-mill levy renewal.
            this levy is a renewal of the current road levy, last renewed in nov'16 and now up for a vote again. there
            is no change in the tax rate for this levy. because it would be a renewal of an older levy, if passed the
            state of ohio would continue to pay a portion of the millage through rollback reduction in the rate paid by
            the property owners. under current law, if the levy is not renewed and is later re-instituted, the entire
            millage would be paid by property owners. additionally, the effective millage is less than the
            nominal 2.75 mills, because as a renewal the levy can only raise the same total amount per year, despite
            increases in the tax base and valuations. the cost per $100,000 of property value would continue to be
            $71.26 per year.
            this road levy is for the purpose of general construction, reconstruction, resurfacing and repair of
            streets, roads and bridges. it may also provide some of the village's matching funds for larger paving
            projects that receive state and federal funding.

public hearing: rezoning of norwood inn
           hotel
           a public hearing will be held virtually, via zoom teleconference, 6:30pm, tue 27 october 2020 (before the
           2nd monthly council and finance meetings). the meeting will consider a rezoning request before council that
           would change the norwood inn property (nã©e holiday inn) from the mixed use subdistrict to the village center
           subdistrict within the hines hill overlay district. the underlying zoning of retail business would remain,
           but this change would potentially permit redevelopment of the property as multi-family residential
           housing.
           the planning commmission, on a split vote, has recommended this change to village council, which has the
           final say on the matter.
           the present applicants have stated a desire to redevelop the existing hotel buiding into just under 200
           apartments, mostly studios. rezoning is itself not sufficient to permit this; other approvals would be
           required as well. a previous applicant, earlier this year, also requested this same zoning change, intending
           to develop about half that many units, but withdrew the request before council could consider the matter.

            some history: at a recent council finance meeting, there was extensive discussion as to how to manage the
            pool in light of the covid-19 pandemic and state of ohio regulations. one council member favored closing
            the pool permanently due to maintenance costs and level of usage by village residents. the eventual
            consensus of council was to request a proposal from the pool's management company (hastings) for operation
            and staffing of the pool consistent with the current state regulations. presumably that proposal is the
            basis of the planned pool operation noted above. be prepared for reduced entry headcount permitted at the
            pool, requirements for social distancing, and enhanced cleaning.

village places renewal of fire capital levy on november'18 general election ballot
           the village of boston heights is seeking renewal of the fire capital levy at the upcoming general election
           on tuesday, 6 november 2018. the proposed renewal fire levy is for "providing and maintaining fire
           apparatus, appliances, buildings and sites". this levy pays for maintenance and repair of the village's fire
           station, fire vehicles, and firefighting equipment â all of which is leased to valley fire district for the
           village's firefighting and ems service. this levy, if renewed, would begin collection in 2020 and run for
           another 5 years at the same nominal 0.5 mill rate. that levy is currently adjusted to 0.45 mill for $14.20
           per year for every $100,000 of residential valuation. the levy was last renewed by the voters in november
           2014. (9 aug'18)

village receives state funding for boston mills road repairs, paving
           boston heights has succeeded in obtaining partial state funding for repairs and repaving of a further
           portion of boston mills road. this are phases i & ii of the overall boston mills road project; phase i
           is just west of olde eight road, and phase ii is just west beyond that. funding for phases iii and iv, the
           eastermost sections, remain to be determined.
           on 10 may 2018, the ohio public works commission awarded small government grants of $242,692 (phase i) and
           $242,207 (phase ii), along with additional loans (within the district revolving loan program) of $242,692
           (phase i) and $242,208 (phase ii). the loans have to be repaid by the village over time; the grants do
           not.
           together these funds constitute 69% of the overall $1.4m estimated cost of the phase i & ii projects,
           leaving an additional $436k to be funded locally from village funds (unless other sources can be
           realized).

public meeting: residential housing tax abatement
           cra
           a public hearing was be held at the boston heights village hall at 6pm, tue 13 mar 2018 (before the monthly
           council meeting). the meeting discussed "revisions to the cra map", more specifically, a a proposal to
           extend community reinvestment area tax abatements to an area of the village proposed for multi-unit housing
           (apartments and/or townhouses). (13 feb'18)
update: the cra proposal was approved and adopted at the subequent council meeting. the
           specifics of a probably multi-unit residential development at hines hill and olde eight roads remains under

           (23 jan'18)
previously: a special council meeting (also serving as a public hearing) will be held on 23 january
           2018 at 6pm, at the village hall, on the matter of a proposal to amend the zoning code to allow
           higher-density multi-unit housing ("attached dwelling community") in the light manufacturing zoning
           district. this was proposed on behalf of the owner of a large tract on chittenden road in that lm district.
           the planning commission recommended against this proposal at its dec'17
           meeting; that recommendation will be considered by council at this meeting.
          



 
          

 village council agenda for the 18 january
           2018 special meeting  (first posted: 18 jan'18)
special council meeting: 18 jan 2018 6pm
update: after a "spirited debate", council concluded that they required more information and further
           consideration on this issue, and will likely discuss it further at the finance committee meeting on tuesday,
           23 jan'18. (19 jan'18)

update: yet another "spirited debate" on this scheme took place at the council finance committee
           meeting of 23 jan'18. council concluded that they required still more information and plans a public
           meeting on the matter, perhaps some time in february. (24 jan'18)

earlier: village council will consider a measure to establish a residential cra (community
           reinvestment area), which would allow the village to extend a property tax incentive (abatement) for
           "residential development".
           while the village already has a cra established for commercial development and residential rehabilitation,
           this type of cra would allow abatements for new residential development, and furthermore would
           not require any compensation for lost taxes to the hudson city school district, or any school
           district.
           while council has deferred consideration of a specific development agreement until march, the establishment
           of this type of cra is intended to allow a tax abatement up to 100% over 15 years for development of about
           400 townhouse and/or apartment units across from arhaus/costco on hines hills road (the former driving
           range). this is conditionally permitted under the hines hill overlay zoning, with approval of the
           planning commission.
           reportedly this residential cra area would extend further into the northwest of the village, allowing the
           possibility of tax abatements for other residential development there in the future. (12 jan'18)
           a couple of less controversial measures are also on the meeting agenda: adjustment of the village income tax
           law to match the state law, and renewal of one of the fire levies. (18 jan'18)




 
          

village council agenda for the 9

           we have posted the draft agenda for the january 2018 regular council meeting; we will post the final agenda
           and related legislation as soon as possible after receipt from the village.
           
            one item of particular interest is council consideration of a 100% property tax abatement for a ~400-unit
            apartment/townhouse complex on the former driving range off of e. hines hill road, across from
            arhaus/costco. this is in the hudson school district; residential cra abatements do not require
            compensation to school districts as do commercial cras.
update: the ordinance enabling a residential cra for this area, and for other areas in the northwest
            quadrant of the village, has gone to a third reading, and presumably council vote, at a special council
            meeting scheduled for 6pm thu 18 jan'18.

           development agreement, presumably for extending a property tax incentive for "residential development".
           we have been unable to determine any details, to date, but likely related to development of higher-density
           housing (townhouses and/or apartments) on the former driving range, as conditionally permitted under
           the hines hill overlay zoning, as that is the only non-single-family residential zoning in the village.

           in furtherance of a proposed residential rental development on chittenden road. the village's announcement
           of this matter can be found here: pc to consider
           attached dwelling community zoning
           additionally, pc approved the rebranding of the clarion inn as norwood inn, and also approved a planned
           medical facility at hines hill and route 8, by akron children's hospital.

           due to changes in paving priorities and newly-received state grants, the village engineer has revised the
           village's 10-year capital improvements and paving plan. back in 2014, village council agreed to borrow a
           projected $5m for a village-wide paving and improvements plan (via notes in anticipation of bonds to be
           issued by the village). this included the now-complete northwest residential and commercial water mains and
           hookups, the rebuilding of hines hill road at the new commercial district, and a complete local road paving
           program. (10 nov'16)

village to decide levies for roads, schools
update: the village's road levy renewal, issue 26 on the ballot, passed:
           68% to 32%
           cuyahoga valley career center levy, issue 47: passed: 63% to 37%
           woodridge schools levy, issue 46: passed: 61% to 39%
           (all subject to updates from absentee/provisional ballots) (9 nov'16)

            an explanation of the boston heights levy renewal on the ballot tuesday, 8 nov'16:
            road levy, issue 26: 5-year, 2.75-mill levy renewal.
            this levy is a renewal of the current road levy, last renewed in nov'11 and now up for a vote again. there
            is no change in the tax rate for this levy. because it would be a renewal of an older levy, if passed the
            state of ohio would continue to pay a portion of the millage through rollback reduction in the rate paid by
            the property owners. under current law, if the levy is not renewed and is later re-instituted, the entire
            millage would be paid by property owners.
            this road levy is used to maintain the local roads, bridges, culverts and ditches within the village. it
            may also provide some of the village's matching funds for larger paving projects that receive state and
            federal funding, like the current paving on akron-cleveland road and the upcoming paving of olde eight
            road.
            the members of council supporting this renewal have offered this explanation and endorsement of the road levy
            renewal . (25 oct'16)


           village residents in the nordonia hills city school district will also be voting on:
           cuyahoga valley career center, issue 47: 1-mill levy renewal, continuing.

           village residents in the woodridge local school district will also be voting on:
           woodridge schools, issue 46: 10-year 6.67-mill levy renewal.

           increase, with an annual 3% step after 2 year; valley fire will in turn undertake hydrant maintenance,
           broader fire inspections, and acquire a third ambulance. some of the other contract provisions regarding
           equipment leasing and maintenence will also be modified. it appears that some of the village's fire
           equipment will sold (rather than leased) to valley fire, and other unneeded equipment will be sold off.

           council will meet in a special work session to discuss valley fire district's proposal for renewal of the
           village's fire and ems services contract, which expires this fall. valley fire district is requesting an

announcment of special council meeting 26 july
           2016
           council will meet to (a) authorize a contract for employee dental insurance, and (b) to re-start the legal
           process for a public vote on the renewal of the current road levy. apparently certifying resolution
           2016-3-16 (of march 2016) called for a 3 year "renewal" even though the current levy is for 5 years (as were
           its predecessors). the village must meet a 10 august deadline for the november ballot; resolution 2016-7-31,
           authorizing placement on the ballot, may need to be re-adopted as well, since it refers to the certifying
           resolution. (26 jul'16)

note: public meeting on natural gas aggregation plan at 6pm, preceding council meeting.
           this is an opt-out plan, meaning that residents will be enrolled by default unless they opt out with a form
           that will be provided by mail in a few weeks.
           
            we have posted the draft agenda for the may 2016 regular council meeting. we will post the final agenda and
            legislation as soon as possible.
           

            council adopted the enabling ordinaces that will launch a natural gas aggregation plan for village
            residents (and small businesses using less than 400mcf/month). further information will be mailed to all
            residents from both the village and from nopec, the plan administrator. those without a contracted gas
            supplier (i.e. on mvr or sco pricing from dominion) will be automatically enrolled unless they "opt out",
            as will be explained in the mailing. those already contracted to a gas supplier will automatically enrolled
            when (and if) their contracts expire, and may also opt out at that time. when enrolled, the customer will
            receive the nopec standard pricing rate, which changes every few months; they may also contact nopec to
            switch to the variable plan that tracks just under the sco rate. (11 apr'16)

boston heights voters permit natural gas aggregation
update: the village's gas aggregation measure, issue 11 on the primary ballot, passed: 73% to 27%. the village will shortly issue further
           information and hold two public meetings to explain the program, presumably after council formally selects a
           gas supplier. (15 mar'15)

            at the primary election on tuesday, 15 march 2016, boston heights voters passed issue 11, a measure that
            will permit village council to select a natural gas supplier for village residents. currently the village
            has no such "gas aggregation" program, although the mayor has in recent years arranged for residents to
            receive the hudson opt-in program rate.
            issue 11 permits council to select any gas supplier as it sees fit; however, all council discussions to
            date have revolved around the nopec gas aggregation offering, as has been selected by many other municipalities in ne
            ohio.
           

            as issue 11 has passed, if council ultimately selects nopec as the village supplier, then:
            â¢ residents will receive more info by mail and can participate in two public meetings;
            â¢ residents would be automatically enrolled in the nopec gas program (with some exceptions);
            â¢ residents could upon request "opt out" of that program initially and every 2 years;
            â¢ residents who do opt-out will continue to select their own gas supplier (or deog sco);
            â¢ residents that do not opt-out can still cancel any time without penalty or fee;
            â¢ residents still get natural gas delivered and billed by dominion east ohio gas;
            â¢ residents can still use budget billing from dominion east ohio gas;
            â¢ residents would pay a 2-month fixed rate for gas ($2.74/mcf for april 2016);
            â¢ some residents may qualify for the nopec variable rate service, slightly under the doeg sco rate.

           e. hines hill road between olde 8 road and state route 8 has been posted for closure from 10 august until

 the planning commission approved the conditional use and preliminary site plans for a
           dominion east ohio gas training center on 17+ acres east of route 8 and just north of the turnpike (on the
           so-called alnola farms north parcel). the facility will include a 37,311 sq.ft. building, and various
           training structures and areas behind that building, facing the turnpike. the bza approved a variance to
           allow the oversize building in this district, with the proviso that the lot size remain as is, not to be
           divided smaller in the future. the facility will be enclosed by a security fence, for which the bza allowed
           a variance to allow 8 ft. height but requiring landscape buffering for the hines hill road view. in
           addition, the pc approved an accessory use to allow a microwave tower on the site for the gas company's data
           network, both for the facility and as a regional relay point; the bza permitted the tower height of 190
           feet, somewhat less than several of the cell towers nearby. various conditions and requirements accompanied
           these approvals, to be settled with the village engineer and zoning inspector, and pending a final site plan
           approval by the pc. construction is expected to begin in fall 2015. (6 jul'15)

village registration required for newspaper, phonebook, literature distribution

           the village in order to distribute newspapers, phonebooks, and commercial or non-commercial printed
           literature of any type. the measure was originally intended to thwart the roadside litter (and drain
           blockages) created by unretrieved phonebooks and weekly newspapers. however, it appears to apply equally to
           daily delivery of the plain dealer and akron beacon journal, etc. there is a $35 annual fee required for
           this registration; interested parties are advised to contact betty klingenberg, village fiscal officer, for

bass pro to join costco as marketplace retail anchor store
           bass pro shops has announced its plans to build one of its signature big-box retail stores in boston
           heights, on the former boston hill country club. the news was apparently kept under wraps pending passage of
           significant tax incentives. the village of boston heights and hudson city schools approved those tif plans
           earlier this week, for both this and the previously-announced costco project. (13 may'15)

           meeting 
           the planning commission conditionally approved the final site plans for the arhaus facility on the western
           side of the former boston hills country club. approval was deferred for the olde eight perimeter buffer,
           pending review of more complete grading and landscaping plans. this reflected concerns about how that
           buffer's mound was to be sculpted, and its setback from the roadway. the developer's spokesman and the
           village engineer emphasized that the current state of that mounding was entirely temporary, and that
           significant improvements would be made further along in the construction project.
           
            the pc also conditionally approved plans for a costco store, a members-only "warehouse club". this will be
            situated around the middle of the former boston hills country club, just off of e. hines hill road near
            ohio route 8. the costco plan includes a 150,000 sq.ft. warehouse store with tire center, and a
            free-standing service (gas) station, which is also members-only.

akron summit county public library levy (renewal & increase) passes
           issue 8: akron summit county public library levy, 1.9 mills 6 years: pass 70% to
           30% (16177-7070 votes, as of am 6 may'15)
           as is traditional, the boston heights vote went the other way: 20 yes and 31 no. (6 may'15)
           source: summit county board of elections tabulation


             the only issue on the ballot in boston heights was for the akron-summit county library levy, and this is only for village voters in the
            nordonia and woodridge schools districts. the library levy is a renewal-and-increase to 1.9 mills; more can
            be read about the issue here. (28 apr'15) 


           note that boston heights voters in the hudson school district cannot vote on this issue â nor do boston
           heights property owners in that district pay any library levy whatsoever, because of a quirk of the hudson
           library taxation setup. library users that feel a little guilty about that can, however, contribute to the
           friends of the
           hudson library.

 "army reserve"
           land sold by usa to private owner
             a once-contentious parcel of land in boston heights has finally been sold. the so-called "army
           reserve" is a 22-acre parcel (# 1300941) along olde eight road, just north of the turnpike and a bit south
           of hines hill road. as of 3 april 2015 it was sold, apparently as a result of an online auction last
           fall, by the usa to a newly-formed private holding company: "olde route 8 land holdings llc" (ohio #
           2363607). it is notable that this company shares its agent with a number of other companies associated with
           sam petros of petros homes, who is connected with the developments on the former boston mills golf course.
           that auction closed at $376k but the actual purchase price is unknown.
             in 2002, this property was purchased by the federal government in order to build a new army reserve
           center. the project was presented to the village as essentially a fait accompli, but citizens and the
           village objected on the basis of heavy traffic in essentially a residential area, lack of suitable roadway
           access, loss of tax duplicate, and loss of potential tax-paying business development. after public protests,
           resolutions from the village, and (perhaps more significantly) the intercession of then- rep. latourette,
           the army reserve project was moved to its current location as of 2008: on chamberlain road in twinsburg. the
           usa has retained ownership of the land for the past 13 years, until now. (4 apr'14)

boston heights now an official postal city address for 44236, 44264 zips
           the village of boston heights was recently notified by the us postal service that "boston heights, oh" is
           now an official city name that can be used for village postal addresses in the 44236 and 44264 zip codes.
           this was based on a proposal to council last year, and council's resolution to make that request of the
           usps, with the further efforts of mayor goncy. while "boston heights, oh" often previously worked as a
           postal address unofficially, mail was sometimes returned or delayed. this change ensures that the post
           office will recognize our town as a legitimate address, and it can safely be used by businesses and
           residents alike in the village. council also hoped that this will encourage new (and old!) village
           businesses to identify with "boston heights".
           it may take some time for this update to percolate out to commercial addressing (shopping, billing).
           however, no address change is required â residents and businesses need not take any action.
            â¢ all zip codes remain the same within the village.
            â¢ mail delivery is completely unaffected â same post office, same carrier.
            â¢ only 44236 (hudson) and 44264 (peninsula) addresses are included (not 44067).
            â¢ it is still ok to use "hudson 44236" & "peninsula 44264" if preferred.

residents turn out to endorse continuation of the village's pool
           about 50 residents and other users turned out at the village's public meeting, tue 27 jan'15, to discuss the
           future and the finances of the village's swimming pool at matthews-thomas park. the overwhelming consensus
           of those attending was that the village should continue to operate the pool, with an outside management
           company if that was preferable. quite a few pool users conceded that membership fee increases might be
           necessary and justified. upon questioning, all the council members gave their views for and against
           continuing the pool operation. concerns revolved around the costs of operation vs. utility to the village
           residents, and long-term capital and maintenance costs.
           ultimately it appeared that pool operations would be continued for the time being, and that the village
           would attempt to increase utilization and membership fee income, while also gathering data for long-term
           operations and capital expenses. (28 jan'15)

village sets public meeting on fate of the public pool at matthews-thomas park
 notice of public hearing, tue 27 jan 2015 at
           7pm 
           a public meeting has been set for tue 27 jan'15, 7pm at village hall, to solicit residents' views on the
           future of the village's wimming pool. at the 16 dec'14 finance committee meeting, a discussion on the
           management of the pool at matthews-thomas park detoured into a push for closing the pool permanently, and
           demolishing it.
           in recent months, the village administration, in conjunction with council's lands & buildings committee,
           has explored outsourcing the staffing and operation of the pool at matthews-thomas park. at the tuesday
           meeting, mayor bill goncy outlined a proposal from hastings water warks co., which would provide all
           staffing and operation of the pool next summer at an operational cost of about $33k, just above last year's
           pool budget. (there would also be an additional one-time equipment cost of about $4k to upgrade the
           chlorinator system.)
           in reply to questions from council, fiscal officer betty klingenberg stated that pool memberships had
           declined last year, perhaps due to extensive closure early in the season stemming from equipment problems,
           and that village residents' memberships were in the minority. further, membership fees covered only a
           portion of the seasonal pool expenses â the balance being covered by general village funds, primarily from
           the hotel bed tax.
           several members of council proposed that the pool instead be closed permanently, rather than outsourced.
           councilors ron antal and glen blakeney suggested that as the pool was not paying for itself, and if village
           residents were not much interested in it as a resource, that the village ought not be funding it â
           especially in light of ongoing equipment and maintenance costs. councilors janet miller and ron fenn, along
           with mayor goncy, supported continuing pool operations through 2015 to see if outsourced management and
           better publicity would improve its bottom line.
           to gauge public sentiment on the issue, council and the mayor set a public meeting before the january
           finance committee meeting, 7pm on 27 jan'15. council members also solicited public input directly to them by
           phone or
           email. in the meantime, the mayor will explore the costs of removing the pool and associated facilities.

village officials boost renewal of fire capital levy for 4 nov'14 general election
           an issue 44 flyer
           from committee to renew fire levy 
           is circulating within the village in support of the renewal of the fire capital levy at the upcoming general
           election on tuesday, 4 november 2014. the flyer is endorsed by mayor goncy and most of the members of
           village council.
           issue 44, the proposed renewal fire levy, is for "providing and maintaining fire apparatus,
           appliances, buildings and sites". this levy pays for maintenance and repair of the village's fire station,
           fire vehicles, and firefighting equipment â all of which is leased to valley fire district for the village's
           firefighting and ems service. this levy, if renewed, would run for another 5 years at its current 0.5 mill
           rate: $15.75 per year for every $100,000 of residential valuation. (note that this levy's millage rate was
           reduced when last renewed in 2009.) (30 oct'14)

 village adopts comprehensive plan
           after several years of work by volunteers, village officials, and independent consultants â and a broad
           range of public meetings and involvement â boston heights has adopted a comprehensive land use plan for the
           village. village council adopted the plan, as recommended by the planning commission, at its august 2014
           meeting.
           the plan is intended to guide future development in the village, while protecting residential values, and
           bolster legal support for the village's zoning codes. professional assistance in creating the plan was
           provided by environmental design consultants of akron, with the support of a connected communities grant
           from amats. (3 oct'14)
           the plan document can be obtained from village hall (at cost), or can be found online at the village's

            walters road will be closed starting on october 1, 2014 for a maximum of 7 continuous calendar days. the
            road will re-open to traffic no later than october 8, 2014. closure is located between hines hill and

political/election signs in boston heights
           at a recent council finance committee meeting, it was suggested that the village's regulations on political
           signs had elicited some surprise and confusion among the village's citizenry. refer to our page on political sign regulations in the village of boston heights, including
           the current temporary sign registration form. there are no new changes to these regulations.
           
            the village's codified ordinances have for many years required registration of temporary political signs,
            as well as barring them from the public right of way. the most recent change to the regulations was in
            september 2012 (ord. 15-2012) when, after a duly advertised public meeting (attended by only two citizens), planning
            commission meetings, and several council meetings, the permitted lifetime for a political sign was
            decoupled from any particular election. the permitted maximum size of any one sign was also increased, for
            most zoning districts. previously, political signs regulations had been set in january 2005 by the omnibus
            chapter 1179 sign code revisions (ord. 3-2005). before that, such signs had been regulated by the former
            chapter 715 of the village's code. essentially the same registration and placement requirements have been
            retained from these older regulations. (24 sep'14)

council road committee, june 2014 - sewer rates
minutes of
           the village council's road committee meeting, mon, 16 june'14  (19 jun'14)
           among other matters, the road committee discussed sewer rates in the village. some residents have expressed
           interest in having metered sewer rates (tied to water usage) rather than the current flat rate charges. any
           change requires the village to convert all sewer users in the village over to metered rates (except for
           well-water users). rates are noted in the minutes, above. it was noted at a recent council meeting that, at
           least in other summit county locales, metered rates have proven cheaper for some residents, and more
           expensive for others. it is not clear how commercial sewer users would be affected. council is expected to
           discuss the matter further. in addition, the committee found that there are sewer service discounts
           available for senior/disabled homeowners with limited income; information on that program is attached as
           well. (19 jun'14)

            of particular interest this month is:
            â¢ council adopted the ordinance that authorizes the program that will bring water mains to the
            neighborhoods in the northwest corner of the village, including hookups to homes along the new water mains.
            the ordinance passed 4-2, with councilors bartko and antal voting "no" and fenn, blakeney, miller and
            polyak "yes". it was explained in earlier meetings that the intention is to borrow the funds for this
            project against future taxes expected from the arhaus headquarters development.
            â¢ a pair of resolutions "unwound" (rescinded) council's previous approval of the termination of the
            previous road superintendent, and authorized a settlement with him that presumably includes the special
            early retirement program created in december. we have been unable to obtain a copy of this agreement, to
            date.
            â¢ council authorized an agreement with the state of ohio that will permit the akron-cleveland road bridge
            rebuilding project to move ahead this summer. the village will contribute 20% of the costs, of which summit

village council notice of 5
           march 2014 special meeting  (first posted: 4 mar'14)
           village council held another special meeting at 6:30pm wednesday 5 mar'14, at the village hall, to further
           consider a program to construct water lines and service hookups. this is the same issue as considered at
           monday's special meeting; council decided to go through the standard three readings of the ordinance rather
           than moving ahead to an immediate vote.
           
            the issue received a second reading, followed by a brief discussion. there was no debate on building the
            water mains; however, councilor ron antal expressed concern about the propriety and precedent of paying for
            the provisions on and to private property. a discussion followed as to the costs and public purpose of this
            part of the program. mr. antal also asked why brandywine road was not included in the program; engineer
            dave krock explained that it was due to the very high additional cost coupled with low housing density,
            along with the low level of interest expressed there in earlier village surveys on water service. mayor
            goncy added that the more significant problems with water well service and potential contamination were
            clustered in the northern neighborhoods. further debate and public comment is expected at next week's
            regular meeting of council, as well as a council vote on the program. (6 mar'14)


            the notice (linked above) includes the planning document that explains for the proposed program to bring

           village council will hold a special meeting at 6pm monday 3 mar'14, at the village hall, to consider a
           program to bring water lines to parts of the northwest quadrant of the village, and to begin the process of
           contracting the engineering for that and other capital projects.
           
update: we have updated the notice (linked above) with the meeting agenda, legislation, and the
            planning document for the proposed program to bring water service to wolcott, sholle, grandview, beverly,
            richard and part of olde eight roads. (3 mar'14)
update: council adopted the resolution to seek engineering qualifications, but decided not to act on
            the waterline program just yet, allowing it to receive three readings before council. it is currently
            expected that a second reading will occur at a brief meeting on 5 mar'14, and the third reading, and vote,
            at the regular meeting of council on 11 mar'14.
            as there was no public forum segment scheduled for this special meeting, village officials held an informal
            q&a and commentary session afterwards. aside from questions and explanations on the proposed program
            itself, residents variously expressed concerns about the program being delayed by these legislative
            procedures, and in objection to the entire policy of village-provided waterline hookups from streets to
            homes. (4 mar'14)

           of boston heights proposal to repave portions of olde eight road. phase 1 and phase 2 of the project were
           funded at $696k and $768k, respectively, of federal highway funds.
           according to the enabling legislation passd by council in november 2013, $457.5k in local funds will be
           required for the entire project. according to res. 2013-11-60, phase 1 is the northerly section from boston
           mills road north to the northfield center twp line; res. 2013-11-61 shows phase 2 as southerly section from
           the boston mills road to state route 303. both phases consist of removal of 3 inches of asphalt, about 20%
           repair, 3 inches of new asphalt, and associated signage and striping.
           presumably this work would be done after any excavation needed for extension of water mains down olde
           eight road, as is envisioned in conjunction with the planned arhaus project. (2 feb'14)
           an additional $248k was also allocated for the village's phase 3, which is repaving of akron-cleveland road
           south of route 303. the reconstruction of that road's bridge over the bike-and-hike trail (ohio edison rail
           right-of-way) is slated to begin this summer; that project will also be largely paid with federal funds.

village council approves tax abatement for arhaus project
hht: boston heights approves compensation agreement with arhaus furniture
(2 feb'14)
see february 2014 hudson life magazine for an update on:
hlm: hudson schools would benefit from new arhaus headquarters (1 jan'14)

our report (29 jan'14):
           boston heights village council considered the cra property tax incentive for arhaus furnitue (homeworks) at
           a special council meeting on 28 jan'14. after extensive public comment, and a great deal of
           explanation, council voted to approve the cra agreement, hudson schools compensation agreement, and
           development agreement with the property owners, by a vote of 5-1.
           
            a major topic of discussion was a plan to bring "city water" to homes along northern olde eight road (at
            the developer's expense) and to homes on five residential streets in the northwest quadrant of the village
            (at the village's expense, using revenue anticipated from the arhaus payroll).
           

 councilor bob bartko, who voted against the agreements, had earlier circulated a
            letter to some village residents decrying the revisions to the legal settlement governing this site at the
            former boston hills country club â specifically, the loss of dedicated green space. in response to a
            resident's question, village engineer dave krock noted that the revised agreement requires more extensive
            and specific requirements for barrier landscaping along olde eight road.
           

            a map analysis here at boston heights overlook shows that about 19.4 acres of greenspace (deedable to the
            village) was lost in the revised settlement, leaving about 38.3 acres along olde eight road and along the
            northern border of the property. at the same time, an additional 2.0 acres of greenspace was offered for a
            hines hill road bike trail easement, and 10.0 acres for greenspace incorporating a stormwater detention
            zone easement along route 8. the settlement agreement does not oblige the village to accept either deed or
            easement for any of those areas. for comparison, the proposed arhaus building's initial footprint is about
            16.4 acres.
           

            the hudson school board has already approved a plan for compensation by the village for a portion of its
            forgone property tax revenues.

new metro bus routes change boston heights access
           new metro bus routes took effect on tuesday, 21 january 2014, which change public transport bus access in
           boston heights. formerly the #102 bus stopped at the clarion inn on each north/south pass between
           northfield/twinsburg and downtown akron. now the #102 bus runs to the northfield park casino without
           stopping in boston heights. the #103 bus now runs between downtown akron and the boston heights clarion inn
           -- but that's the end of the line, with no stops further north. the new #104 bus now runs through hudson to
           the twinsburg industrial parks. the express x60 between akron and cleveland still stops at the odot
           park-and-ride lot on chittenden road, just north of route 303.

village public forum on development of former bhcc golf course
           the village of boston heights held a "public forum" for 7pm tuesday, 17 dec'13 at the village fire
           station to discuss the proposed development of the former bhcc golf course. click here: public forum
           announcement 
update: at the public forum meeting on 17 dec'13, representatives of boston hills property and
           premier development gave an overview of the proposed arhaus furniture development on the former boston hills
           country club golf course. a 760,000+ sq.ft. distribution center and headquarters building is proposed on the
           western side of the property, off of the intersection of hines hill and olde eight road. the eastern side of
           the property, along state route 8, is still slated for future retail development, perhaps as soon as
           2014.
           all truck traffic will be directed east toward the highways, and the developers will improve e. hines hill
           road up to the truck entrance. there will be an unspecified number of semi trailer docks on both the west
           and east sides the arhaus building, likely in excess of 100. offices will be toward the north of the
           building, where a wooded buffer area will be maintained toward adjacent residences. a substantial built-up
           buffer area will be created along the length of the olde eight road boundary, with the intention of
           eliminating lines of sight to the truck docks. water lines would be extended from the north along olde eight
           road, with the developer providing tap-ins for residents along that stretch of road. sewer service would be
           brought in from hines hill road.
           about 230-250 employees would be moved into the facility, with the intention of adding more positions over
           the next few years. marshal pitchford, the village's solicitor, explained some of the provisions of the
           proposed cra tax abatement associated with incoming employee count, guaranteed payroll, and planned growth.
           the facility would receive an 85% property tax abatement for 15 years (improvements only, not the underlying
           land). hudson schools would receive a one-time payment of $500,000 and then an increasing fraction of the
           village's employment income tax revenue from the facility during the 6-15th years of the abatement.
           the village's compensation agreement with the hudson city school district can be read here: hudson/vbh
           compensation agreement 17 dec'13 .
           because the "zoning" of the property is governed by a 2008 legal settlement, many of the provisions of this
           development are not subject to the village's usual zoning code. mr. pitchford stated that the negotiated
           changes have already been worked into an administrative amendment of that settlement, as was permitted by
           the original agreement.
           that revised settlement, or "agreed judgement entry" can be read on the summit county clerk of courts
           website (case cv-2007-07-4696); a replica of that document can be read here: agreed judgement entry 12-17-2013
.
           additionally, however, the development is contingent on village council authorizing the cra tax abatement,
           which will be considered in january. (18 dec'13)

            we have made our own audio recording of this meeting available online: boston heights public meeting: arhaus bhcc development 17 dec'13 


furniture today: arhaus to build new cleveland-area headquarters (17 dec'13)


update: the hudson schools board of education approved, on 16 dec'13, a compensation agreement with
           the village of boston heights concerning a proposed tax abatement for homeworks dba arhaus for development
           at hines hill road in the village. this appears to involve a $500,000 one-time payment from the village to
           the hudson schools, plus annual compensation payments.
           a summary of the agreement can be found in the hudson boe 16 dec'13
           agenda .
           note that all of the village comprises a community reinvestment area (cra) that permits the village to offer
           property tax abatements for up to 15 years. the east hines hill road area (including the former boston hills
           country club) is in the hudson city school district. this kind of agreement is commonly used to compensate
           the affected school district for loss of property tax collections due to a tax abatement granted by the
           municipality. under state law, in the absence of an agreement the school district would be entitled to 50%
           of the new local employee income tax collections during the abatement period (for payrolls over $1m).
           (17 dec'13)

           at the december council meeting, mayor goncy announced that the village was working with arhaus furniture to
           bring its new headquarters and distribution center to the village. informal discussion suggests that the
           complex is projected for the middle of the former boston hills country club golf course on hines hill road,
           with green space remaining to the west and north, and future retail still slated for the eastern part of the
           property. proposed site details are expected to be offered at the public forum meeting. (13 dec'13)

           that property's development is currently governed by a 2008 lawsuit settlement
           agreement, largely outside the village's zoning code.




 
          

arhaus furniture proposes $43m distribution center & hq in village
           arhaus furniture, currently headquarted in walton hills, ohio, is proposing to build a new headquarters and
           distribution center in boston heights. the site is the central part of the old boston heights country club
           golf course on e. hines hill road near route 8. the development is said to be on the order of 770,000 square
           feet with eventual expansion to one million square feet. (17 dec'13)

            the company appears to have negotiated a tax incentive agreement with the village, with the concurrence of
            the hudson city school district. presumably this involves a modification of the 2008 agreement that settled
            the property owner's zoning lawsuit with the village.
            the village held a "public forum" meeting to discuss the proposal, as noted below, at 7pm tue 17 dec'13 at the fire station.

           replatted into several large parcels at the corner of route 8 and e. hines hill road. at the same time those
           parcels were deeded to new corporate entities (all of which still share a mailing address with petros
           homes).
           at the same time, the smaller parcels in the northwestern wooded area of the property have been consolidated

village council agenda for the 9
           october 2013 regular meeting  (first posted: 8 oct'13, revised: 26 nov'13)

           we have now (25 nov'13) received all of the october legislation text in response to our public records
           request made on tuesday, 8 oct'13. lately received were:
           â¢ agreement for bookkeeping
           help from the state auditor
           â¢ richfield police dispatch
           contract
           note: the richfield contract may be superceded by a revision adopted by res-2013-11-65 at a special council
           meeting on 26 nov'13.
           
            the agenda for the october
            2013 council meeting (as distributed at the meeting, which differed significantly from the agenda sent out
            earlier) is now available, along with the legislation text and exhibits, and with our own commentary.
            (first posted: 16 oct'13, revised: 26 nov'13)


            developments of interest include: a change to the places village legislation is to be posted; permission
            for the police department to work with certain county squads, and to add a k-9 dog; contract with richfield for police
            dispatching; agreement
            with the state auditor to resolve some accounting problems in the village books; sell an old fire
            engine; donate some old police equipment; account for additional funds to repair hines hill road.
           

            the october council meeting agenda included an "administrative hearing", which turned out to be an appeal
            to council of the mayor's termination of an employee, as allowed by village codified ordinance 147.17.
            after a brief recess, council reconvened and mayor bill goncy handed the gavel over to council president
            pro tempore don polyak. mr. polyak stated that the hearing was to consider an appeal of the august 29, 2013
            termination of employment of james robinson -- presumably as road superintendent, though this was not
            stated explicitly. mr. robinson had also been the village's fire chief. council then voted to enter
            executive session "to discuss employment matters". in response to our query, mr. polyak later reported that
            council returned to public session and voted 6-0 to uphold mayor goncy's termination of mr. robinson's
            employment with the village.

council approves fire/ems contract with valley fire district
update: with the introduction of a new resolution at a special meeting, boston heights village
           council voted in favor of contracting with valley fire district in peninsula to take over fire and
           ems services for the village. there were 5 votes for the contract (r. fenn, d. blakeney, g. blakeney, r.
           antal and d. polyak), and 1 against (f. baxter). the resolution was adopted as an emergency measure, which
           generally precludes a public referendum for repeal.
           council members' statements on this change have generally accorded with mayor goncy's
           report (7/16/2013)  as presented in last month's town hall meeting. (mr. baxter has stated that he preferred to take the
           matter to a public ballot.)
           there were some animated objections made by members of the current fire department and others attending the
           meeting. in addition to unhappiness with the outcome, some felt there should have been another round of
           public commentary scheduled, in addition to that at the last two public meetings.
           barring further developments, this handover of services will occur on october 1, at which time the village's
           local fire department will be disbanded. the service contract requires valley fire to offer a position to
           current legally-qualified members of the village's fire department. ancillary contracts lease the village's
           fire station and equipment to valley fire district, which will also dispatch an ambulance from the village's
           fire station. (23 aug'13)

            a misleading story in the west side leader, reporting on the 14 august meeting of the boston township
            trustees, seemed to suggest that the contract was already signed. this appeared to be based on last week's
            valley fire district approval of the contract, and an assumption that it would also be approved the same
            night by boston heights village council. however, this did not occur and was apparently not corrected by
            press time.
wsl: "...
            boston trustees" (22 aug'13)


            on a less contentious note, council also voted to accept a settlement with the contractor at the former
            krejci dump cleanup site. this will provide substantial funding for the expected rebuilding of west hines
            hill road.
(22 aug'13)


previously:
           mayor goncy has called a special council meeting on this coming thurday evening in order to have council
           reconsider the question of a fire/ems contract with valley fire district, via a new resolution 2013-8-43. a
           similar resolution 2013-8-38 failed to pass at the 14 aug'13 regular council meeting.
           resolution 2013-8-33 was added later to this meeting's agenda; this measure would approve a settlement
           agreement with the kreji dump cleanup contractor, regarding the condition of hines hill road.

further info on proposed fire/ems contract with valley fire district
update: boston heights village council voted not to authorize the proposed contract that would
           have had valley fire district take over fire and ems services for the village. there were 3 votes for the
           contract (fenn, d. blakeney, g. blakeney), 1 against (baxter), 1 abstention (polyak), and 1 absentee
           (antal). a majority was required to proceed with the proposal. (14 aug'13)

earlier: the village of boston heights issued a newsletter giving further information about a
           proposed contract for fire and ems services with valley fire district; the issue will be considered by

 vote on proposed contract with valley fire

           we are informed that the board of the valley fire district accepted these contracts at their regular meeting
           on 8 aug'13.

           the boston heights fire department association, which is a private association of boston heights
           firefighters, mailed a letter to village residents on 6 aug'13 objecting to this proposal, and disputing
           some of the claims made in support of the plan, including current vs. projected response times.

public town hall meeting on fire/ems services: village hall, tue 16 july 2013

update:
wsl: "...
           details of the [proposed contract for fire and rescue services between the valley fire district and the
           village of boston heights] have been hammered out, but it still needs to be approved by boston heights and
           valley fire district members..." (1 aug'13)

           the village of boston heights held a very animated "town hall meeting" on a proposal to contract with with
           the valley fire district for fire and ems services, on the evening of tuesday, 16 july 2013 at the boston
           heights village hall.
 mayor goncy's
           report to vbh public town hall meeting fire/ems 7/16/2013 
           the mayor and village council's safety committee presented the outlines of the plan, which would essentially
           mothball the village's own fire department, terminate current ems and dispatch contracts with macedonia, and
           contract for all fire response and ems services with valley fire district. valley fire would receive
           contractual payment for these services, and would pay to lease the village's fire station and equipment,
           providing full-time staffed response from either the valley station on route 303, or from the boston heights
           station during some hours of weekdays. the net costs were described as very close to the costs of operating
           the current department with existing contracts, but would provide better coverage with increased response
           manpower.
           the contract is expected to include a provision requiring valley to offer employment to current village fire
           department personnel, subject to legal requirements, but seniority (and the officer command structure) would
           not carry over. the primary justification offered was that staffing an all-volunteer on-call department has
           become impractical in this area: daytime manpower response had become minimal, with macedonia being called
           upon to respond to all fire calls in addition to ems calls, and that the overall department was down to ten
           active members. the implication seemed to be that combination with an existing staffed department was more
           fiscally sound than expansion of the town's own department into a full-time staffed operation.
           several dozen village and area residents, including members of both fire departments, commented at length on
           this proposal. several members of the boston heights fire department expressed opposition to the plan, and
           in particular felt that insufficient attention had been given to a departmental proposal to operate its own
           ambulance and increase staffing. some also disputed specific statements by the mayor and council members
           about the current and historical operation of the department. several people felt the village's firefighters
           were not being treated with sufficient consideration.
           a variety of other operational questions were asked, and answered to various degrees of detail. the contract
           is still being negotiated, though a current draft copy was made available at the meeting. mayor goncy said
           there was no current schedule for a vote on a final contract. there were a number of complaints about this
           matter not being sufficiently publicized; it was pointed out that it had been under discussion in public
           meetings of council and its committees since last year. (16 jul'13)

           balances of various village financial reports.
           â¢ correction: council authorized the first step in placing an additional road levy before the
           village's voters in november. (it had been erroneously announced at the meeting that this vote had
           failed.)
           â¢ police chief ray heatwall received a citation from the summit county sheriff for his work with the swat
           unit.
           â¢ further road repairs and crack sealing will be carried out this year, but no further chip sealing. bidding
           for the hines hill road reconstruction project should begin in july, as will bidding for the village hall

update: the planning commission and the village engineer reviewed prestige homes' proposal for a new

           the 5000-6000 sq.ft. homes would be built between ledgeview and brighton subdivisions, on 45 acres between
           olde eight and the bike and hike trail. some of the homes would be in the woodridge schools and some in the
           hudson schools. the engineer requested updates to documentation on the septic systems, and pointed out that
           the proposed 1800-foot cul de sac exceeded the maximum permissible 1000 foot length for such dead-end roads.
           the bulk of public commentary and questioning from from neighboring homeowners, who were concerned about
           water well impacts, septic system placements, tree preservation, and privacy and rural lifestyle issues. the
           planning commission deferred the application until july to allow prestige homes to supply required
           documentation and to either bring the length of the planned roadway into compliance or formally petition the
           pc for a platting variance to allow the longer cul de sac. (6 jun'13)




 
          

council road committee, june 2013

            the village council's road committee held a special meeting 3 june 2013 to air various options for a
           proposed increase or addition to the existing road improvement levy. village engineer dave krock presented
           an outline of projected costs for complete asphalt repaving of all village roads over various time periods.
           that presentation is available here:
2013 proposed road levy presentation, 3
           jun'13 
           the public discussion focused on the dissatisfaction of wellington court residents with maintenance of their
           street in particular, and those of the ashbrooke west neighborhood in general. complaints included poor
           original roadway construction, general neglect of those roads, last year's patching followed by
           chip-and-seal treatment (including loose gravel), poor work on drainage repairs and re-seeding, and lack of
           commitment by the village to completely rebuild and/or repave the roadway in the immediate future. mr. krock
           stated that the problems with drainage and seeding were being addressed, and some of the roadway coating
           would be re-done as well. those remedies were met with some skepticism.
           there was further discussion of funding and priorities for more extensive paving work, including the
           possibility of property assessments and bond issues. paving priorities were to be guided by the review of
           the village's roads conducted last year:
boston heights engineer's 2012 cip
           road report 
           the road committee planned to take the public comments under advisement, and continue to work the numbers to
           come up with a comprehensive long-term road maintenance plan, which would most likely include an increased
           road improvement levy on the ballot this november. (4 jun'13)

           â¢ the village council has agreed to an amended and renewed 5-year residential trash-hauling contract with
           kimble (j&j refuse) that bumps the monthly fee up $1 for own-container users, to the same current rate
           for trash bin users ($15.40/mo). the new contract allows future annual increases with the cpi. the new
           contract also appears to mandate use of the large rolling trash bins, and similar recycling bins.
           info letters will be sent out.
           â¢ village engineer dave krock reported that the village had received a $345k grant for the long-awaited e.
           hines hill road rehabilitation project, as well as a $345k long-term loan for the same. he reported that
           negotiations continue on the amount of funding that will be received for that project due to the wear and
           tear from the years of krejci dump remediation trucking. additional grants are being sought for park
           playground improvements, and for various drainage repair projects in the village, including the walters road
           culvert failure.
           â¢ long-serving police sergeant randall robison was commended by the mayor upon the occasion of his
           retirement.

village receives grant to pave village hall parking lot
           the village of boston heights has received a $78,600 grant from the state of ohio that will pay for paving
           part of the village hall parking lot. all costs will be covered by the grant; no village matching funds are
           required. this swif grant is intended to improve storm water handling. to that end, the parking area of the
           lot will be excavated to improve permability and drainage, and will be covered with permable pavers, and
           will receive new curbing and drainage.
           as the grant is also intended to promote improved storm water handling, the village has pledged to hold a
           public meeting on the project, to promote the project via flyers and signage, and to document the project
           with a dedicated page on the village's own (future?) website. the cost of these pr materials is set at
           $300.
           krock-esser engineering (which also acts as the village engineer) will be handling the surveying and
           engineering work at a cost of $6,600.
           the construction itself is budgeted at up to $72,000. the project is expected to be carried out in summer
           2013.

"council members were concerned about putting a trail or bike lanes on hines hill road and then waiting
           years for boston heights to connect its trail to it... boston heights part of the proposed trail is $1.46
           million." (17 apr'13)

update: boston heights council member don polyak responds:
"... this article did not report
           the decision accurately. hudson council did not turn down the (already approved and funded by the [hudson]
           park board) off the street trail as reported. they only turned down the extended 4 foot bike lanes on the
           roadway. they are still planning on building a bike trail (off road) from boston heights line to the ydc
           property. this initial investment from the hudson park board is the first major step in this project that
           will create a connecting trail from the national park, the hike and bike trail, to the new metro park, to
           the ydc property, to downtown hudson and beyond.
           as this is a priority for many of us that believe in supporting safe recreation and our residents requests
           for more bike lanes, please pass this email along as you see fit." -- don polyak, vbh council
           (17 apr'13)

update: hudson council member alex kelemen further responds:
"while the hht headline and
           article were not entirely correct, not all of mr. polyak's statements are themselves correct. hudson city
           council did in fact decide not to go forward with a path from the boston heights corp line to the western
           drive of the ydc property at this time. city council will ultimately vote on the park board's plan at some
           future time as to whether this segment or the proposed multi-purpose path through the ydc property to
           prospect street is approved for construction in 2013." -- alex kelemen, hudson city council

village to contract for zoning inspector services
           at the council finance committee meeting of 18 dec'12, boston heights village council decided to contract
           for zoning inspector services in 2013.
           traditionally the village has employed an individual as a part-time zoning inspector, handling both
           enforcement and planning/zoning administrative functions for about $250/month.
           the village will extend its current contract with krock-esser engineering to encompass these additional
           functions; currently k-e acts as the village engineer and street commissioner. dave krock anticipates that
           routine inspection and reporting will require 2 hours per week, charged at a flat fee of $300/month. more
           extensive enforcement and administrative activity will be charged separately. the appointment and contract
           amendment are expected to be made at the january council meeting. (18 dec'12)

minutes of

           the village engineer explained current and future road and drainage improvement projects. some residents of
           the village's ashbrooke neighborhood suggested that the village increase its road levy property tax, and
           extend it from 5 to 10 years, in order to expand the scope of the town's road maintenance program. (ed.
           note: road maintenance is one of the few purposes for which orc 5705.19 allows a municipal levy longer
           than 5 years, or continuing.) (28 nov'12)




 
          

hht: proposed veterans
           trail connects downtown hudson to surrounding communities
           the connection through boston heights referenced in this article is the hines hill bikeway, aka "heights to
           hudson trail", that was discussed at public meetings in boston heights this past year. the village has been
           considering how this project might fit in with the planned refurbishment of west hines hill road, after the
           krejci dump project is finally completed. this is just one of several trails proposed for boston heights in
           the summit county trail & greenway plan. others are the "gateway trail" to peninsula and the cvnp, and
           the "brandywine creek trail" along the creek to northfield and macedonia. (23 nov'12)

national park confirms: krejci dump cleanup is being completed, not restarted
           boston heights overlook contacted the cuyahoga valley national park to inquire into worries, voiced by
           residents in the wooded view area, that the krejci dump cleanup project was restarting rather than finishing
           up. specifically, there were concerns over trucks apparently moving soils out of the dump sites once
           again.

           from chris davis, plant ecologist for the cuyahoga valley national park (and the current cvnp contact for
           the krejci project):

            "a while ago, a few small spots at krecji were found with slightly elevated levels of contamination and
            those areas were removed. but the site is still clean and meeting all regulatory requirements.
            
             all the recent truck traffic at the site (and there's been a lot) has been trucks hauling/moving clean
             fill between the east and west sites to provide fill to meet grading requirements. no dirt is being
             removed from the site. folks also may have seen trucks leaving the site that had dropped off composted
             soil, which has been placed in wetlands, and rock to repair gullies and cover limestone rip-rap. again,
             all this material is clean and uncontaminated.
             even the dirt they trucked off a few weeks ago wasn't "hazardous"; it just didn't meet the super-high
             standards they have at this site. krecji is probably the least contaminated site in the area now. they
             even had trouble finding composted leaves to add to the wetlands that met standards for the site."

akron-cleveland road bridge replacement: public meeting, wednesday 10 oct'12
           odot and the village of boston heights will hold a public involvement meeting to explain the planned
           replacement of the akron-cleveland road bridge over the metroparks bike & hike trail. this is the
           decaying double-bridge structure just south of route 303. the village is responsible for the maintenance and
           replacement of this bridge, as the road is no longer a state highway. however, federal funding has been
           obtained for the bulk of the project, and the metroparks is making a contribution. nonetheless, the village
           itself is on the hook for a substantial financial investment in this project. the public meeting, which will
           be in open-house format without a specific presentation, will be held from 5-7pm on wednesday, 10 october
           2012, at happy days lodge on route 303 (500 w. streetsboro road). (28 sep'12)

           mayor bill goncy, with the concurrence of council, has appointed betty klingenberg as fiscal officer for the

           office, and as a member of the nordonia hills school board. mr. huber, who had briefly worked as the

           council adopted new regulations on temporary political signs, in effect immmediately (ord.17-2012). a 5-cent
           fee was adopted for scanning pages (as well as printing them) for public records requests (ord.18-2012). the

           consistent with this new position (ord.20-2012). council authorized the mayor to join the village with

krejci dump cleanup winding up again
           the long-running cleanup of the krejci dump toxic waste site, in boston township & northfield township,
           may finally be winding up after seven years. the project, which involved trucking hundreds of tons of
           contaminated soil through boston heights, has had several delays as additional toxic materials were found
           requiring further excavation. final restoration work that had originally been planned for spring 2012 is
           apparently only being started now in fall 2012, and is expected to be completed by year's end. boston
           heights village's plans to repair east hines hill road have been on hold until this truck traffic abates,
           and funds long promised by the park service are paid.

village council agenda for the 8
           august 2012 regular meeting  (7 aug'12)
update: with councilors ron antal and don polyak absent, there were an insufficient number of council
           members present at the meeting to suspend the requirement for three readings of each measure. therefore each
           item on the agenda just received a reading by the mayor, except resolution a which was adopted by council
           upon its third reading. now res.33-2012, this requests the county to remit any already-collected funds it
           holds on the village's behalf, where applicable to the current fiscal year (per orc 321.34). contrary to rumor, this is not a request
           for any loan, nor advance on unpaid taxes (which would be per orc 321.341 and entirely at the county fiscal
           officer's discretion).
           additionally, a number of residents of the wellington court area of the ashbrooke west neighborhood
           addressed council, the mayor, and the village engineer about their dissatisfaction with drainage and road
           maintenance, both historical and that currently under way.

public meeting: political
           sign posting regulations 
           a public meeting was held at 7:30pm wednesday, 8 august 2012 (before the regular council meeting) to present
           a proposed change in village regulations of political signs, as a revision to the zoning code. the intention
           appears to be to bring these regulations into conformance with various court decisions on free speech
           rights, while still reasonably regulating maintenance and safety issues. (8 aug'12)
update: the public meeting was attended by only two citizens (including the bho editor). there were
           no comments offered other than solicitor marshal pitchford's statement (in response to a query by councilor
           ron fenn) that in his opinion the new regulations will be conformant with various court decisions. the
           regulations essentially put no specific timetable on political signs, but would now require them to be
           removed, or replaced and newly registered, every 30 days. also, the maximum sign size per sign would
           be regularized across all districts, at 12 square feet (with no constraint on aggregate size or sign
           count). the new regulations would not change the usual prohibition of private signs, including political
           signs, within the public right-of-way.
           this measure received the second of three readings at the subsequent council meeting. (9 aug'12)

update: council adopted a couple of zoning code corrections, as well as a new zoning map (which does
           not change any zoning, but reflects the post-route 8 upgrade terrain). plans for a fall flea market were

village council agenda for the

update: as only four of the six council members attended the meeting, all ordinances and resolutions
           were held for an additional reading (it takes at least five members to override the standard requirement for
           three readings of each item). however, a special council meeting will be held later in the month to attend
           to the more urgent matters; tentatively set for 6:30pm, tue 26 jun'12.
           before the council meeting was a presentation by the village's insurance broker on options for liability
           insurance coverage for the various independent village associations ( fairview cemetery ass'n, friends of matthews-thomas
           park, boston heights fire department ass'n. it
           appears that these groups will need to obtain event liability coverage, as the village has discovered that
           its blanket liability policy may not cover the activities of such groups.
           following the meeting, village engineer dave krock presented a review of the preliminary engineering for the
           west hines hill road improvements that the village hopes to make in the next year or so.

           (15 feb'12)
update: council noted a second reading of a resolution to approve the mayor's appointment of a fiscal
           officer for the village, but took no further action before adjourning. several council members expressed a
           desire that the mayor interview other candidates, and to that end set another special council meeting for
           monday to authorize advertising the position. note that by ohio (orc 733.262) and village law, the fiscal officer is appointed by the mayor, which
           appointment is approved by council (or not). this differs from selection of, for example, village solicitor,
           who is selected and appointed solely by council (orc

village council agenda for the

update: council bumped up the village's fees for credit card payments, chargebacks and bad checks,
           and endorsed the mayor's appointment of richard huber as assistant to office clerk kathi cole.
           council also engaged attorney marshal pitchford as village solicitor for another two years (as his current appointment ends on 31 january),
           but not without a great deal of discussion. clerk-treasurer carol zeman and mayor goncy cautioned council to
           be aware of the probable need for a much larger legal budget than in recent years, based on mr.
           pitchford's new contract rates and increased work hours. mr. pitchford (and several members of council)
           pointed out that he is currently expending extra hours resolving village legal issues that have been
           languishing for years, and which hopefully may be brought to some final conclusion. councilor ron antal
           suggested re-opening a search for a solicitor in the hope of realizing lower legal cost, but others on
           council felt that last year's extensive search process was sufficient. (a suggestion to have routine matters
           handled by an attorney other than the solicitor is probably impractical under ohio law). (12 jan'12)

public meeting:

           a public meeting was held at 7pm 9 january 2012 at the boston heights village hall. the purpose of the
           meeting was to inform residents about a potential bikeway on hines hill road. in 2001, metro parks
           established a greenway plan for summit county. this plan identified ideal locations for bikeways, and those
           included hines hill road. in november of this year, a matching grant was awarded to conduct a feasibility
           study for bikeway along hines hill road. (from the village's legal notice)
update: mayor bill goncy introduced the various speakers from floyd-browne engineering, summit county
           trailways coalition, and city of hudson parks. the basic proposal being examined is to build a bike trail in
           the existing right-of-way on the north side of w. hines hill road eastward from its current intersection
           with the metroparks bike & hike trail. the trail would cross olde eight road at a flashing-signal
           crosswalk, continue along (or possibly, through) the old boston hills golf course to dean memorial parkway
           at route 8. there the trail would cross hines hill to the south side of the road, cross dean memorial (both
           at pedestrian-signalized crosswalks) and continue on that side of the road eastward to the hudson city line.
           the trail would then cross brandywine creek on a new bridge and continue past the old youth development
           center, across the railroad tracks, and up to prospect street. it would then follow prospect and morse drive
           to hudson's first and main center, downtown. the proposal included drainage improvements for the w. hines
           hill road area nearest wooded view, though this was not expected to resolve the drainage problems within
           those properties. there was some discussion of right-of-way and other issues, all of which was promised to
           be considered as the feasibility study continues. (10 jan'12)

boston heights wins grant for comprehensive plan development
           for the past several years, the village's largely volunteer comprehensive zoning plan committee has been
           working on forming a comprehensive plan for boston heights. residents may recall the survey that was carried
           out by the czpc in 2009, the results of which were presented to council at that time. this fall, the czpc
           applied for an amats connected communities grant in the hopes of receiving professional planning assistance
           in completing the plan. this week, the village was in fact awarded the grant, which will be administered and
           expended by amats on its behalf:

krejci dump cleanup, trucking continues
           in a july 2011 update on the krejci
           dump cleanup project, the cuyahoga valley national park reports that the contractor expects to be moving
           into the final phase of testing and removing contaminated soil. the contractor has been removing additional
           soil since 2009, when lingering contamination was found beyond the original cleanup. it appears that truck
           traffic on hines hill road may continue for a while yet, depending on the results of soil testing in the
           last remediation zones. the best case seems to be a windup of the project in spring 2012, including
           revegetation. (12 jul'11)

history: the krejci dump "superfund" toxic waste cleanup project began in fall 2005 (see cvnp disclosure letter) and was
           intended to run about 3 years. citizen concerns along hines hill road sparked a objections and calls for alternative
           routing. at a public
           meeting in boston heights, the project management explained their precautions, and agreed to several
           restrictions on truck traffic, and to conduct contamination testing along w. hines hill road. this was
           conducted before and after the initial major hauling phase, with no significant
           contamination found.
           after the initial excavation concluded in 2008, residual contamination was detected in some areas of the
           dump site; soil removal recommenced in 2009 and has continued to date.

what's that new turnpike bridge??
           several people have asked us about what seems to be a new bridge going up over the turnpike between olde
           eight road and the bike-and-hike trail bridges. the answer is that it's a new overhead right-of-way for a
           large-diameter gas pipeline that already passes north-south through the village. the line has been under
           refurbishment for the past several years. mayor goncy explains:
"replacement of that transmission pipeline is being done in phases. in this phase, the line is being
           rerouted overhead across the ohio turnpike as per that agreement and all jurisdiction is with the turnpike
           commission in coordination with the third lane widening on the turnpike." (5 jul'11)

council committees recommend levy renewals
           the village council's road committee met on thu, 26 may'11 to consider renewal or replacement of the
           village's longstanding road levy. after a lengthy discussion on the road repair needs of the village, and of
           fiscal issues, the committee voted to recommend a renewal of the existing road levy, at the current term and
           rates. this 5-year levy was last passed in november
           2006 at a replacement rate of 2.75 mills. the current effective (residential) millage is 2.7336
           mills.
           subsequently, the council's safety 2 fire committee discussed the goals and results of the village's
           relatively new fire department operating levy. this was passed in november
           2009, at a rate of 0.75 mill for three years. after some confusion as to whether the levy was actually
           due to expire, the committee voted to recommend a renewal of this levy as well, at the current term and
           rates. (there is a separate and long-standing levy for fire department equipment and maintenance, currently
           at 0.5 mill.)
           village council will later vote whether to put these recommended renewals on the ballot of the november
           general election. (26 may'11)

judge rules: no neorsd stormwater fees for boston heights
           judge pokorny of cuyahoga county granted a summary judgement on 21 april 2011, ruling that boston heights
           and several other summit county communities are not subject to the new stormwater fees proposed by the
           northeast ohio regional sewer district. four summit county communities
           are still embroiled in this case, however.
           the fees had been held in abeyance after summit county and the affected communities filed a lawsuit claiming
           that the neorsd does not have jurisdiction over stormwater remediation in summit county and therefore cannot
           apply the fees here.

council considers change from clerk-treasurer to fiscal officer
           a public meeting was held at the village hall on wed, 16 mar'11 at 7pm to discuss a proposal to convert the
           elected office of clerk-treasurer to an appointed fisal officer. mayor goncy introduced the history of the
           office and the overall concept of the proposed change, and the members of council offered the result of
           their inquiries among other villages in the area. the opinions of the mayors of villages with fiscal
           officers were all in favor of the appointed position, citing a broader base of talent and better
           accountability. (16 mar'11)
           the complete meeting can be heard here:
vbh public meeting re fiscal officer 3/16/2011 

previously: council met in a work session on wed, 3 mar'11 at 7:30pm, and held a related public
           meeting on wed, 16 mar'11 at 7:00, to discuss the concept of a fiscal officer.
           council member ron fenn introduced a proposal to convert the elected office of clerk-treasurer (long held by
           resident carol zeman) to an employed position of fiscal officer. the state of ohio introduced this option
           for villages in 2002, per orc 733.262. the village of
           peninsula made this same change last year.
           this change must be carried out at least 120 days before the next general election for the office, which is
           november 2011, so that it takes effect upon the end of the current term. a fiscal officer is appointed by
           the mayor and confirmed by council, as with most village appointments (but not all). presumably this
           arrangement helps ensure that village fiscal matters are handled by a competent and a properly trained
           manager who is responsible to the mayor and council. it also allows the village to look outside its borders
           for this talent, if necessary. on the other hand, it removes this office from the hands of the voters in
           direct election.

           approved the compensation agreement that pledges the village to pay the hudson schools for all property
           taxes foregone from this project. (9 mar'11)




 
          

hudson schools boe approves abatement, pending compensation agreement
hht: company could bring 140 jobs to
           boston heights (6 mar'11)
ed. note: an interesting discrepency: the schools' treasurer is quoted as estimating a property tax
           loss to the schools of $65,000 whereas the developer (and so, the village) has estimated that loss at,
           initially, $46,000 per year. this point will, presumably, be settled in the formal alternative compensation
           agreement between the village and the hudson schools.
update: at the 9 mar'11 council meeting, councilor don polyak reported that the schools'
           treasurer had been referring to the total school property taxes, not the taxes to be abated as was stated in
           the article. this sort of tax abatement applies to the improvements to the property, not the land itself,
           which continues to be taxed normally.(9 mar'11)

           as an office for a company employing about 150 people. (this is likely to close the driving range, due to
           encroachment on its building and parking.) approval is subject to the review of the village engineer, and
           some minor changes. the developer is, however, also seeking a cra property tax abatement from the village;
           completion of the project is said to hinge on the outcome of that effort. (3 feb'11)

council selects ron fenn for open seat
           at a special council meeting on thursday evening, 8 april 2010, the village council selected long-time
           resident ronald fenn to fill the seat left vacant by the death of ray mcfall. mr. fenn and mr. james mizanin
           both responded to council's call for letters of interest, and this evening each made a short presentation
           and answered a few questions posed by the present members of council. after a private "executive session" to
           discuss the appointment, council selected mr. fenn on a 3-1 vote. (councilor blakeney was required to
           abstain from the process, as she is related to mr. fenn.)
           he was immediately sworn into the office by mayor bill goncy. (8 apr'10)

ray mcfall, councilor & former mayor, dies

 russ pry's remembrance of ray mcfall (2 apr'10)
           raymond mcfall, member of village council and former long-time mayor of boston heights, died in the
           afternoon of friday, 12 march 2010. mr. mcfall succumbed to the ill health that he had been battling since
           shortly after the november '09 election that returned him to council after his many years as mayor.
           recently, the village hall council room had been formally named "mcfall hall" in honor of his long service.
           (12 mar'10)

council solicits applications for mcfall seat vacancy
           the village council is posting this
           notice in several upcoming editions of the hudson hub-times and news leader newspapers, soliciting
           expressions of interest in the council seat left vacant by ray mcfall's recent death. residents'
           applications are requested to be at the village hall by 4pm on monday, 5 april 2009.
           
            council expects to hold additional public work sessions on tuesday, 6 april and thursday, 8 april in order
            to interview prospective candidates. a special council meeting will be held later on the evening of 8 april
            to elect a replacement member to council for the term ending 31 december 2013. this meeting is expected to
            include a non-public executive session as permitted by the ohio sunshine law -- but the final election will
            be made in the public meeting.
           

            qualifications and disqualifications for village council are defined by the ohio revised code orc 731.12. beyond that, current council members may
            elect a candidate based on their own judgement within 30 days of the vacation of the seat, per orc 731.43.
           

            council's posting of notice and solicitation of applications, in this case, is over and above any legal
            requirements. this process was hashed out during work sessions on 17-18 march 2010. (19 mar'10)

regional sewer board imposes new fees in boston heights.
           the northeast ohio regional sewer district voted on 7 jan 2010 to
           impose a new fee for storm water
           remediation projects in its jurisdiction, including parts of summit county -- and including the northern
           part of boston heights. the residential fee is said to "average" $57/yr and would be imposed on all
           properties in the district. commercial property fees would be much higher. fees would rise every year.
           summit county has filed a court case claiming that the neorsd does not have jurisdiction over stormwater
           remediation in summit county and therefore cannot apply the fees here.

village resident sues village over golf course settlement agreement
           on 9 may 2008, mr. edward r. kuchar sr., a resident of boston heights, filed suit against the village. the
           suit complains, broadly stated, that the village agreement to settle the zoning lawsuit over the boston
           heights country club was carried out improperly, therefore could not immediately be carried into effect, and
           was entered into in bad faith in the first place. among other measures, the suit asks that the village be
           enjoined from carrying out the terms of the "agreed judgement entry" settlement, and that any zoning change
           to the property be carried out under the requirements of the normal zoning procedures. (please see the
           summit county clerk of
           courts website for further documentation on this motion regarding civil case cv-2008-05-3633.)

special council meeting re-adopts the bhcc lawsuit settlement agreement
           village council held a special meeting at 9:30pm sunday 11 may 2008 to revisit its acceptance of
           the agreement to settle the zoning lawsuit over the former boston hills country club. mayor goncy,
           clerk-treasurer zeman, and councilors cheung, lightner, foss, hudson and miller all attended. councilor
           slane was absent. all 5 present of the 6 elected council members once again voted to re-accept the lawsuit
           settlement agreement (after fixing a few typos in the enabling resolution). when asked, after adjournment,
           about the reason for re-visiting this matter (adopted also on 11 april), solicitor mike cassetty would only
           say that it was to "clarify" some matters.
           a brief glance suggests that consent
           agreement  remains the same, but the form of the accepting resolution, resolution o-2008, now res 15-2008, had been
           modified to detail the reasons for it being handled as an emergency measure per orc 731.30. it is possible that this is in response to
           the complaint made by a village resident in his motion to intervene  in the case. (please
           see the summit county
           clerk of courts website for further documentation on this motion regarding civil case cv-2007-07-4696.)

mayor reports on lawsuit settlement, sets public meeting
(14 apr'08)

bho news summary: at a special "emergency" meeting held on friday evening, 11 april 2008, boston
           heights village council adopted a resolution to settle the lawsuit filed against the village over the zoning
           of the former boston heights country club golf course.
           in essence, it would allow commercial development of 100 acres of the site (65 acres retail and 35 acres of
           other commercial use) and reserve 60 acres as permanently undeveloped land buffering adjacent properties.
           this buffer would be deeded over to the village upon its request, once construction begins.
           it appears that the timing and nature of the settlement are related to an attempt to lure the proposed
           
           summa northern summit hospital to this site at hines hill and route 8. (13 apr'08)

village contracts with simple
     recycling for clothing and textile recycling

      starting on friday, 18 july 2014, boston heights residents can now recycle clothing, any other textiles, and
      small household goods at the curbside. this includes worn or torn clothing, shoes and textile items. the
      village's contract with simple recycling allows that
      company to pick up its green recycling bags on the same day as regular kimble pickup of household trash and
      container recycling. the company has sent information and collection bags to village residents, and will replace
      bags when collected. additional bags may be obtained by calling 866-835-5068, and may also be available at
      village hall. a list of what should and should not be placed in the simple recycling bags can be found here:

      customers to put trash out only in the 96-gallon wheeled totes. new totes will be supplied to all customers that
      previously used bags or cans, during the first week of june 2013. (all customers will now also pay the
      tote-service price, which is a little more than the old can-service price.) in addition, kimble will supply all
      residences with a new 64-gallon recycling tote that can be put out when full. more types of plastics can now be
      recycled, as well. pickup will continue to be fridays at 7am, except for certain holiday weeks.
