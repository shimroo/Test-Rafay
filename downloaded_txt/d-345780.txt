view auctionwelcome aboard!dealing exclusively in authentic railroad memorabilia since 1987
you are about to embark on an amazing journey exploring the world of antiques and collectibles from the railroad.  since 1987 we have proudly been offering quality railroad memorabilia through catalogued auction and retail sales.  we have literally handled 10’s of thousands of individual pieces from railroads all over the country.  we specialize in advertising, badges, buttons, china, depot, express, keys & locks, lanterns, marker & switch lamps, passes, brochures & timetables, posters, telegraph and so much more.
along the way we hope you will take the time to explore the many advantages of registering for our auctions.  once registered you will be notified when we have auctions posted.  if you are considering selling one piece or an entire collection, we can help with that too.  with decades of experience, i have had the pleasure of handling the movement of railroad treasures across generations. each piece is a wonderful symbol of history and has a story that continually transcends time. whether we purchase outright or if you choose consignment, we are confident you will be happy with the results.
after 30 years in this business, i have been fortunate enough to build a strong reputation for my honesty and integrity and along with that, i proudly have some of the most seasoned collectors dealing strictly with me. many of my clients are quiet, not in the regular circles and do not attend live auctions. so, when they purchase, they rely on my expertise and knowledge to know that what they buy is quality.
now that you’re on board take a moment to read a little about us.  we hope you will sit back, relax and enjoy the ride exploring the over 12,000 archived items we have currently posted on our website.
