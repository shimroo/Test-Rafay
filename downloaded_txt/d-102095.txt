it was the international 
community which supported 
indonesia in its brutal 
invasion and occupation 
of east timor (timor-leste). 
it is the responsibility 
of the international community 
to now call indonesia to 
account.

etan 
is an incredible organization. 
it was an important part of 
our struggle for self-determination, 
struggle for the permanent maritime 
boundary with australia, and 
during the last 19 years, it 
has been part of timorese struggle 
to reconstruct and to rebuild 
its country.  at this critical 
juncture of timor's development, 
it is critical to walk together 
with timorese to achieve our 
dream for better life where 
every citizen has the conditions 
to meet its basic rights, including 
the economic and social rights 
to have a dignified life. -gute 
neves

etan 






the indonesian 
army is not running indonesia any longer, 
but it is still powerful. the architects 
of attempted genocide still walk free. 
timorese people's struggle for fair 
and people-centered development goes 
on. the indonesian army still carries 
out in west papua some of the tactics 
it pioneered in timor-leste. activism 
is still needed, solidarity is still 
needed and it can still make a difference 
to timorese and indonesian struggles. 
no group has made this point more persistently 
than etan, which needs and merits support.  -david 
webster







mkott:


timor-leste 
government should use the celebration 
of 20 years after the referendum to 
call for freedom for bernard collaery 
and âwitness kâ
