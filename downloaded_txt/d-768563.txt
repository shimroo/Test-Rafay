							we're an independent warehouse in atlanta, ga with a wide inventory of new, used, & rebuilt parts for all volvo car models. 
							if you're frustrated with dealers & no-service online stores or aren't sure what you need for a fix and want to talk with someone who actually knows what they're selling, we can help. our four senior sales guys have all been here since the 80s!
                              

we have most any part in stock all of the time for these 1967-2000 volvo models:
140, 164, 240, 260, 740, 760, 780, 850, 940, 
								960, s70, v70, s90, v90

and for the more recent s40, s60, s80, v40, v50, c70, v70, xc70, & xc90, 
							we have many new parts like headlights, turn signals, control arms, 
							filters, ball joints, belts, hoses, struts, brake rotors & pads, wheels, cv axles, & more.
							plus, used parts for pre-05 s40s, s60s, s80s, & v70s.(what if i have an old 120, 544, or p-1800?)
							just call, drop by, or email with your year & model 
							and tell us what parts you're looking for.

besides tons of 
								new parts, we have a quality volvo 
								dismantling facility:
      
used volvos 
								are carefully tested and taken apart. good parts are cleaned, 
								checked, & added to our 
								inventory. all operations are indoors. 
								our used volvo parts selection is a gold mine 
								for both owners doing their own work and repair shops 
								trying to keep their customers happy.
