miske’s criminal case enters its final stage


leave a reply 


what does the case of mike mike, the former owner of kamaaina termite and other honolulu businesses, have in common with that of kenneth lay, the founder and ceo of enron, the texas-based energy company that collapsed in 2001 in what at the time was the largest bankruptcy in u.s. history? 
quite a lot, it seems.
lay was convicted in 2006 on 10 counts of fraud and related offenses tied to the corporate bookkeeping shenanigans that led to the enron collapse, and faced criminal forfeiture of millions worth of his personal assets. but lay died of a heart attack in 2006, a few months before he was scheduled to be sentenced and before a planned appeal had been filed.
michael j. miske, jr., was convicted last july by a federal jury on 13 counts of racketeering, as well as murder, kidnapping and related offenses. the same jury said an estimated $25 million in cash, real property, and other assets should be forfeited to the government because they were obtained, at least on part, with proceeds of miske’s criminal activity. and, like lay, miske died in december 2024, weeks before he was to be sentenced.
both deaths, having occurred prior to sentencing and before their appeals could be pursued, implicated the legal doctrine of abatement ab initio, which requires the criminal charges to be vacated, or cancelled, because the defendants had not been able to exercise their right to appeal.
federal prosecutors agree with miske’s defense counsel that the indictments naming him must be vacated as a matter of law, but that isn’t the end of the matter.

resignation in protest


8 replies 


read the 8-page letter from danielle sassoon, acting u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york, explaining her decision to resign rather than follow orders to drop the corruption charges against ny mayor eric adams. 
she is not alone in her decision to resign in protest.
not since richard nixon’s reign has there been a similar flurry of resignations by those who say the trump administration is improperly and blatantly using the legal system for its own political ends.
page 1 is displayed below, with a link to the full document at the bottom of the page.

trump/musk devastating cuts starting to hit home


13 replies 


the rapid, deep, and sweeping cuts to the federal workforce being carried out by the trump administration are hard to keep up with, and it’s even harder to understand their impacts on all of our lives and our environment.
word of funding and job cuts are slow to be made public.
here are two things i’ve heard in the past 12 hours.
1) a longstanding program in the state judiciary to educate middle-and-high school students about the history, meaning, and importance of the u.s. constitution and their constitutional rights has been unfunded. the curriculum used dates back to the administration of president ronald reagan, and thousands of hawaii students have benefited over the years. although donald trump took an oath to uphold the constitution, his administration is pulling the plug on this and other programs that educate students and the general public about that same constitution. 
2) at least a dozen biologists working to protect hawaii’s endangered species and habitats were fired this week from their jobs with the u.s. fish and wildlife service. the number is likely higher, as the fish and wildlife service works to protect endangered species throughout the pacific area. so although hawaii is considered the endangered species capitol of the world due to its high number of endangered and threatened species relative to the small land area, the trump administration and elon musk have now eliminated the programs and staff working in related programs. these aren’t federal bureaucrats sitting behind desks somewhere. these are biologists working in the field. 
these programs were cut and jobs eliminated without prior review, opportunity for comment,  or consideration of the impacts they will have.
these are just two out of what must be hundreds of programs being unfunded in hawaii and people losing their jobs across the state.
we need to be telling their stories.
please, when you hear of other cuts, please leave a comment here.

attorneys general statement re: the vps comments on judicial review


3 replies 


news release 2025-27 from anne lopez, attorney general, state of hawaii
for immediate release 
february 14, 2025
“if a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. if a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that’s also illegal. judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”
vice president vance, february 9, 2025
honolulu – attorney general anne lopez released the following joint statement signed by 17 state attorneys general regarding vice president vance’s comments on judicial review made on february 9, 2025.
“the vice president’s statement is as wrong as it is reckless.  as chief law enforcement officers representing the people of 17 states, we unequivocally reject the vice president’s attempt to spread this dangerous lie.
“judges do not ‘control’ executive power. judges stop the unlawful and unconstitutional exercise of power. as chief justice marshall said in marbury v. madison over 200 years ago, ours is ‘a government of laws, and not of men,’ and that ‘it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.’  for those who value the original intent of the founders and our legal traditions, nothing is more firmly rooted in our legal history, tradition, and the original intent of the founders than the power of judges to stop the executive from breaking the law.
“americans understand the principle of checks and balances. the judiciary is a check on unlawful action by the executive and legislative branches of government. generals, prosecutors, and all public officials are subject to checks and balances.  no one is above the law.  
“as attorneys general, we will carefully scrutinize each and every action taken by this administration. if the constitution or federal law is violated, we will not hesitate to act.
“that is why we have already filed motions in courts across this country to seek temporary restraining orders and injunctions blocking the unlawful and unconstitutional executive orders and actions, including those to ban birthright citizenship; indiscriminately freeze federal funding; cap vital medical research dollars; and grant unauthorized disclosure of americans’ private records and data.
“judges granted our motions and issued restraining orders to protect the american people, democracy, and the rule of law. that is and has always been their job.  that job is the very core of our legal system. and in this critical moment, we will stand our ground to defend it.”
attorney general lopez was joined in this statement by the attorneys general of arizona, california, connecticut, delaware, illinois, maryland, massachusetts, maine, minnesota, nevada, new jersey, new mexico, oregon, rhode island, vermont and washington.
