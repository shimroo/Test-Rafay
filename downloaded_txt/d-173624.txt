the most surreal thing about the soy bomb incident, though, in retrospect, is how long it lasted. “i was very surprised i got to dance for so long!” portnoy said in a recent interview. “but no one filming the event had any clue that it wasn’t part of the act.”


portnoy, it turns out, was a performance artist, and he considered “soy bomb” a two-word poem. “soy … represents dense nutritional life,” he (sort of) explained, “bomb is, obviously, an explosive destructive force. so, soy bomb is what i think art should be: dense, transformational, explosive life.”

this may not be news to anyone who didn’t, like me, stop paying much attention to culture about 24 years ago, but i was delighted to learn that the soy bomb guy (yes, a direct inspiration for my nom de blog) turned out to be a performance artist who continues to do all sorts of intriguing projects: strangergames.com

in case you or anybody in your life needs this reminder:

first, breathe. meditate. journal. dance. hydrate. get enough rest. if you’re an artist, create.

and i couldn’t help quoting this also, because it’s startlingly insightful, yet obvious — once you see it.

“the left seems chaotic because the right reaches toward the past, and there’s only one past,” barnes said. “but there are infinite possibilities for the future.”

a couple good technical-but-approachable articles that are worth your time. first:

the incentives, economics, and privacy considerations around in-app web browsers is a fascinating and important story

… but this article has almost nothing to do with that. instead, it’s about how passkeys may still be the future of authentication. ricky mondello » magic links have rough edges, but passkeys can smooth them over
and next, if you haven’t heard about how apple was supposedly “caught listening”, you will soon:

one of my weirder hobbies is trying to convince people that the idea that companies are listening to you through your phone’s microphone and serving you targeted ads is a conspiracy theory that isn’t true

like you and everyone you know, i’ve had experiences with perfectly-timed-and-placed ads that, combined with my profound untempered categorical distrust of meta, have nearly convinced me that they’ve got constant access to my phone’s microphone. but not apple, and, after a lot of reflection i’m solidly with simon willison on this whole thing: “they spy on you, but not like that."

a situationist statement designed to destroy the other records around it



the durutti column’s 1980 debut album — confusingly titled the return of the durutti column—originally came packaged in a sandpaper sleeve, a detail that couldn’t have been more at odds with the music inside. the sandpaper was a situationist prank dreamed up in part by factory records boss tony wilson

time was gigantic… when we were kids | pitchfork

under tony wilson’s command, joy division and a certain ratio assembled at alan erasmus' flat in manchester. they were reportedly paid £15 each and given a pile of 4,000 sheets of sandpaper, with ian curtis taking on the bulk of the work while his bandmates watched a porn film in another room. despite curtis’s efforts, factory creative director peter saville was underwhelmed: “to me, it looked like a diy thing that was, really, the antithesis of what i was trying to do. it looked a bit homemade.”

the return of the durutti column – the story behind the sleeve – long live vinyl

the album sleeve is a very rare collector’s items as there were only 2000 made, and there are 3 different variations of spray-paint on the sleeve. … the sleeve design was inspired by a 1959 book called mémoires by guy debord, a marxist theorist, writer and filmmaker.

q. we live in representative democracies where certain liberties are respected. we vote for the policies and the people we want to represent us. and if we don’t get the things we want, it doesn’t give us license to then say, “we’re now engaging in destructive behavior.” right? either we’re against political violence or not. we can’t say we’re for it when it’s something we care about and against it when it’s something we think is wrong.
a. of course we can. why not?

some really intelligent, passionate, good citizens just don’t have the same need for literature and movies anymore. it doesn’t occupy the same space in the brain. i think that’s just how we’ve given over our lives, largely, to this thing that depletes the need for curating and filling ourselves up with meaning from art and fictional worlds. that need has been filled up with — let’s face it — advanced delivery systems for advertising. it’s sad, but what can you do? i also don’t want to go through life thinking our best days are behind us. that’s just not productive. so, in your own area, you just have to persist and do what you can on behalf of the things that you believe in. you have to believe that everything can change and that things can go back to being a little better.

civilization is six billion people trying to make themselves happy by standing on each other’s shoulders and kicking each other’s teeth in. it’s not a pleasant situation, and yet you can stand back and look at this planet and see that we have the money, the power, the medical understanding, the scientific know-how, the love and the community to produce a kind of human paradise, but we are led by the least among us — the least intelligent, the least noble, the least visionary — and we do not fight back against the dehumanizing values that are handed down as control icons.
i don’t really want to get off on this tear because it’s a lecture in itself, but culture is not your friend. culture is for other people’s convenience and the convenience of various institutions, churches, companies, tax collection schemes, what have you. it is not your friend. it insults you, it disempowers you, it uses and abuses you. none of us are well treated by culture, yet we glorify the creative potential of the individual, the rights of the individual. we understand that the felt presence of experience is what is most important, but the culture is a perversion. it fetishizes objects, it creates consumer mania, it preaches endless forms of false happiness and false understanding in the form of squirrelly religions and silly cults. it invites people to diminish themselves and dehumanize themselves by behaving like machines, meme processors of memes passed down from madison avenue and hollywood and what have you.
audience: how do we fight back?
it’s a question worth asking.

until about now, most of the text online was written by humans. but this text has been used to train gpt3(.5) and gpt4, and these have popped up as writing assistants in our editing tools. so more and more of the text will be written by large language models (llms). where does it all lead? what will happen to gpt-{n} once llms contribute most of the language found online?

i was amazed by how little the world looked different over the 12 years. whereas my childhood, if you start in the late ’60s and go to ’80, you have very different looks to the world. clothing, hairstyles, cars look very different. it struck me, [in] my own little anthropological, sociological-whatever study of all this, [that] the 21st century wasn’t changing very rapidly in its look. it was only in technology.

about a boy - as his experimental coming-of-age saga boyhood is re-released, filmmaker richard linklater reflects on the legacy of his childhood opus
i’ve marveled at the same thing: our visual culture (clothing, hairstyles, cars, etc) has been pretty much frozen for more than two decades. whenever i bring it up though i usually get blank stares, pauses, polite shifts to a new topic of conversation. at least linklater understands.
the full interview requires apple news+, sorry. some crumbs available here.

the environment potter creates in her tales shares similarities to that of a plantation – a dangerous world where the fight for food and survival is paramount. despite the backdrop of gentle lake district landscapes and an english cottage garden, her tales are set in a context of merciless repercussions for those who don’t have the wits to avoid capture – including peter rabbit’s father, who we discover has been baked in a pie.

beatrix potter’s famous tales are rooted in stories told by enslaved africans – but she was very quiet about their origins

…you can take the guy’s clothes off so he’s only wearing, like, kind of super underwear type stuff, and he’s barefoot and he and he has a sword, and then he rides a horse like that… and it’s like, you can ride a bear. you can… i just run around picking mushrooms. i pick mushrooms, i make dishes, then i start fires.


sometimes i catch a horse, i ride it.


i watch the sunset from a bridge. i found this one place where you can go and sit up on the top of the hill. and every morning the dragon of that area comes out and flies within, like, one foot of your face. and it’s the most beautiful creature.
