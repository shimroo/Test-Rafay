global women’s strike is an international multiracial grassroots network campaigning for recognition and payment for all caring work for people and planet - a care income. it's co-ordinated by the international wages for housework campaign which was launched by selma james in 1972 >>>































selma james is an antisexist, antiracist campaigner. in 1972 she put forward wages for housework (wfh) as a demand and a political perspective that redefined the working class. the international wfh campaign she founded coordinates the global women’s strike. she coined the word “unwaged,” which incorporates all workers without wages. she co-authored the classic the power of women and the subversion of the community and is the author of sex, race and class and other pathbreaking writing. learn more




















the global women’s strike and women of colour gws, which have campaigned for financial recognition for unwaged caring work for decades, contributed to the green new deal for europe and jointly called on governments everywhere to provide a care income, starting now. as mothers, carers, farmers/farm workers, land and human rights’ defenders, women do most of the work of feeding (starting with breastfeeding) and protecting families and communities, the soil and the environment. learn more




















wages for housework begins with those of us with least power internationally – unwaged workers in the home (mothers, housewives, domestic workers denied pay), and unwaged workers on the land and in the community.
wages for housework is a demand, it is also a perspective, a way of organising from the bottom up, of autonomous sectors working together to end the power relations among us. learn more
