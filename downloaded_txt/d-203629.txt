apartment moving hacks to make your packing easy & stress-free



when moving from apartment to apartment, most people are looking for the best ways to make it a quick and smooth transition. if you are not properly prepared for your move, it can become a nightmare and cause a lot of unnecessary stress. here are a few apartment moving hacks from top apartment movers to make your packing easy and stress-free!
1. locate free boxes
if you are going through the process of hiring a moving company to help you move, chances are you don’t want to spend a fortune on boxes. ask local stores or people in your surrounding area if they are looking to get rid of boxes. if you ask around, you will probably find more than you ever needed and save a chunk of cash in the process!
2. use hangers for clothes
when moving your closet, don’t take everything off of the hanger and fold it nicely. this will take too much time in the packing stage, as well as when it is time to hang it all back up. simply take a roll of plastic wrap and wrap big sections of clothes together. if you zip tie the hangers together, it will also help keep everything together while in transit to your new apartment.
3. keep your drawers intact
many people want to keep the drawers inside their dresser, but never think about the potential damage to other items it could cause while on the moving truck. to prevent this from happening, take off the handles and store them in the drawer, so nothing gets lost – including the hardware needed to reassemble them. you can use the drawers as a place to store other items as well, instead of sending your dresser over empty. cheap movers sacramento (cheapsacramentomovers.com) indicates it’s best to wrap the drawers in place using profressional-grade plastic wrap.
4. organize, organize, organize
keeping your items as organized as possible is a great way to make things easier on the unpacking end. it might be tedious on the packing end of things, but if you color coordinate your items and keep things structured and in order, you will thank yourself later. choose a color for each room and label the boxes accordingly – kitchen = red, bedroom = blue, etc.
5. properly pack plates
this is an alliteration that will save you from having to buy all new dishes upon moving into your new place. if you pack the dishes vertically, as you would a box of records, they are more likely to remain unshattered while in transit.
6. protect breakable items
wrap your mirrors, picture frames, or other breakable items in towels, sheets, or different protective layers. if you have access to bubble wrap, this is an even better option to keep your things safe. when you put breakable items in a box, make sure you label them as fragile, so the people helping you move are aware and don’t throw or drop that box.
when moving to a new apartment, it is easy to get overwhelmed and stressed during the process. taking the time before you move to pack things the right way will save you so much time and energy when it is time to unpack and set up your new apartment.

neighborhood markets and restaurants
if you’re looking for delicious, local food, you’ll find plenty of opportunities in chelsea! food trucks and food carts are plentiful here and are an excellent way to grab authentic food on-the-go. look for rafiqi’s food cart for tasty greek dishes, or el idolo for inexpensive mexican food. and for an open-air market experience, make sure to check out the famous chelsea market, which is an entire block that’s filled with restaurants, bakeries, stores, and other treats for foodies to enjoy. with fresh-baked bread, artisanal cheese, and yummy pastries, you’ll find everything here at the market. you can also indulge in a little retail therapy at one of the many boutiques surrounding the area as well.

relocating to uws? read this before hiring residential movers



west manhattan is a culturally diverse area that’s home to a thriving food and art scene. with gorgeous real estate options, countless fine dining venues, and fun community entertainment, it’s a coveted district to live in within the big apple. however, there are many things to consider when relocating to the historic west side. for tips on what to expect in the area, here are a few insights to keep in mind.
home prices
if you’re looking to buy property in west manhattan, be prepared for steep prices. while average costs here are considerably less than upper west side properties, it’s still a fair amount to pay for nyc housing. in chelsea, the median sale price is around $1,515,000 per home or $1,600 per square foot. and in the clinton and hell’s kitchen district, expect to shell out over 2-million dollars for a standard 2-bedroom space. even as more luxurious doorman apartments are popping up with more rental opportunities, it’s still a high price to live in west manhattan.
moving in
once you do find a place to live, moving into your apartment can be a whole different issue. with tight spaces, tough parking, and strict rules about elevator usage, most west manhattan apartments make the moving process a bit complicated. for that reason, we highly recommend enlisting the help of an experienced professional who can get you moved quickly and deal with all the headaches of moving in new york. and if a big snowstorm like stella strikes or there’s another unforeseen issue, be sure you know what to do about nyc movers canceling last minute.
neighborhood life
the west side has a relatively low crime rate compared to the rest of new york city and is a safe place for raising a young family. the area also boasts several prestigious private schools and has a great education system for young children. and with year-round community events, festivals, and neighborhood gatherings, it’s an ideal spot for meeting other residents and building a network of local friends.
demographic
west manhattan is a trendy location that draws in young families and working class residents that live side-by-side with corporate executives and artists. the region also has a high percentage of lbgtq residents and a diverse cultural population, and you’ll find plenty of progressive thinking and open-minded discussions when mingling with residents.

restaurants
in addition to beautiful buildings and historic monuments, west manhattan-ers have an excellent selection of eateries to enjoy. the hell’s kitchen district has some of the most scrumptious and talked-about restaurants in the city and attracts hundreds of locals and tourists each year. you’ll also find popular city gems such as the spotted pig in greenwich, which offers casual ambiance, delicious food, and the occasional celebrity sighting. and whether it’s fresh seafood at the pier or ripe produce at the chelsea market, you won’t be disappointed with what the west side has to offer.

outdoor activities
although west manhattan is part of nyc’s concrete jungle, there’s plenty to do for the avid outdoorsman. the high line is a favorite spot for manhattan locals and consists of a 1.45-mile long park that’s evaluated above the city streets. with beautiful plant life and paths for running and jogging, it’s a great spot for enjoying a bit of nature within the city. the de witt clinton park between 52nd and 54th streets is also ideal for picnics, ball games, and leisurely strolls among green spaces within the neighborhood. and for those looking to compete in organized sports, the chelsea piers give residents access to game arenas and a field house that include activities such as golf, baseball, gymnastics, and more
