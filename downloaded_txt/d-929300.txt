i recently had the pleasure of indulging in a slice of the chocolate caramel macadamia nut with hazel cream cake, and i must say, it was an absolute delight! from the very first bite to the last, this cake was a mouthwatering experience that left me craving for more.

best cake i’ve ever had. it was a coconut haupia cake, which no one here makes anything with haupia as it is a popular flavor in hawaii. the cake is very dense and moist and the haupia has the best flavor. the cake was absolutely gorgeous, covered in fresh flowers. not an inexpensive cake but definitely worth every dollar. i will be ordering my cakes from now on here.

if you’re thinking of ordering a cake from this company, do it!! you will not regret it. my family and i traveled to san diego for my sister’s elopement. let me just say, this was actually the best cake i have ever tasted. on top of the amazing flavor, the presentation was just absolutely beautiful. i ordered a simple 10 inch all white with white orchids. it was everything. flawless and the bride loved it.

in the past year, kona kakes tropical cake bakery has become one of my favorite bakeries in san diego, ca. my husband and i ordered a mango mousse cake and a couple of miniature strawberry guava cakes for our civil wedding on 09/28/2022 after a word-of-mouth recommendation from a family member. after tasting the cakes, we fell in love with their flavors and knew we had to contract kona kakes again to make our 3-tier cake for our church wedding on 09/30/2023.
