   21 years of award-winning cuisine and incredible service   


cucina rustica means “rustic kitchen” in italian and is inspired by the earthy interpretations of the beautiful mediterranean countries. the old-world charm, from the décor to the cuisine, is captured within the walls of our rustic italian restaurant located in sedona, arizona. chef lisa dahl was the first to bring fine dining to the village of oak creek, where she infused her passion for tuscan and umbrian countryside cuisine, devoting her talents to the love of mediterranean tapas and seafood plates. expect to be delighted by the array of vegetarian and vegan specialties, classic pasta dishes, and perfectly grilled steaks on the menu. in addition to our fine italian fare, enjoy cucina rustica’s extensive wine selection, winner of the wine spectator award of excellence for 13 consecutive years. “the gateway to your imagination awaits you.” ~ chef lisa dahl
