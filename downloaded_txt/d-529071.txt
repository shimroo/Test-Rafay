what people say about us










“a gem of a lodge on stuart island is an ideal base for exploring british columbia's natural wonders.” 
outdoor explorer magazine






“world class hospitality is world class location. it has the whole package: great fishing, fantastic bar and food and best in class staff. the staff work hard to meet your every wish on land and harder on the water to give you the epic big catch experience every day. that can't be learned overnight but instead over 20+ years and two generations – larry and sam deliver.” 
rick dennen, president and ceo, oak street funding, llc






“i have been to nanook lodge over the years and after each trip leave full. i leave with an ice chest full of great catches, full of new experiences, full of relationships renewed and a full belly. the fishing, guides, larry and sam, and the lodge are beyond expectations. i am always happy when i am "in the boat." i look forward to leaving full again this summer.” 
mark p. andrews, president and coo, greystone
