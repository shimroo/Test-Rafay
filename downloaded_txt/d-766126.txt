san francisco indie-rocker nerd megan slankard and her band the wreckage have independently sold over 50,000 copies of six self-released albums. their latest record, “california & other stories,” which was co-produced with nashville producer alex wong, (delta rae, vienna teng, elizabeth & the catapult,) showcases new sides of megan's music, balancing delightfully belligerent rock and roll with cinematic soundscapes of orchestral instruments and robot harmonies. before the pandemic brought everything to a halt, megan performed 100-150 shows a year across the country including, more recently, a 50-show guitar center tour with bose, a bio-coastal songwriter tour with alex wong, and a 30-date, cross-country tour with toad the wet sprocket. her songwriting has received national and international recognition: she was a finalist in 2021 (and 2018) and 2nd place winner in 2020 in the unsigned only competition, a finalist in 2020, 2019, and 2017 in the international songwriting competition, a finalist in 2019 in the international acoustic music awards, and a finalist in 2019 in the usa songwriting competition. megan won first place in 2017 in the unsigned only music competition (aaa category) for a punk song she wrote, recorded, and performed herself in her kitchen, smack dab in the middle of san francisco. (sorry neighbors.) megan's adventures have also included singing duets with pat monahan and train, speaking at a tedx event, performing with darius rucker, lukas nelson, macklemore, ben rector, charles kelley (of lady a) at at&t pebble beach pro-am, co-writing, performing, and producing a song for san francisco's kfog's breast cancer research charity drive (featuring guest singers hozier, florence welch, steve earle, grace potter and more,) playing electric guitar on jimmy kimmel live, singing the national anthem dressed as princess leia at oracle park for the san francisco giants (and six other times, dressed as herself), singing for glen keane's animated short "duet" for google's spotlight stories, touring with dire straits co-founder david knopfler throughout europe, and even participating on two episodes of tlc's reality makeover series, what not to wear (she really had no idea.) megan proudly uses bose professional sound systems, guild acoustic guitars, lr baggs pickups, swart amplifiers, and jh audio iems. she also and drinks copious amounts of tea from her local tea company numi.  web site photos by laura kudritzki.
