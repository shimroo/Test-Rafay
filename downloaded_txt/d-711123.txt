welcome to the koogler group

in-person, live-stream 
virtual, and online self-study programs







the koogler group offers a wide range of educational programs, products, 
and services â prelicensing, certification-level self-study, regulatory 
compliance, ce/cle courses, job skills, and business basics training â delivered 
in a variety of formats including instructor-led, in-person, and virtual 
classroom programs, student-driven on-demand online programs, and textbook-based 
self-study programs.
futurefocus on the title (settlement) industry
expanding upon her 2022-2024 work under the title the domino 
effect: what to do when well-intentioned regulatory initiatives result 
in unintended consequences and potential consumer harm, karen 
koogler, ceo of the koogler group, is redirecting her attention to 
developing a seminal series of educational programs and products focused 
on the past, present, and future of the title (settlement) industry.
as a consumer and small business advocate, karen, has devoted a significant amount of her career championing 
small (micro) businesses in the real estate, mortgage lending, and 
title (settlement) industries. she does so, because she knows that the 
best way to protect consumers is to ensure they have unfettered choice 
when it comes to selecting settlement services providers. and the best 
way to ensure unfettered choice is to ensure that small business 
settlement services providers â especially those working as non-attorney 
title (settlement) agents â maintain a seat at the closing table now and 
in the future.

florida 40-hour title agent prelicensing course: in-person and virtual sessions
the 40-hour course is available as a traditional [in-person] classroom 
program as well as a virtual [live-stream broadcast] classroom program. click on 
the course calendar to register for the course offering of your choice.
please note that the virtual classroom [vc] program is a live-streamed 
instructor-led interactive-learning program. it is not 
an on-demand self-study course.
the vc program is delivered in a ânight schoolâ format and is 
strictly regulated to conform to fldfs requirements. students must 
complete assigned reading [florida study manual for title insurance] prior 
to each session [lesson plans will be provided] and must pass all session 
quizzes [based on the assigned reading] as well as the final course exam, 
and submit all session code phrases. the program is divided into twenty 
(20) 2-hour sessions which run monday and wednesday evenings from 7:00 pm 
to 9:00 pm eastern time. full attendance is required.
registration for each vc program will close 10 days in advance of the 
first session date to provide adequate time for students to complete the 
assigned reading prior to the first session.
do not register for this course unless you are prepared to complete 
all assigned reading, attend all twenty sessions of the program, take and 
pass all session quizzes, submit all session code phrases, and take and 
pass the final course exam. failure to do so will result in expulsion from 
the program.
