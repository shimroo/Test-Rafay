oh no! brett favre to playing again!





critics say, ex-football player, brett favre is something like a piece of gum that spots fans have chewed on for too long and can’t seem to find a place to spit out. it is a brutal description. but it gets worse. 

some people just do not know when to quit
at the critics go on to say, that once fans do find a spot to spit favre out, they find that he’s like the gum that gets stuck on a shoe. talking of not being able to get rid of the guy and sports players, many of them can’t seem to can rid of their habit of driving drunk and needing dui lawyers. 

favre to return?
gil brant who is a former executive of the dallas cowboys said this in a talk with nfl.com. brant has also been a longtime exec of the league. and not very surprisingly, he uttered these words this week. yes, not a few years ago or even, just last year. he supposedly said that favre would be interested in talking to the dallas cowboys in returning. apparently favre is not happy that he is only leading the history of the league in interceptions by so much. he wants to pad onto this lead with another team. 

while football has become the national pastime, americans also love to party and have a good night out on the town. not surprisingly, many end up driving back on their own and needing dui lawyers.  

romo, you better get it done soon
as players get older, they retire and spots open up for new players. although each kind of player has his own advantage. for instance, older players come with more experience. while younger players bring more energy and fire in their stomachs. at least, favre has never needed dui lawyers! he does like to take pictures of himself though.

relief for alex riley as his career is flourishing





a dui case was registered against the current wwe sensation alex riley, who has made his jump to fame on the entertainment sport of late. the star was pulled over and arrested subsequently on the 17th of november 2010. being a wonderful athlete does not make anyone above the law and it seems riley understands this very notion.  

lucky escape 

a lucky break indeed for alex as his dui lawyers rescued him just in the nick of time. it seems he has turned this corner around. riley has just recently managed to go solo in a bid to reach out for greater glory in the business. there is nothing wrong with this. in an age where everyone’s future is uncertain, with a country on the verge of financial collapse, and with politicians out of touch with the regulations and huge taxes they are placing on americans, riley is taking initiative. he is not taking no for an answer. but the young star was in the news last november because of the very incident. this is water under the bridge though since riley has turned on the right switch and his career seems to be moving to higher plateaus. nothing seems to be stopping him as of now.  

on the right path

dui lawyers have time and again rescued celebrities from many a dui charge and it does lead one to think whether there are people who are above the law. that said the decision in this case clearly points out that there was not a sufficient reason for the arrest in the first place although he was driving with a license that was out of date. the subsequent appeal that was made by the dui lawyers following his appeal had mentioned the very thing and this was upheld by the judge. sometimes things turn out right!

rebecca black’s friday taken off the internet





rebecca black is the 13 year old sensation with a nasal voice and a barely average song. her video went viral on song sharing websites for reasons that are largely unknown. this is not the first time this has occurred, many people are still trying to figure out how anyone could enjoy watching a man called pee wee herman. paris hilton is another person who comes to mind here. 

friday off air

black’s friday video had become an overnight sensation that catapulted her to fame and into katy perry’s new video too. if anyone who watched it wondered who the rapper was at the end of the song and what purpose he served, the fact is that he is the producer of the song and owner of ark music based in los angeles.

child actors and teenage sensations like rebecca black have to learn to deal with all the public adulation and attention that comes their way. lindsay lohan is another such child actress who ended up needing dui lawyers to sort out the mess that she was in.

good for her

lindsay has gotten into much trouble over the years as mostly happens to celebrity teens and kids who live highly dysfunctional lives with no work-life balance. dui lawyers needed to be called in after lindsay chose to get behind the wheels of her car while she was drunk and in no condition to drive. she has also gotten into trouble for allegedly stealing a necklace from a jewelry store. she seems to have overcome her troubles and matured since she has been handpicked by john travolta to play in yet another italian mafia movie.

oh well

while lohan had stellar dui lawyers who got her off in no time, she didn’t learn her lesson. black is at an impressionable age and needs to be schooled properly. meanwhile, her video has been taken off websites over copyright issues with ark music.

prison inmate says he robbed 2pac shakur





tupac shakur, better known as 2pac, is almost as much in the news now as he was when he was alive. dying an untimely death, 2pac was mourned by fans all over the world. he was a stellar rapper but with the rise of eminem, 2pac has been replaced 3 times over. 2pac was never equal to ice cube either. 

“i was hired”

years after his murder in 1996 when gunmen shot him in the middle of a bustling street in nevada, prison inmate dexter isaacs has come forward to say that he was hired by the ceo of czar entertainment to rob and murder 2pac. wow, that is an incredible revelation. 

recently pbs issued a news article that stated that 2pac was actually alive and safe in new zealand! this is what pbs is doing with our tax payer money. he was supposedly enjoying his time away from the public eye. this was a false story of course! 2pac’s producer johnny j. also committed suicide after his dui lawyers couldn’t save him from jail. taking your life is never an acceptable solution to any problem.

all johnny j. had to do was hire the right dui lawyers who would have worked hard to keep him out of jail.

a pathetic ending 

like 2pac’s death, johnny j.’s death is also mired with controversy as he allegedly jumped off a tier in the prison facility where he was housed. many wonder whether it was a prison fight gone badly. with the right dui lawyers, he need never have reached that level of desperation at all. 

music and lyrics

news like this has brought 2pac’s name up now and again but his music and lyrics is what keeps him in the minds of some people years after his murder.

keeping up with the kardashians season 6 back!





so for reasons unknown, keeping up with the kardashians is back and this time is season number 6! with plenty of drama that unfolded through the evening, people who do watch the reality show must have been glued to their seats since they had nothing else to do. the middle east is blowing up and this country is falling apart financially, thank goodness show business delivers to us such remarkable shows. 

vitamin kthe three sisters kim, khloe, and kourteney make for plenty of eye candy and there is enough drama here to make a seasoned clown cry! kim has all the reasons to be happy after her engagement to yet another player kris humphries who isn’t getting any respect from sister khloe. khloe has in the past got into plenty of trouble and needed dui lawyers and the support of her family. she has never worked a day in her life so that support is always there. 
a crucial momentshe later went on to say that driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs was the worst mistake she could ever make in her life and that she never wanted to go down that road again. khloe was saved by her dui lawyers who were helped by the fact that there were casualties in her dui accident. much has changed since then!
goofinesskhloe refuses to respect her sister’s choice because of the fact that kim seems to change them a little too often! family dinner and catty comments made the rest of the show mildly entertaining to some people.
be careful about casting stonesdui lawyers and legal issues may be a thing of the past but khloe who has been screaming about family first still needs to learn a few things such as what mother kris pointed out: it is important to practice what you preach!
