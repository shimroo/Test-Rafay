if “la lluvia no viene del cielo,” then who flooded valencia?



alyssa rangel



features


before we look into the evidence the valencianos collected to prove the new meteorological phenomenon was man-orchestrated, or engineered, we should first question if weather modification is real, can it target specific locations, and why it is such a mystery. why, for example, are chemtrails, which are daily occurrences and plentiful in america, britain, germany, france, spain and other nations, so mysterious? what about those less observed instruments such as haarp antennas or those fenced-off factories americans drive by that pour plumes of white cloud into the air around the clock?

hitler’s would-be assassin pastor dietrich bonhoeffer

bonhoeffer also found the catholic church’s “transcendence of race and national identity” especially attractive in contrast to the ethnocentrism which the lutheran church in germany had always exhibited and which it was now experiencing in a particularly virulent form as it welcomed with open arms the emergence of aryan christianity. after attending mass on palm sunday, bonhoeffer wrote that it was ““the first day that something of the reality of catholicism dawned on me, nothing romantic or the like, but rather that i am beginning, i believe, to understand the concept ‘church.’”…

egseth is not only operating according to a theological playbook he doesn’t understand, he is being put into a position where he can impose his distorted understanding of eschatology on america’s foreign policy in the middle east as a time when it could ignite a nuclear war which would affect the entire world. never before in the history of the united states has a philosophy as crazy as christian zionism come in contact with a situation so fraught with danger. does pete hegseth know who will arrive to take up his throne in the temple he is urging the israelis to construct to bring about “the day of the lord”? he is known in scripture as the antichrist…

translate hate: the catholic editionbishop bambera’s zeal for jewish causes suddenly makes sense in light of these revelations. in exchange for his wholehearted support for fighting anti-semitism, bishop bambera gains the support of the jews who control public opinion and an assurance that his secrets, whatever they are, will not be made public. this is the result not only of 60 years of catholic-jewish dialogue, but also of the way in which jewish power has metastasized precisely because of lack of catholic opposition…

education as subversion: john dewey comes to brazil



weber braga



features


somehow, after the industrial confusion that followed the overthrow of the brazilian catholic kings, powerful men and dreamers became certain that the kind of social order brazil needed was very similar to the colonial system we had escaped a hundred years earlier. this perception did not emerge as a product of public debate, as it would have if there had been a democratic regime here; but as a distillation of private discussions. these ideas contradicted the brazilian constitution, but that did not disturb them…

hirschfeld openly critiqued the catholic church for its stance on contraception and fornication, attacked the german penal code that judged “sexual deviances as morally wrong and thus criminal,” and argued that sexual aberrations “such as homosexuality were purely biological, not pathological.” for hirschfeld, “what is natural cannot be immoral.”

two years after he was forbidden from visiting medjugorje by bishop zanic, italian detectives caught bishop hnilica during an investigation of a drug smuggling ring and indicted him for trafficking in stolen goods. by 1992, hnilica was behind another visionary connected with medjugorje who was living in the united states, which visionary he promoted to raise money for “war relief in yugoslavia.” in march 1994, hnilica reappeared at bishop peric’s chancery office in mostar and was immediately publicly exposed for his false claim that the pope had sent him there on a mission to consecrate russia to the immaculate heart mary…

holocaust writers have overlooked the fact that, during the ventilation process, zyklon b would still have retained 92 percent of its hydrocyanic acid content, and would thus continue merrily on its way, releasing hydrocyanic acid gas. at 25 degrees celsius, it would continue to do so for fully 15½ hours, and even longer yet at lower temperatures.... how did they get rid of the remaining zyklon b from the midst of the one hundred corpses, without lengthy ventilation periods, and without causing mass deaths outside the gas chamber?

would the jews of today ever accept this same theodicy from the old testament for why they were one of the victims of world war ii? probably not, for if there is anything the old testament teaches us is that the jews learned little from the theodicy of the old testament, the case of david klinghoffer’s book noted above as a glaring example. the perennial problem with the jew has been his refusal to own up to his own sins and instead blame the gentiles for his misfortunes. the only difference in world war ii is that now the misfortunes are cast upon both jews and gentiles for their mutual sins, with the jews crying the loudest

the catechism defines lust as follows: “lust is disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of sexual pleasure. sexual pleasure is morally disordered when sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes.” the failure to distinguish between lust and legitimate sexual desire often leads people to conclude that every sexual desire is lust or conversely that lust is the same as sexual desire. they are not. ..

the girl’s desire to entertain also constituted unarticulated pleas to win the attention and perhaps approval of her ascetic catholic father, who observed popular arts and amusements with indifference, if not disdain. a georgetown graduate, george moore’s breadth of knowledge and interest in theology, history and literature couldn’t be at more of a remove from the tinseltown enticements preoccupying his young daughter. one of mary’s jewish contemporaries described george as “the most catholic person on the planet. i mean, he could neutralize an entire synagogue just by walking past it...”

how the charge of anti-semitism changed catholic liturgy: part ii



alyssa rangel



reviews


millenialism got its start during the diaspora of the jews when they began to imagine their a messiah would allow them to retake the holy land after they slayed the messiah god sent them. it may have been her experience with van ginneken or her contacts through faulhaber that encouraged sophie to host monthly ecumenical agape celebrations, a “meal of love.” those who could not receive communion during mass were able to participate in the agape meal, which would take place after mass sometimes in the princess’s castle and in her personal chapel and sometimes in faulhaber’s palace...

it was our lord who said to the jews, “i have come in my father’s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive” (john 5:43). in this verse, our lord predicted that the jews will accept a false messiah who will be a man after their own hearts and who will come in his own name. he also gave an example to christians about how they ought to accept and embrace political rule. “learn from me, for i am meek and humble of heart” (mathew 11:29).

thus the jews set out to subvert the narrative known as christianity throughout the history of the holy roman empire and successor states like the austro-hungarian empire. sigmund freud is a good example of the typical jew, who subverts every narrative but his own. no one takes freud seriously anymore because he was exposed as a typical jew when the story of his incestuous relationship with his sister-in-law provided the interpretive key which unlocked his hitherto mysterious oedipus complex, which maintained that “all men” wanted to sleep with their mothers or sisters…

“they sustain the state like an executioner’s rope… fatherland, religion and faith are words void of meaning for those that close within their chest a shield instead of a heart… they have as a profession usury, as a privilege impunity for theft or rather the right to bankruptcy.” here, some will say to us, is the reason for the antipathy to which the jews provoke all, here is the origin of antisemitism, the latent volcano that threatens to erupt in open and general revolt against their auspicious dominion.

week, macbeth is the greatest parable ever written for an apostate people mired in the culture of death. so much so, i am here proposing that as preparation of the catholic flock for good friday, the catholic church should mandate attendance at macbeth as a religious obligation for the beginning of holy week. rooted securely between palm sunday and fig tuesday, macbeth monday would provide indispensable moral medicine. and besides, between the triumphant waving of palm branches on sunday and the cursing of the fig tree on tuesday, a mobile forest on monday would seem eminently suitable…

this anglo-protestant culture has been “central to american identity for three centuries,”[i] and huntington sees no reason why it should not serve as the template for another three centuries, as long as americans “recommit themselves to the anglo-protestant culture, traditions, and values that for three and a half centuries have been embraced by americans of all races, ethnicities, and religions and that have been the source of their liberty, unity, power, prosperity, and moral leadership as a force for good in the world.”
