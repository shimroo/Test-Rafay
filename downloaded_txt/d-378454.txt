american made

the american dream was built by americans, so why not let them build your wire products?  using 100% recycled scrap, mid american steel & wire is doing its part to reclaim and reuse what others have left behind. scrap is melted, purified and refined in our electric arc furnace, then cast and cut into 31' x 6" square billets.  the billets are then hot rolled into wire rod coils. these wire rods are used to produce a multitude of semi-finished and finished wire goods.  all okbrand products are made in the heart of america and with american pride.  we are proud to say okbrand products are 100% american melted and american made.
