				mindful that god "wants everyone to be saved and reach full knowledge of the truth" [1 tim. 2:4], 
			we welcome all who seek the truth to join us in our pilgrim journey on earth and in the eucharistic worshipwhich unites us to our lord jesus and to 
			the faithful generations since the apostles.
