call to action: save our mature and old growth forests!


        the public has a second chance at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to protect our last remaining old-growth forests. on june 21, 2024, the us forest service published a draft environmental impact statement (deis), a study of five alternatives for implementing executive order 14072, issued by president biden on earth day 2022, which directs the usfs and the bureau of land management (blm) to protect old-growth forests. the publication of this deis begins a 90-day public comment period, with comments accepted until september 20, according to their online announcement. this is a historic opportunity to provide meaningful protections to the last of our old-growth forests. more than half a million americans participated in the first round of public comments to produce this deis. in this second opportunity we hope to see half a million new voices calling for genuine protections.
