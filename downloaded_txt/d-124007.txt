nestled in metamora, michigan, the white horse inn is one of the oldest original buildings in the city. making its debut as a general store in 1848, lorenzo hoard bought the building two years later and converted it into an inn, which he renamed the hoard house.the hoard house served as a welcoming rest stop for weary travelers, coming by stagecoach or train, where they could get a good night's sleep and a hearty dinner of boiled mutton, oyster sauce and a draft of beer for 10 cents.  



from 1929 to 2012, the white horse inn remained michigan's oldest restaurant but had become rundown throughout the years. longtime metamora residents linda egeland and victor dzenowagis purchased and rebuilt the white horse inn, reinvigorating the building, architecture and menu for the 21st century.a true historical destination, the white horse inn features a familiar but creative menu, with comfort staples like cowboy mac and cheese and chicken pot pie to more modern dishes like the impossible™ burger and parmesan brussels sprouts.
