    leading to the heart of dance
  celebrating 
excellence
 founded in 1969 by sharon e. dante, the nutmeg ballet started its journey as a small, one-room studio. since then, we have enjoyed five decades of growth; guided by a dedication to the highest quality in dance education, we have developed into an internationally renowned facility, widely respected for its pre-professional classical dance training and performance programs. we’re grateful for the enduring support of our local community, along with the many donors, parents and students who have made our mission a possibility over the last 50 years.
now, under the guidance of artistic director, victoria mazzarelli, we are entering our second half century, striving to uplift and empower the next generation of dance artists and to provide equitable access to a world class ballet instruction.
