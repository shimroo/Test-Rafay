our mission















humans continue to push species into threatened or endangered status by modifying their habitats without assessing the risks of such actions. with extinctions occurring on a worldwide basis at an alarming rate, global biodiversity is compromised and the fabric of life on the planet is loosened.the mission of the institute for wildlife studies is to gather information necessary to maintain biodiversity and viable populations of all species, and enhance our understanding of the animals with which we share our world.
