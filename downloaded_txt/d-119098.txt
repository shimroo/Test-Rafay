our business cardsorder samples





designed and crafted in the uk. shipped worldwide.















metal business cardsour metal business cards are a powerful statement. crafted from rolled stainless steel using cutting-edge photo-etching, automated milling, and autocatalytic plating processes, they seamlessly blend form and function. with intricate metal cutting and surface etching, they exemplify precision and sophistication.















plastic business cardsour plastic business cards are genuinely distinctive, matching the thickness of a standard credit card. each card is meticulously hand-printed, seamlessly marrying contemporary materials with traditional manufacturing techniques. the result is an innovative business card that guarantees you stand out from the crowd.















wood business cardsour 3mm thick wooden business cards come in finnish birch, canadian maple, bamboo, american cherry, and black walnut, each selected for its unique color and characteristics. laser-cut from larger sheets, every card possesses a one-of-a-kind grain. the strata construction ensures strength, eliminating weaknesses and allowing for intricate cut patterns without compromising durability.















carbon fibre cardsour carbon fibre business cards feature genuine twill weave, pantone® spot colour printing, and cnc cutting for intricate designs. cnc technology ensures precision, clean edges, and consistent quality. the durable and lightweight twill weave conveys prestige and sophistication. carbon fibre’s strength and portability make these cards practical and elegant. 















acrylic business cardscrafted from authentic 3mm thick perspex®, our acrylic business cards undergo precision sculpting with a high-power co2 laser. this process not only allows for customizing the card's shape but also intricately cutting away repeating patterns and graphics. following the carving, each card undergoes meticulous hand printing using traditional artisanal techniques.















letterpress cardscrafted with meticulous care, our letterpress business cards are manually printed using traditional artisanal techniques, without automation or compromise. every ink is delicately embedded into the subtly textured surface, enhancing the tactile experience. a distinctive seam of color runs through the center of the triplex card, providing a unique finishing touch. additionally, we now offer the option of spectacular gilded edges for an extra touch of elegance.















paper business cardscrafted from an array of sustainably sourced, high-quality pulps with varied finishes, our paper business cards stand out. hand-printing is available on all our papers using traditional foiling methods. our customization options include vegetable-based pigment spot colors, a selection of metallic foils, uv spot gloss, cmyk litho print, and laser cutting, ensuring a diverse range to suit your unique preferences.

our free design servicerequest your design now





no artwork? no problem.













we provide an entirely free design service to customers who don't already have print-ready artwork. once we have collected a few pieces of information, our design team puts together an initial concept. we then generate a photo-realistic digital mockup using our innovative proofing system. this shows how the card would look once produced. then, using your feedback, we make revisions until you are 100% happy with the layout. 



completely bespokeno two people or businesses are alike. we've created artwork for tens of thousands of customers and never come across two organisations whose requirements are identical. we don’t believe in templates. instead, we firmly believe that the development of the artwork should be a collaborative, creative process that is given the time and attention it deserves. it’s the only way to make sure that the business card is as unique as the person handing it out.



innovative proofscustomers need an understanding of how the final product will look and feel before placing an order. yet the cost of tooling makes it impractical to manufacture single specimens. we’ve solved this dilemma using a digital proofing system. we provide images showing how the card will look once produced. coupled with our ability to provide samples of previously manufactured cards, the customer can accurately assess the design and quality of their card before placing their order. 



multiple revisionswe are not naïve enough to think that the first design we send you will be a winner. there will be elements you like and some you don’t. every customer has different tastes and priorities. so we don’t place an arbitrary limit on the number of revisions we’re prepared to undertake. instead, we work with you, using your feedback to patiently revise and alter the artwork, moving the project forward until you are 100% happy with the way it looks.
