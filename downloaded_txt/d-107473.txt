2023 season​for your convenience we have more than doubled our kayak inventory as well as our # of electric/water campsites. because of this there is no longer a need for canoe, kayak, or camping reservations. saturdays are our "busy days" during the peak season, so we still highly recommend arriving in time to have your kayaks rented by 10am on those days (we do still run out of kayaks on rare occasion). we can easily accommodate your needs any day/time otherwise. we love what we do & look forward to each & every fun filled season with you guys.




if you're thinking of camping, canoeing, or kayaking as part of your summer activities, crazy horse will give you the excellent service you deserve. the scenic buffalo river with its breathtaking natural beauty is a wonderful experience for people of all ages. family owned & operated for over 30 years, we have the experience you can rely on.
















 








 












 



​air boat expertise is one of the most important & unique things we offer to help ease your mind. crazy horse is the only outfitter in the area that offers this assistance if needed.​
