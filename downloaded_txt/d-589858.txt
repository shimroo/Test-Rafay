technical stuff: this website is dial-up friendly! we have optimized all graphics and have tested this site on slow dial-up connections to be sure the site and images load fairly quickly. depending on your connection, your speed might vary. if we could afford high speed access we would, but in the meantime, we want to be sure that none of our friends out there, nor us, have to suffer the pain of excruciatingly slow load times. furthermore, we promise this site will never contain slow loading, browser crashing, flashing, blinking, annoying animated gifs (though we cannot be responsible for bravenet content which is designed and hosted by a third party). this site was designed to view best in netscape 7.02 or mozilla (same thing, basically). finally, we promise that at no time during your visit will you be frightened out of your wits by the sudden intrusion of an imbedded sound file. it is safe to leave the volume up!
