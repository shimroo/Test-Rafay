frequently asked questions




                                    what do i need to rent a car in ireland?
                                



you will need your licence and payment card for booking your rental online and for signing the rental agreement at the pick up desk. 
we cannot accept any temporary licences, certificates or letters stating the driver has a licence if it is not present on collection. all drivers must have their physical licence present on arrival for a vehicle to be released. 


 



                                    what are your age requirements to rent a car in ireland?
                                



at the commencement of rental, drivers must meet the requirement for licence eligibility. if the number of years is 8, this does not mean that the driver must have held their licence for 8 years - it means they must have been eligible to hold their licence for 8 years.


 



                                    can i rent a car for someone else in ireland?
                                



at the time of pick up, the person renting the car must be present to sign the rental agreement and provide their debit or credit card.
additional drivers must be present at time of pick up and must fulfil the same age/licence criteria as the principal driver.


 



                                    how do i make an amendment to my reservation?
                                



bookings made through irishcarrentals.com can be amended on manage bookings. free changes 4h before pick up.


 



                                    can i rent a vehicle for my business in ireland?
                                



yes. at irish car rentals, we have one of the biggest and most modern fleets in ireland for business.
you can choose from passenger vehicles, commercial or speciality vehicles – all of which can be customised internally or externally if required and delivered to you anywhere in ireland.


 



                                   are you an irish car rental company?
                                



yes. irish car rentals is not a third party or broker site. we deal directly with customers and offer flexibility in their bookings.
you will be able to amend or cancel your bookings yourself on the website.
