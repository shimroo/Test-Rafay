an elementary lesson on the history of christian rock 

music has, practically since the faith’s beginning, been a vital aspect of christian ritual. from the somber tones of an coptic chant with minimal accompaniment beyond the voices of the singers to the haunting melodies of gregorian chants backed by bells to lively gospel music performed every sunday in black churches across the united states with pipe organs, song has for some centuries been a means of expressing to devotion to all religions, and christianity is no exception. still, faith and music alike have evolved since biblical times. arguably, in the western world, rock and roll is the major form of modern music, though like all forms of music, it continues to change and grow with the times.
christian rock, a sub genre of rock and roll keyed to christian themes, is relatively small but does have a devoted following. its history is begins with rock and roll itself. initially, rock and roll was an outgrowth of country and gospel music, with black musicians taking elements of both, such as the instrumentation of country and the lively energy of fervent gospel and combining the two into something new and unique. when white people discovered rock and roll, it was with the emergence of elvis presley. presley attracted a good a bit of controversy from conservative christian critics who contended that music was dangerous, though presley himself was a dedicated christian who was as good at gospel music as he was rock and roll; in fact, his second of three grammy awards was for “he touched me”, a gospel album.
christian rock as a phenomenon begins largely with larry norman, who believed that rock and roll was not inherently anti-christian and set out to prove it with “upon this rock”, then described as “jesus rock”. his attitude towards rock music was summarized with “why should the devil have all the good music?” and his song “i wish we’d all been ready” included lyrical themes and imagery drawn from the book of revelations and its description of the rapture. norman also produced the music of other christian rock artists, notably randy stonehill and his album “born twice”.
for some years, through out the 1970s and 1980s, christian rock was seen as a small part of the growing contemporary christian music and contemporary gospel music genres, though some artists did have crossover success, notably phil keaggy. petra and resurrection band, two bands who brought a harder sound into the genre, reached a height of popularity in the late 1980s.
the 1990s were a heady time for christian rock music, as the genre experienced a surge of popularity. bands like jars of clay and audio adrenaline achieved large scale success, as did some of the later albums of dc talk that had christian themes. outside the english speaking world, other bands such as oficina g3 and the kry enjoyed moderate success. mainstream exposure of the genre began primarily with acts such as skillet, decyfer down, thousand foot krutch, disciple, underoath and others. the genre is also experiencing a surge of popularity in russia, where eastern orthodox christians are experimenting with the sound of rock and roll in a country that once rejected it.

how to get a man to worship and adore you: 9 effective tips 

do you feel like your man has stopped worshipping and adoring you? if so, don’t worry – you’re not alone. many women feel this way in their relationships. it can be tough to get a man to open up emotionally and be honest with you. however, there are things that you can do to change that. in this blog post, we will discuss some tips for getting him to worship and adore you once again!
here are the top 10 tested and proven tips to make a man worship you:
be yourself & let him see the real you
be honest with him and don’t try to hide anything. i know this may sound scary but you really need to be open with him and let him into your life if you want things to work out long-term. let him see all of you, the good and the bad.
also, this is very important – don’t be afraid to be vulnerable with him. show him your weaknesses and let him in. he needs to see the real you if he’s going to worship.
create an atmosphere of trust with your man
one of the best ways to get your man to worship and adore you is to create an atmosphere of trust. when he feels like he can trust you, he will be more likely to confide in you and share his feelings with you. you can create this atmosphere by being open and honest with him yourself. share your own feelings and thoughts with him, and encourage him to do the same.
be confident & show him you’re comfortable in your own skin
one way to do this is by initiating physical contact. make the first move and initiate intimacy when you’re both in the mood. this will let him know that you’re comfortable with your body and that you want him too.
another way to show confidence is through communication. be open and honest about your wants and needs. tell him what you like and what you don’t. this will let him know that you’re comfortable communicating your needs and that you trust him to fulfill them.
lastly, be comfortable in your own skin. showing off your body, whether it’s in lingerie or a bikini, will let him know that you’re comfortable with who you are and that you’re comfortable being sexual with him. this will turn him on and make him want to worship and adore you even more.
be independent & don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself
while men do enjoy playing the hero role at times, they also want a woman who knows how to take care of herself. he doesn’t want a woman who is always asking for his help or approval. let him know that you are your own person and that you don’t need him to take care of you. this will show him that you are strong and confident, and he will respect you for it.
you can also work on being more assertive. this doesn’t mean that you have to be bossy or always right, but it does mean that you should express your opinions and stand up for yourself when necessary. men respect women who are able to stand up for themselves and their beliefs and are not going to put up with any bs.
show him that you’re interested in him & care about him
make an effort to get to know him better. show genuine interest in his life and what he has to say. compliment him sincerely when you see something you appreciate about him. be there for him when he needs someone to talk to. let him know that you’re always happy to listen and offer support.
tell him how much you care about him and express your affection in words and actions. plan thoughtful gestures that will make him feel special and loved. do everything you can to make sure he knows how much he means to you.
take care of his needs!
another way to get your man to worship and adore you is to make sure that you are still meeting his needs. often, when a man feels like his needs are not being met, he will withdraw emotionally. make sure that you are still physically and emotionally available to him. show him affection, and let him know that you still want him.
don’t forget to keep the spark alive in your relationship! often, when the spark goes out, a man will lose interest. you can keep the spark alive by doing things that you both enjoy together, trying new things, and keeping the communication open between you both inside and outside of the bedroom. if you follow these tips, you’ll be sure to get your man worshipping and adoring you in no time!
be patient & don’t push him too hard
he will come around when he’s ready. just enjoy the time you have together and don’t force anything. relax and let things happen naturally. if you try to push him too hard, it will only push him away. so just be patient and enjoy the ride. who knows where it might lead?
if you’re looking for a real long-term commitment, then you might have to be even more patient. men typically take longer to commit to a relationship than women do. so if you’re getting antsy, try to relax and give him some time. he’ll come around when he’s ready. just enjoy the time you have together and don’t force anything. relax and let things happen naturally.
enjoy your time together & don’t take things too seriously
focus on enjoying the moment and each other’s company. let things flow, and see where they lead. the most important thing is to have fun! by doing so, you’re more likely to create a deep connection with the man you’re dating.
remember, relationships are meant to be enjoyable! so relax and let yourself go. if you take things too seriously, it’ll only push him away. instead, focus on the present moment and creating lasting memories. that’s what truly matters in the end.
live your life & let him be a part of it
don’t change your plans or interests just to please him, and don’t expect him to do the same for you. if he’s a good guy, he’ll be happy to join in on things that make you happy, and vice versa. keep up with your hobbies and friendships, and encourage him to do the same. a relationship should add to your life, not be your entire life.
of course, there will be times when you have to put your relationship first, but in general, it’s important to maintain a healthy balance. if you find that you’re always the one making sacrifices or bending over backwards to accommodate your partner, something is off-kilter and needs to be addressed.
it’s also important to keep some things to yourself and not share every single detail of your life with your partner. it’s perfectly fine—and even healthy—to have a few things that are just for you, that don’t involve him. this could be anything from a hobby to a group of friends that you don’t include him in.
having your own life outside of your relationship is not only important for you, but it’s also attractive to him. men are attracted to women who are confident and independent, and having your own life helps you exude those qualities. so go ahead and live your life—he’ll be happy to be a part of it.
the road ahead…
i hope you liked these tips, as you can probably tell just by reading them they are all super affective, especially when applied synergistically.
just remember, the most important thing is to always love yourself first and foremost. if you can do that, then he will too. thanks for reading and i hope this helps!

tips for meeting christian singles 

as an unmarried christian it is natural to seek out guidance on the best places to meet other christian singles. it can be overwhelming to think about all of the many opportunities that are out there for meeting people that you might connect with. hopefully these simple tips can make it a little bit easier for you to find the right person.
trusted & tested: 3 step for meeting christian singles near you
the first step – the first thing you want to do is make sure you are ready to date. make sure you are in an emotional place to be there for someone else. if you are not, you could end up breaking someone’s heart and that wouldn’t be a good thing at all. it is normal to want company and support when you are in a bad place emotionally, but it is best to seek out this kind of support from family and friends, rather than seeking it in a romantic relationship.
step 2 – the next thing you want to do is find a good church group to join with other singles. if you are in college you can find a college group. if you are older than that look around and see if you can find a church with a singles group in your local area.
if you can join one of these you can meet people who are also single and might be looking for someone to connect with. it might take you some time to find someone but this is your best bet. it is also good if the group is always adding new people to it. this is a reason why it is important to do some research. try to ask around and see what you can find out about the best christian singles groups near you.
remember, even if you only make friends in the group, one of those friends could lead you to the person you will want to date. you will always be meeting new people and that is the best way to find someone to have a relationship with.
by meeting people through a church group, you know that they will share the same faith as you. obviously this is something that is very important and you have a far better chance of meeting another christians in these types of groups rather than is other kinds of groups for singles.
step 3 – the last step you should know about is to pray about everyone you meet that might be a potential date. that way, you will know if they are the right person for you or you should move on. it is hard to find a good person to date but praying through it will help with that.
when you have made the decision to look for someone to date, you should try to do it right. you want to be the right person for someone else to fall for. work on yourself and put yourself in a good place so that you can meet new people and eventually meet the person you should be with.

is cohabitation before marriage ever acceptable for christians? 

when it comes to christianity, there’s a lot of argument about what is and is not appropriate. when one thinks about it, it makes a lot of sense. even if the bible is the inspired word of god and not just the words of men trying to understand god and the world around them, it was still written by men. and humans are notorious for presuming they’re right, and not actually listening when they’re wrong. it’s no different when the speaker is god himself!
because of that, there’s a lot of argument in some of the social situations. one such argument is cohabitation and premarital sex. to some, the bible is 100% against premarital sex, and absolutely against cohabitation. to others, that’s an old fashioned idea that was used to keep people in line or to ensure the purity of bloodlines and judgement of heirs. so what’s the real truth?
is it okay for christians to cohabitate before marriage?
first, we have to understand that the bible, even if it is the inspired word of god himself, is still a book written thousands of years ago. what’s more, it’s not even one book, but two. the old testament is a book of history and laws for the hebrew tribe as they survived in the ancient world. the new testament is a book of spiritual understanding and encouragement to a sect of the hebrew tribe within the roman empire.
this means that even within the bible itself, there is recognition that times and situations change. a good example of this is the kosher dietary laws, which were abolished in the book of acts when god said “let nothing i have created be called unclean”. some people take this to be specific to the dietary laws, while others take this to mean everything under god’s creation. after all, god said let “nothing” he has created be called unclean, right?
this is all to say that the answer to “is it ever acceptable for christians to do something” is “it’s complicated”. in the case of cohabitation, you need to search your soul, pray, and talk to your priest or pastor. if you are personally having doubts, then it may be better to not cohabitate. however, if you feel secure in your faith, if you feel that god is not concerned with this kind of thing, or that your relationship is as faithful and holy as marriage even without the legal bindings, then is it appropriate?
i say no. but it is definitely an interesting topic to debate!
