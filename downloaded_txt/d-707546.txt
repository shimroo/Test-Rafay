"dedicated
        to the restoration of american chestnuts"
the
      american chestnut cooperators' foundation is a nonprofit scientific and
      educational  foundation dedicated to restoring the american chestnut
      tree to its former place in our eastern hardwood forests. priorities
      include the development of blight-resistant all-american chestnuts and
      economical biological control measures against chestnut blight in the
      forest environment. 

in the first 40
      years of the 20th century, blight destroyed 3.5 billion american chestnut
      trees. what had been the most important tree in our eastern forest was
      reduced to insignificance. no comparable devastation of a species exists
      in recorded history.
thank you for
      stopping by! 

"it is not beyond the grasp of
      science to restore the american chestnut to economic importance. it could
      be accomplished within the next 50 years."--
      prof. gary griffin, virginia tech 1997
