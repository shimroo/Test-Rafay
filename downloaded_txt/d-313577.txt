			what they are saying...
		

			"enrolling our son in mma has been one of the best investments we have made.  
			the positive transformation started with his participation in the summer camp, 
			which motivated him to stay there for high school. throughout these years we have 
			seen how he has become an independent young man, able to manage his time through multiple 
			activities, maintain a high gpa, participate in sports, clubs and community service, all 
			while developing the leadership skills that will open for him a world of 
			opportunities for his future.  thank you to all the mma staff for their contributions to our son's formation."
			-cinthia castedo, mma parent

			everyone deserves an environment where they are mentored, valued, and can succeed
		

we know that you want your son to excel academically, emotionally, and socially. to do that, you need to provide your son with a challenging environment that offers individual attention that will develop his full potential. 
the problem is his current school has not given him the focus or opportunities he needs to grow academically or as a person which makes you feel worried and concerned for his future.
we believe that all young men deserve an environment where they are inspired to meet their potential.
we understand the frustration of being just another face in a classroom which is why since 1965 we have focused on small class sizes and challenging each of our young men to excel.
