professional learning communities are an invaluable experience to grow professionally and build a sense of community with colleagues. you form a group, identify a topic, coordinate dates and times. if you’d like mespa to apply for ceus for you, the group has to meet for a total of 6 hours throughout the course of the year (for example, 4 times for 1.5 hours each). then, send christine a brief outline of what you plan to learn and talk about. when your 6 hours are done, send christine an attendance sheet. this is a great way to earn 6 ceus while learning about what you care about and building a community of support.
