here is my article for http://www.artsmediamag.comi intend to include this information in a book i'mwriting on the boston scene - pitching to my editorsat amg first.70's rockers release new albumsby joe viglionethe old guard of the 1970s boston music scene appearsto be having a harmonic convergence of sorts, with anamazing array of new discs finding simultaneousrelease by the end of 2005. sure, there have beensightings that a resurgence was about to take place,the varmints - frank rowe of the classic ruins andbilly borgioli of the real kids - releasing theirmusic in 2002, robin lane & the chartbusters puttingtheir reunion on record with "peace of mind" in 2003,and the group "new england" reforming for a live showin 2005, with an appearance on hirsh gardner's 2003disc, wasteland for broken hearts, released on marqueein japan (as well as all their discs including a newalbum of out-takes finding new life on the gb musiclabel).yes, there have been sightings, but never before havewehad pretty much an onslaught of name local bandsputting their art out to the world again - all atonce. back in the day it was home-made vinyl 45s ande.p.s, but as the new millennium is well underway, andwith recording techniques far more accomodating, thecd and digital downloads have replaced those smaller,charming formats.the verdict on this music by these veterans? theproduction values and song selection - across theboard - proves that these artists are not only gettingbetter, they are aging like fine wine. if only thesediscs were released in their heyday!so here's a nice year end wrap-up and look to thefuture.willie loco alexander & the boom boom band13 tracks of very powerful music from this importantboston institution. co-produced by david minehan ofthe neighborhoods and the boom boom band, it issonically superior to the two mca releases from 1978and 1979 and proves what a creative and essentialgroup this was and still is. man, if they hadreleased an album every year since 1979 - thepossibilities are endless and their stardom would havebeen assured. "ogalala", "aaww", "telephone sex"and "who killed deanna" have been recorded by williein the past, but this is his most revered ensembleputting their stamp on the material. grade a+jon butcher's barefoot servants 2get it? a line from the jimi hendrix hit written bybob dylan, "all along the watch tower" - "...princeskept theview/ while all the women came and went, barefootservants,too." the band features veteran boston rocker jonbutcher who has done so much soundtrack work - fromstar trek the next generation to hbo's "deadwood" andshowtime's "hendrix" film. as with willie loco, thismusic is sonically superior to his two releases onpolydor from 1983 and 1984 (though jon was in the 70sgroup johanna wilde, which puts him in this club of70s rockers).barefoot servants features ben schultz, neal wilkinsonand legendary bassist leland sklar. the music runsfrom acoustic to clever pop/rock with driving guitars.real craftsmanship and - again - if only thismaterial had the power of uni music behind it thistime around... "love you too much" is a harp-ladensequel to the fine young cannibals "she drives mecrazy", a powerful pop, as is "when the day comes".grade a.fox passthrough the years jon macey has evolved, releasing twoalbums on mercury with tom dickie & the desires in1981 and 1982, putting a push behind macey's parade inthe 1990s, returning thirty years later with the albumdebut of a band who had released a single in 1976 - "ibelieved" and "prized possession". unlike willieloco, the band opted to go with all new material(saving the old classics for an upcoming live album),but like the boom boom band, this group is superbonstage. produced by barry marshall (with lavernbaker and the dick tracy and shag soundtracks to hiscredit), mike roy, john jules and jon macey's powerpop has never sounded better on record. veteran stevegilligan (who appeared on stompers' boardwalk album)replaces david godbey on bass. 13 tracks of theirbyrds meets r.e.m. style - just keep in mind - thisband was opening for roxy music at the orpheum yearsbefore r.e.m. released their first single.excellent. grade aduke & the drivers "harder than before"with a release date of february 21, 2006, arts mediamag got an advanced copy of "harder than before" fromthe group that released two albums in the mid-1970s onabc - the first of which included the minor hit "whatyou got". here the band has refined its formerly edgyr & b sound delivering solid gospel as on "angel",mesmerizing dance-rock with the first expanded single,"funk all over the place", even calypso/ska on"loco-loco" (probably not written for willie "loco"alexander, but a cute coincidence). this album isstunning. grade a+sal baglio of the stompers as "rock e rollins"rock e. rollins' second release is the completeopposite of what you'd find on a stompers album -though it would be interesting if baglio's veteranband included this excellent triple a space-age pop intheir modern electric blues shows. sal is a highlycreative songwriter with a great voice and it is nocoincidence that, like all of the aforementioneddiscs, this is among his finest work. "lost marblesrevolving head" is the yardbirds meets the electricprunes. british rock and psychedelia are exploredthroughout the disc. "45" rips the clash as surely asjon butcher took liberally from the fine youngcannibals, but it veers off into a total popdirection. again, if only if only this had come outon boardwalk when the stompers had their chance at thebrass ring. grade a - and a real find!mach bell of thundertrain with mach 5though his thundertrain released "hell tonite", a livewcoz broadcast from 1979, on gulcher records in 2004,the last lead singer for the joe perry project hasnever sounded more raw and vital. he too has gonethrough mutations, from the mag iv in the 1980s tolast man standing in the 1990s, mach 5 continues thethundertrain mantra of "i gotta rock" on opening track"get it up", a tune mick jagger could utilize (asdavid lee roth copped mach's riffs on "hot forteacher" in 1984 - years after mach had a single bythe same name. there's a credible cover of alicecooper's "under my wheels" and the heavy pop of"kandyland", "quincy girls", ten tracks in all. it'squintessential mach bell. grade a.rtz - brad delp, barry goudreau, brian maes, timarchibald, david stefanellifirst a little history - delp and goudreau are, ofcourse, from the 70s band boston, david stefanelli andbrian maes performing and recording in the 80s withrobert ellis orrall, maes later playing onstage withthe band boston's spinoff group, orion the hunter,opening for aerosmith prior to the formation of rtz.bassist tim archibald performed with new man on theirepic debut in the mid-1980s and, with maes andstefanelli, an integral part of the brian maes group.as rtz they hit the top 30 in february of 1992 with"until your love comes back around". in 1999/2000 ajapanese label, avalon, released "lost in america",which brian maes has re-released in 2005 on his ownbriola records. they've also issued 11 more tracks ona second cd entitled "found in america". the stuff isbrilliant! though demos produced and engineered bybarry goudreau in his home studio, they have more thancharm - there's more power and excitement in the demosthat sought - and found - the deal than the workreleased on irving azoff's giant records in 1991,which led to the hit. the millions of fans of theband boston need to own these discs - and at the riskof sounding redundant - boy, if only rtz like the boomboom band, the stompers, fox pass, jon butcher axisand mach bell's thundertrain had only had theopportunity to release a dozen or so albums - therewould have been hits galore. all the tracks are firstrate, "someday" a potential pop classic. by the way,4/5ths of rtz - everyone but barry goudreau - appearedon peter wolf's 1996 reprise disc "long line".stonecrazy with danny kleindanny klein of the j. geils band put togetherstonecrazy (a term taken from the legendary buddy guy)prior to the j geils reunion tour. it's been anextremely slow process, original drummer steve shaheencutting the initial tracks with the group, which alsofeatures babe pino and his brother ken pino (of johnnycopeland fame). this writer got a phone call fromduke and the drivers drummer mark highlander who wasin search of a band. a rock journalist, of course,thinks about "dream bands", so the rhythm section of jgeils and duke & the drivers made perfect sense. addproduction by jay geils himself and keyboards by sethjustman and you have the closest thing to a new jgeils band disc on record that you'll have to a geilsreunion on record till that band finally records.itmb with mick spiros & norman bloommickey spiros worked with the legendary adrian barber(producer of the velvet underground's last studioalbum and aerosmith's first, along with engineeringcream) and norman bloom has been a fixture on theboston scene perhaps longer than anyone as bookingagent and multi-purpose drummer. modeled after leemichaels and frosty, itmb - the incredible two manband - is a boston institution. listen to "martha" issee if you think aerosmith's "dream on" might have hadits beginnings elsewhere! adrian barber, after all,produced both acts. it's a great little live discavailable only on the itmb websitehttp://www.itmb.org/and there you have it - ten new albums by veterans ofthe boston scene - artists who still have something tosay - and know how to articulate it on record. allten discs are a truly inspirational listeningexperience and a statement on the purity - andsurvivability - of the original boston music scene.joe viglione is a rock critic for allmusic.com andproducer/host of visual radio, a ten year oldtelevision program which interviews recording artists,authors and other personalities. he too is a 70'srocker who has released a compilation "lifeswork: 2005and counting" available on emusic.com. discoveriesmagazine contributor joseph tortelli has said aboutlifeswork: "this compilation certifies the count'sreputation as a songwriter who composes pop/rock tunesthat are both catchy and enduring."joe viglionep.o. box 2392woburn, ma 01888mobile 617 899 5926images:barefoot servants 2 with jon butcherhttp://www.atomrecords.com/images/coverservants2.giffox pass by fox passhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:2bkmu3udan4kwillie loco alexander dog bar yacht clubhttp://www.williealexander.com/images/cd/dbyccover85.jpghttp://www.williealexander.com/htm/music.htmlrock e rollins / sal bagliohttp://www.rockerollins.com/super_heterodyne.htmduke & the drivers harder than beforehttp://www.dukeandthedrivers.com/getdown.htmlrtz lost & foundhttp://www.rock-is-life.com/reviews/img/rtz.jpgitmbhttp://www.coppolaconsulting.com/itmb/images/itmbnycpic.jpgmach bell's mag vhttp://cdbaby.com/cd/mach5stonecrazyhttp://www.wildcatblues.com/black-rose-25-anniversary-party_files/image002.jpglinks:long line peter wolfhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef5cfddc6c3d349d8edb&sql=10:fq4zefek8gfnreturn to zerohttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef54f6d861373c8ffec61d&sql=10:86jueai04x87robert ellis orralstompers live scrapbookhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef5cfedd6c3f3e9d8edb&sql=10:zq1ibkh9sakmcruisin' duke & the drivershttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef54f6de67373c85fec61d&sql=10:4fjm7i7jg7drduke & the drivers rollin' onhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef54f6de67373c85fec61d&sql=10:tw5a8qztbtq4robert ellis orrall contain yourselfhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef5cfed96c38399d8edb&sql=10:j9fpxqlhldhespecial painhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef5cfed96c38399d8edb&sql=10:12jieai04xf7fixation robert ellis orrallhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef5cfed96c38399d8edb&sql=10:gw2zefykhgf8new manhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef5cfeda6c393e9d8edb&sql=10:sekvikpjbbf9jon butcher axishttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef5cfedb6c3d3d9d8edb&sql=10:wjjp7i7jg75rtons of willie reviewshttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=adfeaee47319dd49a87520e89b2c45f6a672fe19d650da971f28455a92b63e45913e65ca46f68ba5dbb674b666adff31a65a0fd686ef5cfedb6c3f359d8edb&uid=miw030512201327&sql=11:1kq7g4kttv1z~t2

                      	 wayne wadhams article by joe viglione
	                       
                          

october 18, 2005wayne wadhams and how berklee college's recordingstudios were builtby joe viglionethough his group, the fifth estate, found fame in juneof 1967 when a hit version of "ding dong the witch isdead" (jubilee records) from the wizard of oz circledaround the top 10, wayne wadhams is better known inboston circles as a berklee professor who has producedrock and jazz for major labels as well as re-releasingclassical music forgotten by some of those same majorrecording companies, successfully packaging andselling that important art on his boston skylineimprint.professor wadhams has many great stories - recentlydiscovered footage of his pioneering 60s bandcapturing the spirit of their mission. it should domuch to insure their legacy alongside peter wolf'shallucinations, barry tashian's remains and victor"moulty" moulton's barbarians as the guys who helpedbuild the vital new england music scene. but asessential as that work was and still is, thefoundation it created is equally important, if not asvisible. you see, wayne wadhams is the man whodeveloped six recording studios at the berklee collegeof music in boston - which constitute the music,production & engineering department.   studios whereproducers from the late jimmy miller (rolling stones)to george massenberg (linda ronstadt) and many otherartists have lectured and held master classes whileworking on their own projects.======================================================wayne wadhams founded studio b, a commercial bostonfacility, before his work at berklee, and arts mediamagazine asked him how all this developed back in theday.a.m.m.: wayne, what gave you the idea for studio b?w.w.: "that was really just an accident. the orsonwelles film school, of which i was one of the foundersand vice president, had a recording studio in it,which i put together  for narration and musicrecording - just a 4 track room at the time. at  somepoint in the early 1970s we bumped it up to 8 track,which was pretty good for that time.  in 1974 theschool itself went out of business, so the owner ofthe complex said "make me an offer".   i did. i boughtthe entirety in one lump and put it in a van, and itsat in my backyard for a year, till we decided what wewanted to do.during that time i met allen smith, who became ourhead engineer. we rented the space on boylston street- between arlington and berkeley (the street, not theschool) in boston, where we were for more than adecade."  during that time the studio upgraded from 16 track andthen 24 track at the end. studio b's businessconsisted of commercial clients doing ads, tv work,the kind of projects now mostly done by the facilityknown as soundtrack (where allen smith has workedsince studio b), and other clientele such as localartists and regional bands.in mid-1982 berkelee college hired wadhams to doresearch and consultancy and decided to go ahead withthe new mp&e department later in 1982.   towards theend of 1983 wayne effectively closed studio b takingmost of his staff and putting them all to work atberklee installing the studios and developingcuricculum.   "even  allen smith became a teacherthere," wadhams explained, "but he didn't liketeaching much. that's when he got an offer fromsoundtrack and took it in 1984."wayne also explained the berklee philosophy at thetime: "the core was always the performance division -people teaching players to play, that was the centralpart of it - arranging, songwriting, film scoring andother things of that sort.i designed the recording studios, not all of them,because there are eleven. i designed the first six."the work included basic acoustic design, layout..."they've been renovated since then, i've had little todo with that.  they are still in the sameconfiguration, the basic design for  studios a - f (isthe same)."what happened was that berklee asked wayne to write upa report. "they asked me "should we be teachingrecording techniques or anything related and if so,what - and how should it be oriented?""i interviewed students, a lot of faculty, alumni herein ny and l.a., interviewed the heads of cbs studios,atlantic studios, you name it, to ask if they thoughtit viable and worthwhile for a college to be teachingengineering and/or technical areas of recording.  theysaid "absolutely" because recording itself was gettingso much more technical" and so said my report."wadhams was in the middle of a motion picture audiomix with the famous screenwriter/director john saylesin new york, the 1983 picture "lianna", when he wassurprised to receive a phone call (within a month ofhis turning in the report) asking "how quickly can youget all this up and running?"he replied "if you want this done within six monthsyou have to give me full control of the whole thing." they said ok. "they set it up so that i was workingwith the provost, and the new president, then lee berk(the school was, in fact, named after lee berk), whowas just taking over from his father, who had foundedthe school in 1945. everything was done in directconcert with the president's office."this accelerated the closing of wadhams' own "studiob", helping them make the decision not to move, but towork on the berklee project."this was also a time when the industry itself was sorapidly increasing in technical detail and complexity" wayne told arts media magazine. moreover, at thispoint in time, an "audio" version of the "oscars" wascreated by mix magazine - the "tec awards" for outstanding technical achievement.  berklee won thefirst, second and third "tec" awards.  the aes (audioengineering society) also awarded berklee top honorsas an educational institution, and held theirexecutive meeting at berklee, which they had neverdone at any school before.  this signified to theindustry that the school had done the right thing. although wayne intended the berklee job to be aturnkey operation in his career, the college haddifferent ideas.  they said "now that you've built themp&e department, don't you want to teach?"  wadhamsreflected: "the next thing i know, i'm a fullprofessor."today wayne is still busy, currently producing a cd ofbach organ music with organist david carrier at thewellesley congregational church.  he's written anumber of books including a three volume set called"sound advice", and most recently "inside the hits", awonderful exploration of what makes many well-lovedtop 40 hits tick.  it is published by berklee pressand is worth seeking out.

                      	 peter calo article
	                       
                          

peter calo returns to boston, orpheum theater 11/19/05 by joe viglionepeter calo was born in a small town in alberta canadaand moved to boston with his family when he was inhigh school, 9th grade.  at that point in time he tookup the guitar and within two years or so was invitedby the mit classical guitar society (founded in 1971by vo ta han) to perform a concert at kresgeauditorium in cambridge.  "i started out playingclassical guitar, that was my first love along withthe blues and funk" the guitarist said from his homein croton on hudson, new york in an interviewmid-october, 2005.by 1982 his jazz band bellvista released a six songe.p. followed by his own "spoonerism" in 1983 and atrack, "fine line", on 1985's "boston rock & rollanthology vol. #7" (varulven), the first real look atcalo on record performing rock & roll. with sarah caldwell and leonard bernstein inbernstein's masterpiece, "mass", peter calo was theonly person to have performed both the singing role ofthe rock musician in that opera as well as playing theguitar. "after the performance leonard bernstein cameup and gave me a hug as i took my bow - i'm lookingfor the photo of that" (in calo's personal archives).a mainstay of the boston scene, calo was involved asan original member of both down avenue (the band whichhad  charles pettigrew of charles & eddie "would i lieto you" fame) and the heavy metal horns.  after hisstints with both groups peter moved to new york wherehe began doing session work, producing and eventuallyhooked up with carly simon, beginning what is now aten year relationship with the legendarysinger/songwriter.calo noted, on his work with carly: "we've beenworking off and on for ten years...the first tour was 1995. imet her in august - we did an impromptu gig."  theyalso did a concert taped exclusively for "lifetime"and calo's datebook filled up quickly. over the yearshe's performed on shows with dobey gray, debbie boone,lesley gore as well as "the new york voices", a fourpiece vocal band which toured with peter as part ofthe backing trio, performing on their 1993 grp album,"what's inside", as well as their 1998 rca disc "newyork voices sing the songs of paul simon".  he alsoworked on carly simon's 1994 disc "letter's neversent" (arista" and her grammy nominated 1997 disc"film noir".   a long-time member of the broadway show"hairspray"'s orchestra, he is on their grammy winning2002 cast album on sony.  "he goes to bat for theartist when he's producing" said well-known bostonvocalist pamela ruby russell.  "he's very inspiring, ilearned so much from him. he's kind, professional,very  organized, great producer ...and aguitarmaster."   russell also feels that calo'smusical vocabulary is phenomenal "because he plays inso many genres, in so many types of music."  with somany accolades a second opinion was needed, so artsmedia magazine contacted new york chanteuse ingridsaxon, daughter of vaudeville star david sorin-collyer- the man who was vocal coach to bette midler, barrymanilow, paul simon and so many others. "it wasawesome recording with him, he's brilliant" said saxon- echoing pamela russell's sentiments from hundreds ofmiles away.  "before we even went into the studio hecame to my voice studio with his equipment, recordedmy rehearsal with paul trueblood so that we could hearit back, and started giving us input.  his ears are soincredible,(and) he directed both of us.   he really directed usmusically like the third set of ears, it wasincredible."   saxon knows show business, havingappeared on "ryan's hope" and "days of our lives"soaps, continuing with " he's very encouraging, reallysuportive. peter knows so much about the recordingprocess - he's been on so many sessions; he knew howto work with the engineer, work with the pro-tools. hehad every angle covered."along with involvement soundtrack to the 1999 robertde niro film "flawless" and other movies, calo'srecorded output is becoming voluminous - work withlinda eder,rosie o'donnell, joe pesci, david osborne, katetaylor, kate's nephew ben taylor, and, of course,ben's mom,carly simon.  which brings us back to boston and theorpheum show, november 19, 2005.  peter calo will beperforming with opener ben taylor - son of both jamestaylor and carly simon, as well as with carly.  thesongs, of course, will truly move the audience alongwith simon's presence (her star-power cameo in 2004's"little black book" made that movie so extra special),but calo's signature guitar lines can't be ignored. ina concert with mary gatchell in epping new hampshirein may of 2005 his guitarwork fit with gatchell'skeyboards so hand-in-glove.  mary gatchell's "indigorose" album was produced by calo, who may tour newengland in 2006 with a number of his acts includingopera singer adelmo, ingrid saxon, mary gatchell,pamela ruby russell and others.  with all this output his own work gets somehow lost inthe shuffle.  it shouldn't.  peter calo's "cowboysong" album is historical and an instant classic thatshould be in libraries across the country.  the artistrecorded contemporary arrangements of songs from theamerican west including "shenandoah", "red rivervalley", and "i'm so lonesome i could cry." a bigdeparture from his instrumental tribute albums to theeagles and the beatles, two separate discs, on thenorth star label, and his own "wired to the moon" and"cape ann" albums.  for more information on thisinfluential and important artist who worked many aboston/cambridge nightclub and theater, go tohttp://www.petercalo.comhttp://www.visual-radio.net1995-2005  our tenth year on television!http://vrtv.blogspot.comp.o. box 2392woburn, ma 01888

stone crazy  for  arts media magazine(60,000 issue bi-monthly; largest arts mag in newengland)   the story of the musical group stonecrazy and thecreation of their album, "stone crazy", is a snapshotof just how hard it is to record and market importantart as the new millennium rambles on.  one would thinkthe pairing of blues guitarist kenny pino - sideman tothe legendary johnny copeland - and j. geils bassistdanny klein - would be the kind of combination majorrecord companies would snap at.    you've got twoplayers who toured europe with debbie davies, givingthese professionals time to find their own groove,along with seven to eight years to carefully put thepieces of stonecrazy together.   factoring in the collective longevity and abilityto track solid music efficiently and effectively,signing the group to one of the j. geils band's oldhomes - emi or atlantic - should have been elementary.but we are talking about the nuttiest business in thehistory of the universe, and important art doesn'talways get its due.   with a torturously slow incubation, the initialstonecrazy tapes - much like j. geils starts and stopswhen jon landau was producing the early 1969 or sosides that never made their way to vinyl, danny klein,ken pino, harp-playing brother babe pino and drummersteve shaheen put some music together in the studio.with shaheen's drumming they had a good, laid-backstyle, a live show in chelsea caught on video back inthe late 1990s documenting that part of theirevolution.  the first cdr of studio material had aspecial charm in a world where the blues market isjust glutted with material.  no label picked it up,and though it got aired along with a danny kleininterview on mark snyder's am radio show on wmsx, andwith college radio play recognizing there wassomething here, the early stonecrazy demos becamecasualties of record label indifference, and soughtafter collector's items by hardcore geils fanatics.    enter mark hylander of the groups sass and dukeand the drivers.  hylander phoned this writer up andasked if there was a band looking for his talents.knowing shaheen was about to leave stonecrazy, thethought of geils' bassist playing alongside duke andthe driver's drummer made perfect sense - "duke",after all, was a band that idolized the geils attitudeand mystique.  the union worked, and despite aninterruption when geils got back together to  tour in1999, the group has stayed intact with babe pino,ken pino, danny klein and mark hylander.a little background on the concept's development:  danny klein is a boston rock & roll pioneer andlegend.   when peter wolf and stephen jo bladd were ina 1960s band called "the hallucinations",  danny, john"j" geils and magic dick were taking classes atworcester poly tech and playing in their ensemble -thej. geils blues band.  when they all joined forces andsigned to atlantic, their unique brand of blues/popfusion started taking hold, especially with theclassic "homework".  the band eventually recorded withthe great duo buddy guy and junior wells on atlanticin 1972. a decade later buddy guy went on to releasean album on alligator entitled "stone crazy".   circa 2002 john "j" geils produced the band atwellspring sound in acton, and recorded some guitaron tracks with stonecrazy, as did keyboardist sethjustman. it's actually the first time three members ofj.geils' band are back together in the studio. thegroup was offered a contract with gerry beaudoin'sfrancesca records around this time, a label thatissues john geils own material, and  four of thetracks, "fooled    myself", "buttercup", "mr. blue"and "woulda coulda" made  the rounds on radio andcable tv.    come 2005 the band finds their music released onal cocorochio's black rose records - a label thatboasts sal baglio's stompers, tom hambridge, bostonrockabilly music conspiracy and others.  that it tookover eight years for the fourteen tracks to finallysee the light of day is a good indicator of how toughit is to get the formula just right when major labelsare too busy buying each other up to get behind thework of musicians who have already paid their dues.musicians who are the real deal.joe viglionehttp://www.visual-radio.net1995-2005  our tenth year on television!http://vrtv.blogspot.comcreating content since 1995! featuring joe viglione - host of tv eye, established in 1979.
