aliens from hell - freeman at conspiracy con 2013






what occult practices have the nazis, and now nasa, employed to communicate and channel entities into our dimension. what is the real purpose of the billions going into particle colliders like cern? what is blue beam, a faked alien invasion, or something much more sinister? how does this play into the new world order?

why does madonna have a dna clean up crew? did madonna show the mark of the beast at the superbowl? is this the very same mark shown by russell brand?
did michael jackson die or is there a much deeper mystery involving the nine gods of egypt that were channeled by the elite? is there any reality to stargate sg1 or battlestar galactica? how have space command, the fbi, and the cia influenced our understanding of inter-dimensional gods and the genetic creation of mankind?

aleister crowley, the beast 666, changed the world forever, as his beliefs take their deepest roots in society, what did crowley have to say about transhumanism and the industrial use of blood and semen? can this explain lady gaga's use of blood and semen in her new perfume line? what is the secret meaning of monster drink's logo? how many times have you seen 666 and not realized?
