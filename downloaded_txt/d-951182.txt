kia ora, welcome to tohuin 1998, we established the world’s first māori-owned wine business. we are part of a family business and business of families. our tūpuna were kaitiaki of whenua and moana  - farmers, fishermen, planters and providores. they were astute, creative and entrepreneurial. it is our responsibility to uphold their legacy, and enhance the resources they passed down to us, now and for future generations. today we create internationally recognised award-winning wines while remaining true to our deeply held values, which include rangatiratanga, kaitiakitanga and manaakitanga – excellence, guardianship and kindness.every tohu bottle carries our distinctive logo, derived from a koru pattern. for māori, the koru symbolises growth, life and the natural world, and our logo celebrates this iconic spiral. it represents the growth of our company and the journey of our people from the past to today. this koru signifies our long-term intergenerational goals and has become our tohu, our signature. welcome to our journey. mauri ora!
