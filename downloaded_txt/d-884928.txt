welcome to constable hall









the hall is closed for inside tours until spring, however we still have many exciting outside programs planned. check our event page for upcoming activities and people are still encouraged to enjoy the grounds, our new paths and new benches.  we will officially open for tours on may 28th, but schools or  groups may tour earlier with a reservation.





constable hall is a historic house museum located in the adirondack tug hill region of lewis county, new york. this federal style limestone mansion was built in the early 1800’s by members of the constable family.


the hall has been a fixture of the north country since it opened for public tours in 1949. the beloved hall, garden, and grounds have had visitors attending the annual fundraising events, touring the hall and gardens, and learning about early american living.


bring your family & friends for a step back in time to experience a rich history and relaxing day on the grounds of this prestigious estate. browse the information here to learn more about our tours, events, and lovely garden and grounds. you can be sure your visit will be memorable and enjoyable!





twas the night before christmas


it is a constable family tradition that clement clarke moore wrote his famous “a visit from st. nicholas” inspired by his visit to constable hall. the tradition, which dates to at least the mid 1800s, says that clement visited his second cousin, mary eliza mcvickar constable and her five children shortly after she was widowed in 1821 or 1822.


the constables, moores, and mcvickars were all new york city neighbors. susan moore, related through the constables, made a sketch of the hall during the 1820s that you can see on your next visit to the hall.


the following lovely article was written for the december 1988 issue of the adirondack life magazine. permission was kindly granted to reproduce this copyrighted article for your enjoyment.
