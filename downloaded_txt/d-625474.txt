"amazing stay at the kehoe house
kehoe house is exceptional in so many ways. the house is beautiful and the rooms are so stunning and come equipped with modern conveniences surrounded by antique furnishings that took our breath away. the moment my husband and i arrived, we felt cared for. the staff is exceptional and will help in any way they can to make sure you have a relaxing stay. we really enjoyed socializing in the front parlor, having a glass of wine and looking out at beautiful columbia square. we highly recommend kehoe house!"

downtown savannah location
the kehoe house's great location in the heart of the historic district makes it easy to experience savannah.  our guests are a short walk away from just about everything you'll want to do in the downtown historic district.  you'll need a vehicle to get to tybee island (savannah's beach), wormsloe historic site, and a few other popular places outside the historic district, but you can very easily spend several days exploring on foot.
