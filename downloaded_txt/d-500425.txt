freesolve resorbable magnesium scaffold

indicated for de novo coronary artery lesionsa
supportresorbable coronary scaffolds widen coronary artery stenoses and provide temporary vessel support. thereby, scaffolds enable unobstructed blood flow in the coronary arteries with low rates of stent thrombosis (st) and target lesion revascularization (tlr).
resorbby degrading after fulfilling their scaffolding function, they offer all options of future therapies.
