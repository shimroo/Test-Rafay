mark your calendars! november 4th paul marinaro album release show!


leave a reply 


i am so excited to announce that the great chicago vocalist paul marinaro will be celebrating the release of his new album not quite yet on november 4th at the studebaker theater in chicago. this project was years in the making. paul worked hard choosing the material and i arranged everything on the album—14 tracks—for strings, horns, and two intimate duos. it’s a remarkable project, one for which i am deeply proud.  
click here for tickets!

not quite yet releases on october 28 and is available for pre-order at bandcamp!
paul has released two singles from not quite yet—”born to be blue” and david bowie’s “5:15 the angels have gone.” you can stream both on spotify as well as watch behind-the-scenes videos of us recording at chicago recording company. you can also support paul at bandcamp by purchasing these singles

vonology releases friday, april 15 on ears&eyes records


leave a reply 


i am thrilled to announce that my latest album, vonology, will be released april 15 on ears&eyes records on vinyl, cd, and digital download through bandcamp. vonology is a five-movement suite of compositions that i wrote to explore the artistic, spiritual, and astrological dimensions of von freeman’s music and life. i wrote this work as an artistic companion piece to my university of chicago dissertation, “’will you still be mine?’: memory, place, race and jazz on chicago’s south side,” which examines the history of segregation and jazz in chicago, with von’s new apartment lounge jam session as a central case study. anyone who purchases the album from bandcamp will also get a digital copy of this dissertation. i will also be launching a new website on april 15, vonology.info, that will further explain my compositional process and what the music represents, as well as updates of my research on von freeman, george freeman, and the south side jazz scene. you can read more about vonology here.

covid updates from the chicago jazz scene


leave a reply 


i hope all of you and your loved ones are safe, healthy, and staying sane under the lockdown. this has been a trying time for everyone and we musicians are trying to find ways to help with livestream performances and interviews. there are some exciting updates in my musical and academic worlds:
on may 5, i successfully defended my dissertation, “‘will you still be mine?’: memory, place, race, and jazz on chicago’s south side” at the university of chicago. i am officially a ph.d. in ethnomusicology. 

i am excited and grateful to announce that the city of chicago’s department of cultural affairs and special events has awarded me an individual artists program grant that will fund the release of vonology later in 2020. this project is the artistic component of my dissertation, and musical exploration of the themes surrounding von freeman that came out of my research. more news on the release coming this summer.
the university of chicago’s humanities division has awarded me the humanities teaching fellowship at the university of chicago for the 2020-21 academic year. it’s a postdoc position where i’ll be teaching music and humanities courses the coming academic year. 
2020 marks the 20th anniversary of my first album, the mike allemana organ trio with my longtime musical companions, dan trudell on organ and mike schlick on drums. we will be having a celebration later this year that will include 20th anniversary special editions of our two albums. stay tuned.
  
please stay healthy and safe.
