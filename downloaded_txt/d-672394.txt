“i believe that the work of our network is to build a continuum where economic stability is just the beginning. through our actions and partnerships, we have the opportunity to mobilize efforts so every community can thrive. and if there is an anecdote for poverty it’s hope. hope that we can make it to the next day but also hope that you can live out your dreams. i believe hope connected to action changes the landscape of our lives and the lives of generations to come.”— vanessa philbert, ceo, community action partnership of lancaster county
