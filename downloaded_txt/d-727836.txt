doug ritter is an internationally acknowledged authority on survival equipment and practical survival techniques.  his innovative product reviews, evaluations and articles have helped to revolutionize some aspects of survival equipment design and production and allow consumers to make fully informed purchase decisions about their own investment in survival, decisions with potentially life and death importance.
doug is the founder, publisher and editor of equipped to survive®, a comprehensive independent source of information on survival equipment dedicated to saving lives though survival research and education.
doug is also the founder and chairman of knife rights, a grassroots advocacy organization rewriting knife law in americaâ¢ and forging a sharper future for all americansâ¢ 
doug ritter™ gear
after evaluating survival gear for two decades, doug has developed some very strong opinions about what works and what doesn't; what will save your life and what might not.  in some cases he has given up hope that someone else will deliver a product that includes all the features he would prefer.  as a result, he has begun collaborations to produce gear to his own exacting specifications. one key feature has been that all this gear must be affordable and a good value a well as being gear you can bet your life on™ 





proceeds from the sale of doug ritter gear supports doug ritter's knife rights' efforts to free knife owners from irrational knife restrictions.
