horsemanship & communitythe southlands foundation strives to provide a historical and agrarian connection to the community and to cultivate respect and love for the land and its animals through education, conservation and outdoor recreation.the southlands foundation teaches horseback riding, horsemanship, and the love, understanding and skillful care of horses to adults and children. we offer horse stables, indoor and outdoor riding arenas, and horse show opportunities. in addition, our 200 acres are open to the public for miles of trails to ride or walk.in 2023, we celebrated 40 years as a not for profit, but our land rests on the historical legacy of deborah dows who founded the riding stables in 1938 and the native peoples who inhabited the land long before. join our tsf community and help us preserve our land for future generations.learn more



 


“some tell of their riding, but more tell about learning to love the land and the creatures on it – to understand growing things – to learn to live and let live – and how their time spent on southlands helped them cope better with the problems in their individual lives.”

— deborah dows, founder
