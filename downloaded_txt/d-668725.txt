darkness ch. 4





alex sheathed her blades without cleaning the blood from them and walked up to the group on the ground with all the confidence of a panther in its natural habitat. her every movement was fluid and graceful at the same time they were threatening and intimidating. in the months that she had survived on her own, killed things ten times stronger than herself, she had learned to become one with every muscle in her body. her body was a tool that her mind used as a conduit for its power. she stopped short of the brown haired man where he sat on the ground holding the girl she had rescued from the backseat in his arms. he set the girl down gently, though quickly, and stood up slowly to face her. her eyes shifted wildly as her heart warred with her soul and tried to bring back the humanity that was lost on her. her hand shot out and wrapped around his throat in a vise like grip no mortal could hope to break. for a moment she struggled with herself and nearly pulled her arm back but her demonic half won out and her grip remained around his throat, even though her arm was shaking from the internal war within. “you have two seconds to give me a reason not to kill you,” she stated flatly. her eyes became blacker than ever before and her arm ceased to shake. tristan watched her graceful movements. it hurt him to know that such grace came from such darkness. he set emily down on the ground and stood back up. almost faster than he could see he found her hand tightly gripped around his neck. tristan looked down at her, locking eyes with her. he noted the shift in color and a small smile formed on his features. tristan looked down at her and managed using his strength to pry himself from her grip. it was difficult though. she was stronger than he thought. "if you kill me dean will die," he answered simply. alex snorted derisively, not deterred at all by the fact that he had just outmatched her strength. her demonic half was raging inside her, begging for release, for more bloodshed. it filled her soul and threatened to consume her entire being. for a moment it raged so fiercely that her body burned, a feverish spike brought on by too much power in one body. she broke out into a sweat and her color paled severely. she stood strong as her nose began to bleed and her hands began to shake. her fever soared higher, spiking more than a human body should be allowed to have without an ice bath, and her body struggled to remain on its feet. she felt like she was being torn apart on the inside as two halves of a soul battled each other viciously, the demon half trying to take complete control and the human half trying to regain a bit of ground. the power was too much, the blood too strong for a human body with no human soul to absorb it. she wasn’t a full-blooded demon and therefore without her human soul fully intact to steal some of her demonic half’s thunder than her body was going to die from the inside out. only a full blooded demon could handle the power that went along with the title. alex felt as though someone were driving spikes into her head as her vision blurred and she involuntarily cried out from the pain. the sound was human, completely alex, and as she had sudden flashbacks of who she really was her knees buckled. tristan watched for a moment. he would wait for the right moment to intervene. he looked over at sarah then back at alex. when he saw her begin to lose footing he stepped forward and caught her body as she fell. tristan lowered her onto the ground slowly, holding her in his arms. he brushed her hair back and ran his hand along her cheek. her fever was much higher than he anticipated. he hadn't meant to let it go so far. "shh, alex,” he whispered, knowing that there wasn't much left of her to hear him. tristan closed his eyes and held her close, keeping one hand resting on her face. he felt his body chill, the cold flowing from his body to her own. this was harder than he thought. it would take more energy. tristan looked down at her and waited. he was regenerating the bits of her broken soul to at least give her enough to fight with. tristan used memories of her and dean to piece back together the shattered pieces of her soul. at the same time he was mending her broken body as well. when he felt her temperature lower to that of a normal human temperature he released her and set her gently on the ground. he looked down at her and leaned over her waiting to see if she'd wake up. he worried what sarah would think and hoped that sarah would believe he was helping. sarah ran to her sister, tears in her eyes, and fell to her knees beside her. her heart raged with pain, fearing that she was going to lose alex all over again. she had seen this before. alex had had many wars with her demonic half in which her body had become a victim, but her human soul had always won out and the symptoms had always receded. she met tristan’s eyes over her sister’s body and wondered what he had done to save her. she knew that it had been him, from the moment that he had caught alex and lowered her to the ground she knew that he had done something that had saved her life. her eyes were questioning but grateful and her tears fell freely down her face to drop onto her sister’s chest. tristan looked up at sarah. his breathing was labored and his skin much more pale than before. he locked eyes with her and after a moment he smiled. "she has strength like i've never seen sarah," he said simply. he wasn't really referring to physical strength. after a moment tristan leaned back and turned his attention back to emily. she looked terrified. "it's all right now emily. everything's going to be all right."alex stirred beneath sarah’s hand and when she opened her eyes they were black again, but steady. sarah blew out her breath; she had been hoping that alex was back and would remember everything. it would seem that accomplishing that would be harder than she thought. sarah felt her sister’s emotions through her touch and was shocked to realize that there were none. alex was devoid of any emotion at all. sarah moved away quickly, motioning tristan away as well. she came to his side and pushed him away, gripping his arm in her hand and she was startled to realize that the interaction was more to steady herself than to move him. she was overwhelmed with the knowledge that there was so little left of her sister’s soul that it was almost completely demonic. she wanted to fall to her knees and cry until everything ended and she could wake up happy again. she found herself unconsciously gripping tristan’s arm tighter before looking up to meet his eyes. “i don’t know what you did,” she said quickly. “i’m not even going to ask. but you have to know that it will happen again. as long as the demonic side is stronger, it will happen again and next time she might not live.” tristan looked at alex and his heart broke to see her. he tried so hard to save her but it hadn't worked. he took note of sarah pulling at him and he turned to face her. tristan wrapped his arms around her in a comforting way. "i'll do everything in my power to get her back sarah," he whispered. "i promise. i will die before i let you lose another sister." tristan knew what he was doing was wrong. it had been wrong since he picked emily up on the side of the road. he wasn't supposed to intervene like this but he couldn't just sit back and watch them die. emily meant too much to him. sarah pushed him back farther away from alex as she rose to her feet, steady as a rock and just as solid, and lowered her voice so that only tristan could hear. “i’m not going to pretend that i understand you. and we still have to talk later. but i know that you did something to save her life and for some reason i have this feeling that you’re the only one that can do it again. alex might not mean that much to you, but she is all i have left. so i need to know . . . i need to know . . . ,” she hesitated, knowing that she was overstepping the bounds of some unseen rules with her question. “i need to know if you’ll do it again. i’m asking you, because for whatever reason i trust you, to stay close. i need to know that when this happens again you’ll be there to stop it.” she looked into his eyes and glanced over her shoulder to where alex was lifting dean into her arms with care. tristan watched alex's movements carefully but heard every word that sarah said. he heard the pain and the plea in her voice. then he looked over at her locking eyes with her. he couldn't say no. he knew he should, but he couldn't. how had he gotten so involved in this? tristan averted his gaze for only a moment then looked back at her. "i promise sarah," he said softly. "i need your help now though. you can't carry sam, but i can. i was thinking maybe you could carry emily. she's much lighter than any of them." tristan turned to emily. "sarah's going to take care of you and i'll be with you the whole time." then he looked back at sarah. "dean's lost a lot of blood, all of them have. they need to get to a hospital now." sarah nodded quickly, pulling herself from her own emotional trauma, and moved to emily’s side. she stared into the younger girl’s eyes for several seconds, seeking to establish a bond of some kind of trust before she lifted her into her arms. “it’s okay, emily,” she told her. “i’ll make this painless i promise. i told you i’ll keep you safe and i mean it.” sarah focused her mental energy to sarah’s pain and dulled it. she concentrated before she lifted and planted the emotion in emily’s heart that she couldn’t feel the pain. she didn’t want her to feel her broken legs being moved around and she took all of her energy and put it into that one goal. emily watched the scene unfold before her. she stared at tristan in amazement. there was something about him that was frightening but calming at the same time. every time he looked at her all the bad things went away. she heard him speak of sarah taking her and she nodded slowly. however, when sarah moved closer she backed away. she looked at sarah with terror in her eyes. she felt the girl pick her up and for a brief moment she felt the searing pain but it faded. she wrapped her arms around sarah's neck the way she had with tristan and rested her head on the girl's shoulder. tristan looked over at them as he picked sam up slowly. he looked down at john; he would have to come back for him. "would you believe i don't have any transportation," he said with a laugh. considering he was in the middle of nowhere on a highway without transportation, as if everything else didn't seem strange about him that just added to it. when sarah got emily into her car safely and with no pain involved she turned and allowed tristan to place sam beside her. dean and john went into alex’s car and she turned the engine over to pull out onto the highway. sarah followed her with tristan in the front seat and together they roared down the highway to the nearest hospital.

darkness ch. 3





emily watched the two with fear and fascination. her focus was mostly on alex. when alex said they were coming to finish the job emily let out an involuntary whimper. she looked up at alex with tears in her eyes. emily watched alex take out two matching blades. she was going to fight them off, emily could tell. she wouldn't let her, not alone. dean took care of her, he always took care of her and she was supposed to take care of him now. she said it was her turn. emily moved to try and stand but her legs wouldn't budge. she let out a loud cry but stifled it quickly then looked up at alex once more. she wanted to help, more than anything she wanted to help but she couldn't move. emily felt so helpless. all she could do was let alex handle it. for all the amount that emily didn't trust alex, she had seen the look of love in the girl's eyes when she looked at dean. she cared deeply for dean and emily could tell. though emily had no comprehension of what real love was. all she had for that was dean and he was on the ground, dead to emily's knowledge. love was not something emily wanted anything to do with at the moment. her father always told her he loved her. it was all a lie. emily loved dean and he left her, he died. she looked up at alex once more. love was what fueled her, made her stronger. emily knew there was something inside the girl, something not quite human. there was no other way she could have ripped the doors from the car or picked dean up the way she did. there was a strength inside her that was brought forth by something, almost demonic. at the same time though emily could almost feel that it was fueled by love. what kind of love could give strength like that? alex came forward with her blades as one of the demons tried to rush past her to get at its prone targets. she held out the blade and spun as he passed, burying it to the hilt in the back of his neck. the demon stopped and began jerking and convulsing as she twisted the blade. from the other side sarah could see the tip of the blade protruding from the demon’s throat. alex jerked the blade out and kicked the body to the ground as she turned to meet the rush of a second demon. he barreled into her and successfully knocked her to the ground. she went down with the demon on top of her and managed to get her foot up and onto his chest before her back met the dirt. she brought her blades in a crisscrossing x at the demon’s throat and quickly pulled them apart. the head severed, showering her with a spray of blood, and she kicked out sending the demon flying back fifty feet to slam into the front of the semi truck. as alex stood from the ground a dark haired young man bolted past her at a speed that alex couldn’t possibly attempt to catch. she turned and watched him run toward dean and the others but something in her gut instructed her to leave him be for now. she would challenge his arrival later. alex wiped off some of the blood and managed only to smear it further. she shrugged and walked forward with her already bloodstained blades at the ready in her hands. emily stared at alex with fear in her eyes. she was terrified of this unstoppable force, but at the same time there was something comforting about it. she was protecting them. emily wondered who this girl was, what her connection with dean was. how did she know them? dean never mentioned her. though there was a lot about the eldest winchester's life that he had never mentioned. emily never claimed to know dean very well, but he protected her. he was the first person in her life that loved her. he was her safety and now, when it mattered most she couldn't help him, but this strange girl could. there was something dark about the girl that frightened emily. she looked back and forth between alex and her opponents watching them each meet their demise at the end of her blades. suddenly she noticed someone run to her side. she turned quickly, causing a searing pain to shoot through her right leg and the rest of her body. what she saw in front of her made her heart skip a beat. "t... tri... tristan," she whispered with tears in her eyes. the young man smiled and wiped away her tears with his thumb. he tucked her hair behind her ear and kissed her forehead. "shhh," he whispered. it was the same comforting tone that dean used with her back in salvation. "its all right now," he whispered resting his forehead against hers. sarah turned her attention from sam to the newcomer kneeling beside the girl with the broken legs. her heart skipped a beat and she feared she had a let a demon slip past unnoticed. she remembered her promise to keep the girl safe now and she stood up quickly. she put her hands to her temples, focusing her power at the young man. tristan glanced up at the younger woman. he found himself being compelled to his feet. tristan stood and stared at her for a moment. he looked down at emily then back at sarah. "i'm trying to help," he called to her and glanced down at emily. his heart ached to see her like this. he knew it shouldn't but it did. "please, i'm trying to help," he said in an unnaturally calm voice.sarah held fast to her psychic power, pinning him into place so that his feet were weighted down to the earth. he made no move to attempt to come toward her but she kept her power focused on him all the same. she stepped nearer while she did so and began scanning the surface of his emotions like a radar detector. she probed deeper, seeking out anything that would make him a threat. she found nothing and when she scanned him she was startled to feel a deep feeling of peace. she looked closer and saw the tiniest pinpricks of white light surrounding the inside of his being, as though he were a candle in the night. her eyebrows furrowed in mild confusion. “who the hell are you?” she demanded. tristan stood in place and watched sarah inch closer. he kept glancing down at emily and he smiled at her to let her know he was fine. he knew what the girl was doing and didn't want to seem to be a threat. the last thing he wanted was for her to send him flying because she thought he was a threat to sam and dean. she spoke again and he couldn't help but smile. there was power in her voice, a sense of command. it amused him. "my name is tristan," he said simply. "i know emily. please, sarah," he paused and locked eyes with her. she had seen into his heart, at least had a glimpse at the truth. "i am trying to help. they need to get out of here; it is too dangerous for them." sarah hesitated slightly. “i know that. what the hell do you think we’re trying to do? the bigger question is what are you doing here in the middle of the night on a deserted highway?” tristan turned his attention to sarah when she spoke. "that's much more complicated than i would care to explain miss delaney," tristan asked. his voice showed that he was in no mood for an argument. "these boys need help now and if you don't let me go then they will die. please, i am trying to help them." tristan met the girl's eyes once more and studied her. "please, trust me for now and i will tell you everything at a better time. just trust my judgment." his voice was unusually calm and rather soothing. tristan spoke with an unsettlingly calm voice and the only emotion in his eyes came when he looked at emily. sarah searched him harder for a moment, seeking anything that would deny his claims and again came up empty. she released her hold instantly and stared hard at him. “you and me,” she said firmly, “we’re going to have a talk later. count on that.” under her breath she muttered, “mr. show’s up in the middle of the freaking night. you glow like a damn candlestick!” "tristan," he said as he dropped to his knees beside emily. sarah looked at him, startled, as she realized that he had heard her and was correcting her informal name for him. she had to stop herself from wondering how in the hell he had managed to hear her comment. he smiled and picked emily up in his arms, holding her tight. "shh," he whispered to the trembling girl as she wrapped her arms around his neck and rested her head on his shoulder. tristan chuckled at her comment and looked down at emily. "thank you for trusting me sarah." he wondered when she would notice that he knew her name. she probably had since she knew he had knowledge of her capabilities. sarah turned her attention to the girl that tristan called emily. she appeared badly frightened and her entire body shook from fear and pain. sarah’s heart broke for the girl and all she wanted to do was run to her and take her in her arms and tell her that the world really wasn’t so bad. she suppressed the urge and watched the loving way that tristan handled her. the comfort and compassion that he imparted with just a mere touch and soft spoken word. her eyebrow rose slightly and she felt herself even more at ease with him. she no longer thought he posed any threat at all to them but she knew that there was something supernatural about him, albeit in a good way. her heart told him that he was on their side, for better or worse, and she needed to trust him implicitly. tristan smiled at her and looked down at the bodies that surrounded him. he looked back up at emily and smiled. "shhh," he whispered once more. tristan stroked her hair gently and looked up at alex in her fight. a small smile formed on his lips and he looked down at dean, then back at alex. she was better than he thought she'd be. he could feel the demon inside her, but still her heart prevailed. that was amazing to tristan. he had never seen a human so strong in the presence of a demon. alex ducked a punch that the third demon sent at her and she remained low to the ground in a perfectly balanced crouch. she kicked out with her right leg and hooked it around his knee. he was a skilled fighter though and instead of falling to the ground he jumped over her extended foot to safety. she came back up on her feet in an instant and circled him warily, searching for an opening in his defenses. he came at her with a fierce three punch combination and she blocked all of them before having to drop one of her blades to catch the extended foot that came kicking out at her face. the demon jerked his foot from her grasp and dodged backward out of her reach. “enough games,” she snarled. alex launched her body into a cartwheel, her legs flying in an arc through the air although her hands never touched the ground. when she landed she was positioned behind and slightly to the right of the demon. he came at her quickly, spinning on his heels and she dodged behind him. she grabbed his neck in the crook of her arm and jerked. his neck snapped audibly and alex swore she could hear the bones snapping all the way down his back in the near-still night. she caught sarah’s eye as the younger woman turned at the gruesome sound. alex shrugged and dropped the body to the ground without a second thought. tristan's head turned quickly at the sound of breaking bones. he stared at the girl in amazement. she would need more help than he originally thought. tristan glanced down at dean's all but lifeless body. he would be strong enough to give her the help she needed. then tristan looked down at emily. she stared at alex in terror and tears streamed down her face. "shh," he whispered looking down at emily as she turned to meet his eyes. "don't worry. she's on our side." alex turned and spotted the demonically possessed truck driver running off into the night, most likely to the safety of whoever his benefactor was. she considered giving chase and putting him out of his misery but something in her heart stopped her. he was a human, trapped in his own body. she couldn’t kill a human being. she stopped suddenly, standing as if frozen to the ground beneath her feet. all she heard was her own heart beating quietly in her ears. but she had killed .  . .those months where her own identity was a mystery to her she had killed plenty. demons and humans alike. anything that had stood in her way she had taken out of existence. she stared at her hands and swore that they were stained with more blood than she actually had on them. her heart trip hammered and for a moment she felt like she was going to be sick. a single tear found its way down her face and she swiped at the foreign object, not understanding the cause of it. her heart hardened again and the memory of the innocent lives she had taken faded back into the recesses of her mind. alex turned around and faced the group of people she had pulled from the broken impala. in their midst was the brown haired young man that had escaped past her earlier. she started forward toward the group, where the woman that called herself her sister seemed to be having a confrontation with him. he wasn’t going to escape a second time.

darkness ch. 2





sarah stumbled back as alex pushed past her and over to the car. sarah could see the slumped over form of the semi truck driver against his steering wheel but another gut instinct told her that she shouldn’t go near him. instead she hesitantly followed alex and stood back as her sister came within inches of the totaled car. she halfway wondered what alex was going to do and even more wondered what she was doing there at all.alex came up to dean’s window and reared her fist back before punching out. the glass shattered around her hand and she reached inside to gently push dean’s body away from the door. her vision caught hold of the two men in the front seat and a flood of images assaulted her mind. both of them were familiar to her and her memory told her that she knew them. her mind told her that she had laughed with them once, fought beside them, cared for them and loved them. she felt as if she were looking into a distant life that she no longer lived and she couldn’t quite fit all the pieces of it together. even so her heart told her that they must be rescued as well. they could hold the key to her past that she had been seeking for the last few months.alex felt her eyes shift rapidly, sliding from brilliant blue to black and back again. she closed her eyes tightly and shook her head, growling under her breath. when they were blue she knew that her eyes were generous, loving, and open. when they were black she knew that they were as cold and lifeless as the bottom of the ocean. when her emotions and memories became confused her eyes shifted and she felt feelings inside her dead heart that she didn’t know existed. at this very moment she felt love, deep and passionate, when she stared at the man in the backseat that had been haunting her dreams and memories.alex looked past him suddenly to a shift of movement in the backseat. a small girl huddled there and the moment their eyes met the girl shrank back as far as she could go. alex took in her disheveled and fragile appearance. she studied the overly large white sundress that hung off the girl’s right shoulder and the cut that decorated it, presumably from the car crash. her face dripped blood from a small laceration on her forehead and her brown eyes stared at alex with fear and tears mixed in them. alex stared hard at the girl and recognized pain across her features. the girl tried to squirm away but alex realized quickly that she couldn’t.she didn’t recognize the small fragile creature in the backseat and her face elicited no memories. all the same there was something in her eyes, the pain that was evident there, the innocence that seemed to permeate everything about her, that made alex’s heart twist. her eyes shifted again, maintaining their crystal blue color for several seconds before shifting back.“hold on,” she said sharply. “i’ll get you out.”she grabbed onto door that the now shattered window provided access to and ignored the shards of glass that sliced into her palm. the cuts on the top of her hand sewed themselves shut quickly and disappeared with no trace that they had ever been there. she jerked with all her strength and the door groaned in protest but came off the car. she picked up the door and tossed it away behind her and into the night. alex repeated the process with the driver’s side door and blood ran freely from her hands and down her arms.“alex,” sarah called. “be careful. we don’t know how badly hurt they are.”alex snarled under her breath and gently placed her hand under dean’s neck and the other around his legs. she lifted carefully and brought his six foot frame to rest again her own more slender body. from the backseat the girl reached out for him. she tried to move across the car but couldn't. with every movement of her legs pain shot through her tiny body. she turned and walked a short distance away to place him gently on the ground.sarah dashed to the driver’s side and stared into the backseat at a brown haired, doe eyed girl that she didn’t recognize. she smiled gently, seeing the pain evident on her features.“it’s okay honey,” she said quietly. “my name is sarah. we’ll get you out, i promise. you’ll be okay. you’re safe now. i won’t let anything else happen to you.”emily's head turned quickly when she heard another voice. she stared at sarah with slightly less fear. there was something about this girl that was less threatening. she began pulling sam out with caution as alex returned to the backseat to extract the terribly frightened girl. emily remained silent. it wasn't until alex appeared next to her in the car that she finally spoke. emily looked back and forth between alex and sarah, but it was obvious she spoke to alex. "d... de... dean," she whispered. her voice was soft and hoarse, much like the first time she spoke to dean. there was a childlike quality to her voice that seemed to make it echo in the silent remains of the impala.alex hesitated at the edge of the car, her head stuck in the door and her braid falling down over her shoulder. she met the girl’s eyes and for a moment she became lost in them. her eyes shifted wildly as memories of love and laughter flooded her being. she reached out a hand and gently touched the girl’s arm. she came further into the car and grabbed hold of her upper body.as the girl leaned closer emily did her best to back away. she was trembling uncontrollably. with each subtle movement emily felt a fiery pain shoot through her body.“i’m sorry but this is going to hurt no matter which way i do it,” alex warned her.alex pulled back, taking care to keep her legs as straight as humanly possible, until the girl’s body was in a better position to be picked up. alex eased her arm under the broken legs and tightened her grip to allow minimal movement. she didn’t want to cause the girl anymore pain than she was already in.“you really might want to hold your breath,” alex advised her. “i’m going to have to carry you over to dean and your legs are broken so it’s going to hurt.”every movement was painful for emily. she was a strong girl though and she bit her lip and shut her eyes as tight as she could. she took sharp breaths every once in a while when the pain was too great but she wouldn't cry out or scream. she didn't know who this woman was, or what she was for that matter, but at the moment she trusted her, or at least trusted her to enough to let the woman, alex, take her out of the car.she lifted gently and brought the girl’s tiny frame to rest against her own. she was light as a feather, easily carried, and alex strode across the grass to where she had laid dean. his face was pale in the moonlight and the blood was beginning to dry across his handsome features. she felt a lurch in her stomach and the remnant of a love so deep in her heart that she took a gunshot for him. her mind spun. she heard the sound of a gun firing echoing in her head and saw herself jump in front of dean to take the bullet. the memory receded and she was left with confusion.alex reached the place where she had laid dean and set the girl down carefully next to him. emily moved towards dean, almost shielding his body from the woman. it had been dark in the car and she hadn't gotten to see dean clearly. now, with the light from the cars, emily was finally able to see the damage. she stared down at dean with the most horrified expression. her heart ached as she saw him. all emily could think of was that he was dead and she was left all alone. emily leaned down and ran her hand across his face. "don't go," she whispered to him. then she looked up quickly when she saw a movement out of the corner of her eye. sarah came up then, dragging sam’s body as she wasn’t strong enough to carry it. alex ignored sarah and returned to the car to retrieve john winchester. when she returned with him over her shoulder she eased him down onto the ground next to his sons and surveyed the land around them. the highway was empty of any help.“alex,” sarah whispered.alex turned her head to regard the younger woman and followed her finger to where it lay pointing over a hill. alex made out three figures coming toward them at a steady pace. inside the semi truck the driver was starting to get out and alex knew immediately that they were all demons.“they’re coming to finish the job,” alex stated.“we can’t let them!” sarah cried, falling to her knees beside sam.alex popped the sore muscles in her neck and let her eyes fall on each of the car crash victims. she returned her steady gaze to the approaching figures.“stay with them,” she commanded and she left no room for argument with her tone. she reached down to her boots and slid out two wickedly curved and serrated blades, gleaming silver in the moonlight, and perfectly matched. she flipped them around deftly in her hands until the blades were resting against her forearms and the hilts in her palms. “i’ll take care of the problem.”

darkness ch. 1





darkness is the sequel to wild angel, it is a collaboartion with angie (roguefire28 from jaf forum)... it combines her stories (frozen, heat, and intensity) with wild angel and takes place where wild angel left off... enjoy.sarah’s 2003 flame red firebird roared down the empty highway at a speed that threatened to break the sound barrier. she cared little for highway patrols; if they attempted to pull her over she wouldn’t hesitate to start a high speed chase that would make the news. sarah had taken her car to a specialist in the underground market and had her engine worked on, the governor removed, and every other trick in the book that made her car as fast and aerodynamic as possible. already she was reaching 150 mph and climbing. three months ago she had retreated to her family’s log cabin in the mountains to get away from the world in which she lived. her sister had died at the hands of a demon, just like all the rest of her family, and in order to deal she had to run away. she had spent the months alone, living out her life in solitude and contemplating her life decisions. at long last she had come to terms with what had happened. sam had proposed to her, her sister had died, and the boys had gone off on another hunt after the demon that killed their mother. the last phone call she had received from sam had been three days ago and she hadn’t heard a word since. then the vision had come. she had seen a semi-truck smash into the passenger side of the impala in the middle of the night. following the road signs she had seen in her vision she had immediately left to find the highway that would potentially take her lover’s life. she had already lost everything in the world that had meant anything to her and she wasn’t going to lose her fiancé. she floored the gas all the way down to the floorboard and thought back on alex. two months ago the doctor from the hospital that had proclaimed alex dead had called to say that her body had never been recovered. the doctor had reason to believe that she had accidentally been cremated due to a slip up in the computer records. sarah had resigned herself to the fact that she would never be able to bury alex next to the rest of her family and had instead just had a tombstone placed in the family plot bearing her name and an epitaph that read “an angel among demons and a hero among men”. sarah struggled with the pain that still resided in her heart and drove onward before spotting a set of headlights shining into the road in the distance. they were stationary and sarah began to slow the car down to a more acceptable stopping speed. her breath caught in her throat as she came upon the scene her vision had forewarned her about. she slammed her foot down on the brake and the car reacted by swinging around to face the accident scene, her headlights illuminating what enfolded before her. she jumped out of the car as a second set of headlights appeared coming over the hill at a break neck speed as well. sarah turned her attention back to the impala and its four passengers. the semi truck’s front end was lodged into the passenger side of the impala and there was no hope of getting it out herself. smoke plumed from the engine into the night sky and the radio in the semi truck blared loudly a horrendously happy song. sarah made out dean’s face pressed against the glass and saw the blood that stained the window where his head touched. sam was unconscious in the driver’s seat and his father next to him, both bloodied and cut from the accident. sarah turned sharply as an engine louder than her own roared to a stop and a figure stepped out of a black with white racing stripes 2003 mustang ss. the glare of all of the headlights prevented her from making out the driver but whoever it was walked with confidence as they approached sarah. sarah’s breath caught sharply and for a moment she forgot to breathe as the figure was revealed. “alex?” she whispered. her sister was among the living for whatever reasons that sarah didn’t even begin to guess at. alex was dressed from head to toe in black leather and her boots sported three inch heels that made her look taller and more imposing. there was a new scar that cut through the middle of her left eyebrow and her eyes were the customary onyx black that signified her demonic half was in charge. the scar from the gunshot wound was faint but noticeable on her abdomen where the flesh was revealed by the corset-like black leather top she was wearing. on her hands were bicycling gloves, the kind that were cut off at the fingers, and her hair was braided back away from her face with black and red leather strips braided through the hair. emily slowly began to hear the muffled sound of a car radio. the sounds came back into focus. the young girl tried to move but found it too difficult. her head throbbed and she couldn't move her legs. it took a while but with enough effort emily managed to open her eyes. she turned her head to the side and saw dean on the seat next to her. his body was beaten and bloody. it tore her heart apart to see him like that. dean was a fighter and now emily saw him and he was broken. she forced herself to sit up slowly, looking at the sight around her. emily was still unable to move her legs. she looked over and saw john in the seat in front of her, his head against the window and sam next to him. she had blood along her face from the small cut on her forehead. emily looked down at dean once more then she noticed a light out the window. she managed to make out two figures, women. emily watched them in silence, afraid to move. she looked in the one woman's eyes and was terrified to find them dark and cold, as the demon that might have taken her family away from her again. there was something different though. it wasn't much; just enough to not scare her the way the demon that inhabited john scared her. she didn't have that sick feeling in the pit of her stomach. still this girl seemed dark, cold. she watched the two for a moment. emily sat against the remains of the backseat. she wished she could sit in her safe position, hugging her knees to her chest but she couldn't move her legs. emily looked down at the floor and saw blood flowing down her legs. they were most likely broken. she looked up quickly when she saw one woman point in her direction. her heart stopped and her breath caught in her throat. she wondered if they saw her. what would they do if they did? there wasn't much emily could do. she was too weak to do anything with her mind and she couldn't move. emily was trapped in the car unable to get away. she wasn't worried about her safety though as she looked at the woman with onyx colored eyes. she was more worried about dean's safety. she looked down at his lifeless form then back up at the women. “it can’t be . . .,” sarah stammered, for a moment completely forgetting the car crash. “you’re dead!” alex looked in her direction sharply and all sarah saw there was the anger and darkness of a full-blooded demon. sarah took a step backward, away from her volatile and powerful sister. alex cocked her head and stared hard at sarah for a moment, as if struggling with something inside herself that sarah couldn’t see. sarah wanted to run to her and hug her but something held her back. an instinctive feeling that while her older sister was miraculously alive there was something very wrong. “who the hell are you?” alex demanded. sarah was stunned. it was worse than she thought. alex didn’t remember anything from before the gunshot wound and it would seem that she was no longer even remotely human. “i’m . . . .i’m your sister,” sarah stammered. “i’m not here for you,” alex told her sharply. she pointed at the smoking impala and sarah belatedly realized how much precious time she had wasted. “i’m here for him.” sarah followed her finger to where it lay pointing at dean.

wild angel ch. 6





she didn’t bother to get a hotel room.  she hoped she wouldn’t need one.  the boys would have one and she would stay with them.  emily took a moment standing in the parking lot to try and understand what happened.  he kissed her, it wasn’t much but still no one had done that before.  emily ran her fingertips over her cheek where his lips had been.  she closed her eyes and a small smile formed on her lips.  she looked down at the paper in her hand that contained his cell phone number.  emily smiled and put it in her bag next to the picture of sam and dean with their dad.  when they were done she would make sure she called him.  when she found sam and dean and everything calmed down. emily sighed and looked around.  she threw her backpack over her shoulder and took a deep breath.  the sun was setting and emily started down the street hoping to at least find their car.  she searched for hours up and down every street she could find.  what she didn’t know was that she kept missing them just by a few minutes.  emily stopped at a small diner and got something to eat.  she had taken so of jim’s money, he wasn’t going to need it.  she took a few moments to calm down.  she was worried, what if they moved on?  did they know about jim?  was dean even worried about her?  she took her cell phone out and hovered over dean’s number.  she called and again there was no answer.  emily sighed and shook her head.  she paid for her meal and left the diner.  it was late by then but she didn’t have anywhere to stay.  she turned down a road that she knew she had been on before.  emily had given up on her search to find them when she heard a familiar voice down the street. emily looked up and saw a black car parked on one side of the street.  on the other side she saw sam and dean run into a house.  emily’s heart stopped for a moment.  she felt the worst sensation in the pit of her stomach.  it reminded her of when that woman showed up at the church only much, much worse.  emily did her best to run towards the house.  she stopped just outside when she heard a gunshot.  emily looked up towards one of the rooms and just as she looked up it caught fire.  she screamed and took a step back just as two people, a man and a woman, ran out of the house.  following behind them was sam and dean behind him.  he was holding a baby.  dean handed the baby to the woman.  he didn’t even seem to notice that emily was standing there. emily, like sam stood staring through the window of the burning room.  dean still hadn’t seemed to notice that emily was there.  she vaguely heard sam say something and out of the corner of her eye she saw him move towards the house.  dean stopped him, he said something but emily couldn’t really hear it.  she looked through the window and saw a figure of a man.  she knew what it was, who it was.  it wasn’t until dean pulled sam back and he ran into her that emily looked at them.  it wasn’t until that moment that dean knew she was there.  “emily,” he said staring at her. sam turned when he heard her name and looked down at her.  they both seemed surprised she was there.  “you’re… you’re alive,” sam said softly. dean stood there silent for a long time.  emily looked at him and she thought she could see tears in his eyes.  after a long pause she finally felt what she had been searching for.  dean stepped closer to her and wrapped his arms around her.  emily finally had a chance to let it all out.  she buried her head in dean’s chest and dean could feel her body trembling in his arms.  “shh,” he whispered to her, stroking her hair gently.  dean understood what was wrong.  though he never said it part of him hoped she died to.  if she were dead she wouldn’t have to live with what dean knew she had seen. they took her back to the hotel.  the ride was a long and silent one.  sam was upset, emily could tell but she couldn’t figure out why.  emily knew that thing took their mother from them but like her, sam had been an infant.  she didn’t understand why he seemed so much more upset than dean.  of course, emily had no knowledge of jessica.  even if she knew about jessica she couldn’t comprehend the relationship, the deep feelings that sam had for her.  it was beyond emily. they got back to the hotel and dean sat down with emily on one bed and sam on the other.  emily kept looking over at sam while dean spoke.  “emily,” he whispered.  finally he turned her head to face him.  “are you all right,” he asked softly.  “how did you get here?”  dean sighed and looked down at his cell phone.  he noticed he had several missed calls, all from emily.  dean sighed once more.  “i’m sorry,” he whispered.  then dean stood and tried to call their dad again.  still there was no answer.  emily curled up and rested her head on the pillow.  it was nice to hear their voices again, even if they were upset.  she vaguely listened to what sam and dean were saying.  why was sam so angry?  then dean said something about jessica.  emily sat up just as sam slammed dean against the wall.  emily immediately went into her normal, frightened position of hugging her knees to her chest and burying her head in her arms.  who was jessica?  sam spoke and it broke emily’s heart.  there was so much pain in his voice.  so much hurt.  emily couldn’t understand it but she could hear it and it killed her to hear sam like that.  what hurt worse though was what dean said.  emily knew he meant his family but his words still hurt her.  “the three of us, that’s all we have.  that’s all i have.”  why wasn’t emily included?  who did she have if not at least dean?  his voice broke through her and she found tears rolling down her face.  sam backed away from dean and dean looked over at her.  he saw her tears and walked over to sit next to her.  “shhh,” he whispered again wiping away the girl’s crystal tears.  dean sighed and stood, picking up the phone and calling their father once more. emily sat straight when she saw the look in dean’s eyes.  he hung up the phone and said they had his father.  who were “they”?  dean had never taken the time to explain why him and his brother do what they do so emily was confused and frightened.  sam and dean argued about whether or not they should go.  in the middle of it emily stood.  “why,” she said quietly.  “where?  who… what’s… what’s going on,” she asked quietly.  she was frustrated and now that she was more articulate than the last time she saw the winchesters. dean looked over at emily.  he was surprised that she spoke.  she rarely spoke last time they met.  dean was caught off guard.  he paused and looked down.  “it’s complicated,” dean said softly.  “i’ll tell you in the car,” he said quickly as he finished packing up the car.  dean spent the entire ride to lincoln explaining the last twenty plus years of their lives.  emily sat in the back seat of his car half listening.  she hugged her knees to her chest and rested her chin on her knees.  the ride was long and rather unproductive.  they still didn’t find their father.  dean decided it would be best to stop by an old friend of their father’s.  his name was bobby.  emily followed them into the house.  they passed by a black dog sitting on the hood of a blue pick-up truck.  the dog barked at her and she jumped, clinging to dean.  dean simply looked down at her and laughed.  “its ok,” he said with a smile.  they walked into the house and emily took a seat in the corner behind some books.  she didn’t really listen to much of what they were talking about.  in her mind it didn’t involve her. at least she thought that till she realized that bobby had turned to look at her.  “this includes you little lady,” he said simply.  emily sat there hugging her knees to her chest and stared at him.  “you’re in this storm with those boys.  you better take good care of them.” “ye… yes… yes sir,” she said softly.  there was something amusing in her voice as it caused bobby to start laughing.  emily looked at dean and he just smiled.  she didn’t understand what was so funny.  emily looked up when she heard a dog yelp and then there was silence.  bobby looked out the window.  seconds later the door burst open and a woman walked inside.  emily stood quickly and stared at the woman.  it was the same she had seen kill jim.  emily moved to go after her and dean held her back.  she glared at the woman and dean moved in front of emily.  he made a move towards the woman and she threw him back, knocking emily over as well.  emily hit her head on a desk and her world went black.  she woke a few minutes later, her head on a small pillow.  she sat up and saw the woman tied in a chair.  emily took a spot on top of a bookcase and sat there watching.  she liked spots like that, small places she could curl up in. she was excited for a moment, and then she heard dean speak.  she saw dean backhand the woman.  emily vaguely heard bobby mention that she was possessed.  emily glared down at the girl and she looked up at her.  “name’s meg,” she said with a smile.  “i remember you.  you were that tiny little girl hiding in the church.”  so she had seen emily.  why hadn’t she killed her?  “did you enjoy the show?”  emily tried her best to stay put and not react to meg’s words.  it was hard though.  emily had only felt anger like this once in her life and that was in her basement with her father.  dean had been there to save her from losing herself in her anger.  dean walked back to them and sam started reading something.  she watched meg writhe in pain.  to her terror, emily got some enjoyment out of it.  dean’s voice terrified her though.  he was so angry.  there was a darkness coming from him that made him no seem like dean.  he wanted to know where their father was, emily understood that, but there was a line that had been drawn and dean passed it long ago.  finally he got his answer.  dean told sam to finish it.  emily knew that would kill meg.  somewhere inside her she knew that meg was just a frightened girl like herself.  she could hear it, feel it, and see it.  emily jumped down from her perched position on a bookcase and stood in front of dean.  she looked up into his eyes trying to find the comforting dean she once knew. “sammy, finish it,” he said looking down at her and not sam.  emily looked almost devastated by his words.  she looked back at sam and saw fear in his eyes.  emily bit her lip and looked down she closed her eyes and heard sam finish what he was reading.  emily watched the demon leave meg and her entire body go limp.  emily backed against the wall as meg slowly raised her head.  she was alive.  emily was amazed.  there was strength in the girl that made emily smile.  she watched as sam and dean carefully lifted her out of the chair and set her down on the ground with a pillow under her head.  emily looked down at the girl.  meg looked up at her. she said she had been that way for a year, awake for some of it.  emily watched and the girl locked eyes with her.  “i am so… so…s… so sorry,” meg struggled to say.  emily simply smiled.  it was a comforting smile, letting meg know it was all right.  meg told them that the demon wasn’t lying and where they could find their father.  then she took her last breath.  emily watched with some kind of childlike fascination.  dean stood and took emily away so she wouldn’t look at the body. emily looked up at dean.  she saw pain, remorse in his eyes.  it was the same look he had when he killed her father.  emily didn’t know what to say.  she wanted to comfort dean as he had done so much for her but she couldn’t think of how.  dean walked away from her and they gathered their things and left. as emily was walking out she glanced back at meg’s body and bobby took her arm.  “you take care of those boys all right,” he said with a smile.  emily nodded and walked out the door following sam and dean.  she sat in the car and the ride to jefferson city was silent.  emily stared out the window.  after a while she looked down at the piece of paper she held that had tristan’s phone number on it.  she smiled as she thought about him.  his eyes, the softest kindest eyes she had ever seen.  emily bit her lip and stared out the window.  dean looked through the mirror and laughed when he saw her.  he had seen that look before, but he wouldn’t bring it up. it wasn’t as long of a ride as she thought it would be from lincoln to jefferson city.  she got out of the car with the boys and stood leaning against the car as sam read the book bobby had given him.  dean rummaged through the trunk.  emily stared out at the bridge in the distance that went across the missouri river.  she sighed and crossed her arms over her chest.  she heard sam and dean start fighting again.  emily rolled her eyes and sighed.  she turned to face him as dean tossed the colt in the trunk and closed the lid.  “stop it,” she snapped at them.  “both of you.  that’s all i’ve heard since i found you.”  her voice was strong, commanding.  dean couldn’t help but think that maybe jim had been right when he said emily was doing much better. the two walked along the river and dean noticed a sign that said “sunrise apartments”.  it took a while, and some scheming but they eventually devised a plan that involved sam pulling the fire alarm to get all the people out, or at least the people that weren’t possessed.  the plan irritated the hell out of emily though.  she wasn’t involved at all.  dean waited for the fire department to arrive then he distracted the firefighters as sam stole some of their uniforms.  when they were ready to go in dean took emily around to the back of the building.  “emily,” he said looking down at her.  “stay here, i’ll come get you.”  emily nodded reluctantly and waited for the three of them to show and for them to leave.  she stood there for a long time.  emily noticed a man walking down the street.  she got that same sick feeling she had with meg and she studied him for a moment.  emily turned the corner and walked down the street a little.  she took a spot hidden under a staircase, thinking she would still be able to see where sam and dean would be coming from. dean helped their father get out the window and out the fire escape.  suddenly something threw him back with an unbelievable force.  he slammed against the windshield of a car and sat up.  he saw the man straddling sam and punching him repeatedly across the face.  dean watched for a moment as bruise after bruise appeared on sam’s face.  finally he took the colt out of his belt, aimed, and pulled the trigger sending a bullet through the man’s head.  he stood and walked over to help sammy up.  dean carried sam over to where their father was.  he stopped when he realized that emily was nowhere to be found.  his heart raced.  dean set sam down next to their father and looked around.  “emily,” he shouted.  “emily!”  dean looked down at his father and brother.  they were barely conscious and dean knew more demons would be coming soon.  he couldn’t wait anymore.  dean had to get them out of there.  he made a note in his mind to make sure that he came back to find her.  then dean helped sam and his father up.  he put them in his car and tore off down the rode. emily waited and waited until the sun started to go down.  dean never did find her.  she stood and walked back to where she was supposed to meet them and saw a body on the ground.  it was that same man from before.  emily realized that dean must have killed him then taken sam and their father somewhere else.  tears filled her eyes.  he didn’t take her.  she was lost and alone again.  emily closed her eyes and tears slowly fell down her pale cheeks.  after a moment she felt that same nauseous feeling and she looked around.  there were about four people coming towards her.  emily did the first thing she thought of.  she ran.  emily ran as fast as she could down the street, down the highway into the middle of nowhere.  it was dark now, very late at night when she finally stopped.  she continued walking.  it was as if something was leading her.  she didn’t know where she was going but at the same times he knew exactly where she was going. emily turned and walked down a side road.  she followed it until she spotted dean’s car outside of a small old house.  she walked over and glanced through the window, seeing sam pinned against the wall.  it wasn’t until she saw dean that emily realized what was going on.  emily’s heart stopped.  she felt as though she was being torn apart from the inside.  she looked through the window once more and saw dean.  she could hear his cries.  something took over emily at that moment.  she walked towards the door and kicked it open with all her strength.  john turned to face emily, his eyes an almost florescent yellow. emily stood in the doorway her head lowered a little.  her hair fell in her face and covered her eyes.  there was darkness and strength that emanated off of her.  she looked up at john with only her eyes her head was still lowered.  there was a dark, menacing look in her eyes.  john simply smiled and walked over to her.  she turned and seemed to circle around him.  “i know you,” he said simply.  “ah, yes i remember.  emily reynolds,” he said with a hint of pride.  “you,” he closed his eyes and smiled.  emily glanced over at dean and saw his head drop down and blood drip from his mouth.  anger and rage fueled inside her.  it was far more than anything she had experienced.  what emily felt inside her was pure hatred.  “i had so many plans for you emily.  you were… you were always one of the strongest.  even as an infant i knew your potential.  the power you possessed.  don’t you feel it?”  john glanced over at dean and smiled.  “you care for him?  he takes care of you.” emily glared at him and stood between him and dean’s lifeless body that was still pinned to the wall.  “he took care of me,” she said softly, a malicious tone in her voice.  “he’s always taken care of me.”  emily paused and raised her head to look john square in the eyes.  “my turn,” she said simply.  a split second after that john slammed against the wall.  emily walked towards him.  john tried to move but couldn’t.  “its not so much fun now is it,” she asked quietly.  john tried to speak but found himself unable to breathe. sam watched from the wall and after a moment he dropped to his feet and dean to the ground.  he took a deep breath and sam ran to his side.  “are you all right,” he asked.  dean nodded and looked to their father.  sam looked over at them and he picked the colt up off the table.  he looked at the demon in his father’s body. the demon smiled and laughed.  with a sudden push emily flew back against the other wall where dean had been before.  her head slammed against the wall and she fell to the floor again next to dean.  emily stood up slowly and she glared at him.  she wasn’t able to stand for very long though.  after a moment she fell to the ground next to dean once more.  dean managed to move over and he rolled her onto her back, looking down to make sure she was all right. sam held the gun at his father and pulled the trigger, shooting him in the leg.  he stood over his father with the gun, ready to shoot.  then he heard that voice.  it wasn’t the demon speaking.  john was begging sam to shoot him.  dean kept pleading for sam not to shoot him.  emily was half conscious and she tried to follow what was going on but it was hard.  finally sam lowered the gun and just after that the demon left john’s body.  emily sat up slowly.  she was stronger than dean and she held him up.  emily looked over at him and smiled.  “i took care of you,” she whispered.  he smiled faintly at her and nodded.  sam and emily helped get john and dean into the car.  sam drove, john was in the front passenger seat next to him, dean was in the back on the driver’s side, and emily sat next to him, hugging her knees to her chest. dean had lost a lot of blood and emily kept looking over at him.  her heart was racing.  dean was all she had left if he died she’d be alone, even if sam was still here.  dean was her protector, her lifeline.  sam drove as fast as he could down the street.  he fought with his father about the bullet and emily noticed him looked through the mirror at dean.  she looked over at dean and smiled, taking his hand in hers.  everything would be all right, she was sure of it.  then with a sudden jolt emily flew across the car and landed next to dean.  she was able to curl up in a small enough ball that she didn’t get crushed.  she looked up and was the only one of them to see what hit them, a large semi-truck.  emily felt a warm red liquid flow down her face.  she looked up and realized that it was not only her blood but dean’s as well.  she looked up at his face and it was the last thing she saw before emily clenched her hand around his and everything went black.

wild angel ch. 5





emily spent the next few months with jim murphy.  she learned a lot from him.  she’s still terribly shy but she’s learned that not everyone should be feared.  jim got her to open up to him, tell him about her father, and to tell him about dean.  dean was the first person she remembered that ever cared for her, really cared for her safety and her feelings.  sure she had teachers that worried but no one ever did anything.  dean was the first person that ever showed that he genuinely cared what happened to emily. emily spent most of her days in the basement of the church.  she wasn’t much for socializing and to be honest the people that came in scared her sometimes.  there was a feeling she got with some of them that made her nervous.  it was only nerves though.  that is until one day about three months after she had been there.  emily was down in the basement; she was walking up the stairs to find jim.  emily stood in the back and stopped when she felt this feeling in the pit of her stomach.  she felt as though she were going to be sick.  emily had never felt that before. when she looked up she saw a young woman walking up to jim.  there was something about this blonde that emily didn’t trust, but she was too frightened to do anything.  she froze, standing there and staring.  she watched for a moment until she saw the girl’s eyes turn black.  then, with a speed she didn’t know she had emily ran down the stairs.  jim had set up a small space in the corner of his weapons room that emily could hide in.  she was small enough to fit and no one would see her unless they knew it was there.  emily ran down into the room and hid in her little hole. she was trembling terribly and she shut her eyes.  then she heard footsteps.  emily opened her eyes and saw jim run into the room.  he took out a knife and threw it at the woman.  she caught it and emily wasn’t really sure what happened next.  she heard the woman speak but was so frightened she couldn’t understand it.  emily sat there and watched as the woman slit jim’s throat.  emily almost screamed but she knew better than that.  the woman stood over the body for a moment then looked over in emily’s direction.  she swore that the woman was looking right at her but eventually she left.  emily stayed there for hours afraid to come out in case the woman was still there. she stared at the body and watched as the blood flowed to the floor and into the hole she was sitting in.  she tried to keep it from getting in her hair but was terribly unsuccessful.  emily sat there, hugging her knees to her chest replaying the events over and over in her mind.  the sound of his final breath echoed in her mind.  she could have done something, stopped it somehow.  why hadn’t she done anything?  jim took care of her she should have protected him.  she was just starting to like jim.  she hadn’t smiled or laughed so much in her entire life.  she rocked back and forth and it wasn’t until late that night that she finally left the hole.  she walked across the room and stood next to jim’s body.  her hands trembled as she slowly closed his eyes. emily stood there for a long time, unsure of what to do.  she didn’t have anywhere to go.  her hands shook terribly as she slowly made her way up the stairs to the small bedroom she had in the back of the church.  emily curled up in her bed and stayed there for two days.  finally she remembered where she put dean’s phone number.  she called but got no answer.  emily looked down and noticed a small note on her table for her.  it was written in jim’s handwriting.  the note read: “sam and dean are in salvation iowa.  they’re safe and their father is with them.  don’t you worry.  sam says hi.”  emily looked down at it then she quickly ran over to her closet.  she gathered her clothes together and threw them into a small backpack.  then she stood and looked down at a picture she had of sam and dean.  jim had given it to her; it was a picture of them when dean was about fifteen.  it was all she had of them.  emily grabbed it and threw it in her bag, along with a cell phone that belonged to jim. emily walked out of her room and back down to where jim’s body was.  she stood there for a moment.  “i’ll find them,” she whispered.  the emily turned and headed out of the church.  she wasn’t sure where she was going, or how she was going to get there. but she knew she would find sam and dean.  she walked along the highway for several hours before calling dean’s cell phone again.  still there was nothing.  she was getting tired and she hadn’t eaten in at least two days.  emily was exhausted and hungry but she wouldn’t give up. it wasn’t until early the next morning that she noticed a truck stop ahead of her.  she walked passed it and stopped when she got to the front.  “you need a ride miss,” the man asked.  he was a younger man with dark hair and dark eyes.  his skin was tanned and he looked as though he hadn’t shaved in a couple days.  emily stood there for a moment.  she didn’t trust people in general she wasn’t sure if she should trust this man either.  she had packed a gun and several knives before she left so she was ready to defend herself if need be.  emily nodded slowly and the man opened the door of his black pick-up truck. emily climbed in and sat down on the seat.  she hugged her knees to her chest and stored her bag on the floor by her feet.  emily looked over at him and she closed the door.  then he pulled back onto the road.  he glanced over at her and smiled.  “name’s tristan,” he said with a smile, looking over to the girl. emily glanced over at him but she didn’t say anything at first.  she looked down and then glanced over at him once more.  “emily,” she whispered. “emily, that’s a nice name,” tristan said with a smile.  he looked over at her and noticed that she was rather pale.  she was trembling too.  “if you’re cold there’s a coat behind you that you can wear,” he offered.  “i got some sandwiches in the cooler down there too if you’re hungry.  some stuff i picked up for dinner last night but didn’t eat.” emily leaned down and opened the cooler.  inside she found a cheeseburger that hadn’t been eaten.  she picked it up and looked over at him.  he nodded and she smiled.  emily took it out of its wrapper and took a few small bites.  she didn’t want to make it too painfully obvious that she was hungry.  “thank you,” she said quietly. “so,” he asked quietly.  “where ya headed?”  the man had a small accent, hardly even noticeable.  his voice reminded her of dean’s.  he glanced over at her and smiled.  she seemed so nervous, he felt bad.  tristan didn’t want to make her uncomfortable.  he saw her walking and she looked so fragile.  he couldn’t just leave her to walk. “iowa,” she said softly. “really,” he said with a laugh.  “i’ll be damned.  i’m headed to des moines, meeting some family there.”  he laughed and smiled at her.  “where you headed in iowa, i might be driving through.” “salvation,” she whispered. “salvation, salvation,” he said to himself.  “hold on.”  tristan pulled off to the side and emily looked over at him.  he leaned behind her to grab something and she backed away.  he glanced up and smiled.  “relax,” he said quietly.  “i was just getting this,” he said taking out a map.  he looked through it and then looked over at her.  “i was checkin’ to see if we go through salvation on the way.”  tristan looked at the map then he folded it up and put it back behind her.  “well, we don’t go directly through it but it’s not that far off course.  you want me to drop you off there,” he asked. she looked at him, still nervous.  she didn’t have the bad feeling she got with the blonde woman though.  she nodded slowly and eventually smiled.  “thank you,” she whispered again.tristan simply smiled and pulled back out onto the road.  “it’ll take a day or so,” he said glancing over at her.  she was sitting and staring out the window.  he smiled and looked back ahead of him as they drove down the highway.  after a while he glanced over at her and noticed she was asleep with her head against the window.  he noticed her shivering and he reached behind her and grabbed a blanket then he carefully managed to keep driving and wrap the blanket around her at the same time.  he looked over at her and smiled.several hours later emily woke up as they pulled up to a hotel.  tristan ran inside and got a room, with two beds and then drove around to find a parking spot.  he parked the pickup truck and the two got out and walked into the room.  she looked around then back at tristan.  emily smiled and he smiled back at her.  she was strange, in his mind at least.  he didn’t know what to make of this girl.  she was quiet, it was almost creepy but he didn’t get any creepy vibe off of her.  emily sat down on the bed and opened up her backpack.  she took out her cell phone and tried once more to call dean.  still there was nothing.  tristan watched as her face turned from a normal, blank one, to a look of disappointment.tristan sat down next to her on the bed and looked over at her.  “what’s wrong,” he asked quietly.“dean won’t answer his phone and he hasn’t called me back yet.”  dean promised that he would call her back if she called.  she had called several times by now and still heard nothing from him.“who’s dean,” he asked quietly.  “is he your… your boyfriend or something?”emily looked up at him she was smiling and obviously trying not to laugh.  she shook her head slowly and hugged her knees to her chest, resting her chin on her knees.  her long brown hair fell in front of her face but she didn’t notice.  what was dean?  she had never really thought about it before.  then it came to her, though she wasn’t sure how sam felt about it.  “brother,” she whispered with a smile on her face.“oh,” tristan said softly.  emily couldn’t see it but he was smiling.  he looked over at her and tucked her hair behind her ear.  it caused her head to whip around and she stared at him.  “sorry,” he said quickly.  she simply smiled and he looked down for a minute.  there was a long awkward silence then he stood quickly and looked over at her.  “i umm… i’m gonna… i’m gonna get a shower,” he said quickly.emily looked at him confused he was acting weird.  it didn’t make her worry though it only made her laugh.  he seemed nervous or something.  she smiled and looked down as he gathered some clothes from his suitcase and walked into the bathroom.  he closed the door behind him and after a moment emily heard the water start.  she lay back on the bed and looked up at the ceiling.  she had come so far in the last few months and she wanted dean to see her progress.she was lost in thought, her memories of dean and sam.  she looked up when she heard the door open and sat tristan walk out with only a pair of flannel pajamas pants on.  he wasn’t bad looking at all.  emily had come far enough to notice that.  she never really noticed dean’s looks but she was so afraid her father would find her she didn’t notice much of anything.  she noticed this man though.  his dark curly hair hung in his eyes a bit.  his skin perfectly tanned, it reminded her of dean’s skin tone.  he was tall, she hadn’t noticed that before but she hadn’t seen him standing.  tristan’s eyes were dark, but not menacing.  they were soft, almost inviting.  his smile was comforting as well.  tristan stopped when he saw her looking at him and smiled, he was actually blushing.  he walked over to his suitcase and found a black t-shirt and put it on.  “sorry bout that,” he said quietly.  “forgot a shirt.”  he laughed and sat down on the other bed, facing emily.  emily sat up and faced tristan, hugging her knees to her chest.  there was silence for a long time.  after a while tristan finally spoke.  “so this dean… is he uh… is he in… in salvation?”emily looked over at tristan.  she knew she shouldn’t say yes just in case but she was going there and she already said she couldn’t get a hold of dean.  “maybe,” she said softly.  that was the best answer she could think of.  “that’s the last place i knew him to be,” she said quietly.  “i haven’t seen him for a few months.”“oh,” he said quietly.  tristan looked down then he looked back up at her.  “you look tired,” he said quietly.  “you should get some sleep, i plan on leaving early tomorrow.”  emily nodded and lay her head down on the pillow, pulling the covers over her.  “good night emily,” tristan said sweetly as he turned out the light.  emily smiled and looked over at him.  he was already asleep.  she smiled and closed her eyes.emily fell asleep quickly and slept peacefully through the night.  the next morning she was awoken by a soft shake.  she opened her eyes and looked up to see tristan sitting on the edge of the bed looking down at her.  he smiled and tucked her hair behind her ear.  “morning beautiful,” he said with a smile.emily turned the brightest shade of red imaginable when he said beautiful.  she knew it probably meant nothing, just a casual greeting but no one had ever said that to her before so it meant a lot.  she sat up slowly and accidentally bumped his head.  “sorry,” she whispered.  tristan laughed and rubbed her forehead gently.  he stood and packed up his suitcase.  emily stood and did the same with her backpack.  it didn’t take long for the two of them to be ready to go.“you wanna get some breakfast,” he asked with a smile.  “there’s a small diner down the street.”  emily smiled but it quickly faded.  she didn’t have time for this she had to find dean.  “i don’t have time, i’m in a hurry,” she said softly.“well i’m driving and the driver won’t get far without food so what say you that we stop for a little bit to get food?”  emily sighed and nodded.  tristan smiled and lifted her head to look at him.  “besides you look like you could use some food,” he said with a smile.  emily smiled and followed him to his truck.  they climbed inside and tristan took off out of the parking lot.  he stopped in the drive-thru of a mcdonalds.  they got some food and continued on the road.  tristan told emily that they should be in salvation by the end of the day.  that made her happy.  emily was quiet for most of the drive but every time she looked over at tristan he was smiling at her.  after about four hours of silence tristan finally spoke.  “you’re different,” he said simply.  he laughed as he said it.  “that sounds so stupid but i mean it in a good way.”  he smiled at her and they were silent again.  several more hours passed and they came to a hotel in salvation iowa.  tristan pulled into the parking lot and emily looked over at him.  she thanked him and he smiled at her.  as she was getting out he grabbed her arm gently and looked at her with a smile.  “hey, emily,” he said quietly.  “do you think maybe…. maybe i could have your phone number or something?  i’d… i’d like to keep in touch.”emily smiled and nodded.  tristan handed her a piece of paper and she wrote down the number then handed it to him.  the half of the paper that hadn’t been written on tristan used to write his number.  he smiled and handed it to her and as he leaned over he placed a small innocent kiss on her cheek.  emily smiled and turned bright red.  “it was nice meeting you emily,” he said with a smile as she got out of the truck.  emily smiled and nodded as she closed the door.  she watched as tristan reluctantly pulled away and she was left alone outside the hotel in salvation, iowa.  there was now a new quest ahead of her.  she had to find dean.

wild angel ch. 4





the boys left the bathroom and walked back out into the room.  dean looked over at emily who was curled up in a ball on the bed.  he sighed and looked down, leaning against the table in between the two beds and on the opposite wall.  dean wasn’t sure what to do.  this girl needed help, help neither sam or dean could give her.  he was in over his head with her because he knew the longer they were together the harder it would be to separate her from him.  for once dean wished their father would just answer his phone calls. dean looked over at sam, who was sitting on the edge of the bed.  there was silence for a long time.  then dean looked back over at emily.  she was asleep.  she looked so peaceful, so pure when she was asleep.  not that she didn’t when she was awake, because in all senses emily was completely untainted, completely pure almost like a child, but when she was asleep she didn’t have the fear she possessed when she was awake.  it reminded dean of sam when they were younger.  the kid was flawless when he was asleep but when he was awake he was scared, he would fight with their father, he was annoying.  dean sighed and looked over at sam, who was watching emily.  dean wasn’t sure if he could handle the pressure of protecting the both of them.  he had enough trouble keeping sam alive.  though emily was infinitely less stubborn that sam. “we have to come up with some kind of plan sam,” dean said quietly, to keep from waking emily.  “her father isn’t dead, i saw him.  i could hear his breathing.  this man has to be stopped or he’ll keep coming after emily until she’s dead, permanently,” he said with a sigh. “so what are you suggesting dean,” sam said coldly.  he knew exactly what his older brother was suggesting.  it hadn’t been the first time dean suggested something like that and that worried sam.  “if he’s alive, we can’t kill him.  i’m not going to have that on my conscience and i’m not going to let you either.  if we kill him we’ll be just as bad as him.”  dean sighed and sam smiled almost triumphantly.  “so we find some way to stop him, or,” sam paused and looked over at emily.  “we take her and go.” “we can’t leave this unfinished sam.  i won’t leave her with the fear that her father will find her.” “there aren’t many other alternatives dean,” sam snapped.  he looked over at emily.  she moved when he snapped but she didn’t wake up.  “what else can we do,” he whispered. dean sighed and looked down.  he ran his hands through his hair and closed his eyes.  “i don’t know,” he said simply.  “let me think on it.”  dean lay down on the floor with the pillow between the two beds.  sam lay down on the floor just outside the bathroom, since his bed was now covered in blood from emily. “i’ll stay awake for a while and make sure no one gets in.  i’ll wake you up in a few hours and you can watch her,” sam said softly.  he heard no response from his brother.  “dean,” he whispered.  sam sat up and looked over at dean to find him already asleep.  “great,” he sighed laying his head back down on the pillow. sam tried his best to stay awake but eventually sleep took him.  dean woke late that night, or early in the morning whichever way you choose to look at it.  he heard movement and it woke him.  dean sat up rubbing his eyes.  he got up just in time to see emily leaving the room.  dean stood and walked behind her silently.  dean wasn’t sure if she was awake or not.  so he followed behind her as quietly as he could.  she walked slowly, gracefully.  dean took note of that.  he followed her out into the parking lot, down the street, through the town, past the cemetery, and all the way back to her house.  he wanted to stop her but wasn’t sure what she was doing. dean watched her walk down into the cellar and was about to follow her when someone grabbed his arm.  dean jumped and was about to punch whoever took his arm then he realized it was sam.  “damn it sam,” he whispered.  “what the hell are you doing here,” he asked. “you woke me up,” sam answered simply.  “what do you think she’s doing here,” he asked.  almost as if on cue they heard a scream from inside the house.  the boys looked to the house then at each other and they ran in.  dean got down in the cellar first and when he got down there he stopped dead, causing sam to run into him.  he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.  emily stood staring at her father.  he was against the wall across the room.  it seemed as though he couldn’t move and he looked to be in a great deal of pain. “emily, baby what are you doing,” he asked quietly.  “i just wanted us to be a family again.”  that only seemed to make emily angrier and a large gash appeared across his face. “emily stop that,” dean called to her.  she turned her head towards dean and another gash appeared across her father’s chest.  “emily stop,” he said softly. “sam said you couldn’t,” she whispered.  “sam said it was wrong.  sam said that you couldn’t do it,” she whispered.  there was darkness in her eyes, they were innocent and pure yet if one looked deep into them there was darkness there.  “i can,” she said simply.  she turned her head to face her father once more and when she looked in front of her she saw sam.  emily looked up and screamed sending sam flying across the room.  he was shot straight into the room she had been in and the door slammed shut. dean could hear sam pounding on the door.  the room was air tight, if sam kept pounding on the door and shouting the way he was he would quickly use up all the oxygen.  dean knew this.  dean ran to emily and grabbed her arm, turning her to face him.  “emily stop it,” he shouted.  she got scared and dean went flying away from her.  emily looked back at her father and she walked over to the table.  it held all sorts of needles with different things in them.  she looked down at the table then over at her father.  emily wasn’t a killer and dean knew that.  dean got up and walked over to her.  he stood behind her and turned her to face him.  he knew what emily was going to do but he couldn’t turn her into a killer.  she was too pure and he didn’t want to damage that.  dean stood there for a moment and pulled the gun he had with him out of the back of his belt.  he looked down at her, staring into the girl’s frightened, innocent eyes.  dean raised the gun; his hand was shaking for the first time since he was a kid.  he looked down at emily.  “i’m sorry,” he whispered then he pulled the trigger.  as soon as he did the pounding in the room stopped and the door opened.  sam stood there and stared.  he looked at dean holding the gun over emily’s shoulder then he looked at her father who lay dead on the floor across the room.  “i couldn’t make you what i am,” he said quietly.  after a moment dean put the gun away and tucked emily’s hair behind her ear.  “you don’t have to worry anymore,” he whispered. sam stared at dean.  his brother just killed a human being.  he was a murderer.  sam understood though, he knew dean had to do what he did because it was better for dean to be the killer than for emily to be a killer.  sam walked up to him and looked from emily to dean as dean wrapped his arms around the girl’s small fragile form.  dean looked over at his brother and sam swore he saw tears in dean’s eyes.  “she’s safe now,” sam whispered.  dean simply nodded. back at the hotel, emily was sleeping again and sam and dean were packing their things.  they planned on leaving during the night while emily was asleep.  dean looked over again as they were about to leave.  he watched her sleep and then he dropped his bag.  “we can’t leave her hear sam,” dean said softly.  “she’d be devastated and i can’t hurt her like that.  plus what are people going to think? she’s supposed to be dead and haunting that house.”  sam nodded and sat down on the end of the bed.“how far are we from pastor jim,” sam asked quietly, looking up at dean.  “couple days drive,” he said with a sigh.  dean nodded.  he walked over to emily and sat down on the edge of the bed next to her.  “emily,” he whispered tucking her hair behind her ear once more.  “emily.”  emily slowly opened her eyes and looked up at him.  “hey,” he said with a smile.  sam watched he was amazed to hear such tenderness from his brother.  “we gotta get goin,” he whispered.  “come on.”emily sat up and looked at him confused.  “i’m… i’m going… going with you,” she asked.dean nodded and smiled at her.  “for a little while yeah,” he answered.  she stood and dean put his arm around her to help her.  she was still weak and not quite awake yet.  the boys packed up the car and dean helped emily into the backseat.  then they got in, dean started up the car and they pulled out of the parking lot and tore off down the highway.  dean glanced through the mirror at emily who was looking out the window at the sky.  “emily,” he said quietly.  she looked over at him when he said her name.  “sam and i can’t keep you with us, you understand that right?  with what we do it would be too dangerous and i don’t want you to get hurt.”  she nodded slowly but something told dean she didn’t believe him.  “we’re going to leave you with a friend of ours all right.  he’ll take good care of you.”  dean paused and looked over at sam.  “sammy you should call him before we show up with a strange girl and leave,” he said with a laugh.  then dean looked in the mirror back at emily.  “his name’s pastor jim, well his name’s just jim, that’s not the point,” dean said before he started rambling.  “he’ll take care of you.  we’ll keep in touch, let him know where we are from time to time so you don’t get worried all right.  he’s a good guy and knows how to protect you from the things that might hurt you.”  again emily nodded but dean could tell she didn’t want him to leave.after that the drive was silent.  the finally got to pastor jim’s church and dean and sam walked in with emily.  it was fairly empty and dean smiled when he saw jim.  “hey old man,” he said with a smile.“i was shocked when you called sam,” he said with a smile.  “wow, you boys are growing up.” “well one of us obviously ate more vegetables,” dean said pointing to sam who was a good three inches taller than him.  dean laughed and looked down at the girl who was all but hiding behind him.  “jim, this is emily,” he said moving emily in front of him.  she backed away from jim and dean couldn’t figure out why she was so scared.  then he remembered what her father told her.  he sighed and looked at sam.  “sammy watch her there’s some things i need to explain to jim.”  sam nodded and jim and dean walked off.  “emily’s special,” he said quietly.  “kinda off.” “yeah, i got that,” jim said with a laugh glancing back at sam and emily.  they were sitting in a pew and she was curled up with her head on sam’s lap. dean laughed when he saw it.  “that’s the first time she hasn’t been completely terrified of sam,” dean said quietly.  “her mother, she uhhh… it was uhh… it was the same demon that killed-” “mary,” jim said finishing dean’s sentence for him. “yeah,” dean said looking down.  “anyway, her dad didn’t take it too well, not that anyone would but uhh… he blamed her.  spent the rest of her life trying to figure out what she did or what he connection was with it.  sam and i found her about a week ago in the cellar of her burned down house.  she had been asleep in that room for three years.  everyone thought she was dead.  anyway, umm… her father died in the second fire,” dean lied.  “she’s afraid of you and most likely this place because her father told her she was the devil’s child.” “oh,” jim said looking over at them again.  “i see.” “yeah, so it might take some getting used to but ya know, she’ll be fine.  just keep her away from anything that could possibly be dangerous for a while."  jim looked at him with a questioning look.  “oh, yeah, she can move things with her mind.  the first time she got scared she locked herself in the bathroom…. without locking the door,” dean said with a smile.  “but really, jim she’s harmless.  she just gets scared easily and with what her father did to her i don’t blame her.”  dean sighed and looked back at his brother and emily.  “keep her safe.  set up some place for her to hide, or something if someone comes for you.  not that i’m saying anyone would but you know, your connection with us and dad, you never know.  just… just make sure she’s safe.  i promised her she’d be safe here.” jim nodded and the two walked back to sam and emily.  emily sat up and looked up at jim with fear in her eyes.  dean sat next to her.  “em, remember what i said about your father?  he lied to you, you are not the devil’s child.  and jim will take good care of you.” jim smiled at her and offered her his hand. “its nice to meet you emily. now, lets go see what clothes we have stashed away for you.  i’m sure they’ll be better than his,” he said looking at dean.  emily smiled and actually laughed.  she stood and walked with jim back towards the back of the church.  dean and sam stood and were walking out of the church. “dean,” a small girl’s voice called.  dean turned around and emily walked up to him.  “you’ll find your daddy,” she whispered to him, with a smile on her face. dean smiled and wrote his cell phone number down on a piece of paper.  “here, you hold on to this and anytime you want to talk to me you call all right.  i can’t guarantee i’ll answer right then but i will call you back all right?”  emily nodded and walked back to pastor jim.  then sam and dean walked out of the church to continue their seemingly never-ending search to find their father.  “she’ll be fine,” dean said more to himself than to sam as they got in the car and tore down the highway onto their next mission.
