in 1936, the thakral's enterprising spirit led them to japan, where they continued to focus on the family's core business - textiles. later, the group ventured into several other countries, including singapore and china in the 1950s and 1960s. at a time when the strategy of regionalisation was still at a planning stage for most companies, the thakral family had already made inroads into foreign lands, which would later pave the way for the group's growth and diversification.



 



in 1973, thakral brothers started to support the group's diversification from the textile business into consumer electronics.  the group's turning point came in 1974, when ventured into consumer electronics in china, building on the network that was laid in the 1960s.  this business has continued to grow and, today,  the group's consumer electronics business in china contributes substantially to the group's turnover.  
the group's future growth will hinge on selective expansion of their core businesses in the 
                      international arena. 

                      through entrepreneurial vision and foresight, good financial acumen, and an uncompromising standard of business integrity, the group has laid the foundation for its next phase of growth.
