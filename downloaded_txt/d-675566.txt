card management
card management is available for consumer visa debit cardholders through boc mobile, our personal mobile banking app. card management gives you total debit card control, helping to protect your account from fraud. card management allows you to turn your debit card "on" or "off" anytime. when your debit card is turned “off", it will be completely inactive. all you need to do is turn it “on” when you’re ready to use it. you can also add travel plans, define geographic areas where your card can be used, set dollar limits and restrict purchases by type of merchant, which gives you complete control over how your debit card is used. if you are not enrolled in online banking, you will be required to enroll in online banking and download the mobile banking app.
