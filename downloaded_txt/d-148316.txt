bad, inasmuch as the left minor crochet is of no utility
              in a minor right oblique refused, nor in a full front
              unopposed by the major oblique echeloned.

12082. when
                    did steinitz become world champion?
bartlomiej macieja (lasek, poland) refers to the
                  feature articles early
uses














































                    of world chess champion and world
chess














































                    championship rules and draws attention to a
                  further text, published a few days before the first
                  steinitz v lasker match began. page 24
                  of the new york times, 11 march 1894 stated:

for 26 years the veteran has successfully defended
                    the championship of the world.

also:

if a man who has held the worlds championship for
                    26 years accepts a challenge for a match which
                    promises to him less remuneration than matches he
                    contested before, he deserves some praise.

the illustrated article was also published, with due
                  credit, on page 3 of the montreal daily witness,
                  13 march 1894.
nineteenth-century references to the duration of
                  steinitzs tenure are always welcome, regardless of
                  the view adopted.


12083.
                    tournament champion
shortly before the start of the carlsbad, 1907
                  tournament, emanuel lasker wrote on page 10 of the new
                  york evening post, 7 august 1907:

the only notable absentee is dr tarrasch, who has
                    been hailed as tournament champion since he won
                    the champions tournament at ostend. what title
                    will be conferred on the winner of this tournament
                    [carlsbad] is rather puzzling at present.
as the list of entries includes all those who
                    played in the champions tournament, with the
                    exception of dr tarrasch, and includes maróczy and
                    many of the ingenious young players who are coming
                    to the front, the carlsbad tournament must be
                    considered to be of the same class as that of
                    ostend, and it seems illogical to award the title of
                    champion to the winner of one tournament and
                    withhold it from the winner of the other.



12084.
                    cohn v chigorin
many books have the game between e. cohn and
                  chigorin, carlsbad, 1907, for which white shared the
                  second brilliancy prize. much has been written about
                  11 f4, a move upon which emanuel lasker remarked:

mr cohn frankly admitted that he did not see that
                    he would lose a pawn by this move. that it turns out
                    a sacrifice, and not a loss, is more good luck
                    than good management.

lasker gave the game on page 9 of 12 october 1907
                  edition of the new york evening post, and his
                  comments about the irregular opening are noteworthy:
1 d4 nf6 2 c4 d6 3 nc3 nbd7 4 e4


players like chigorin undoubtedly dread the usual
                    routine of the queens pawn opening, because of the
                    difficulty which, as black, they must experience
                    before they can hope to attain any kind of attack or
                    superiority. by some curious process of reasoning
                    they resort to outlandish manoeuvres, hoping that
                    something beneficial might turn up, or that
                    irregularity may help originality. and so this
                    position arises, where white has freedom and black
                    confinement. and this at no cost to white of
                    material or weakness on the right, left or centre of
                    the board. conceding such an advantage, the result
                    is inevitable against correct play. the queens pawn
                    opening is certainly very strong for white, as
                    indeed are many other openings. but the philosophy
                    which induces a player with the black pieces to hope
                    to win with moves which it is impossible to conceive
                    are the best available only increases the inherent
                    difficulties that have to be contended against.



12085.
                    mexico
is there a reader in mexico who has access to
                  archival materials of the country and who would be
                  prepared to undertake some chess research on behalf of
                  a c.n. correspondent?


12086.
                    anti-turton

white to move
1 d4 would be met by 1...qe2, and white therefore
                  deployed the anti-turton
                  motif with 1 rd2. a correspondent gave this position
                  (lucarelli v carra, bologna, 1932 or 1933) in c.n.
                  681, but further particulars (and most notably the
                  full game-score) have not been traced. the two
                  surnames can be found in italian chess literature of
                  about a century ago (often, in the second case, with
                  the spelling carrà), but when was the position, if not
                  the full game, first seen in print?
jens askgaard (køge, denmark) writes:

the position from the game lucarelli-carra
                      appears on page 109 of schackkavalkad by
                      kurt richter (stockholm, 1949), translated from
                      the original kurzgeschichten um schachfiguren
                      (berlin, 1947):

the date is given as 1933. instead of black
                      resigning after 1 rd2 rxd2 2 d4 qe2 3 bc1, the
                      book says that white won easily thanks to his
                      strong passed pawn on h6.
i would add that 2...qe2 is a losing mistake for
                      black. instead, he could have played the
                      anti-anti-turton move 2...rf2, or 2...bh2, which
                      my computer suggests as the best move.

the position was on page 101 of the 1947 original
                  edition. had richter already used it elsewhere?


12087.
                    ordinal numbers (c.n. 12033)

c.n. 12033 asked when and where the practice arose of
                  referring to world chess champions with ordinal
                  numbers.
from dmitriy komendenko (st petersburg, russia):

in soviet sources i have found no instances of
                      botvinnik being called the sixth world champion
                      during his first term (1948-51), although quite
                      often he was called the first soviet champion.
                      the description sixth world champion can be
                      found in articles published in 1951 in advance of
                      his match against bronstein, one example being a
                      summary of the history of the chess matches on
                      page 5 of the 15 march 1951 edition of the
                      newspaper советский спорт:

frequent use of ordinal numbers seems to have
                      begun with smyslov. for instance, in an article on
                      page 31 of the 16/1957 issue of огонёк
                      flohr wrote, smyslov wants to be the seventh
                      champion of the world in chess history.



other examples from 1957 can be quoted, such as
                      the 19/1957 edition of огонёк, page 31,
                      where the writer, again flohr, called for three
                      times hurrah to celebrate the new, seventh world
                      champion:



starting with tal, the practice became
                      increasingly common. on page 3 of советский
                    спорт, 11 may 1960 an article by gideon
                      ståhlberg, who was the chief arbiter of that
                      years title match, was headed the eighth world
                      champion:

a production by the central studio for
                      documentary film (цсдф) had the same
                        title with reference to tal. the tradition
                      had been established and continued with petrosian,
                      spassky, fischer, etc.



12088.
                    robert hübner (1948-2025)
the late robert hübners great strength as a player
                  and analyst should not cause his legacy as a chess
                  historian and critic to be overlooked. the c.n. search
                  window can be used to locate a number of items which
                  refer to his forensic skills.


12089. the
                    writings of robert hübner
in his chessbase two
knights














































                    talk conversation with arne kähler on 17
                  january 2025, johannes fischer described hübner as an
                  absolutely brilliant writer and expressed
                  astonishment that so little of his output has appeared
                  in english.

                    keres v alexander

this photograph of paul keres and c.h.od. alexander
                  is reproduced courtesy of the hulton archive. it was
                  taken during hastings, 1954-55, but the board position
                  is unrelated to their game in the tournament.


12091.
                    staunton and saint-amant
as cited in c.n. 8134, g.h. diggles review of the














































                    kings of chess by william














































                    hartston noted the inclusion of a cartoon
                  depicting stauntons final victory over saint-amant,
                  with his supporters singing the national anthem in the
                  background.
dominique thimognier (fondettes, france) draws
                  attention to the cartoons appearance on page 151 of les














































                    cahiers de lechiquier français, issue 49,
                  september-october 1935:

our correspondent adds:

la revue caricaturale published the work
                      of major french caricaturists, including the
                      celebrated honoré daumier. the chess cartoon, by
                      charles vernier, appeared in the 5 january 1844
                      edition. it is shown on the bordeaux website séléné,
                      although with a notice which appears incorrect
                      regarding the place of first publication (not
                      bordeaux but paris).

                    howard l. dolde

source: the conclusion of chernevs chess corner on
                  page 237 of chess review, august 1952.
such presentation of quotes, lacking any context
                  (e.g. capablancas age at the time, and whether the
                  words were written or spoken), was a trait of past
                  chess writers, even good ones. today, the absence of a
                  source leaves any writer open to scepticism.
capablancas remark was discussed on pages 85-86 of
                  our 1989 monograph, as well as in c.n.s 6172 and 9630.
                  below is the full (faint) column in which it first
                  appeared, on page 8 of the sixth section of the pittsburgh

the columnist, who focussed very much on chess
                  problems, was howard louis dolde (1884-1943).
from page 6 of the pittsburgh post-gazette, 7
                  september 1943:

we note too that the previous day, page 17 of the
                  newspaper had referred to a coroners report on the
                  cause of death:

addition on 23 january 2025:
courtesy of the cleveland public library, below is an
                  extract from page 82 of the april 1910 american
                    chess bulletin:




12093.
                    the death of t.w. barnes
john townsend (wokingham, england) writes:

thomas wilson barnes had the best record of any
                      of the british players against morphy in offhand
                      games. born in ireland about 1825 (source: 1871
                      census), he qualified as a barrister at the middle
                      temple, but was non-practising for a number of
                      years.
like deschapelles, as well as being an
                      exceptionally strong chessplayer he excelled at
                      whist. when barnes led trumps, the game was over,
                      said an obituary.
the same obituary (whist jottings, westminster














































                    papers, 1 september 1874, pages 99-100) described
                      in detail the symptoms of his last illness:

his illness has been a long and painful one.
                      this time last year he weighed 16 stones; he went
                      abroad and his strength seemed suddenly to leave
                      him. with difficulty he got into a cab. he
                      gradually wasted away, until he became 7 st. 8
                      lb., and this was the last time he was weighed
                      (two months since), and he was certainly much less
                      weight at the last. physicians were in vain. no
                      one really knows the cause of his death; some have
                      suspected a cancer in the stomach, and,
                      unfortunately, he would not give permission to
                      have a post mortem, so that the real cause will
                      remain a matter of surmise. our impression is that
                      he died from banting. from being an enormous
                      eater he suddenly stopped his food, taking meat
                      only once a week; and soon, from want of use, his
                      stomach refused to fulfil its functions. he died

a transcript of barnes death certificate
                      follows:

the cause of death, malignant disease of the
                      stomach some months certified, seems, to a
                      medical layman such as myself, to account for the
                      symptoms of rapid weight loss which have been
                      alleged by some to be the result of banting.
the calendar of wills and administrations
                      (dublin) for the year 1874 contains the following
                      entry:

barnes thomas wilson
                      effects under £5,000
                      15 october
                      the will of thomas wilson barnes late of middle

                      barrister-at-law deceased who died 13 august 1874
                      at 68 cambridge street was proved at the principal
                      registry by the oaths of reverend samuel simpson

                      alexander duke simpson of belfast captain 13th
                      foot two of the executors.

although there is the above entry in the
                      calendar, the actual will has not survived, owing
                      to a fire in dublin in 1922.
for some reason, the date of death given above
                      is one week earlier than that contained in the
                      death certificate.
barnes was buried in brompton cemetery on 25
                      august 1874. source: the royal

                    s.s. boden
john townsend also provides some random notes on the
                  life of s.s. boden:

samuel standidge boden was born on 4 may 1826
                      at west retford, nottinghamshire. although some
                      sources, including the oxford companion to
                    chess, have specified east retford, the place of
                      birth is clear in his baptism entry in the
                      register of the independent chapel at chapel gate,
                      east retford (source: national archives, rg 4
                      /3217, folio 7):

samuel standidge, son of james and mary frances
                      boden, was born 4th of may 1826 in the parish of
                      west retford, and baptized july 27th in the same
                      year. jas. boden.

the chapel was nonconformist, and the
                      officiating minister was his father, james boden,
                      whose father, in turn, james boden, was a
                      well-known congregationalist minister at sheffield
                      and elsewhere.
james boden junior was baptized on 28 august
                      1791 at hanley tabernacle, staffordshire, an
                      independent chapel (national archives, rg 4/1871).
                      he preached at retford for a few years before
                      moving with his work, and the 1841 census shows
                      him as an independent minister, together with his
                      family, including the 14-year-old samuel, at
                      riding fields, beverley (national archives, ho
                      107 1229/43, page 44).

later that year, james boden senior died. his
                      will styled him reverend james boden, minister of
                      the gospel, of sheffield (national archives, prob
                      11/1953/196). james boden junior was named as a
                      legatee, but not the future chessplayer, samuel,
                      who was a grandson.

the loss at chesterfield of charlotte boden,
                      widow of the elder james, followed on quickly in
                      1843. james boden junior, father of samuel, had
                      lost both parents within two years. during 1843
                      and 1844, he was mentioned a few times in the
                      local press in connection with a chapel in
                      beverley and with the mechanics institute. the
                      last reference i have to his duties as a minister
                      in beverley is a document noted in the catalogue
                      of the archives at hull history centre, l
                      dcfs/6/2/2/59/3: resolutions concerning the
                      employment of mr boden at lairgate chapel during

                      item which i have not examined.
the hull advertiser, 24 november 1843,
                      page 4, carried a news item about the mechanics
                      institute, beverley, in which he is recorded as
                      having proposed a vote of thanks. similarly, there
                      is a reference to him in the hull advertiser,
                      8 march 1844, page 3, when he was reported as
                      having delivered a lecture on magnetism to the
                      beverley and east riding mechanics institute, of
                      which he was one of the vice-presidents.
                      thereafter, i have no more information about james
                      boden until his death in 1851.
his wife, mary frances boden, moved to hull, her
                      native town, with or without her husband. rev.
                      william wayte, writing in the bcm
                      (february 1882, page 56), affirmed samuel bodens
                      association with hull:

before he came to london, mr boden was known as
                      the strongest player of the hull chess club;

some chess writers erroneously gave hull as
                      bodens birthplace.
an obituary of samuel boden in the chess
                    players chronicle (18 january 1882, page 31)
                      notes that he started life as a railway clerk and
                      it later makes the following observation:

on coming into some property, through the death
                      of a relative, he devoted himself to art. this
                      necessarily left him but little time for chess and
                      its practice.

the westminster papers (1 september
                      1876, page 89) states:

about 27 years ago there came to london from
                      hull a young gentleman, then 25 years of age,
                      whose immediate destiny was a desk in the offices
                      of the south eastern railway at nine elms.

there seems to be an inconsistency in this last
                      remark, since nine elms was in the south western
                      railway company. a document noted in the catalogue
                      of the national archives, rail 411/665, offers the
                      possibility of some information concerning bodens
                      railway career among records of the staff of nine
                      elms. the document has not yet been examined.
later in the westminster papers article,
                      it is asserted that the death of a distant
                      relative some years ago enabled him to
                      relinquish railway accounting.
the known sources of his inheritances through
                      the deaths of relatives were twofold. firstly, his
                      maternal grandfather, john thornton, a gentleman,
                      died in hull in 1845, leaving a will which was
                      written on 20 august 1844, a codicil being added
                      on 29 july 1845, with probate granted on 28 august
                      1845 (national archives, prob 11/2027/205). the
                      dwelling house at the time of the testators
                      decease was given to his daughter (bodens mother)
                      during her life:

 ... upon trust to permit my said daughter mary
                      frances boden to have the use and enjoyment
                      thereof during her life exclusively of her present
                      or any future husband and without being in any
                      manner subject to his debts control interference
                      and in all respects as if she was a feme sole
                      and after her decease i direct the same to sink
                      into and be considered as part of my residuary
                      personal estate and to be applied and disposed of
                      accordingly ...

she received a lifetime interest in other
                      properties. the will mentions property in hull,
                      including in albion street and storey street. s.s.
                      boden was not one of the biggest winners from this
                      will, but he stood to benefit in the long term
                      through his mother, whom, in the event, he
                      outlived by only three years. in addition, a trust
                      fund was set up for the benefit of his mother and
                      her children, and, more specifically, he was given
                      a lump sum of £400 at the age of 21:

... upon trust to pay thereout to each of the
                      sons of my said daughter mary frances boden
                      (including the said john thornton boden and edward
                      boden) who may have attained the age of 21 years
                      or as and when they shall respectively attain that
                      age the sum of four hundred pounds ...

the date of bodens coming of age was 4 may
                      1847, but it is open to question whether he gave
                      up his alleged job as a railway employee shortly
                      after coming of age.
the second known inheritance came not from a
                      distant relative, but from his father. the
                      following facts are taken from his death
                      certificate (general register office, deaths,
                      december quarter 1851, shoreditch, vol. 2, page
                      327). james boden died on 8 december 1851 at 11
                      albert place, shepherdess walk, hoxton new town
                      (middlesex); male, 62 years, gentleman; cause of
                      death: typhoid fever peritonitis pleuritis
                      pneumonia gangrine, 24 days certified; informant
                      george booth, present at the death, of the same
                      address; registered 10 december 1851.

george booth was already living at 11 albert
                      place on 31 march 1851, the day of the 1851
                      census, where he was described as a watch
                      finisher; aged 37 and born in the city of london,
                      he lived there with his wife, louisa, and two
                      children (national archives, ho 107/1535, page
                      number illegible). the nature of his relationship
                      with the deceased, james boden, is unknown.

james boden was buried at the church of st john
                      the baptist, hoxton, on 11 december, the
                      officiating minister, by whom the ceremony was
                      performed, being his own son, edward boden, of
                      huddersfield. the 1851 census finds edward boden
                      in huddersfield, described as born at retford,
                      aged 28, b.a. camb. vice-principal of the
                      collegiate school there (national archives, ho
                      107/2295, page 41). a minor discrepancy between
                      the age of 61 in the burial register and of 62 on
                      the death certificate is of no consequence.
the huddersfield chronicle (20 december
                      1851, page 8) reported that on thursday morning
                      last at the distribution of prizes at the
                      collegiate school the rev. mr boden was
                      unavoidably absent, having been called to ripon by
                      the bishop to take priests orders. it seems a
                      little odd that the report made no mention of his
                      having presided at his fathers burial, or,
                      indeed, of the death of a minister who was
                      formerly a widely-known figure in yorkshire church
                      circles. when james boden senior had died, there
                      had been an insertion in gentlemans magazine,
                      as there had been for his widow, charlotte boden.
james boden died without a valid will, and,
                      accordingly, letters of administration were
                      granted in the prerogative court of canterbury to
                      samuel s. boden, of thavies inn (source: indexes
                      to death duty registers, national archives,
                      ir27/60, folio 14). the assets of an intestate are
                      divided between the closest relatives according to
                      set rules; in this instance, one would expect the
                      widow to receive the lions share, with smaller
                      portions going to the several children. for those
                      requiring full details of the assets thus
                      inherited by boden the chessplayer, inspection of
                      the appropriate death duty register in ir 26 at
                      the national archives at kew should satisfy their
                      curiosity; the letters of administration will be
                      found in prob 6.
bodens residence for a number of years,
                      thavies inn, situated at holborn, was originally
                      used exclusively by lawyers, but by this time was
                      available as accommodation for anyone willing to
                      pay the going price. in fact, s.s. boden is to be
                      found there at the time of the 1851 census
                      (national archives, ho 107/1527, page 36). he
                      lived in a boarding house run by anne cocker, a
                      53-year-old single woman, born at hathersage,
                      derbyshire. through an error in enumeration,
                      bodens name has been recorded as samuel s. bax,
                      but other details make it obvious that it should
                      read samuel s. boden: he is described as a
                      boarder, unmarried, aged 24, a gentleman, born at
                      retford, notts.; above all, corroboration is
                      provided by the thavies inn which appears in
                      the indexes to death duty registers (see above);
                      moreover, boden was associated with thavies inn
                      during morphys time in england, viz.:

we have the pleasure this month of completing
                      the publication of the series of games contested
                      in 1858 between mr morphy and mr boden. the
                      following game, hitherto unpublished, was played
                      between these eminent masters, at mr bodens
                      chambers, in thavies inn, on the evening of 9
                      july 1858. the rev. s.w. earnshaw, to whom we are
                      indebted for it, was present on the occasion, and
                      recorded the moves.

(source: the westminster papers, 1 april
                      1876, page 241.)
 spare a thought for bodens father. what
                      happened to him? he became detached from his wife
                      and the rest of his family, and his death in 1851
                      was hushed up, suggesting that his family was not
                      proud of him. since he died in hoxton, my first
                      thought was that he may have spent some time in
                      the lunatic asylum at hoxton, but i have so far
                      found no evidence of that. he may have had a
                      change of career, a marital break-up, moved to
                      another area, become an insolvent debtor, or
                      become ill in some other way. various
                      possibilities remain open. 
g.a. macdonnell quotes boden as recalling when
                      he first met bird at the divan in the strand, in the














































                    knights and kings of chess, (london, 1894), page
                      44. that implies that boden had himself started to
                      visit there by 1846.
in 1847 hull hosted the anniversary of the
                      yorkshire chess association (chess players
                    chronicle, 1847, pages 159-164). in fact, two
                      bodens attended: mr boden, from settle,
                      presumably, john thornton boden, elder brother of
                      s.s. boden, and boden, by inference a hull
                      member, who is taken to be s.s. boden himself. he
                      won a game there from harrwitz, who was playing
                      blindfold and simultaneously, which earned him
                      this favourable comment from staunton:

 ... mr boden, one of the most promising players
                      of the northern clubs.

boden took a number of years to come to his best
                      as a player, his peak arriving in 1858. in 1851,
                      he won the london provincial tournament. he beat
                      rev. john owen convincingly in a match in 1858,
                      but his match play successes were otherwise
                      limited. his reputation seems to have exceeded his
                      actual achievements. morphys description of him
                      in 1858 as the strongest english player can be
                      valid only if one excludes löwenthal on the
                      grounds that he was not naturalized until 1866,
                      and staunton, because he had retired, since it
                      could be argued that both were stronger than boden
                      in 1858.
by the time of the 1861 census, he had moved to
                      57 pratt street in the parish of st pancras
                      (national archives, rg 9/116, page 64). here he
                      was a bachelor and lodger and described as an
                      artist (landscape). also living in st pancras at
                      that time was the irish master francis burden, who
                      for a time lodged with cecil de veres mother. the
                      two of them are both associated with having given
                      the young de vere instruction in chess, but it is
                      not known that boden ever lodged with mrs de vere,
                      and he probably coached de vere at the divan.
his later years were occupied primarily by art.
                      his whereabouts on the 1871 and 1881 censuses
                      remain to be discovered. he died on 13 january
                      1882, at 3 tavistock street, bedford square,
                      middlesex, described as artist (painter), his
                      age entered (incorrectly) as 56 (general register
                      office, deaths, march quarter 1882, st giles
                      district, volume 1b, page 453). his name was
                      entered incorrectly as samuel standridge boden,
                      instead of standidge. the cause of death was
                      enteric fever 20 days pneumonia 4 days certified
                      by charles elam f.r.c.p., the informant being
                      joseph wurgler, present at the death, of 3
                      tavistock street. in the 1881 census, joseph
                      wurgler was a swiss-born lodging house keeper,
                      living at that same address with his wife and
                      daughter (national archives, rg 11 325, page 15),
                      so he is taken to have been bodens landlord.
                      according to the national probate calendar,
                      bodens personal estate amounted to £2,628 2s.,
                      probate of his will being granted on 14 april to
                      the executors, his brother reverend edward boden
                      and the chessplayer thomas hewitt, a solicitor.

                    boston newspaper commented:

and although this was a bit of pleasantry, dr
                      lasker did say in all seriousness that where the
                      second player in almost any other opening might
                      hope for a win, it was good judgment in the ruy to
                      hope for a draw. the suggestion that the chess
                      world was waiting for some man who should begin an
                      exhaustive analysis of the ruy early enough in
                      life to complete it, he dismissed with a
                      deprecatory shrug. im afraid he would have to
                      continue it in the hereafter, he said.

                    simultaneous displays by lasker
by way of introduction to the now familiar
                  simultaneous game f.w. dunn v emanuel lasker, london,
                  21 january 1908, which began 1 e4 e5 2 nf3 nc6 3 bc4
                  nf6 4 ng5 d5 5 exd5 nd4, laskers column on page 7 of
                  the new york evening post, 28 march 1908
                  stated:

simultaneous chess, which has now become so
                    popular, both here and in europe, is capable of
                    furnishing entertainments and instruction to the
                    amateur chessplayer. but in order to make it so, it
                    is necessary that the single performer  usually a
                    master  should consider the interests of his
                    opponents, and instead of measuring his success by
                    the high score he can make, he should endeavor to
                    play all sorts of combinations, calculated to
                    exercise the ingenuity of his spectators. one should
                    not try to play perfect chess on such occasions,
                    for, to begin with, under the condition of play, one
                    cannot succeed in doing so and, on the other hand,
                    by introducing novelties that may lead to lively,
                    though perhaps unsound, attacks, one not only avoids
                    unduly prolonging the performance but also presents
                    to the spectators many interesting and exciting
                    positions. this sort of simultaneous chess also
                    appeals to the opposing players, who usually prefer
                    being defeated in a fair fight rather than being
                    gradually and dismally ground down by the proverbial
                    pawn plus.
dr laskers popularity as a simultaneous performer
                    is largely due to his following this method of
                    procedure. always endeavoring to make his
                    exhibitions both entertaining and instructive, he
                    rarely follows the orthodox lines of play, but by
                    varying at some point endeavors to create
                    interesting situations that shall throw his
                    opponents [sic] on his own resources, and
                    enable him to exercise his ingenuity in finding the
                    best reply.

                    the real paul morphy (c.n. 12018)

from john townsend (wokingham, england):

pages 268-272 of psychotherapist charles
                      hertans recent book the real paul morphy:
                    his life and chess games (alkmaar, 2024) contain
                      material about the staunton-morphy controversy.
                      for those needing a reminder, the controversy can
                      be seen as comprising the following phases in
                      1858:

1. morphy arrives in england and challenges
                        staunton to a match. the latter, who has retired
                        from match play, accepts, but points out that he
                        is under contract to produce an edition of
                        shakespeares works, and he needs time to brush
                        up on his game.
2. relations between the two belligerents
                        deteriorate through unfriendly exchanges in the
                        press and elsewhere.
3. at length, staunton withdraws from the
                        negotiations. relations continue to be bad and
                        never really improve.

i did not notice new information about the
                      controversy in this part of the book, or signs of
                      fresh research on the topic. much of the content
                      in those pages is concerned with the quoting of
                      contemporary reports and documents which have
                      appeared in print before. for good measure, the
                      author treats us to some colourful remarks of his
                      own which reveal a one-sided stance in favour of
                      morphy.

                      chess notes, going back to the 1980s, has included

                      g.h. diggle, frank skoff and kenneth whyld, and
                      the quartet of feature articles below includes
                      many lively exchanges:

                          to fiske.

the c.n. discussions have been conducted in an
                      editorially impartial and even-handed manner, but
                      it seems that even-handedness was not part of mr
                      hertans objectives. he refers to morphy sometimes
                      as paul, while the supposed villain of the piece
                      has to make do with staunton.
the following anti-staunton language and
                      sentiment is to be found:

page 268:

paul understandably doubted stauntons
                        intentions
... sucker punches received from staunton in
                        the press ...
... morphy shared his concern that staunton
                        would try to evade the match, and pin the blame
                        on paul ...

page 270:

... but staunton being staunton, he couldnt
                        resist taking more cheap shots at morphy in his
                        column ...
... his shoddy treatment of the american ...

page 271:

these actions were certainly petty and
                        ungracious on stauntons part


... the bitchy sniping of a humiliated
                        champion ...
... potshots at morphy ...
... rattled by stauntons antics ...
... his unseemly behavior ...

page 272:

... stauntons catty, distasteful behavior
                        ...
but stauntons defenders never threw in the
                        towel.

page 273:

howard staunton had a deeply flawed
                        personality.


this last remark is perhaps the most damning of
                      these criticisms and is stated with the same
                      certainty as if mr hertan had had staunton on the
                      psychiatrists (or psychotherapists) couch in his
                      consulting-room. it almost reaches the level of
                      conviction of dale brandreth, whom you quoted in attacks
                        on howard staunton:

 the fact is that the british have always had
                      their thing about morphy. they just cant seem
                      to accept that staunton was an unmitigated bastard
                      in his treatment of morphy because he knew damned
                      well he could never have made any decent showing
                      against him in a match.

reference is made by mr hertan to the old
                      criticism that staunton unfairly accused morphy of
                      not having the stakes for the match. the latter
                      was hurt by the comments. staunton had had
                      difficulties in the past with would-be match
                      opponents who could not readily muster the stakes,
                      an example being daniel harrwitz. he did not
                      invent the problem of morphys stakes. in his book
                    paul morphy the pride and sorrow of chess
                      (new york, 1976) david lawson devotes a chapter to
                      the subject of staunton and the stakes, which
                      reveals that morphys family, the intended source
                      of the stakes, strongly disapproved of a match for
                      money. it is only too clear from charles maurians
                      letter of 27 july 1858 to d.w. fiske that the
                      familys attitude most certainly was a problem
                      which seriously threatened the match. morphy had
                      kept from maurian the extent of this disapproval
                      and the extraordinary lengths the family was
                      prepared to go to, which maurian now revealed:

... they were ready to send some responsible
                      agent to london whose duty it would be to let mr
                      morphy know that he must either decline playing or
                      continuing the match or that he will be brought
                      home by force if necessary; that they were
                      determined to prevent a money match by all means.
                        (lawson, pages 120-121)

hinc illae lacrimae. clearly, this ruled out
                      the family as the supplier of the stakes. it left
                      poor maurian close to his wits end. fortunately,
                      he acted promptly and, in a change of plan,
                      secured the £500 from another source, the new
                      orleans chess club. he wrote again on 29 july 1858
                      with news that the amount had been raised. there
                      had been real uncertainty until maurians decisive
                      action. who can tell the exact time of arrival of
                      the funds? neither are we likely ever to know how
                      much intelligence, if any, about morphys family
                      difficulties reached stauntons ears. at the times
                      when he grumbled about morphys lack of stakes, it
                      is likely that the money was yet to appear or, at
                      least, as far as he was aware. staunton deserves
                      the benefit of the doubt here. his remarks are
                      likely to have been in response to a real
                      difficulty over stakes rather than a smear which
                      he had falsely concocted to discredit his young
                      adversary. morphys familys disapproval strongly
                      indicates that there was indeed a real problem
                      over the stakes.
edge wanted the chess world to believe that it
                      was staunton who asked for the stakes to be
                      reduced from £1,000 to £500, but it is much more
                      likely that any such request came from morphy, in
                      the light of the family circumstances alluded to
                      above. given a choice, morphy would certainly have
                      preferred no stakes at all (... reputation is
                    the only incentive i recognize).
another issue was stauntons contract with
                      routledge to produce an edition of shakespeare,
                      sometimes cited by his critics as an excuse for
                      not playing a match. one might have hoped that the
                      late chris ravilious had put this matter to bed
                      for good by his article in chess (december
                      1998, pages 32-33), in which he showed not only
                      that such a contract existed but also that it
                      contained specific penalty clauses for failure to
                      deliver parts of the work on time. later, the
                      contract appeared in print in tim hardings book,
                    eminent victorian chess players (jefferson,
                      2012), on pages 338-339.
our understanding of the character of the
                      degenerate f.m. edge, morphys associate, has
                      taken giant steps forwards in recent years, so it
                      is disappointing that such material has not been
                      drawn upon by mr hertan. edge certainly
                      contributed to the breakdown of negotiations for a
                      match. good relations between morphy and staunton
                      were needed if the former wanted a match, but edge
                      pulled in the opposite direction.
as events turned out, if there was ever going to
                      be a meeting of these two famous masters, it
                      needed to be at the birmingham tournament.
                      unfortunately, while staunton played in this
                      event, and did badly, morphy went to some lengths
                      to avoid such an encounter, even giving a phoney
                      excuse for his non-attendance. (see my
                      contribution in a
                        debate on staunton, morphy and edge.)
                      stauntons participation at birmingham answers the
                      frequent criticism, also raised by mr hertan, that
                      he was afraid to meet morphy: whether or not he
                      was matched against morphy in birmingham, he must
                      have known that it was likely he would lose there,
                      and he was not afraid of that; in the event, he
                      was beaten by löwenthal.
the chief problem with mr hertans coverage of
                      the staunton-morphy affair is that virtually all
                      of it could have been written 50 years ago.
it may be a small slip on page 273 to give frank
                      skoff the wrong uscf title (he had been president,
                      not director), but how could mr hertan offer, on
                      the same page, such an obviously incorrect
                      conclusion about the exchanges between skoff and
                      whyld? as i have observed elsewhere,
                      whyld emerged from the debate severely battered.
mr hertan ends that paragraph by writing one
                      thing which is true: that there are hundreds of
                      pages of c.n. material on staunton, morphy and
                      edge. the problem is that he shows no signs of
                      having read them.
