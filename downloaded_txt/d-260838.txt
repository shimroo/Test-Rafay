testimonials















“we visited about 6 local countertop fabricators in buffalo. we had the best experience at buffalo granite, price was on par with rest. brenda was extremely helpful and always answered all my questions. nicole was also very pleasant to deal with. the installers came today, they were very pleasant and knowledgeable. explained to me everything. all in all the final product is very nice and we are very happy! 5 stars all the way!”— rob m.“we recently worked buffalo granite and marble for our kitchen remodel. from picking out materials to installation, everyone was friendly and helpful. their showroom is extensive and we were able to find the perfect granite for us. they were always available to answer any questions i had throughout the process, even adding an extra countertop piece at the last minute! many people complain about the “seams” in their countertops and we can’t even see ours! i highly recommend this family owned business- you will not be sorry!”— cassandra b.“we are so happy with our countertops! chelsea was so helpful guiding us through the process from start to finish! she listened to the style that we were looking for in our new kitchen and bathroom and came up with options for us! they were a pleasure to work with! the counters are even more beautiful than i ever would have imagined! we highly buffalo granite and marble for any of your countertop needs!”— griffin h.
