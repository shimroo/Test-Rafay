book your experience



















we understand that families are under constant pressure – financial strain, a busy schedule, being spread out across the country, a lack of community, etc after having been in business since 1951, we are proud to have hosted thousands of families over the last 70 years and we are excited as we look into the future under new ownership and a new vision to see the moors become the premier resort and marina on kentucky lake.
