                                 nate is exceptional as a realtor and as a skilled tradesman, which meant that every house we saw i could trust him to let us know what was a concern and what was something easily fixed.  that peace of mind made it so much easier to purchase our home, and i'm so thankful we had nate there with us through the entire process!

                                 rob was just overall great! very helpful and was very easy to talk to! i may have just met him less than 2 weeks ago but i felt comfortable talking to him like i've known him longer! he was always available when i had any questions and he immediately had a great plan to help us try to get the most out of selling our home! i will definitely consider using him in the future once we start looking to buy another home!
