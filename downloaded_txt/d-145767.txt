www.tiffany.org -- an online fan club

dan tobias
production



 














tiffany.org is a fan site operated continuously since 1995 about the singer tiffany,
who rose to success in the late '80s as a teen pop star, and made a comeback in the new
millennium with a critically-acclaimed album,
and, yes, bared it all for playboy.
this is an unofficial fan site, not affiliated with or endorsed by
tiffany, her management, record labels, or tour promoters.
for that matter, this site has no connection with the jeweler tiffany & co., which has its
web site at www.tiffany.com (not tiffany.org like
this site!)

hot news!

tiffany's new cooking club! let's
food with tiffany!

tiffany's official site is up at www.tiffanytunes.com.  hopefully, she's got
permanent control of this address so it won't change again with some future change of management like it has a few times already.

read more about tiffany on wikipedia, the free encyclopedia,
and help improve the article too, since it's the encyclopedia anybody can edit (unless you're banned or blocked or
get on the wrong side of its ruling clique, or there's too much edit warring on the article so it gets protected...).
you can also follow tiffany on twitter (now with that coveted
	blue check mark!) or like
	her on facebook.
