				announcements
			














				presidents’ day office closure
			

				all texas comptroller of public accounts offices will be closed feb. 17 in observance of presidents’ day. our electronic services — including tools to file and pay texas taxes — will be available 24/7.
			
agency releases biennial revenue estimate (bre)
the bre for 2026-27 estimates the revenue texas can expect to receive during the next two-year budget period and forms the basis of the budget.
taxpayers affected by southern california wildfires
out-of-state taxpayers affected by wildfires and straight-line winds in southern california may be eligible for an extension to pay texas taxes. see our disaster relief information webpage for more information.

				beneficial owner information (boi) reports under federal corporate transparency act 
			

don't confuse boi reports with public information reports (pirs) or ownership information reports (oirs)
beginning jan. 1, 2024, the u.s. department of the treasury began accepting beneficial ownership information (boi) reports as required under the corporate transparency act. a boi report contains information about individuals who own or control companies doing business in the united states. boi reports should be filed with the treasury department's financial crimes enforcement network (fincen) through its online beneficial ownership secure system (boss). the reports cannot be filed through the comptroller's office or the texas secretary of state, and do not serve as a substitute for pirs or oirs. for more information on boi reports go to the treasury department's website: https://www.fincen.gov/boi. 


				franchise tax notices - january 2025 
			

form 05-211, texas notice of intent to forfeit right to transact business
if you receive this notice, you failed to meet franchise tax filing and/or payment requirements. 
        learn how to resolve this issue and ensure your franchise tax account is current. if your entity's annualized total revenue for the 2024 report year is at or below the no tax due threshold of $2,470,000, you are not required to file a report, but you still must file either a public information report or an ownership information report. see changes to no tax due reporting for 2024.


form 05-285, franchise tax annual report filing notice; or email
the comptroller's office sends a letter or an email to all franchise taxpayers as a reminder that may 15 is the due date for franchise tax reports, extension requests, payments and/or public or ownership information reports. see our franchise tax webpage for more information about franchise tax.


				qr codes on forms 
			

				connect easily to webfile using new qr codes on some of the comptroller's tax forms. 
			

				high call volume 
			

				shorter wait times occur from 8-10 a.m. and 4-5 p.m. please have your 11-digit taxpayer number ready when you call. for additional information, see call tips and peak schedule.
