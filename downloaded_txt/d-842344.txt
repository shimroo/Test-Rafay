we manufacture real "cast stone" made from crushed limestone and white cement, the closest product to real honed limestone possible. beware of imitators in the los angeles cast stone market who acid-wash regular precast concrete to imitate cast stone.

although our gfrc is a beautiful product, and comes in 10 colors and 5 textures, there is no comparison when compared to cast stone which has a warm limestone look and comes in 10 colors and 2 textures..

    advantages of green gfrc for green building

low toxicity raw materials: cement, sand, glass fibers natural 
      coloring pigments and water  ( we can also use 
      waterproofing additives)
durable, stain resistant, long lasting materials reduce replacement, 
      maintenance and repair  
our green gfrc is supplied integrally colored with standard textures to 
      eliminate voc's during painting  (our products come in 10 standard 
      integral colors)
non-combustible gfrc meets astm e136 
lightweight foam coated precast products use 80% less material than precast
      

we can also use recycled aggregates such as recycled concrete, recycled 
    water, and fly ash.
    to achieve our sanded finish, we use natural sand and water which is used 
    like sandpaper to remove the smooth cement surface and expose the 
    aggregates, we also re-use the by-product of
    this procedure (i.e. cement, sand water).
    we like green gfrc because it produces a very lightweight and durable material 
    that is easy to install. the end product is very strong and 
    may be installed as thin as 3/4" which is practically impossible to do with 
    any other concrete or cementitious material.

      green
      gfrc technology is considered environmentally friendly and very appealing 
      when considering green building alternatives. green does not only mean 
      environmentally friendly but also sustainability, the more a product will 
      last the more sustainable it is, also counting toward greenness are amount 
      of waste generated during the process, how much of the ingredients are 
      recycled material such as fly ash and how much maintenance will it need 
      during the life of the product.
in addition to being strong and lightweight, green gfrc also offer a greater 
  variety of option and finishing styles, another great advantage is that the 
  materials very strong and not brittle like concrete which allows us to 
  install 
  anywhere without much risk.
