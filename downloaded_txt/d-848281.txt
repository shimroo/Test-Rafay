50+ years of backcountry adventures!an unforgettable experience in the woods and waters of maine. about maine high adventure















maine high adventure offers exciting, fully-outfitted canoe treks within 4+ million acres of northern maine woods and waterways. each and every maine high adventure trek is custom designed to the attending group’s interests and skill level.  we have been providing life-long memories since 1971, first as a bsa national council program and more recently as part of katahdin area council, bsa.some reasons your unit should consider a maine high adventure experience!















mha is experienced



maine high adventure has outfitted treks from matagamon base since 1971. that’s 50 years of high adventure serving over 32,000 scouts!mha uses time-tested scouting skills: leave no trace---patrol method --- open fire cooking---youth led crews.



when you contact us, you will work directly with the mha director.we serve only 25 to 50 crews per season, which offers a more personal experience for you and your group. rather than being one of dozens of troops arriving or departing you may be the only crew – or one of just two or three.              a knowledgeable mha representative can meet with your group via zoom or in-person to present and discuss mha.















mha is personal



minimum stay is 6 days – there is no maximum.  the longer your trek, the more you can do!we don’t offer pre-planned trips.  every trek is custom-designed.  upon arrival at mha matagamon base, each crew will plan its own trek with the expert advice of our trip planner. you can choose arrival and departure days to suit your schedule.

although your trek will lead your crew into the vast backcountry of northern maine, your initial destination is our operations base - matagamon high adventure base which is located at the northeast corner of baxter state park on grand lake matagamon. see accompanying map for approximate driving times to matagamon base from the mid-atlantic and new england.
