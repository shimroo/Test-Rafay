history of six
 



									are we really the best physios in london? 								



									we’ve been doing this for a long time, probably the longest in london and it all started back in the 90’s in parsons green, where we still have a great clinic.




								



									our aim then and our aim now, to never, ever compromise on doing the very best for our patients.
								



									we’ve got some great spaces, in wonderful places and the most amazing team – trust us to get you back to where you need to be, and who knows even a little further forward!

about us 



don't treat, cure 



physiotherapy in london and the south since 1996
 



the c word: cureit’s funny how one word has sparked so much debate amongst our colleagues over the years. but for our patients, it’s simple: they want to be cured. that’s exactly what we aim for, every single time. and if that’s anatomically and physiologically impossible, we’ll go above and beyond to get you as close as humanly possible.this commitment has been our guiding principle in london for nearly 30 years, and in lindfield for over a decade. now, as we continue to expand beyond the city, we’re excited to welcome the team and patients of dorset into the six physio family. rest assured, whether you’re in the heart of london or the beautiful countryside, you can count on the same dedication and expertise.being good at what we do is ingrained in our dna – it’s our north star. the 8,400+ testimonials from our wonderful patients, more than any other physio clinic in the uk, reflect that trust.we’ll always focus on finding and treating the root cause of your problem, not just giving you a quick fix. rehabilitation is the key, helping you return to full function and understand your symptoms long after your time with us.so, whether you’re already part of the family or just joining us in dorset, keep the faith and continue the trust. we’re here to help, with the same passion and drive to cure that’s always defined us.

pelvic health 



pelvic floor muscles are an important group of muscles that provide cradle like support for the pelvic organs, as well as giving you control when you urinate. keeping these muscles strong is essential for both men and women: a great way to learn more is by having pelvic floor physiotherapy sessions.
