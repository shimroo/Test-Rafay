   our restaurant


 chicago prime steakhouse is the only family-owned prime steakhouse in the entire northwest suburbs nestled in an ocean of national chain restaurants. we pride ourselves on the personal touch and outstanding cuts of meat, seafood, chops and feature a cigar friendly outdoor covered patio. service and quality are the name of the game and we take our relationships in the community seriously. reservations are strongly encouraged. the lounge and patio feature specials and promotions almost daily so feel free to visit us after a golf game or just as casual as you are. dress code is casual so no stuffy pretense here, just bring a smile and have some fun!
