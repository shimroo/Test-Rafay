wooden signs in various timbers
at the sign maker workshops in devon, we have a barn stocked with a wide range of timber in various types and thicknesses, where we craft wooden sign blanks. from small house signs to large business signage, we can create them all.
oak is our most popular choice for wooden signs, and we believe it to be the most beautiful timber. however, sapele is also a favorite for its rich, deep red hue, and iroko is valued for its high oil content, which makes it low-maintenance.
in addition, we offer chestnut, cherry, red grandis & opepe,red cedar and douglas fir - the last two are both excellent choices for outdoor signs which needs little care. red cedar is known for its natural resistance to decay and beautiful grain, while douglas fir provides strength and durability for larger signs.





slate, granite & stone
at the sign maker, we create custom slate house signs to suit your unique preferences. you have complete control over the size, with slate options ranging from 10mm to 75mm in thickness. we'll adjust the letter size to perfectly complement your sign. choose from hundreds of fonts and a wide array of letter colors, with white and silver being popular choices. we can also incorporate images and decorative borders.
in addition to standard slate, we offer a selection of other premium stone:

green lakeland slate: offers a unique and distinctive look.
rainbow sandstone: showcases a vibrant and colorful appearance.
purbeck stone: provides a classic and elegant touch.
granite: available in various colours and thicknesses, suitable for house signs, business signage, and memorials.






entrance signs - signs with posts
when looking for a sign with the 'wow' factor, entrance signs are hard to beat. an entrance sign is crucial, not only because it identifies a property but also because it says a lot about your home or business. your entrance sign must look the part, as people driving past will unknowingly judge you or your business based on its appearance.
we craft our entrance signs typically from wood, although we have also created some striking stone entrance signs. whether you choose wood or stone, our entrance signs are designed to make a lasting impression and effectively represent your property.





black and white signs
black and white signs have surged in popularity due to their timeless appeal, versatility, and high visibility. to help you explore the many options available, we have created this dedicated page showcasing a wide range of black and white sign in a range of materials.
one of the key reasons for their popularity is their exceptional readability. studies show that white lettering on a black background ranks among the most visible colour combinations, making it an excellent choice for signage. similarly, black text on a white background is close behind on visability. whether you're looking for a classic or modern custom-designed black and white sign, this page will guide you through the best options.





painted wooden signs
at the sign maker, we are experiencing a revival in our painted wood signs which blend traditional craftsmanship with modern look. in contrast to the prevalence of vinyl signage, painted wood signs bring a distinct warmth and character. we use various timbers for the painted wooden sign, including oak, sapele, and tricoya (a waterproof wood-based board), and paint them with most ral colours plus farrow and ball matches. these signs are perfect as double-sided hanging signs, house signs, and entrance signs on posts.
to ensure lasting beauty and durability, we use a durable polyurethane paint mixed with a hardener which provides exceptional protection against the elements.





metal signs - name plates
we offer a diverse range of metal signs suitable for all locations. for coastal areas, our toughprint signs are perfect, made from encapsulated aluminium for extra durability. if you prefer signs with raised lettering, we provide options in etched zinc, cast iron, brass, bronze, and aluminium, as well as cost-effective embossed aluminium.
additionally, we offer engraved metal plaques in brass, coloured aluminium, and stainless steel. whether you need robust signs for harsh environments or elegant plaques for a refined look, we have the ideal solution for you.





sign boards
we craft a range of sign boards made from pvc, aluminium composite, aluminium, painted tricoya, fibreglass, and clear acrylic. our custom sign boards are particularly popular with businesses and commercial properties because we design them with their environment in mind, ensuring they last as long as possible.
we offer aluminium, composite, and pvc boards suitable for full-color printed vinyl or cut vinyl lettering. these boards are available with or without posts and are also ideal for information boards. suitable for both indoor and outdoor use, our signboards provide excellent value and durability.





slate & granite memorials
at the sign maker, we offer a fantastic range of stone memorials. from granite and slate memorial wedges to stone-like corian tablets, we provide options that allow you to honour your loved one meaningfully. our selection includes slate, granite, and other stone memorials, memorial tablets, and wedges. we offer a large range of slate and granite in various sizes, thicknesses, and colours.  our skilled craftsmen & designers work closely with you to create a high-quality stone memorial exactly as you envision.





engraved memorial plaques
at the sign maker, we offer a variety of materials for our engraved memorial plaques. brass, the traditional choice for memorials and signs, provides a classic look but requires some maintenance. for a lower-maintenance option, we offer exterior-grade flexible acrylic, which is weatherproof and uv resistant, as well as stainless steel, known for its durability and long-lasting qualities. each material has its own unique appearance, and by exploring our options, you're sure to find something that suits your needs.
these memorial plaques can be used for a range of purposes, including bench plaques, grave markers, or even as simple plaques mounted on tree stakes.





toughprint signs and memorials
you won't get tougher than our tough print signs and memorials! designed to last and weather the storms (literally), our tough print signage is moisture, abrasion, scratch, and fade-resistant. these plaques and signs can even be used in very harsh weather conditions - including by the sea.
these pieces can include small text, photos and printed designs. as well as being very durable, they are also resistant to graffiti and acids.





gifts and presents
you probably would not think of coming to the sign maker for gifts. however we have a range of thoughtful, sustainable presents and handcrafted gifts to be cherished for a lifetime, we're sure you'll find the right fit for any occasion. here are just a few of the pages:-

wooden house signs
discover our high-quality wooden house signs designed to fit all budgets. choose from various timbers, sizes, fonts, and images to create your perfect wooden sign. our top three timber choices are oak, chestnut, and iroko, each offering unique benefits:- oak: renowned for its beauty, durability, strength, and weight. chestnut: often called "poor man's oak," we view chestnut as an excellent alternative. iroko: a sustainable hardwood is akin to teak and is known for its extreme density, durability, and stability alternative.





farm and estate signs
at the sign maker we create custom farm and estate signs that add a touch of distinction to your property. from classic oak to timeless slate, from traditional painted wood to modern fibreglass, we offer a wide variety of materials and styles to suit your taste and budget. 
our skilled craftsmen create signs built to withstand the elements, ensuring lasting beauty for years to come.
our designers will work with you to create signs that reflect your property, incorporating logos, fonts, and imagery to create the signage that is perfect for you.





engraved plaques
when thinking about engraved plaques, brass often comes to mind. while brass is a fantastic material for plaques and signs, it does require regular polishing. at the sign maker, our engraving workshop offers many other materials for engraved plaques and signs. for example, stone-like corian plaques are maintenance-free and highly durable. we also use acrylic laminate in various colours, black aluminium, and eco-friendly paperstone, all suitable for outdoor use.
all our engraved plaques are of the highest quality.

slate is an excellent choice for memorials due to its natural beauty and durability. we have slate from 12 mm to 75 mm thick, which can be cut to any size. the lettering is engraved into the slate and then painted in various colours. you can choose your font and images can be included.
holes can be drilled for mounting the slate memorial onto a posts or wall.
