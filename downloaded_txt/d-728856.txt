we celebrate god's gift of diversity and value the wholeness made possible in community equally shared and shepherded by all. we welcome and affirm people of every gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation, who are also of every age, race, ethnicity, physical and mental ability, level of education, and family structure, and of every economic, immigration, marital, and social status, and so much more.we acknowledge that we live in a world of profound social, economic, and political inequities. as followers of jesus, we commit ourselves to the pursuit of justice and pledge to stand in solidarity with all who are marginalized and oppressed.

this february 25 at 7:00 pm, we invite you to our community prayer gathering: racial justice event. 

join community members on the steps of sewickley united methodist church to lament racial injustice, heal our differences, repent of our own complicity, reconcile with those who are different from us, hope for a brighter future, and liberate ourselves from the shackles of racism. 

discussion and light refreshments will follow the service.














happy anniversary, leap of faith! 

we are officially old enough to drive a car. 

16 years of making music and memories with this wonderful group.  and so many others who have been in and out. 

thank you @sewickleyumc for always supporting us! 

our congregation is the best.  we are blessed to continue to worship our lord and sing praises each week with you all.
