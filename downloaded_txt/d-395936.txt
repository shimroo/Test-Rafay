       the siberian husky club of america.  the shca is the akc-recognized national breed club, founded in 1938, and has a membership consisting of established breeders, exhibitors, fanciers, and sled dog racing enthusiasts.

 

our mission is to do all possible to bring the natural qualities of the pure-bred siberian husky to perfection through purposeful breeding.  we protect and advance the interests of the siberian husky through a code of ethics which encourages sportsmanlike competition at dog shows, companion events, sled dog races, and other performance events.  we educate our members and urge breeders to adhere to the standard of the siberian husky as approved by the american kennel club.














statement by the board of the siberian husky club of america regarding genetic testing the siberian husky club of america (shca) has been following rapid advancements in the science of genetic testing as applied to siberian huskies and other breeds, and is supporting active research in that field, including assessing the most effective role genetic testing can serve for our breed.

the shca supports efforts to research diseases of significance for the siberian husky, including the ongoing genome mapping being funded by the shca trust at the university of wisconsin, and recent genetic testing developed by the university of minnesota for polyneuropathy (shpn1) and hypomyelination (sps1 – “shaking puppy syndrome”). the board recommends that members take advantage of these new testing tools to help eliminate two terrible diseases from the breed. this is in keeping with the club’s longstanding commitment to sound and ethical breeding practices that seek to eliminate hereditary defects from the breed, which is exemplified in the standard testing of eyes and hips in breeding siberian huskies.the shca is aware of early genetic testing results that show evidence of some isolated impure breeding in registered siberian huskies. these results are being evaluated by researchers in this country and others, and once available and subject to independent peer review, the shca will decide on an appropriate course of action. in the meantime, the shca is reaching out to university-based research institutions and other non-profit organizations for information and analyses. this is not the first time the club has been confronted with such a question – its action to disqualify merle and brindle markings a couple of years ago is a notable precedent.genetic science and dna testing are evolving rapidly and as the parent club for siberian huskies, we want to address this issue in a careful, deliberate and timely manner. in conjunction with the american kennel club, we will develop practical and effective responses as needed. the shca stands committed to protecting the integrity of the siberian husky breed, and to advancing testing for genetic diseases where proven effective and practicable.the siberian husky club of america condemns all cross-breeding of the siberian husky.
