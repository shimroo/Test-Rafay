congratulations vestaburg elementary & secondary buildings!michigan educators work tirelessly on behalf of learners and do so much that is worthy of celebration and acknowledgment. the mimtss recognition process provides one way to shine a positive light on work happening within the state related to implementing an mtss framework to meet the needs of all learners. schools, districts, and intermediate school districts (isds) were eligible for two types of mtss recognition during 2023-2024 to reflect a range of successes: 1) mtss data utilization and 2) mtss implementation and impact.
