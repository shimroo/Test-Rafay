the 
story in brief




 
 alan 
and all yp workers extend heartfelt gratitude 
for your support. we are dedicated to having 
the results of our work and reversing alan's 
conviction benefit all people afflicted by 
vaccine damage, medical assault, and false 
accusation of infant harm/murder. let's bring 
an end to these travesties.










imprisoned 
for life
(over six years
so far) for shaken 
baby syndrome (sbs), alan yurko is now supported 
by an armada of medical experts and vaccine 
safety advocates who agree that his infant 
son was 
killed 
by an adverse reaction 
to vaccination and by subsequent iatrogenic 
complications in the hospital.

we 
acknowledge that genuine infant abuse exists. 
however, like the yurkos, many 
people and families have been, 
and are being, 
unjustly assaulted by a medico-legal juggernaut 
that fails to do thorough and obligatory analysis. 
on 
this site are varied presentations of the 
baby alan story, a glaring example of what 
can happen to anyone.
to 
help others as well as the yurkos, we 
have valuable scientific 
articles about medical misdiagnosis 
in many cases of sbs, as well as information 
on vaccine reactions, subdural hematoma, retinal 
hemorrhage, non-traumatic pediatric rib injuries, 
iatrogenic 
complications and 
much more.
we 
are very grateful that some folks have already 
prevented false conviction because of information 
they got from this site. alan has letters 
of thanks.
