last updated: october 15, 2014
please read these terms and conditions ("terms", 
"terms and conditions") carefully before using the 
http://www.sunrisewholesalemerchandise.com website (the "service") 
operated by sunrise wholesale merchandise, llc ("us", "we", or "our").
your access to and use of the service is 
conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these terms. 
these terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access 
or use the service.
by accessing or using the service you 
agree to be bound by these terms. if you disagree with any part of the 
terms then you do not have permission to access the service.

if you wish to purchase any product or service 
made available through the service ("purchase"), you may be asked to 
supply certain information relevant to your purchase including, without 
limitation, your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit 
card, your billing address, and your shipping information.
you represent and warrant that: (i) you have the 
legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in 
connection with any purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply 
to us is true, correct and complete.
the service may employ the use of third party 
services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of 
purchases. by submitting your information, you grant us the right to 
provide the information to these third parties subject to our privacy 
policy.
we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your 
order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or 
service availability, errors in the description, image, or price of the 
product or service, error in your order or other reasons.
we reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
recurring billing for membership
i understand my wholesale membership will 
automatically renew monthly/yearly and i will be charged on a recurring 
basis. i understand that i can cancel at any time, but in order to avoid
 being charged for another billing cycle, i must cancel my membership 
subscription before i am billed for my next cycle, and that no refunds 
will be given for charges already billed. 
order cancellations
once orders are placed or submitted to us, via 
our website, api, via telephone or any other method, they cannot be 
cancelled.  in the event you wish to cancel an order you have already 
placed, you may request cancellation by contacting us.   we will make 
every effort to cancel your order, however cancellation is not 
guaranteed and in most cases orders cannot be cancelled, even if the 
order has not already shipped. 
once an order has shipped, you may ask us to 
request an intercept from the shipping carrier.  not all carriers offer 
an intercept option and carriers that offer an intercept option do not 
offer it on all shipping methods (for example, fedex does not offer 
intercepts for orders shipped via smart post shipping method). intercept
 requests are not always successful and often are not successful.  there
 is an intercept fee of $12.35 per box which is only applied if the 
intercept is successful.  by requesting an intercept, you accept 
responsibility for the intercept fee(s) associated with your order, in 
addition to the 20% restocking fee. original shipping charges are not 
refunded for intercepted orders. 
returns, refunds
returns will incur a 20% restocking fee.  all 
returns must be authorized.  authorized returns will be issued an return
 authorization (ra) or return merchandise authorization (rma) number.  
failure to request return authorization may result in the rejection of 
your return.  original shipping charges are not refunded.  return 
shipping charges are the responsibility of the customer.  refunds will 
be issued as "merchandise credit" or "account credit" which can be used 
towards a future purchase, unless otherwise requested. 
refused orders will incur a 20% restocking fee 
plus return shipping charges.  original shipping charges are not 
refunded on refused orders. 
orders returned to us by the carrier for 
insufficient address, incorrect address, inability to deliver, or for 
any other reason will incur a 20% restocking fee plus return shipping 
charges.  original shipping charges are not refunded on orders returned 
by the carrier. 
orders you receive from customers
if you are selling our products online, you may 
receive orders from customers through a website you created, online 
marketplaces (such as ebay or amazon), a website that we or a partner 
created for you, or in any other number of ways.  you are solely 
responsible for verifying the authenticity of those orders before 
placing them with us.  we are not responsible for assessing the validity
 of any orders that you submit to us for fulfillment.  you are required 
to perform your own due diligence to ensure that orders you submit to us
 are not fraudulent.  it does not matter if the orders come to us in any
 automated way, such as through our api, or our integrations with the 
amazon or ebay marketplace, bigcommerce or shopify, or any others.  you 
accept sole responsibility for the orders you submit to us or that are 
submitted to us on your behalf.  
in the event that you should try to dispute a 
payment for an order you submitted to us (such as by initiating a 
chargeback with your credit card company) we will aggressively pursue 
collection options.  the costs associated with collecting those funds 
will be passed on to you.

california online privacy protection act



                                caloppa is the first state law in the 
nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a 
privacy policy.  the law's reach stretches well beyond california to 
require a person or company in the united states (and conceivably the 
world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable 
information from california consumers to post a conspicuous privacy 
policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected 
and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with 
this policy. -  see more at:
                                consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/

                                once this privacy policy is created, we 
will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first 
significant page after entering our website.
                            

                                our privacy policy link includes the

coppa (children online privacy protection act)



                                when it comes to the collection of 
personal information from children under 13, the children's online 
privacy protection act (coppa) puts parents in control.  the federal 
trade commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the 
coppa rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online 
services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
                                


                                we do not specifically market to children under 13.
                            








                                    fair information practices



                                the fair information practices 
principles form the backbone of privacy law in the united states and the
 concepts they include have played a significant role in the development
 of data protection laws around the globe. understanding the fair 
information practice principles and how they should be implemented is 
critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal 
information.
                                


in order to be in line with fair information practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:


                                we will notify the users via email
                            

                                     
                                â¢
                                within 7 business days
                            

                                we will notify the users via in site notification

                                we also agree to the individual redress 
principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue 
legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who 
fail to adhere to the law. this principle requires not only that 
individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that 
individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to 
investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
