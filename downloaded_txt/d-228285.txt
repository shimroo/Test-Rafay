	 an exercise is aussie ignorance
    


australian news can only really be described as 'tabloid' at best. the most exciting thing about it is the occasional golden opportunity to ridicule our fellow neighbours, and this video is no exception.

well, i think that just about says it all.thanks ransey, for the fantastic blog with a massive archive of stuff that i know no one could have read all of.oh, and btw 'anonymous',  we never expected any slack. we just thought that this dead blog may be able to use an update once in a while to keep the archives browsers amused. if you don't appreciate it, fair enuff, but being a prick about it isn't necessary.thanks ramsey, for everything. you are a blogging legend.

	 the quick 10: facts about 10 presidential inaugurations
    


1. jimmy carter’s inauguration was distinctive for a few reasons. first of all, he was the first president to be sworn in by a nickname. second, his inauguration day parade included a macy’s parade-like balloon of a peanut to celebrate his past. and third, his wife, rosalyn, was also the only first lady (in recent history, anyway) to wear an old gown for the swearing-in ceremony. seeing no reason it shouldn’t be worn again, she wore a dress she had worn to a gubernatorial ceremony in georgia.2. zachary taylor refused to be sworn in on a sunday, because he was very strict about “keeping holy the sabbath.”  the position of president couldn’t just be vacant until monday, so the president pro tempore of the senate, david rice atchison, was brought in as a pinch hitter. there’s some debate as to whether this actually makes him the 12th president and zachary taylor the 13th, but obviously, it’s generally accepted that he doesn’t count. he didn’t even stake claim to the title, and repeatedly told people that he slept through most of his day as president. he must have had a good sense of humor about the whole thing, though, as evidenced by the inscription on his gravestone. picture by wikipedia user umbricht 3. calvin coolidge had some interesting people swear him in as president. the first time, after warren g. harding died in office, coolidge was sworn in by his notary public dad. they were at a farm in vermont and had to conduct the whole thing by kerosene lamp. the second time, he was sworn in by former president william howard taft, who was chief justice of the supreme court at the time. 4. thomas jefferson walked to and from his own inauguration. 5. warren g. harding was the first to arrive at his inauguration via car. 6. when andrew johnson was inaugurated as vice president, he was totally trashed.  he was very ill from typhoid fever and drank whiskey to try to numb the aches and pains a little. except he overdid it and ended up slurring his way through his oaths. then he tried to swear in the new senators, but got too confused and had to let a senate clerk complete his duties instead. “the inauguration went off very well except that the vice president elect was too drunk to perform his duties and disgraced himself and the senate by making a drunken foolish speech,” senator zachariah chandler reported. “i was never so mortified in my life, had i been able to find a hole i would have dropped through it out of sight.”7. more than three tons of jelly belly jelly beans were used in ronald reagan’s inauguration in 1981.  when he was governor of california, he developed a jelly bean habit because he was giving up smoking and the jelly beans helped distract him. he became known for it, so red, white and blue jelly beans were used for his inauguration celebrations. the blueberry jelly belly, in fact, was created just for this purpose. 8. barack obama may be using the same bible to take his oath as abraham lincoln did, but teddy roosevelt still has one up on him: he actually wore one of lincoln’s rings.  john hay, roosevelt’s secretary of state, was also abraham lincoln’s private secretary (he was only 22 at the time) and was there when lincoln was assassinated. hay was given the ring by mary todd lincoln and let roosevelt use it in his 1905 inauguration.  9. the adams presidents were apparently sore losers. when their successors were inaugurated, both john adams and john quincy adams made it a point to be otherwise occupied far out of town. 10. in his inaugural address, james buchanan announced that he wasn’t going to run for re-election. he was true to his word, and maybe that’s for the best: he’s continually ranked as one of the worst presidents the u.s. has ever had.vialabels: cj, facts, inauguration, presidential inauguration

	 don't mess with the candy, man!
    


neighbor uses lawn decoration to subdue knife-wielding manwhen a drunken neighbor came over and threatened his thanksgiving guests with a kitchen knife, one del paso heights man allegedly took matters - and a plastic candy cane - into his own hands.in what police said was self-defense, the man used the two-foot plastic lawn decoration to beat 49-year-old donald kercell until police could take kercell into custody, said sacramento police spokesman sgt. norm leong.kercell allegedly became intoxicated, went over to a neighbor's home on the 3600 block of dayton street early thursday evening and began waving a kitchen knife at people gathered on the lawn, leong said.when kercell cut a few people's clothing, leong said, a man at the home decided to fight back. other people at the home called police.leong said the candy cane-wielding man does not face any charges. the knife-wielding man, however, was arrested and booked into the sacramento county main jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon.source: sacto 911

	 google phone vs. 3g iphone, the showdown!
    


a friend of mine, ferris, fellow co-worker, received his new “google phone” in the mail today.  if you didn’t hear in the news, today was the launch of the new t-mobile cell phone — named the g1. this phone runs the google android operating system. complete with a touchscreen, qwerty keyboard, gps, wi-fi, bluetooth, etc — you know, all that good stuff. anyways, i shot a quick video blog to show and compare the g1 “google phone” to the recently released 3g iphone. watch my complete video blog about the two phones below… p.s. you may remember ferris from a hilarious video blog that he was featured in previously — he had a “half” cell phone that miraculously was still working.labels: android, g1, google phone, iphone

	 literary  rules
    


prepositions are not words to end sentences with.and don’t start a sentence with a conjunction.it is wrong to ever split an infinitive.avoid clichés like the plague. (they’re old hat)also, always avoid annoying alliteration.be more or less specific.remarks in brackets (however relevant) are (usually) (but not always) unnecessary.also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies.no sentence fragments.contractions aren’t necessary and shouldn’t be used.foreign words and phrases are not apropos.do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it’s highly superfluous.one should never generalize.comparisons are as bad as clichés.don’t use no double negatives.eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.one-word sentences? eliminate.analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.the passive voice is to be ignored.eliminate commas, that are, not necessary. parenthetical words however should be enclosed in commas.never use a big word when a diminutive one would suffice.kill all exclamation points!!!use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.understatement is always the absolute best way to put forth earth shaking ideas.use the apostrophe in it’s proper place and omit it when its not needed.eliminate quotations. as ralph waldo emerson said, “i hate quotations. tell me what you know.”if you’ve heard it once, you’ve heard it a thousand times: resist hyperbole; not one writer in a million can use it correctly.puns are for children, not groan readers.go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.who needs rhetorical questions?exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.vialabels: cj, english, literary
