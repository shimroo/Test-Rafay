the quest for knowledge of the whole

confidence in the truth, and in the difference it makes
against the widespread skepticism of the age, and the easygoing relativism allied with it, we in the school of philosophy are confident in the human capacity to achieve truth and to live thoughtfully in its light. taking inspiration from the great philosophers, ancient, medieval and modern, our community of students and faculty is committed to the pursuit of wisdom, the object of philosophy in the root sense of the word.

dean's welcome
 
formally inaugurated in 1895, the school of philosophy has accepted doctoral dissertations on issues confronting every major philosophical discipline and every major figure in the history of philosophy. the school continues this endeavor against the background of a broad consensus on the definitive importance of two perennial questions: what is the human good? what are the ultimate principles of being and knowledge? the awareness of these questions and the study of their possible answers constitute an end and an ethos in light of which the school chooses to concentrate on the careful reading of primary sources in the history of philosophy.
