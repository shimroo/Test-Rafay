pam wood waugh's family and then some...





  







over the past 40+ years, 
          most of my spare time has been spent in genealogical research. it's 
          a passion, not a hobby. 

 

in memory of mom,

          shirley margaret dean wood
18 
          jan 1921 - 27 may 2009
you loved 
          family research so much and instilled that in me.
          i miss you so much and sharing the excitement of "new" 
          finds.

genealogical 
      research in the eastern townships, quebec
i started this site back in 1995 when there wasn't much available 
          for researchers looking toward anglo research in quebec. this website 
          is for all researchers working in any of the 11 counties of quebec which 
          make up the eastern townships. twenty-one years later still there. there isn't a lot of new activity but it is there for a few new additions and archive purposes. this 
          site joined quebec genweb on march 22, 1998.  
pam's maternal 
      lines 
mom's lines involve a great 
      many new england families who went to quebec after the revolution - some 
      loyalists, some rebels: brust, covey, crawford, derick/derrick, holt, 
      longeway, patterson, salls, scott, tallman, tryon, vaughan, wait, and 
      young. also had a few lines from england: dean, smith, curry, 
      pearson and munday, who were living in leeds and hunslet, 
      yorkshire, in the 1820-1880 period.

pam's paternal lines 
            ! 
dad's lines were in new 
            brunswick and nova scotia after the revolution - quite possibly earlier, 
            as planters. some branches were old new england stock, several mayflower 
            passengers. there are kings and queens of england, france and italy, 
            charlemagne 
            and even lady 
            godiva! currently working on nesbitt, wood, williams, 
            howard, kerr, belding, darrah, daley, hammond, hepburn, and stanley.

randy's lines 


            the waugh family came from ireland to ma about 1872. the sharpe 
            side traces the descendants of thomas sharpe, of cecil co, md to iredell 
            co, iredell co, nc. the sharpes married into the cloers and the byers. 
            roberson cloer is the earliest proven ancestor. can't seem to tie 
            him in to the other cloers in the area. we know he must be related, 
            but how? jacob beck and paul koch both came over from 
            germany.
