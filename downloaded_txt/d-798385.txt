history













contemporary art servicesplus gallery enriched denver’s contemporary art scene beginning in 2001, providing one of the leading, reputable platforms for prestigious artist representation and exhibitions of note in the region through two prominent spaces at the forefront of the rino arts district, including one of denver’s most iconic redevelopments at the benjamin moore paint factory at 25th and larimer. plus gallery, under owner/director ivar zeile, gained its strong reputation for assisting artists in establishing prominent careers through long term support of jenny morgan, mike whiting, xi zhang and many others who have gone on to both critical acclaim and respected collections. major changes in the district as well as shifting climate for presenting art through a traditional gallery model led to releasing the physical space in 2014, transitioning towards limited artist and client support on a private basis. zeile continues to facilitate sales in support of select artists whose careers are most firmly developed through the operation, with a passion in connecting collectors seeking a refined level of interest and development beyond traditional art, while supporting visionary, forward thinking artists.
