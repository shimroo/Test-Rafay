welcome to the dragonfly website!
it's easy to be fascinated by dragonflies. they were among the very first winged insects to evolve over 300 million years ago! dragonflies belong to the order odonata, characterized by large multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong, transparent wings, and an elongated body. dragonflies are similar to damselflies, but adults hold their wings away from, and perpendicular to the body when at rest. their two sets of wings work independently, allowing dragonflies to maneuver through the air effortlessly. their huge eyes give them incredible vision in almost every directions except directly behind them.
