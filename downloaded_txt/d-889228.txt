what is epos?

epos stands for electronic point of sale. it is a system used in retail stores and hospitality venues to process payments and manage inventory. epos systems often include features like barcode scanning, tracking of customer data, and loyalty programs. it is an efficient and cost effective way to manage the financial side of a business.







how much does a demonstration of your system cost?

demonstrations of our system are completely free of charge! get in touch today to arrange one of our dedicated account managers to come give you a visit!







what areas do you provide epos to?

we provide our epos to a number of different retail and hospitality sectors. take a look at our customer page to see our main sectors. if your sector isn’t listed, don’t worry, we still may be able to help!







is your epos system cloud based?

we provide a hybrid system offering the best of both worlds.  data available at all sites but with the ability to continue to trade should the internet connection fail. 







i already have epos, can i change to your system?

you certainly can change your system! most of our new customers are migrating from a previous system that didn’t meet their requirements.  we will even migrate your data from your old system to make the switch as painless as possible!







i already have an ecommerce site, can your system connect to it?

we can integrate existing woocommerce and shopify sites to our system. we also offer a custom ecommerce package if you are wanting a new website that will integrate straight to our system.
