i was born, raised, and still
        live in the small and historic seacoast town of york, maine and i have
        been a professional woodworker for more than 35 years. this web site is
        really a portfolio containing pictures and descriptions of some of the
        many interesting woodworking projects that have been hand made in my
        one-man shop. this site is maintained for historical reference.  
on the following pages you
        will find hand woodcarving examples that includes carved acanthus leaf mantle
        brackets, prototypes, hand carved business and residential signs, large
        turned and carved wooden capitals made as patterns for the cast stone
        industry and some intricate woodturning projects to include a type of
        bagpipe. also featured is the restoration of a circa 1900 carved wooden
        indian for the museums of old york.
