a wrestling card that will never ever be booked...the couples tag tournamentrap_sheetdecember 14th, 2022from time to time i think it would be healthy to post a mock card to show what could be possible for wrestling fans locally but many factors make it impossible for it to happen.  for my first wrestling card that will never ever be booked, i present the first ever "couples tag team tournament".  this is a mixed tag where well established wrestling couples are all gathered together for a one night single elimination tournament to determine who is the ultimate "power couple" in the midwest.  note, sibling teams would not fit the theme here.  why would this card never be booked?  no promoter could get them all in the same building, with the logistical and availability challenges, nor afford the price tag.  casual wrestling fans wouldn't turn out to see it unless it was in chicago.  therefore holding the card is a tough sell for any promoter.   i shall predict the winners out of each bracket.--chicago bracket *paloma starr & cody jones vs. sierra & joey "the jet" avalonprediction - sierra & avalon advance.  i think the speed & power advantage of the wi team dominates the chi couple and won't be close.--ohio bracket*harley fairfax & fenrir ragnarok (shield wall) vs. shawna reed & cody hawkprediction - shield wall advances.  shield wall has the intimidation factor going and while shawna has held up toe to toe with fairfax, the vikings overwhelm here.--st. louis bracket*tootie lynn ramsey & mike outlaw vs. savanna stone & james brady (top two)prediction - ramsey & outlaw advance.  ramsey & outlaw have gone so much farther in the ring than the couple getting back from california that the team ambition members overrun them.--illinois bracket*rahne victoria & joey o'riley (lowlives) vs. riley knocks & nick natural (the "epic" solution)--prediction - lowlives advance. the "epic" solution are still pretty green and are no match for the zero one veterans.  there are two other couples that could sub in place of knocks & natural but the result would be the same.we go to round two - --chicago vs. ohio*sierra & joey "the jet" avalon vs. shield wallprediction - sierra & avalon advance.  this would be a hard hitting brawl that could go either way, i shall play the "what if" at the end here.--st. louis vs. illinois*tootie lynn ramsey & mike outlaw vs. rahne victoria & joey o'riley (lowlives)prediction - ramsey & outlaw.  another close one, i would have go with the team ambition members edging out on the strength of the resume in the end.the final round -*sierra & joey "the jet" avalon vs. tootie lynn ramsey & mike outlawprediction - pulling it out at the end of the night i would go with sierra & avalon to win the tourney.  strength, power and edurance become the difference the longer the match goes.the "what if"s?  if shield wall advanced, i think both ramsey & outlaw and the lowlives would beat shield wall in the final.  if the lowlives advanced against sierra & avalon, sierra & avalon would still win it all.now, if any promoter tries to book an event like this, let me know.  i'm curious if someone would attempt booking this or similar and actually pulls it off.

ten of the reasons liberals are so annoyingrap_sheetdecember 1st, 2022by john hawkinsi don’t hate liberals, but i do detest liberalism because i view it like an infection. a human being can survive a small infection, with no problem – and the same is true of liberalism. it may sound strange for a conservative to say, but there are lots of wonderful human beings out there that are liberals. they’re nice people, they genuinely mean well and they’re pleasant to be around.in my experience, however, like infections, liberalism can turn disastrous in a hurry once it starts to spread. the more politically involved a liberal becomes, the more miserable, insufferable, and toxic they often turn out to be. even if you knew nothing about liberalism other than the effect it has on people, you’d know it’s a monstrous philosophy that smart people avoid like a case of monkeypox.if you’re conservative, you are probably nodding along. if you’re not into politics or worse yet, a liberal who hasn’t been badly infected yet, you may not understand what we’re talking about. read this column and you will get it.1) liberals insert politics into everything: sporting events? business? church? school? thanksgiving dinner? to liberals, everything is a brutal political struggle and sometimes it’s like, “damnit alyssa, i just want to enjoy this movie without hearing complaints that the film engages in cultural appropriation and the cast is too cisnormative for you. ”2) the totalitarian impulse: liberals love, love, love nothing better than the idea of writing a law in washington, dc today and forcing everyone else in the country to obey it at gunpoint tomorrow. that’s why so many liberals were secretly ecstatic over covid.  having the power to decide whether people got to open their businesses or not, get a haircut or even go to the beach is like a wet dream for a lot of liberals. many of them are attitudinally no different than the people that run china, but fortunately for us, unlike china, we have a second amendment that keeps liberals from going too far.3) pro-censorship: because liberals have given up on proving that their ideas are good, they’ve increasingly embraced censorship. you know, it’s like that old saying goes, “if you can’t beat them, then try to make it impossible for anyone to find out that they have better ideas than you so that you win by default.”4) they are baffled by gender: matt walsh famously did an entire movie called, “what is a woman?” that revolved around the modern left’s inability to answer that simple question. what they seem to have settled on is that your gender is whatever you decide it is, which makes absolutely no logical, scientific or common sense. the idea is that kids, who decide that they’re the rock, spider-man, or a dinosaur one minute without being taken seriously, should be treated like the opposite gender the moment a boy takes an interest in my little pony or a girl likes football is madness. allowing confused teen girls should have their breasts cut off or teen boys to have their penises carved up? it’s some of the most horrific lunacy happening on planet earth. once you get to the point where you falsely believe you can choose your gender, what can’t you choose? can a white man choose to be black? can you choose to be an ox? a coffee table? a planet? napoleon? if not, why not? all of these things are equally ridiculous and the further we go down this road, the weirder it’s going to get – and newsflash… liberals have already gotten pretty freaking weird on this topic already.5) liberals have given up on convincing people their ideas are good: these days, liberals generally don’t even try to make a case for their ideas. instead, they essentially say, “we’re the good guys and anyone who disagrees with us is a bad guy and our enemy. so, which do you want to be?” they’re not interested in debate, they’re not interested in alternative ideas, they just know that “good people believe what we believe and bad people don’t.” from there, everything else they say is just a backward justification to explain why the mean girls club they’ve created is being victimized by the people they’re tormenting in the hallways.6) liberalism is a religion substitute: devout liberals value liberalism above everything else. for liberals, it’s ahead of friendship, relationships with family, their job, their kids, and even god. fanatics of any sort get on everyone’s nerves, but zealots screaming about critical race theory, microaggressions, and drag queens are a special kind of hell.7) liberals just don’t care if their policies work: liberals care a lot about how ideas sound and make them feel, but not at all about whether they work or not. as a general rule, liberals are so indifferent to the success and failure of most of the policies they advocate that they don’t even bother to check. there’s certainly no one on the left going, “wow, it sure is disappointing that all the promises we sold obamacare with weren’t true and the higher insurance costs it caused are hurting a lot of americans, so maybe we should repeal it.” instead. it’s more like, “ha! we passed it suckers and if you don’t like that it doesn’t do what we said, too bad! no backsies!” every liberal policy effectively ends up being nancy pelosi saying, “we [need] to pass the bill in order to find out what [is] in it.” of course, by the time you find out what’s in it, you’ve already taken the poison and they’re going to sit there cackling at you, twirling their bad guy mustaches and laughing about how you’re never getting the antidote.8) race obsession: liberals constantly work to tear down the idea of a colorblind america and create the idea that everyone must be judged by their race first… well, except the white liberals, of course. they’re the “good white people” because they’re liberal, so they’re supposed to get a pass for the never-ending racial nonsense they foist on everyone else. happily, it doesn’t always work out that way and even white liberals end up getting destroyed every so often by the race-obsessed frankenstein monster that they’ve created.9) so many liberals are blind to their own hypocrisy: it’s bizarre to see a liberal who has private bodyguards calling for gun confiscation, who flies overseas on a private jet talking about how we’ve all got to cut back on carbon emissions, or who complains about how awful capitalism is by tweeting on their iphone. some of this is certainly a, “do as we say, not as we do sort of thing,” but a lot of times liberals seem to be genuinely oblivious to their own hypocrisy. for most of us, that would be impossible, but most liberals don’t understand the issues they’re talking about very well, haven’t spent a lot of time thinking about them, and haven’t even considered the other side of their arguments. so many of them are like monkeys playing with dynamite who don’t understand why the banana trees keep exploding.10) liberals trash america: the united states may not be perfect, but it is the most successful, prosperous, and dominant nation in all of recorded human history. meanwhile, a bunch of people who can’t even manage a large city or college campus without it turning into a sh*tshow are constantly proclaiming how awful america is, mocking people who unironically love their country, and looking for ways to fundamentally transform it. there is absolutely nothing going on in say berkeley, chicago, or new jersey that suggests liberals could come up with something better than the founding fathers did, but that’s not going to stop some dork with a drug habit, a psychologist, and personal pronouns from explaining how we need to be much more like some country that’s ten times less successful than we are.

disgraced and decertified wrestling podcaster resorts to harassing various people on twitterrap_sheetjuly 9th, 2022unfortunately some people refuse to look in the mirror and realize they are the problem not everyone else.  james jordan took to message the father of a now retired wrestler accusing them of being yours truly and threatening to assault me on sight.  the victim did not know who he was or who i was.  why he decided to pull this stunt saturday afternoon is unclear.  james jordan was chased out of a pro wrestling epic event months ago after posting several creepy photos and harassing comments of the female talent.  i come to read a tweet that the husband of one asked jordan to stop, to which jordan cornered him in the restroom threatening to shoot him which led to several wrestlers watching the event not booked that evening intervening. jordan has been banned by several promotions for misconduct.  he has also threatened to sue me for calling him out for the pwe incident.and now he makes several claims about sicw and herb simmons. {he deleted the video}  [fyi:  one of the claims he made actually checked out and i dunno how i missed that story.]i implore the national wrestling alliance and the chase hotel not to allow him admission to their events, doing so will put to peril the fans and talent.  the victim has tagged billy corgan and the nwa in tweets after jordan directly connected himself to corgan.  i also don't miss twitter.on a side note, the july 4th highland park mass shooting incident touched billy corgan as he owns a teahouse in the area where it occurred and was only able to reopen his business during the weekend after the downtown was closed off for several days due to the fbi investigation.note:  this story will be updated.

pwci this week - now on other streaming sites!rap_sheetmay 9th, 2022in the wake of my youtube channel being attacked by left-wing zealots who are engaging in desperation "ministry of truth" like tactics after losing twitter to elon musk, i have taken action to mirror my content to two other video sharing sites - rumble & odysee - which will include other videos blocked because yt doesn't get the concept of "fair use" (majority of which are year in review shows).  both have their pluses and minuses but both have a migration tool that allowed me to send content to both sites with minimal effort in a short amount of time.  to visit my mirror channels - pro wrestling central illinois this week on rumble - http://tiny.cc/pwci-rpro wrestling central illinois this week on odysee - http://tiny.cc/pwci-eand pwci this week on youtube - http://tiny.cc/pwcii previously used dailymotion as the alternate but its user interface never had any improvements made to it and no migration tool.  odysee in the short amount of time it has existed at least made the most progress on emulating the yt interface.  and both have some sort of monetization without any of the hoops yt has.  so please subscribe and put a few views there as i get things set up over time.

the april fools prank that got me wrongly kicked off facebookrap_sheetapril 3rd, 2022ladies and gentlemen, i have a major announcement.  it has been a situation for many many months where the covid pandemic directly controlled what the family would do.  yearly traditions went out the window as everyone was afraid of contracting the virus.  when treatments and vaccines came along you would think we would go back to doing things before covid came along.  sadly that has not been the case.  while some members of the family had and gotten over the virus or never got the virus, others got the vaccine, but those who got the vaccine demanded everyone else in the family get the vaccine or they were not allowed to participate in family functions.  thanksgiving, christmas, easter...forget it!  i was one of those in my family who refused to get the vaccine for very real fears of deadly side effects that damage the heart.  i was told i wouldn't get any christmas presents and hardly anyone wanted anything to do with me because i made a choice they didn't agree with!  i've had enough, and i've decided it was time to put myself up for adoption after being excluded again last christmas.  if my old family was gonna cower in fear the rest of their lives, it was time to become a member of a new family who doesn't live in fear.  this has been in the works for the past couple of months and i am proud to announce that i have been adopted by the wheeler family and my name going forward is steven michael wheeler.  i am proud to be a wheeler, who never stopped living even in the age of covid.  i will be celebrating the family traditions i grew up with and will be moving to another state fairly soon.  this change will be quite the adjustment but i have full support from my new family and i will find happiness again after being so alone and depressed for all these months so needlessly.  to my former family who i assume are in shock that i did this, i cannot live without a family and you chose to exclude me from the family.  it was time to move on and it was in my best interest.  as i prepare to move to my new home to be with my new family, i say to everyone who has been experiencing the same situation i have, don't be afraid to make a leap of faith.  everyone will be better off for it.  thank you for reading and april fools!note: mark zuckerburg is a giant a**hole and all his moderators are a bunch of giant a**clowns who all need their heads smashed in with steel chairs - they suspended my facebook account for three days because some douche with a flaming hot poker jammed way up his a** got pissed off over my april fools prank which i had to put here because the commie fascist zealots that run that site are a bunch of whiny losers who should be locked up in a mental institution subjected to daily shock treatment.

a column that not just didn't age well but became extremely radioactiverap_sheetmarch 1st, 2022jim leach, one of the biggest donkey fluid drinking left-wing loons of springfield a year ago wrote this absolutely ridiculous column, which not only didn't age well but also became extremely radioactive.  so radioactive he just deleted the column off wmay.com in a weak attempt to hide his colossal embarassment, but archive.org preserved a copy of this glorious laughable piece which proves once and for all the only thing that matters is his ideology holding power and does not care of the consequences. [editorial] our long national nightmare is overby jim leach a few minutes ago  photo credit: joe biden / official websitefor 65 excruciating days, i, like you, have sat forlorn, shaken and lost, waiting for that most important of american traditions – the presidential news conference. like you, i have watched fox news commiserate with our national sorrow as joe biden, day in and day out, refused to slake our thirst for the live question-and-answer session for days longer than his recent predecessors.but now, at long last, the sun is again shining, the birds are singing, our souls are lifted and enlightened. joe biden has finally gone before the white house press corps to conduct a presidential press conference.it is, of course, a valuable thing for presidents to hold themselves accountable, to stand up to the scrutiny of the press, to defend their record and explain their plans and their vision. it is not, though, a national crisis if a new president spend most of his first two months in office actually formulating and enacting policies rather than engaging in the performance art demanded by fox and other talking heads.now that this first news conference is under his belt, we know a few things that we didn’t know before – and we also know some things that most of us already knew. first and foremost, it should be evident to everyone who watched or listened that the endless right-wing accusations that president biden is suffering from dementia or cognitive failure is every bit as much a sham as their big lie about election fraud.i’ve seen dementia up close and personal. people with dementia don’t have biden’s command for policy detail and the intricacies of governing. in his time at the podium, biden showed he had much more insight and knowledge of governance, and a more realistic and clear-eyed assessment of what can and cannot be done in that arena, than donald trump displayed in four years and approximately four billion interviews, gaggles, and tweets.it’s well past time for the right-wing echo chamber to drop this nonsense, but they show no signs of doing so. it’s up to the rest of us to recognize that when they lie to us incessantly and unashamedly, we can and should feel free to ignore the rest of what they have to say.since i’ve already played the trump card myself, i feel obligated to offer this criticism of biden’s press conference performance. he should spend a lot less time invoking his twice-impeached, zero-popular-vote-victories predecessor. we all know what trump’s incompetence and disinterest in actual governing led to. but it’s biden’s responsibility now – spend less time talking about what he failed to do, mr. president, and a lot more time telling us what you’re going to do.what else have we learned? biden has a lot better sense of humor than his critics, and most of the press corps. unlike the reporters who kept asking about it, biden immediately got the irony of questions premised on the idea that people are pouring across the border because biden’s “a nice guy,” even though they poured across the border in even greater numbers in 2019 when trump – no one’s idea of “a nice guy” – was in office.biden also drily referenced his start in the senate “120 years ago,” a lovely bit of self-deprecating humor that flew right over the head of many of biden’s critics. the only thing funnier than biden’s line was the faceplanting that twitter pundits engaged in by missing the joke completely.biden at times referred to notes during the news conference – another action that will be seized on by his critics as some sort of evidence that he’s unfit for the job. i, for one, would much rather have a president checking his notes and presented information accurately, rather than just winging it and making it up as he goes along.we also learned that biden favors a return to the “talking filibuster,” because he recognizes that getting rid of it entirely is most likely a political non-starter right now. and that the 78-year-old president “expects” to run for re-election in 2024, but won’t say it definitely because no one knows what the next three-and-a-half years will hold – a perfectly reasonable stance to take that seemed to confuse some members of the press corps.i finished up the hour reassured that we are being led by a good man, who is genuinely concerned about things other than himself – about the wellbeing of migrants who, at no small risk, are coming to this country in a desperate search for help, about the people who continue to be battered by the health and economic effects of the pandemic, about the victims of gun violence. it was important to hear directly from him. but it’s more important for him to get back to work and put that concern and compassion into action.

fire fauci... and then prosecute himrap_sheetoctober 21st, 2021https://townhall.com/columnists/larryoconnor/2021/10/21/fire-fauci-n2597793larry o'connor6-8 minutesfire fauci... and then prosecute himsource: greg nash/pool via ap"sen. paul, with all due respect, you are entirely, entirely and completely incorrect," dr. anthony fauci told sen. rand paul on may 11 of this year. "the nih has not ever, and does not now, fund gain-of-function research in the wuhan institute." this was in the midst of a lengthy exchange between the two doctors over paul's line of questioning over research that may have eventually led to the development and release of the deadly covid-19 virus that has crippled this nation's economy for nearly two years.now we know that fauci lied in this infamous exchange. it wasn't a gaffe. it wasn't an accidental omission of irrelevant, immaterial details. it was an outright, categorical denial of the most important line of questioning pertaining to the origins of the virus and the possible connection to american financial participation in the process. here's the exchange:     this is gold: anthony fauci has been exposed by rand paul for his hand in ‘gain of function’ research that lead to the weaponization of the coronavirus. fauci tried to use semantics to get out of it but failed. investigate him now pic.twitter.com/bzdasbrdj3    — melissa tate (@therightmelissa) may 11, 2021yesterday, the lie was exposed... by fauci's own agency. our katie pavlich delivers the receipts:     the national institutes of health released a letter wednesday night correcting the record on the agency's funding of dangerous gain-of-function research at the wuhan institute of virology.     "the fifth and final progress report for grant r01ai110964, awarded to ecohealth alliance, inc. is attached with redactions only for personally identifiable information," a letter written by nih principal deputy director larence tabak to republican congressman james comer states. "it includes data from a research project conducted during the 2018-2019 grant period using bat coronavirus genome sequences already existing in nature."    "the limited experiment described the final progress report provided by ecohealth alliance was testing if spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in china were capable of biding to the human ace2 receptor in a mouse model," the letter continues. "in this limited experiment, laboratory mice infected with the shc014 w1v1 bat coronavirus became sicker than those infected with the w1v1 bat coronavirus."    in the letter, tabak maintains that while gain-of-function research was conducted, sars-cov-2 was not developed through that kind of research at the wuhan lab.as for senator paul:     “i told you so” doesn’t even begin to cover it here: https://t.co/9jfn85i24i    — senator rand paul (@randpaul) october 21, 2021apologists claim that the nih had no idea this research was done and its vendor never disclosed the information, but as usual, our colleague scott hounsell at redstate is all over that:    again, if daszak, who helped to submit the chinese tailored world health organization report on the origins of covid-19, and authored the infamous lancet letter, almost universally scientifically decided to be a fraudulent assessment, is in charge of ecohealth alliance, why would the nih expect that daszak or his organization would tell the truth or submit accurate reports if it could implicate them in the murder of 5 million people?    the nih letter then provides a genetic analysis of sars-cov-2, to known viruses as questioned by representative comer. as our reporting here at redstate has previously hypothesized, ratg13 is the most likely candidate as the backbone for sars-cov-2, after facing the genetic manipulation of gain-of-function research. the nih letter to comer openly states what we already know:  that ratg13 (a virus found naturally in a cave in the yunnan province in 2013), shares 96% of its genomic code with sars-cov-2.in other words... when fauci gave his sworn testimony in may, over a year after the crippling pandemic had taken hold, one would expect that he would've ensured that any research the us was connected to in wuhan would've been vetted and any connection to gain-of-function research would've been revealed. to merely claim "we had no idea" is not sufficient. he should have known. and he probably did. but, his unequivocal denials do not leave him any wiggle room for a back-tracking "oh, i was mistaken, i didn't know about this at the time" weasel way out. fauci has been caught in a consequential, high-profile lie that could rise to the level of perjury considering the material nature of the subject and the fact that his lie was delivered under oath, to the united states senate and while serving in his capacity as director of niaid. this was not a minor little lie that can be boiled down to an oversight or an error or a tiny fact that merely slipped the mind. paul rounded back on the topic and gave fauci opportunity after opportunity to correct the record, and fauci continued to grandstand, pound the table and shout his lie directly at the senator from kentucky. he needs to be fired. he needs to be fired not just for this but for the very real fact that his role has been completely compromised by his own behavior. when he speaks, it literally makes no difference. those who disbelieve him won't listen, or if they do, will mock his words and show his inconsistencies of the past that negate his exhortations today. those who do believe him are already persuaded to wear a mask, get a shot, put their kids in masks, abstain from sporting events, cancel holidays, and accept all the other myriad controls over our lives and our liberties that fauci seems to relish invoking from his air-conditioned studio as he's piped into another sunday talk show that only his fan club is watching anyway. his tv appearances have been reduced to confirmation fear porn for the masses who are already too terrified to take their outer mask off before they get in their car alone. he is worse than a liar... he is an irrelevant liar. and we are paying him handsomely to continue his lies. he does more harm than good, which, last i checked, is not really in keeping with his hippocratic oath... and his lies certainly violate his oath of office. fire him now... and then begin the investigation into his behavior.

how exactly a left-wing hack operates, and how evil and diobogical they arerap_sheetoctober 15th, 2021https://americanmind.org/salvo/thats-not-happening-and-its-good-that-it-is/salvo 07.26.2021 10 minutes“that’s not happening and it’s good that it is”michael antona quick and dirty guide to regime propagandagaslighting getting you down? feel like the regime has dialed the megaphone up to, and past, eleven? you’re not crazy. it’s definitely happening and likely to get worse as our masters’ ability to cope with reality further worsens—or worse, they gain the complete and absolute control they seek. they’re both scornful and terrified of dissent, which explains why they incessantly shriek at us and lie to our faces.so, to help you navigate the twitstorm, i present a guide to seven of the regime’s most common, oft-deployed lies. this is not meant to be comprehensive. i’m sure there are tactics they use that either i haven’t crystalized or that aren’t front-of-mind at the moment. i encourage others to expand the catalogue with their own observations. the better we can understand how they try to manipulate us, the better we can resist and counter it all.let’s start with the unholy trinity of ruling class horse manure. these first three are similar, but subtle differences determine the ways they’re used in differing circumstances.the law of merited impossibilitythe coinage is rod dreher’s and goes back to the early debates on homosexual marriage. as dreher formulates it, the law of merited impossibility holds: “that will never happen, and when it does, boy will you [homophobes, transphobes, racists, sexists, whatever] deserve it.”this law is used, first, to disarm resistance to the latest leftist enthusiasm. whatever the innovation is, it will have no adverse consequences. none! puberty blockers and disfiguring surgeries have no downsides whatsoever. how dare you suggest they might!its second purpose is to dismiss out of hand “slippery slope” arguments—despite, or because of, the fact that every single such argument over the last twenty years at least has proved true. worried that allowing people to “self-identify” as whatever sex they want will lead to pervy 50-year-old men exposing themselves to’ tween girls? insist, loudly and indignantly, that that will never happen and anyone who suggests it might is an alarmist bigot with a heart full of hate.the third purpose is to enforce the new caste system. those who get to impose fresh irrational indignities on the rest of us are the upper caste. those who object, or even have reservations, are lower. the latter are not allowed to harbor, much less express, any doubts. whatever humiliation the upper caste has planned for us, we deserve and must meekly accept. hence when said pervy 50-year-old actually does start waving around “her” equipment in the girls’ locker room, if any parent dares object, let ’em have it with both barrels. that thing that ten seconds ago you said would “never” happen? now it’s righteous punishment for the retrograde.the law of merited impossibility has done wonders for the left in helping to ram through a wide variety of radical societal changes and cow into silence all opposition. it’s currently busy destroying girls’ and women’s sports, an outcome that we were assured would “never” happen. though one wonders what the ladies did do to deserve it.the law is a bit passé, though, because our rulers rarely any longer feel the need to reassure normie americans that everything will turn out ok, that the things we most fear won’t happen. mostly, the holders of the megaphone just skip to the second half, the angry insistence that we deserve itthe celebration parallaxa parallax is the apparent difference in position of the same object seen from different vantage points. for instance, an analogue speedometer that reads sixty miles per hour to the driver, but fifty to the passenger—even though the needle itself is only in one place.the celebration parallax may be stated as: “the same fact pattern is either true and glorious or false and scurrilous depending on who states it.” in contemporary speech, on any “controversial” topic—or, to say better, regime priority—the decisive factor is the intent of the speaker. if she can be presumed to be celebrating the phenomenon under discussion, she may shout her approval from the rooftops. if not, he better shut up before someone comes along to shut him up.note also that the key distinction here is celebration versus non-celebration, not support versus opposition. one need not actually, clearly oppose the subject under discussion in order to be blameworthy. declining or neglecting to celebrate it forcefully enough is enough. as in stalin’s russia, lack of enthusiastic clapping is regarded as opposition. the legitimacy of one’s right to state the same identical fact, in the same identical language, depends on who one is and what one thinks of it. since the left presumes that all persons of color approve of the phenomena covered by the celebration parallax, the parallax is really a test to distinguish allies from deplorables.to the best of my recollection, the origin of the celebration parallax arose from the need to defend “affirmative action,” a very unpopular policy since its inception. the party line therefore goes like this: people of color must be granted explicit preferences to overcome america’s “legacy of racism” so that we may “diversify” america’s power centers and end white male dominance, a move that—in addition to being necessary to address the country’s inherent racism—improves those institutions by infusing them with different and hitherto neglected points of view. also, kids of color need “role models” who “look like themselves.”but there is no such thing as “reverse discrimination,” which is itself a racist term, and there are no “quotas” (another racist term) whatsoever, but only “timetables,” “goals,” and measures to evaluate applicants and candidates “holistically.”on no subject is the parallax more prevalent than immigration. depending on who’s doing the talking, the demographic transformation of the united states is either a glorious trend that portends a permanent democratic majority and a more “vibrant” future, or else a “conspiracy theory” that is not happening in any way at all, no-how.the left insists that concerns from certain quarters that immigration policy in america (and europe) amounts to a “great replacement” is a “dangerous,” “evil,” “racist,” “false” “conspiracy theory.” but a leftist new york times columnist can write an article entitled “we can replace them” and … nothing. same fundamental point, except she’s all for it and her targets aren’t. a u.s. senator can exult that demographic change will doom republicans. joe biden himself can refer to an “unrelenting stream of immigration.” except they’re celebrating it and calling for it. anyone on the right who uses the exact same words will not merely be denounced; the very fact pattern that is affirmed when biden says it will be denied when the rightist repeats it.the law of salutary contradictionwhich brings us to the law of salutary contradiction, whose formulation is: “that’s not happening and it’s good that it is.” while the law of merited impossibility applies to the future, this one is about the present. it’s what the ruling class immediately switches to after what they insisted would “never” happen is happening before everyone’s eyes.is the nsa spying on tucker carlson? that’s an insane conspiracy theory … which is also warranted by tucker’s treasonous contacts with russian officials as he seeks an interview with putin.is the biden administration inviting in illegal immigrants, then putting them on military planes and shipping them to the heartland? absolutely not … and these future nobel prize winners deserve their shot at the american dream.once you learn to recognize this pattern, you see it everywhere. it is the cornerstone of ruling class rhetoric in the current year.the smails exhortationturning from the unholy trinity, we see that the ruling class condemns all of us as entitled boors. in their eyes, we deserve nothing. we have no reasonable wants nor any just complaints. our only role is to accept getting nothing and learning to like it.our masters bleat about “democracy” but have redefined the word to mean “getting exactly what we”—i.e., they—“want.” any ostensibly “democratic” outcome that might result in us getting what we want is ipso facto illegitimate. border wall? fascist! immigration enforcement? racist and fascist! law and order? double racist and fascist! better trade deals? economically illiterate! an end to endless wars? catastrophic! and also, somehow, “anti-semitic.” penis-free girls’ bathrooms? transphobic!no matter is too small, too local, too private, or too inconsequential to escape their gaze and slip their punishment. bake the cake, bigot.mostly what they bleat, though, is anti-american, anti-white, anti-conservative, anti-christian, anti-rural, anti-southern, anti-red-state, anti-redneck, anti-working-class hate. every media organ and cultural citadel blares this message loudly and incessantly.the purpose is hard to figure. on one hand, it’s demoralizing, which certainly serves ruling class ends, and it fires up their coalition. on the other hand, if you’re trying to boil a frog, it’s best not to tell him the plan, as he might try to jump out of the pot.which brings us to:the lie-back imperativethis tactic, and the next one, are related to what steve sailer has called “the war on noticing.”the regime knows it’s in a difficult rhetorical position. the heart of its argument is that some people are inherently innocent and good while others are inherently guilty and bad and must be treated accordingly. to ears insufficiently attuned to this new understanding of justice, this can sound unjust. tying moral worth to circumstances of birth? not treating people equally? punishing the living for the sins of the dead?why all this is—contrary to appearances, logic, and common sense—“just” requires considerable explanation. to the extent that people “get it,” they will sharply divide between those who say that the “advantaged” have it coming and those who object “no, i don’t.”the problem for the regime, therefore, is that while its message is very effective at egging on its own side, it can be equally effective at alarming and rousing its targets. the ideal solution would be to come up with a public message that rallies the regime’s base while lulling its targets, but this turns out to be very difficult, if not impossible.another option is to forbid the targets from speaking up—hence the celebration parallax.but the regime’s preferred mode is not merely to allow its targets to speak, but to require it—so long as the targets deny the regime apparatchik said what she said. hence the response to “you are evil and deserve what’s coming to you” must be “you don’t think ill of me and wish me no harm.” every punch in the face must be publicly rationalized, by the victim, as a massage. the purpose is partly to bully the frog into staying in the pot and partly a matter of humiliation. in the oft-quoted words of anthony daniels, “a society of emasculated liars is easy to control.”a great many “conservatives” are not merely willing but eager to play along. indeed, whole institutions of the establishment “right” do little else but reassure their ostensible constituency that the left not only doesn’t mean its proto-genocidal rhetoric but isn’t even saying it.it is an odd feature of the current year that calling an avowed enemy a liar—publicly insisting that her plain words could not possibly mean what they plainly say—not only fails to provoke an angry denial but is welcomed by the liar herself. anything to keep the regime’s targets somnambulant for as long as possible. the more americans who wake up and realize that contemporary leftism is a revenge plot with themselves as its targets, the more will object and try to stop it. this is what the regime, at present, most fears and is trying to prevent.the enmity counteraccusationthis one is perhaps the most brazen. as i put it elsewhere, “the enemy calls you its enemy for recognizing its enmity.”as regime hacks spew vile, borderline—and sometimes explicitly—violent rhetoric at you, they will immediately wheel and counterattack if you dare object. don’t appreciate being called evil because of your race? then you are “divisive”! dare put up your hands to block an incoming punch? that’s violence! you’re just supposed to take it.they’re enemies who treat you like enemies while they insist that you treat them as friends. at least, though, unlike the housebroken “right,” they stab you in the front.a related point is that if you so much as speculate as to where their insane vitriol might lead the country, you will be accused of wishing for that outcome. it’s entirely possible that decades of anti-american, anti-white, anti-christian animosity, coupled with nation-destroying trade, immigration and foreign policies, will not lead to civil war. then again, it’s entirely possible that they might. if they do, the ruling class and the left will bear the blame. naturally, though, they will blame us.indeed, they already are. attempts to head off such a conflict by warning about it are treated as provocations intended to produce said conflict. one can be forgiven for wondering if their plan is to start it and then say we started it, sort of like insisting poland triggered the second world war by shooting back.“you’re worthless, baby; and if you even think of trying to leave me, i’ll kill you”which brings us to the last. deplorable americans are loudly and incessantly said to be the worst people in the history of the planet, pure unadulterated evil, with no legitimate concerns, interests or grievances.well, ok. then why live with us? why treat as anathema even the most moderate, banal, attempt to allow some measure of federalism and local control?there can only be two answers: either our masters know (or intuit) deep down that we can live without them but they can’t live without us, or else they want to keep us around to administer what they view as deserved punishment.being neither a psychiatrist nor a theologian, i could not say whether the roots of this behavior are psychotic or demonic, but in this layman’s judgement, it exhibits key characteristics of both.but understand this: they hate you and want you cancelled and ostracized, or at least utterly subservient and obedient. you owe them no consideration. their every argument, every sentence, every word are proffered in bad faith. as mary mccarthy said of lilian hellman, “every word she writes is a lie—including ‘and’ and ‘the.’”the regime is powerful, which means we must calibrate our resistance carefully. but to think clearly, our minds must be free. which requires understanding its rhetoric and seeing through it. i hope this short guide is useful in that effort.michael anton is a lecturer and research fellow at hillsdale college and a senior fellow at the claremont institute.

the fundamental issue with replacing facebook & twitterrap_sheetjuly 2nd, 2021unfortunately, as the three stooges known as zuckerburg, dorsey and wojcicki continue to be exposed as public enemies of american democracy beholden to the chinese communist party for their blood money - mass exodus to alternate platforms not controlled by bigtech radical left-wingers are too severely splintered to determine the best outlet to replace them.  sadly, almost everyone you know are not on these other platforms and hardly anyone there now is from your area.  it's not like it was when people bailed on myspace.  what will it take to change that?  and looking for people you know on the target platform very hit or miss, mostly miss or not at all.

roadtrip to elgin...rap_sheetjune 22nd, 2021normally i haven't done long roadtrips to wrestling shows, given there's enough close by me that such trips are unnecessary.  dreamwave was typically the furthest i would go at 130 miles to lasalle-peru.  the exception to this is when i'm staying overnight nearby with family.  however, since i've been gaming a lot lately in a bid to win gamer of the year at galloping ghost (despite much grumbling from certain people) i was going to stay up there the weekend, and i was needed as a ringside cameraman.  it was outside and bloody hot again, as it was the previous weekend where i filmed outside.  there were a lot of new names i had to learn i hadn't seen, got a few interviews with people.  supposedly mwa will be running in downstate illinois at some point.  officially though, this was my first independent show i've ever attended in the chicago area (i attended a tna ppv before that).  of course it wasn't perfect, a couple matches i didn't care for, but the opener, the tag and the matches with aew guys carried the event.  would i go back?  if it comes downstate, probably.  another drive up to chicago, not likely under normal parameters.  i know there's people who weren't thrilled with a certain someone being involved in the show, that certain someone wasn't happy with the comments made about him. also a tribute was made to steve cain who passed away recently.  well some of the stuff from this event will be shown on pwci this week in the future, as i like to showcase the new faces for the locals to learn about.midwest wrestling alliance results from elgin on 6/19 --*vinny lee glamrock pinned judo granger*mwa midstates champ mr. fitness 2 pinned myles mercer*chief attakullakulla pinned tyler bodine*alex gretzky pinned christopher daniels*mwa tag champs the answer pinned the rebel hearts*mwa women's champ morgan lavey pinned renee van peebles*mwa heavyweight champ brian blade beat lance archer by dq

masks may make you sick with something worse than covid...rap_sheetjune 17th, 2021by jennifer cabreraa group of parents in gainesville, fl, sent 6 face masks to a lab at the university of florida, requesting an analysis of contaminants found on the masks after they had been worn. the resulting report found that five masks were contaminated with bacteria, parasites, and fungi, including three with dangerous pathogenic and pneumonia-causing bacteria. although the test is capable of detecting viruses, including sars-cov-2, only one virus was found on one mask (alcelaphine herpesvirus 1).the analysis detected the following 11 dangerous pathogens on the masks:    streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumonia)    mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis)    neisseria meningitidis (meningitis, sepsis)    acanthamoeba polyphaga (keratitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis)    acinetobacter baumanni (pneumonia, blood stream infections, meningitis, utis—resistant to antibiotics)    escherichia coli (food poisoning)    borrelia burgdorferi (causes lyme disease)    corynebacterium diphtheriae (diphtheria)    legionella pneumophila (legionnaires’ disease)    staphylococcus pyogenes serotype m3 (severe infections—high morbidity rates)    staphylococcus aureus (meningitis, sepsis)half of the masks were contaminated with one or more strains of pneumonia-causing bacteria. one-third were contaminated with one or more strains of meningitis-causing bacteria. one-third were contaminated with dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. in addition, less dangerous pathogens were identified, including pathogens that can cause fever, ulcers, acne, yeast infections, strep throat, periodontal disease, rocky mountain spotted fever, and more.the face masks studied were new or freshly-laundered before wearing and had been worn for 5 to 8 hours, most during in-person schooling by children aged 6 through 11. one was worn by an adult. a t-shirt worn by one of the children to school and unworn masks were tested as controls. no pathogens were found on the controls; samples from the front top and bottom of the t-shirt found proteins that are commonly found in skin and hair, along with some commonly found in soil.a parent who participated in the study, ms. amanda donoho, commented that this small sample points to a need for more research: “we need to know what we are putting on the faces of our children each day. masks provide a warm, moist environment for bacteria to grow.”the parents contracted with the lab because they were concerned about the potential of contaminants on masks that their children were forced to wear all day at school, taking them on and off, setting them on various surfaces, wearing them in the bathroom, etc. this prompted them to send the masks to the university of florida’s mass spectrometry research and education center for analysis.https://rationalground.com/dangerous-pathogens-found-on-childrens-face-masks/
