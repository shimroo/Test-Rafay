	 mitchieville is a place of caring
	 
    


those of you interested in hitching a ride aboard the statist gravy train should research the utility of having your own municipality.  mitchieville is a diverse community that embraces diversity.  that is what we write on the forms, tick on the boxes, and click on the links.  then the money arrives.  mitchieville is an equal opportunity grasper of funds.  mitchieville celebrates open borders, which means that we take government money from countries, states, and provinces which we are not really part of.  if california cuts us a check, we cash it.  there are no borders, eh what?  we take and spend their money, and in return we send them the words they want to see on forms, some purloined pictures, and other forms of white guilt slaking.  but i should get to the point.  mitchieville has received and spent money to promote fluoridation.  let me tell you how.  this is a feeling good spending other peoples money story...

some people have questions about fluoridation. these people are hate filled right wing extremists.  in an open society, they need to shut up, to be silenced.  the mayor and i spent several hours of deep, rye soaked, conversation trying to figure out how we can impose fluoridation on an electorate that opposes fluoridation.  re-election is frequently on the mayor's mind, almost as much as re-gifting fluoridation grants.  a study was called for.  we flew to an expensive haliburton resort (paid for by a grant to promote literacy awareness amongst university arts sophomores) to study the problem.  one day, while we were fishing (the mayor caught the largest pike that week)  our science advisor, dr.no, observed that it is mitchieville's most vulnerable citizens who suffer most from mouth disease.  fluoridation should then be restricted to the bus station, public housing, and the street where the methadone clinic, abortion center, tattoo parlor, and whores motel is located.  this is a great idea!  the mayor had already laid the ground work of creating a diversity village where the downtrodden can have easy access to services.  diversity village is supplied with drinking water from one source, one pipe.  the people of the progressive municipality of mitchieville can thank their visionary mayor for this design.

fluoridation is expensive.  while the contract kickbacks and hiring of nephews , political cronies, and wet work minions is facilitated by building the potemkin village style fluoridation plant, the ongoing operation of this facility would consume resources.  while the municipality is happy to receive funds for construction, operation, and maintenance, our wise mayor is not happy to spend funds on construction, operation, and maintenance.  this was a heavy burden on the mayor and the leadership cadre.  i could see the lines of worry on his face during the pot bellied pig races at mitchieville pride week.  how could fluoridation be made sustainable in a world torched by global warming?

how to provide sustainable fluoridation?  the electorate was satisfied: they could get their fluoride from toothpaste.  the medical community was satisfied:  the incidence of fluoride induced mutations remained at a pre fluoridation level. but the statists who send us money would want to see fluoridation effects in the oppressed.  how to do this without diverting spending money?   once again, global warming science came to our rescue.  dr.no drew up a plan to supply fluoride from one of the industrial processes performed in the subterranean levels of the supreme central library of mitchieville.  instead of putting money into the pockets of some blood sucking corporation, a sustainable, environmentally friendly lithium fluoride compound would be used to spread diversity for the never workers in diversity village.  i well remember the look of relief and joy on the face of the mayor when he was told the good news.  at that very moment, the mayor's favorite won the bum fights quarter final for mitchieville pride week.  what a great evening!  lithium has well documented health effects.  now the goodness of lithium would be combined with the goodness of fluoride and given to those who need it most: the never workers of mitchieville!  hurrah!

now, in mitchieville, fluoridation has a new meaning, and that meaning is sustainability, diversity, and bent gender pride.  diversity village is a more peaceful place.  the oppressed never workers are more peaceful, thanks to fluoridation.  we put fluoride in the wine we give to the alcoholics in the shelters.

you too can develop a sustainable revenue stream from re gifted statist spending.  the statist policy of non ability hiring means the bureaucrats who check the forms and approve the spending are easily motivated by conjecture, comforting photo shopped images, and creative writing.  mitchieville has a library swat team, for example.  think outside the box.

what a great day.  finally, ontario has put to rest the racist, sexist, homophobic past and elected a woman, a gay woman.  what a relief.  the sun is shining.

voters in ontario have said yes to pension security, employment justice, and vacation rights.  i am willing to bet your pension, livelihood, and happiness on that.  you can quote me on that too. 

the gloomy hyperbole about economic collapse is dispersing like snow in a global warming winter.  remember last winter?  remember the children asking 'will i ever see snow again?'.  yup. 

i was sitting on the subway and i let off a long, silent fart of happiness.  the train was stopped because of delays.  i wanted to share my joy.  later, while waiting in traffic to make a left turn (only one block before some traffic lights) i was savoring the waving fists of happiness and the honking horns of consensus.  all is good.  you can let your dog take a crap in the park knowing that someone else is responsible.  the children have spoken. 

there will be no layoffs in the civil service.  there will be more regulations to protect the earth.   health care will be better and faster.  my white guilt is gone like jism down the throat of a sex trade worker.

share in the happiness.  join me.  fart on the subway.  make left turns in rush hour.  embrace the black market economy and keep your money for yourself.  you will have to provide the services the government promises and taxes for, so keep your money for that purpose.  the wolf will lay down after filling his belly with lamb and sleep the contented sleep that only a wolf in a land of doltish shepherds can.

	 the next russian mobilization
	 
    


well, the simple minded green folk of the ruling class are breathing a sigh of relief over the passing of the nightmare of european ground war.  those suckers of the jism of white guilt that are our progressive betters can now go back to their stalking and bullying of mayor ford.  not you, though.  the next time the russians mobilize along their borders they will have more troops.  this concerns you.  the next cruise missile that hits the gardiner expressway could well be theirs.

 as we speak, bridges are being built.  the twinkle intellects of the left think bridges are for dialogue, not rail cars loaded with tanks.  airfields are being expanded and hardened.  nco's are being trained, and a new crop of junior officers.  the colonels have been studying secret studies of your weaknesses.  how to exploit them.  ministers, deputies, directors of department are realigning the economy into the total war economy.  and, what have you been doing?  drinking beer and getting fat.  gloating over your plus prime pension.  the war god, mars, has plans for you, lard ass. so, tell me ... what economic mobilization have you done?

of course, nothing.  same brilliant economic strategy as 1933 to 1939.  that is six years.  how big will the russian mobilization be in 2020?  how outnumbered can you count?

	 no nepotism here
	 
    


something rather unsettling about the morning radio today: the cbc was not whining about mayor ford.  instead, they were whining about the leaving of veteran news hound whats his name mcintyre.  who?

nice guy whats his name (he wrote a book, books.  you have not read them unless your were forced to in school ...) wants to save jobs for junior journolists.  like his son, who already works at the cbc.  guess what, his wife works at the cbc, too.  

what about mayor ford?

	 what the hell am i?
	 
    


i'm starting to run out of strange and bizarre animals to post about, i may have to start using the cast members from rent. that'll mess you up real good.let's see what this abomination is all about:are characterised by a gelatinous, mostly scaleless, globose body; a large head, and generous complement of menacingly large, sharp, glassy fang-like teeth lining the jaws of a cavernous, oblique mouth. these teeth are depressible and present only in females. in some species there is a scattering of epidermal spinules on the body, and the scales (when present) are conical, hollow, and translucent. they possess an illicium and esca; the former being a modified dorsal spine—the "fishing rod"—and the latter being the bulbous, bioluminescent "fishing lure".while females may reach a length of 18 centimetres or more, males remain under 3 centimetres.that last bit of information takes nancy pelosi out of the equation. hmmmmm.look at all those semi-foreign words above: globose, illicium, gelatinous--all of a sudden i got me a hankerin' for some arby's.this isn't about me though, this is about one of three, who usually guesses this correctly, and so fast in fact that by the time i drive my massive suv to city hall, the answer is already in the comment section waiting for my approval.what the hell am i?labels: what the hell am i?

i love cynthia mckinney. i've always had an attraction to women that are slightly retarded, therefore, cynthia is like a sex goddess to me. i want to wreck this video for you and tell you what happens, but i won't. cynthia wouldn't want me too. let's just say that if you are under the assumption that liberlism is a mental disorder, this is pretty much the proof for your pudding.again, i retrieved something from this aint hell
