my journey with lance (the day the running stopped)


















i've been riding with kevin for 15 years, another 35 before that, and somehow missed this unusual place in the hills behind cupertino. it looks like the abandoned steel mill from the original robocop. 5 sets of tracks! what did this look like when it was in its heyday, manufacturing cement for shasta dam? finding places like this is what makes it so fun to ride a bike! you don't need a car, you don't even need a plan. you just look up into the hills and wonder, what's that? how do i get there? --mikej  we can put that smile on your face. that's really what we sell. smiles. whether it's an ebike to extend your range, a trainer to help stay in shape when it's raining, a mountain bike to get completely away from cars or bikes for your kids so you're not driving them to school. we've got it. and more. can you build or finish the assembly of my ebike? currently chain reaction is certified for bosch, shimano, tq, fazua, beps and hyena. these are popular with the better brands found in many bike shops, but on-line bikes are usually using other, less-well-supported drive systems. assembly should be done only by a shop certified for the drive system your bike uses. we encourage you to contact whomever you purchased your on-line ebike from to find out if they have authorized service available where you live, before buying the bike. do not accept the line "we use standard components any shop can work with." it's usually a cover for not providing adequate support for local dealer service. no repairs on scooters. we no longer do any repairs of scooters. it's not our area of expertise and we have yet to see one that's ul2849 certified, so our insurance company doesn't like them either. at least 5 bike shops have burned down due to electric scooters and electric bikes left for repair.











our 45th anniversary present to you- tire & tube changes made easy!you're not wrong- modern tires and tubes are more difficult to install than they used to be. more strength and prybar-like tools aren't the answer. you can out-smart that tough tire using technique! our video will help make your next tire or tube change much easier! and since guys don't follow directions, women can watch this and show the boys how it's done. :-)feb 1, 1980- chain reaction bicycles opened for business. same ownership, same management, since day 1! life goes by at just the right speed on a bike. it's just as true today as it was 45 years ago.






drastically reduced prices on a lot of bikes!
