horses are the largest animal with which most humans 
	can form a lasting bond. they are the subject of great interest and mystery. 
	being physically in the presence of a horse has a calming effect on many of 
	us, such that we lose track of time. we hope this site will provide you

	horses of particular use to you and unravel some of the mystery of the horse

	a few kentucky derby stories. 
	as you'll see, these stories are about derby fans experiences. there's the 
	race itself and there's the fan happenings associated with the race. the 
	stories may be about either or both.

	horseworlddata@aol.com.
