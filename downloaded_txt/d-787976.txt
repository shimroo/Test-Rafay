full bio











latest release 







fareed haque 
 



casseus! 



there’s an argument to be made that haitian-american guitarist-composer frantz cassus (1915-1993) was one of the most overlooked figures in modern classical music. by fusing the european classical tradition with haitian folk elements, the “father of haitian classical guitar” developed a distinctive vocabulary on his instrument that was at once full of contrapuntal complexity and teeming with driving rhythm. those qualities caught the ear of chicago-based fareed haque, a modern guitar virtuoso who has tirelessly explored the realms of jazz, funk, fusion,latin, world music and classical over the past four decades.
