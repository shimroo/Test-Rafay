we wouldn’t go anywhere else. great chalets, awesome prices, and great service. thank you guys for so many years (48+ to be exact) of awesome service that’s made our vacations special (2-3 each year). tom and team, you are doing a great job carrying on this business that your family started.

absolutely the best cabin rental company in the smokies! we have been staying with mountain laurel chalets for over 18 years. we would not think of going anywhere else. it's our home away from home. staying with mountain laurel chalets is like staying with family!

we checked in after-hours and were impressed with how the office handled it! we had no issues whatsoever during the stay. we also made use of the amenities and enjoyed the free ticket to dollywood! mountain roads are new to my family, but we grew to love the drive and adored the view. we even saw a few bears! i have recommended mountain laurel chalets to all my friends and family looking to visit the area! i hope to plan a trip this year as well. easily five stars.

mountain laurel chalets is the best, hands down! they are a local, family-owned business with 50+ years of experience. and they have so many cabins to choose from! we have been using for 10+ years, and after some of the nightmare stories i’ve been hearing about other rental companies, i won’t ever switch.

this was our 5th stay and we are always sad to leave! we already have 3 more stays booked with mountain laurel chalets. we have been vacationing in gatlinburg for 50 years, and mlc is hands-down the best company we have ever vacationed with.

we originally booked our stay with another company, but unfortunately it didn't go as planned. so we called mountain laurel chalets to make a last-minute booking and chris, who was very accommodating, made it possible for us to get a place where we could stay that same day once we explained our situation. his patience and professionalism got us the most beautiful place to stay for our vacation! my family and i will definitely come back and book with you again, and we will definitely recommend mountain laurel chalets to our family and friends!
