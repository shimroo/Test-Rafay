history
since 1937, the fels institute of government at the university of pennsylvania has pioneered the training and practice of public administration. today, we continue to build on our legacy preparing the next generation of public leaders.
the heart of the fels institute of government is fox-fels hall, referred to by the fels community as “the mansion.” dating back to 1907, the colonial revival was originally the home of american philanthropist, humanitarian, and businessman samuel s. fels. in 1950, it was gifted to penn to house the fels institute of government. the history-rich mansion has been our program’s home ever since, providing classrooms and study spots for our students, offices for our administrative team, and indoor and outdoor gathering spaces for a host of student and alumni events held throughout the year.
