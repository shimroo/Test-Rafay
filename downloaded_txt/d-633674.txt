bobwhite quailsouth texas is one of the few places left that has an abundance of bobwhite quail and the mariposa ranch is the premier spot in north america for hunting these wild birds. the dog power of the mariposa ranch is provided by six gun kennel. mike miller is the lead guide for this operation and his string of english pointers are among the top wild bird dogs in the country.



hogan invasive species to texas, we will gladly take you out on a pig hunt. typically, you’ll hunt in blinds over feeders but sometimes it’s possible to hunt them out in the bush. hogs at mariposa ranch can easily reach over 300lbs. 



whitetail deerwhitetail bucks are the most sought after north american game animal, and the mariposa ranch bears some of the best whitetail habitat in the country. with a whitetail population of over 3,500 on the ranch, the average b&c score is 135 to 140 and the average age is 6.5 to 7 years old. at the mariposa ranch, the most difficult aspect of hunting is deciding which buck to shoot!                                                                              



turkeywe have a huge turkey population with beard lengths averaging over 10 inches and spur lengths averaging 1.25 inches. at the mariposa ranch, there is no reason not to take home a trophy bird!



nilgaiimported several decades ago, the nilgai, or blue indian antelope, has proliferated in south texas.  fortunately not overrun with these animals, the mariposa ranch has healthy herds that roam freely.  extremely elusive and weighing up to 700 pounds, the nilgai is not only difficult to hunt, but even tougher to bring down.  a magnum caliber rifle and a well placed shot are essential.



dovecome early january, the mesquite trees are covered in doves. our hunts primarily hunt over the water holes late in the afternoon when the birds need to drink. if you are a crack shot - we’ve seen limits in under 15 minutes. 

    


“a hunt based only on trophies taken falls far short of what the ultimate goal should be . . . time to commune with your inner soul as you share the outdoors with the birds, animals, and fish that live there.”

— fred bear
