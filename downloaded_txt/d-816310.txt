about
the parade

     




the
annual dacula memorial day parade will once again step off on monday,
may 26,
2025 at 10:00 a.m. the parade takes place rain or shine (unless there
are active serious thunderstorms in the area). 
there is no rain date.

founded
by marvin atherton, the dacula memorial day parade has been a proud
tradition in dacula since 1994. the parade has grown over the years
with about 100 units participating in the parade each year! families
begin to line the street hours before the parade begins. there are
10,000 plus spectators lining the parade route when the parade steps
off at 10:00 a.m.

the annual dacula memorial day parade is one of the most high profile
events
in the metro atlanta area on memorial day. it is important that we take
this opportunity to honor the sacrifice made by thousands of americans
who died guarding our precious liberties and way of life. as founder of
the dacula memorial day parade, it is my goal to see that today's youth
understand the significance of memorial day. for this reason, every
participating parade unit is to focus on honoring our fallen heroes and
display
patriotism.

the parade features our fallen heores, veterans, veterans
organizations, active and reserve service men and women, active and
restored military vehicles, marching bands, scouts, churches, community
groups, local businesses, horses, antique and classic cars, tractors
and much more!

we hope you will plan to join us while we honor those who gave their
lives for our freedom!
