a unique way of life

ocean reef is more than a club, it’s family; a family that holds tradition, privacy and belonging at its core. that’s why generations of members continue to connect and to enjoy the countless amenities all within this private club community.








honor, tradition and camaraderie.

as golf clubs go, ocean reef club’s traditions go back more than half-a-century to 1955, when the first 9-hole course opened. today the club boasts two championship 18-hole courses, a rarity in the florida keys – even among standard golf clubs.
