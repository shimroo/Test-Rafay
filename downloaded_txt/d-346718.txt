  welcome to boulder city, nv

 



    discover ~ explore ~ unwindwe're so proud of our quaint, little town of boulder city.we want you to be our guest in experiencing a little of its historic charm

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

   



 




boulder city, is the only incorporated city in nevada without gaming and home of the state's number one tourist attraction, hoover dam. this is a wholesome, family-oriented community, with a significant retirement sector, that takes pride in its low crime rate and high-quality police and fire protection. we are ideally located between the entertainment and excitement of las vegas and henderson and the recreation paradise of the lake mead national recreation area, containing north america's largest man-made lake. boulder city is home to the first designated national water trail in the desert southwest.
