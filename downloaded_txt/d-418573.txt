		"best location on south beach"	

				he cadet hotel is my home away from home. thank you, ricardo and sylvia, and all for taking good care of me. i love the hotel because is small, quiet.  a wonderful respite from the hustle, yet so close to everything. i will be back perhaps my favorite hotel ever.
