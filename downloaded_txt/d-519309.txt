a sanctuary for interspecies healing and learning

   







  

our farm is dedicated to right relations between all beings, and the seven natural laws embodied by animals.  respect, courage, honesty, wisdom, humility, love, integrity. we serve as a bridge connecting animals, humans and natural ways of balance, to access what lies beyond language and deepen the possibilities of human presence. our intent is to provide teachings, trainings and therapies to enhance and expand the understanding of our subtle natures, restore our relationship with the seasons, the cycles, the elements, and our ancestors.  to offer a supportive space for self discovery, growth, and future generations.

  




  











we offer a variety of services, educational workshops, retreats and individual therapies for people and canines, and the expansive nature of this relationship. looking forward, the farm will be placed in conservancy, allowing a continually evolving model for co-existence.
