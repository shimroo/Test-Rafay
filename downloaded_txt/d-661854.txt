this is a long overdue thank you for repairing our retaining wall this spring. it looks extremely handsome now, and we appreciate the work of your crew. also, we were grateful that you could finish the repairs before july 4th. with the independence day parade on our street, we wanted the yard to look attractive. in the future we’ll call nature scape for landscaping because we were so pleased with your work.
