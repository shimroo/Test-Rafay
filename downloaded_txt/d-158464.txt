it is with great pride we welcome you to the church of scientology detroit.
since 1963, we have served a growing congregation in the motor city and surrounding area. today, from our landmark location in the heart of our newly resurgent city, we are honored to extend our help to communities in our region and beyond.
our church realizes scientology founder l. ron hubbard’s vision that all churches of scientology become what he termed ideal organizations (orgs). ideal orgs not only provide the ideal facilities to service scientologists on their ascent to higher states of spiritual freedom, but they also serve as a home for the entire community and a meeting ground of cooperative effort to uplift people of all denominations.

                            kalindi—student
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet kalindi, who used l. ron hubbard's study technology to solve her difficulties with studying and learning.
“i always wanted to study and i couldn't learn how to read and write,” says kalindi. “i found out that in scientology, there's a lot of information about how you can educate yourself and improve your life. i did all the basic courses.  now i can read anything.”








                                                    
                            ryan—firefighter
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet ryan, a firefighter from the united states.“in scientology, i’ve learned certain technologies about how to deal with emergencies and how to deal with chaos and how to deal with confusion,” says ryan. “apply a little bit of the scientology data and things get better. it’s true in my life and in my problems.”








                                                    
                            linda—dancer
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet linda, a dancer from the usa.“after i got into scientology, i really started expanding and expressing myself and communicating and my art became alive,” says linda. “scientology, it gave me confidence to understand not only myself, it also gave me the confidence to talk to other people until they understood my viewpoint.”








                                                    
                            matt—real estate agent
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet matt, a real estate agent.
“even as an able guy,” says matt, “i had some problems. when i turned to scientology i was able to find the answers to those problems and handle them. i’m at the point now where i’m able to expand and win at life as much as i really want to.”








                                                    
                            paul—architect
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet paul, an architect from the united states.“as an architect, scientology has been incredibly helpful to me,” says paul. “you make determinations about what is necessary and what is needed. you’re trying to build something that you need a lot of information in order to do it. and scientology for me reinforced taking information, creating something with it. it’s just something i can always rely upon. i can handle, really, anything.”








                                                    
                            steve—musician
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet steve, musician from the united states.














                what is scientology?

            

scientology is a religion in its highest meaning, as it helps bring man to total freedom and truth. the essential tenets of scientology are these:

you are an immortal spiritual being.
your experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. and your capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized.
furthermore, man is basically good. he is seeking to survive. and his survival depends upon himself and his fellows and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe.

dianetics: the modern science of mental health
by l. ron hubbard
indisputably the most widely read and influential book ever written about the human mind, dianetics fully describes the reactive mind, the previously unknown source of nightmares, unreasonable fears, upsets and insecurities, and how to get rid of it.
