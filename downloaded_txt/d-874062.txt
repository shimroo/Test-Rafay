this company showed up for my daughter's birthday on time and jumpy house was clean. the last company i used delivered a jumpy that was really dirty and unsanitary. i will recommend this company to my friends and extended family. thanks rebecca's!!!

i had an excellent experience with this company. we rented a 14 foot water slide for my sons 4th birthday. the slide was set up two hours before the party and picked up a few hours after the party was over. very smooth customer service throughout the whole booking, set up and take down. we had a great time and i would highly recommend this company to anyone!!

we hired them to provide some games, a popcorn machine, cotton candy machine, and a spin art machine. there were some communication problems, but everything was delivered on time. the delivery guy did a good job explaining how to operate the machines.

picked this party rental for my college graduation. everyone including the adults had a bouncing blast. the business office was very helpful over the phone or you can rent online. they dropped everything off and picked it up very close to the intended times. was priced reasonably and it absolutely made my day. so glad i rented with rebecca's jolly jumps.
