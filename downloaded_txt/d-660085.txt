five 
		star charters is a family owned operation based in gold beach,  
		oregon.  we offer ocean charter boat and guided river fishing 
		services.  the ocean and nearby rivers offer world class fishing 
		many months of the year.  look at the fish schedule to see which 
		types of fish we catch depending on the time of year.  we have 4 
		river boats including 2 drift boats and 2 power boats as well as 2 ocean 
		boats to fit your needs.  




depending on the type of 
					fishing and the time of year our river boats can accommodate 
					2 to 4 people while our ocean boats hold 6.  our trips 
					range from a 
					5 
					hr. bottom fish charter to a full day salmon, steelhead and 
					other bottom fish charter.  we offer a full range of 
					tackle including lures, bait and fly gear.  no 
					experience needed.  we take the novice to the expert 
					fisherman.  try a combination package with bottom fish 
					in the morning and a salmon bay troll trip in the afternoon.  
					it's one of our most popular charters.  we can organize 
					and accommodate any size of group.  give us a call.
