our mission is to illuminate the lives and legacy of clara and henry ford for our visitors through the preservation and re-imagination of their beloved estate.

























happy valentine's day! ♥️

henry and clara met at a new year's dance in 1885 and quickly fell in love. they were married on april 11, 1888 (the same day as clara's birthday). together, they faced many ups and downs, but stayed as devoted to each other as the day they met.

we hope that henry and clara's love story leaves you feeling as inspired as it does us.

#dyk the fair lane estate property during clara and henry’s lives extended all the way from ford road to the north down to michigan avenue, and from where southfield fwy is now located west to brady street in what was then called the village of dearborn?  the original entrance road to fair lane intersected with michigan avenue.

on today's #museummonday, we want to highlight the garage.

in the garage, there is the famed turntable, which served two purposes. it provided a way for the vehicles to turn around and allowed the water used for washing the car to gather at the lowest point at the center of the turntable, where the central drain removed the wash water.

henry purchased this turntable from the canton foundry & machine co. one of the photos below shows the receipt. the other photo (from the book the auto's turn: a true story by poyser, john r.) shows the ""universal"" turntable that henry purchased for fair lane. 

later this month, we'll feature what the patent looked like for this turntable along with more information!

lately, our team has been asked when we will open the house to the public for tours. 

we are expecting to expand access and programming in early 2027. currently, the home is open for member-only events, fair lane music guild concerts, and tours during our annual restoration showcase in may for historic preservation month.

#fairlane #dearborn










recently, we hosted a university of michigan-dearborn art history class, during which students learned about the history behind #fairlane and the lives of henry and clara ford. 

our team loves it when we can partner with neighboring companies, organizations, and universities!
