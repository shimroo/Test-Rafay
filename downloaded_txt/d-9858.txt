total solutions for pipeline rehab.
insituform















the experts in cured-in-place pipe (cipp)
over 50 years ago, insituform® invented cipp to protect and restore pipelines, reduce infiltration, increase flow and improve water quality. today, we have numerous solutions for water and wastewater pipelines, from gravity to high pressure mains; a proven alternative to disruptive and costly pipe replacement. 
insituform is the gold standard for pipeline renewal across multiple sectors: municipal, industrial, dot, military, airports, fire protection and the list goes on.  our manufacturing and wetout facilities in north america and europe are iso certified with strict quality control standards.

less disruptive, up to 50% more efficient


transmission mains; small to large diameter; low and high pressure


mechanical service connection reinstatement (from inside the pipe)
