bizforsale was established in 1998 and is probably the oldest "business sales" portal in the southern africa region. having been in the online business for over 25 years we have honed a website and model that works well for buyers, sellers and brokers.  we ourselves are not brokers  -  we simply provide sellers with leads and if a sale results then the seller pays a small commission.  this gives sellers, including brokers, the opportunity to advertise widely at no upfront cost which can minimise the major cost in selling.

at times this website receives up to 20,000 unique visitors per month. about 75% of listings are placed by brokers and there are no up front, monthly or other fees. we also provide brokers with inbound leads from buyers looking for businesses to source or for assistance in selling their businesses.

the real synergy that we can offer you is that we have wide national reach and excellent international traffic. for an endorsement of our services, can we suggest that you contact any of the brokers listed on our recommended brokers page. almost all the brokers listing with us have been participating for several years which is an endorsement of the quality of enquiries that the site generates.

it is also important for buyers to understand that we operate as an advertising and contact service and, in the normal course of events, we would not have any personal contact with the people making enquiries. copies of buyer's enquiry forms are emailed to us for control purposes only and the original enquiry is emailed directly to the seller.
