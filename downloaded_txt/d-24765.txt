latest updates

don't find this when you try to access eos!  
most of the time, i can make up the little 
                        differences, and sometimes big ones, between the amount 
                        of donations our site receives each month and the cost 
                        of remaining on the net.  this month, due to a 
                        current financial crisis, i will be unable to do so.  
                        if eos donations do not meet its expenses, eos will go 
                        away.
it will do so with dignity and pride after serving 
                        the soap internet world for 8 years, bringing the 
                        brightest, most clever and entertaining minds of soap 
                        commentary to you for almost a decade.  
staff, readers, fans and friends, your donations 
                        are critical this month!  our expenses are due on 
                        monday, september 15th!

                        - confessions of a media ho
                        by karen h - gh & amc















                        kendall is seeing the side of zach that he normally 
                        conceals fairly well. who can blame him, though, as he 
                        believes josh embezzled #20 million from him. guess josh 
                        should have thought twice before giving his inheritance 
                        to the miranda center. but heck, as he put it, he wasn't 
                        supposed to be among the living, anyway, thanks to what 
                        erica thought she'd done all those years ago.

break out the confetti!  sound 
                        the trumpet! play the hallelujah chorus!  the down, 
                        dirty, sex in a limo has seen the light of day!  please 
                        have a champagne mojito on the house, not too dry, not 
                        too sweet, but full of punch!  honestly, folks i was 
                        afraid this secret would never come out again.  color me 
                        shocked that the powers that be were just waiting for a 
                        good moment to spill the beans.  after a year when 
                        everyone in town except lucky knew that jake was born in 
                        a leather jacket, id lost hope that secrets could be 
                        kept longer than a sweeps season.

                    witty and wise observations about the latest amc spoilers.








9/5 
                    - a cynic soaps up
by kate roach brown - amc







greenlees attitude about ryans 
                      feelings provides a nice counterpoint to kendalls 
                      complete, utter and totally obnoxious obsession with them. 
                      if kendall really has everything i ever wanted, why 
                      isnt she spending time enjoying her own life?  my theory 
                      is that kendall is more like her mother than she realizes.

i'm directing this barb straight 
                            at your heart, bobby guza... you have trashed this 
                            show and these characters more than enough as it 
                            is.  you have turned the pcpd into nothing more than 
                            a cracker box full of goofy cartoon cops who 
                            couldn't find their way out of a paper bag, let 
                            alone to a crime scene.
