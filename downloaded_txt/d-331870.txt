what if i have no experience, what is right for me?the majority of our students start with no experience. it's understandable to feel anxious/nervous. we have a friendly community spirit that is the bedrock of our culture. it's ok to try a few classes and see what resonates with you. if our school isn't the right one for you we will talk you out of joining. a lot of beginners have started their marital arts journey with us. we look forward to meeting you!

what happens in a typical class?depending on the instructor and the art it can vary. generally there will be a warm-up, new techniques are introduced and practiced with a partner. there is sometimes live situational training at the appropriate level. at the end of classes there is usually a cardio component. most classes are 60 min long. with 2 classrooms we have over 70 times each week where people train

who will coach me?we have a variety of different instructors who are all certified to teach in their discipline(s). many of our instructors have traveled, trained and competed all over the world. we regularly have students visiting from other countries and across the usa because of the level of coaching we provide. who will i be practicing with?classmates come from all backgrounds, sizes, abilities, genders and experiences. much of the work we do requires practicing with classmate, because combat is always with another individual. we pride ourselves on the friendly community and team spirit we have built over the years.do i have to spar?the short answer is no. the longer answer is to be proficient at combat you must practice against a resisting opponent to develop skills that could save your life. we have developed one of the best sparring cultures in mn. our students work diligently to keep each other safe and to be in a learning zone.

will i get hurt?there is risk with any physical activity and minor injuries do happen sometimes. because of the inherent dangers of combative martial arts, the heightened awareness of safety keeps most people from any sort of catastrophic injury. the goal of our practice is developing real combat skills in a safe manner. continued practice requires being un injured and therefore we use methods of learning that are safe and effective. is this stuff for fighters only?no!! the majority of our students are regular folks who are looking for a hobby that promotes well being, strength, confidence, energy, friendship, teamwork, how does martial arts enhance happiness and well being?humans can flourish by pursuing happiness indirectly. by seeking out physical, intellectual & emotional challenges with a supportive group we can enhance our well being and experience more happiness.hear it from our community
