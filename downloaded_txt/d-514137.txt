industrial construction faqs 










what type of industrial buildings do you build?

we design and construction industrial and commercial buildings that are future ready.  from warehouses and packing facilities to workshops, aircraft hangars, feedlot covers and agricultural specific sheds.  each and every clearspan building is tailor designed to suit your commercial operations and needs. customisations might include roofing styles, colours and additional features like insulation and ventilation, racking, gantries, glazing and other options that will meet your specific needs. 







what are the benefits of using steel in the construction process?

opting for a steel frame shed brings several advantages. primarily, steel is highly durable and resistant to termites, rot and fire, making it a superior choice for extreme conditions. steel sheds require minimal maintenance, which can save time and money over their lifespan. additionally, steel is a sustainable material as it is recyclable without losing quality. these sheds offer flexibility in design, allowing for clear spans and customisable layouts to maximise usable space.







do you fabricate and supply residential steel structures and sheds?

no. we build commercial scale projects – we do not sell residential sheds, kit homes, barns or garages. 







do you deliver projects outside of toowoomba?

yes. we can deliver commercial construction projects in south east queensland, the western downs, far north queensland and northern nsw.

four daughters beef: feedlot roof covertake a tour of the large feedlot roof structure for our client, four daughters beef. we collaborated closely with our client to deliver an investment that would create comfortable conditions for their cattle all year round.one crucial design aspect was to achieve adequate airflow for the cattle – with the 22.5 degree pitch and custom designed ridge vent almost 16m high, the temperature difference when standing underneath is significant.

design thinking for industrial construction 



design thinking is a methodology that can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when designers and scholars started to explore interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving.
fast forward to 2024 and the practice is becoming more and more prominent in architecture and building design with a view to developing innovative solutions for clients by getting to know their needs and points of view in more detail.
at clearspan, we put particular emphasis on a “client focused approach”.  our ethos is to collaborate with our clients and find material and design solutions that will improve efficiency, safety and productivity across the projects that we build.
a great example of client collaboration to industrial construction is our recent project for an agricultural client.
this particular client holds and distributes highly corrosive materials and therefore had very specific needs in terms of their design brief. 
their new building needed to maximise safety for staff and be built with longevity in mind.
in collaboration with our client, our team created an industrial building design that was specific to their needs and utilised innovative materials that would best meet the unique operating conditions of the company.
to address the issues associated with the highly corrosive products the client stored, clearspan utilised a series of specific design elements:

wagners cft purlins along with full fiberglass roof and wall sheeting, stainless steel fixings and flashings. these products were selected as typical steel building products would corrode and rust out in a short timeframe.
a specific paint system for the building’s structural steel tailored to protect against specific stored products. again, traditional options such as hot dip galvanizing would not stand up to the high corrosive environment.
tilt panels to hold product with force from front end loaders incorporated into the design

the resulting design presented the client with a building that would not only meet their safety requirements but would also minimise corrosion to the building over time – improving the lifespan of the structure.
the project is an excellent example of how innovative design and understanding the operations of our client’s achieves better value outcomes for all involved.
