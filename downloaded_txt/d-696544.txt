sex and the ai city…





 “hey siri, write me an opening line to a sex and the city episode but with a bit more oomph to it”my relationship with big wasn’t the only thing i blew up that day. at the trinity test site i detonated the first plutonium bomb, unleashing a 22 kilotonne blast. had i become death, destroyer of worlds? meanwhile uptown, samantha had her hands full with her own “manhattan project”…

ghent…





 lovely day out wandering around the city of ghent / gant / gent / gand / gaunt. the castle of the counts (yes, we had to double check that) was fun. as were the jupiler beer and chips.
