						aviation law is a complex discipline that consists of 
						operators, pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers, 
						manufacturers, and 
						the laws that govern their activities. it is a 
						specialized field that requires not only a strong 
						background in law but a thorough understanding 
						of aviation.  
it can include 
						defending a pilot from a potential federal aviation 
						regulation violation or a family member who lost their 
						life or was seriously injured in an aircraft accident. 
						contact our experienced staff for an initial free
