welcome


you found my home on the internet! there’s really nothing to see here yet. why hurry making a website hardly anyone will ever see?
so how about reading a random page from wikipedia instead?
since you can’t resist reading more … here are some things i care about. see also the top menu for categories.
some projects i support with a small donation are freecad, osarch, liberapay, matrix, mastodon, fosstodon & f-droid. i am also a member of free software foundation (usa) & free software foundation europe’s & their danish group.
osarch is open source in architecture, engineering & construction. you’ll find me all around the organization.

mastodon


here’s my mastodon.social feed
