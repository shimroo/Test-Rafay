disney fun 





~ this post includes affiliate links ~when i was at my local michaels some time ago, i saw this cute little kit to crochet disney characters, and i couldn't resist. i used worsted weight yarn and the suggested hook for it instead of the yarn and hook in the kit and crocheted these. 😊aren't they just adorable??  💗💗💗i actually made 3 dumbos (one for me, my sil, and a dear friend) and the mickey and the minnie went to my other dear friend. not sure if michaels still carries the kit, but you can find the book alone on amazon.what are you crocheting lately?  probably some christmas gifts? i've made another fun thing and i will post about that later. 😏
