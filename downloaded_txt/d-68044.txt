rising above great dane funding | facebook


    we are excited to announce a new partnership with rising above great dane funding. this partnership is a major step toward the ongoing commitment we have to our adopters and hope you are as excited as we are.
    rising above great dane funding is a 501c3 non-profit organization whose mission is to provide financial assistance to great dane parents experiencing economic hardship. so, what does this mean for our adopters?
    this means our previous adopters are eligible to apply for financial support if their great dane requires veterinary care that cannot be afforded due to economic hardship and extenuating circumstances; even if the adopters are outside of rising above’s coverage area.
    we adopt great danes to families for a reason, so this further solidifies our commitment to finding loving, forever homes for our great danes. life and finances don’t always go as planned and we all need a helping hand at times. please show your support by following their page at the link above and sharing the exciting news!
