kiwi production
kiwifruit is native to north-central and eastern china. it is also known as the chinese gooseberry, as it was first described in the west from its resemblance to a gooseberry. the fruit was brought to new zealand from china in the early 20th century, and the kiwifruit was given the name ‘chinese gooseberry’. later, when it was discovered that the fruit was from the genus actinidia, it was renamed ‘kiwifruit’.
how to plant a kiwi
kiwifruit (actinidia deliciosa) is a delicious, nutritious fruit that can be grown in home gardens with a little care. here‘s what you need to know to get started. kiwifruit are climbing plants, so they will need support in the form of a trellis, fence, or other structure to grow on. plant kiwifruit in early spring in a sunny location with well–drained soil. space plants 8–10 feet apart to allow room for growth. kiwifruit are vigorous growers and will need regular pruning to keep them under control. prune kiwifruit in late winter or early spring, before new growth begins. remove any dead or damaged branches, and thin out crowded areas to encourage good air circulation.
kiwifruit is a rich source of vitamin c, containing more than twice the amount found in a same-size serving of orange. it is also a good source of dietary fiber and potassium. kiwifruit has a relatively short shelf life, so it is often eaten soon after it is harvested.

kiwifruit are heavy feeders and will need to be fertilized regularly to produce good fruit yields. apply a balanced fertilizer (such as 10–10–10) in early spring and again in mid–summer. water kiwifruit plants deeply and regularly during the growing season to keep the soil moist but not soggy. mulch around plants to help conserve moisture and keep weeds under control. kiwifruit are typically ready to harvest in late fall or early winter. cut fruits from the vine with a sharp knife, being careful not to damage the plant.
fruits can be stored in a cool, dark place for several weeks. with a little care, kiwifruit can be a delicious and rewarding addition to the home garden!
why are they healthy?
kiwi fruits are a good source of vitamins c and e, which are both important for maintaining a healthy immune system. kiwi fruits are also a good source of potassium, which is necessary for maintaining proper fluid balance in the body. additionally, kiwi fruits contain antioxidants and fiber, both of which can help to promote good health.
