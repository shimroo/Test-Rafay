if you are a california resident, when you submit a right to know, right to access, right to delete, or right to correct request through one of the methods provided above, we will ask you to provide some information in order to verify your identity and respond to your request. specifically, we will ask you to verify information that can be used to link your identity to particular records in our possession, which depends on the nature of your relationship and interaction with us. for example, we may need you to provide your name, email, phone number, ip address, browser id, amount of your last purchase with the business, and/or date of your last transaction with the business.
