the house was amazing, very clean all the amenities we
                                                needed. perfect service with the rental company too. i would absolutely
                                                recommend to rent this property.

                                                customer service - nothing was too much trouble. i highly recommend them
                                            




victoria mcanespie







just to say that we enjoyed the villa. we needed help on a
                                                couple of occasions and received prompt service. we are a family of
                                                satisfied customers.




the mcdermids







the holiday was superb. we have been in florida for the
                                                past 15 years and this was one of the best villas yet. may be tempted
                                                back next time!
