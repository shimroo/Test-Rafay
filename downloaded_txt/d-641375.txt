earth day, communes, & the fear of failure
posted by johnny_mango on april 26, 2011 at 10:00amview blog





nob
 hill--whatever the calendar says, earth day in nob hill means one 
thing:  the big street fair on silver ave. just behind la montanita
 co-op.  this year the "real" earth day was a week late.  the 
party occurred the week before.  and if you missed it, be assured 
all the regulars were there, fig man, bedding plant growers, various 
dancers and bands, bicycle groups, advocates for humanitarian causes, 
batik tee-shirt vendors. etc.but the buzz was all about 
bees.  hey, i always thought there were two kinds of bees:  
honey bees and bumble bees.  it turns out my thinking was a little 
bit off the mark.  there are actually about 20,000 different 
species of bees.  and from listening to the people at the bee 
table, i got the impression that there are maybe 100 varieties of bees 
right here in abq, some of them no bigger than flies.stumpsnow i have been worried about the health of bees for several years, even counting the bees hanging out
 on my fruit trees.  i'm pretty sure i had not recognized some of 
the smaller varieties as bees at all.  this is to say nothing about
 the other pollinators such as moths.  i guess i feel a little bit 
better knowing all our bees aren't coming out of one hive.they 
were giving away bee hatching stumps.  these slices of logs have 
lots of different size holes in them where different size bees can lay 
their eggs.  i was told to lay the log on its side with the holes 
facing east.  it should get some afternoon shade and be about half a
 foot off the ground.  well i can do that, i thought.  i'm not
 sure i understand the whole stump story, but i can follow directions.job killersi
 think a lot of people are sort of leery of being part of anything 
called "earth day."  for one thing, any project involving saving 
the earth seems just a little too big for the average person.  for 
another, you might get called names...like tree-hugger or hippie.  
and people throw out phrases with derision such as "save-the-minnow" 
just to make you feel stupid.  gas, oil, and coal companies want to
 make you feel like a "job killer" and are spending lots of money on tv 
ads to make sure you know you will be laughed at, or worse.even
 the governor of the state of new mexico thinks you are misinformed or 
stupid...as she tried to undo pollution restrictions for power plants 
and pit rules for the oil & gas industry.  meanwhile, fool that
 i am, i put my bee hatching stump in the back yard.  i guess i'm 
convinced that many people doing small things can make a big difference.vietnamearth
 day started in 1970, largely as a result of senator gaylord nelson of 
wisconsin.  but you really can't talk about that period without 
mentioning the vietnam war.  it is a large part of everything in 
the late 60's and early 70's.  and it speaks to whether the goals 
of earth day are ultimately just a little too big for any kind of 
rational commitment.  i say just look at the generation who were 
under 30 years of age during the vietnam war.  they had a 
goal:  to stop a large land war in asia involving half a million 
troops and tens of thousands of deaths.before our involvement over there america didn't even know where vietnam was.  most people still remembered
 it as part of french indo-china.  during wwii it was occupied by 
the japanese.  the french had tried to reclaim that part of their 
empire after the war and the vietnamese people resisted the 
reoccupation.  i was in grade school when the french forces at dien bien phu
 fell, ending the french attempt to take back southeast asia.  but 
by the time of american involvement, a decade had passed.  as a 
nation we knew nothing about vietnam.earth day"teach-ins"
 had to be instituted on college campuses across america.  they 
were usually lectures and q&a done by university professors in 
auditoriums.  they lasted well into the night.  nobody knew 
anything.  everything had to be explained:  french 
colonialism, nationalism, the nature of a jungle war, guerrilla warfare,
 revolution, the "domino theory," the draft, the buddhist monk 
immolations, the corruption, the lies, wars of attrition, the 
willingness of the enemy to die.  nobody knew...and most did not 
want to know.but teach-ins also gave birth to another idea:  earth day!  here's senator gaylord nelson's talking about the summer of 1969:  "i
 still hoped for some idea that would thrust the environment into the 
political mainstream. six years would pass before the idea that became 
earth day occurred to me while on a conservation speaking tour out west 
in the summer of 1969. at the time, anti-vietnam war demonstrations,
 called "teach-ins," had spread to college campuses all across the 
nation. suddenly, the idea occurred to me - why not organize a huge 
grassroots protest over what was happening to our environment?"environmental crisisand on november 30th of that year the new york times ran the following:  "rising
 concern about the environmental crisis is sweeping the nation's 
campuses with an intensity that may be on its way to eclipsing student 
discontent over the war in vietnam...a national day of observance of 
environmental problems...is being planned for next spring...when a 
nationwide environmental 'teach-in'...coordinated from the office of 
senator gaylord nelson is planned...."peaceniksthe
 war in vietnam got passed from kennedy to johnson to nixon.  and 
trying to stop it sounded like a quixotic task.  you can imagine 
(or remember) what people thought.  "it's hopeless.  it's too 
big.  it can't be done.  you will be an outcast if you speak 
out."  families were torn apart.  kids left home.president
 richard nixon called a whole generation of college kids, "punks." 
 the word "peacenik" was also used quite regularly.  it followed a 
path from the soviet sputnik to beatnik to peacenik...highlighting the 
"spaced-out" similarities of all three.  in college back in 
illinois i myself was once assaulted with a tire iron and on another 
occasion kicked down three flights of stairs.  this was not 
particularly unusual.  the police were sometimes even worse.  
even my apartment building in chicago was "raided" several times by the 
police looking for anything they could find.  and then there was 
the 1968 democratic convention in chicago.  i know some of what 
happened.  i was there.communesit is 
no wonder so many urban young people pulled up stakes and left for the 
countryside.  sometimes they found a way to live together away from
 it all.  they formed communes.  it must be remembered that 
this didn't happen very often.  for one thing, somebody had to have
 a boatload of money to use for a land purchase.  i never found 
anybody like that, but i know they existed.  once started, communes
 usually emphasized self-sufficiency
 through farming.  they built their own buildings.  they 
worked hard, made music, fell in love, raised children.  
eventually, over the course of several years, most people drifted away 
and started new projects or jobs or families.i heard a guy on tv
 last week calling the idea of communes "naive" and that they were 
failures because they had a limited life span.  that would be like 
calling going to college a failure because you left before you turned 
50.  you live, you learn, you grow, and you move on.block by blockthe
 idea of starting a new society from scratch with basic beliefs 
involving love, kindness, sharing, respect of the earth, sustainability,
 creative expression, brotherhood, and sisterhood seems just too 
enormous a task to be undertaken.  yet it was done over and over 
again.one of the results of this self-reliant mood among young 
people was the spurt of owner-built homes, especially in new 
mexico.  the rio grande valley is full of these houses, mostly 
built in the 70's and mostly built of adobe.  talk about taking on a
 big project!  where do you even start?  but we did.  my 
wife and i built one.  my brother-in-law and his wife built 
one.  our friend sal and his wife built one.  our next door 
neighbor built one.  they are all over the valley.fear of failuredeep
 inside we fear this job of saving the earth is too big and we are so 
small.  the enemies are too powerful.  we are just a few 
peaceful people in a land seemingly full of armed idiots.  but 
sometimes small individual actions can make a difference:  like 
with the vietnam war...like in starting a new way of living 
together.  but let me give you a bigger and better example.dunkirkin
 late may of 1940 germany was about to wipe out the entire british 
expeditionary force in france.  the only hope the british had was 
to evacuate their army of 340,000 troops by sea.  but their 
destroyers were too big to get close to the beaches and at the end of 
the first day just 7000 soldiers had been ferried or waded out to where 
the ships were and boarded up the gangplanks.  the "little ships of dunkirk" came to their rescue.  even while being attacked by
 german airplanes, a flotilla of around 700 merchant marine boats, 
fishing boats, pleasure craft, and lifeboats (the smallest of which was 
15 feet!) crossed the english channel with their civilian crews and 
helped evacuate the 340,000 british troops.  little 
people...peaceful people in small boats went up against the german war 
machine and came away with the lives of over 300,000 men.the bees in my backyardso
 far i have no tenants in my log condo.  i'm not sure if i'm even 
supposed to.  i have to imagine that laying bee eggs in that stump 
would be something of an "any port in a storm" situation.  still, 
what harm does it do to put it out there--facing east, with shade in the
 afternoon, six inches off the ground.  i've done things that were a
 lot more of a long shot than this.  sometimes it works out.
