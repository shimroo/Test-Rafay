wet zone waterpark		







due to the comprehensive maintenance and repair requirements identified by city staff, we are unable to open the wet zone summer for the 2024 season. although the rowlett city council has allocated funding to immediately begin the process, these projects will not be completed until well after summer ends. we appreciate your patience and understanding as we implement essential improvements for a safe, enhanced wet zone experience in 2025!
