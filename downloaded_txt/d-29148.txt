grandeur, grit, and glory since 1847:a tribute to the history of the grand hotel.
the resort experience, grandly inspired honoring its ties to american freedom, the grand’s unique history is celebrated each day at 3:45 p.m. our registered hotel guests and lakewood members can join the procession that commences by the main lobby fireplace and culminates with a civil war replica cannon firing on the edge of mobile bay at cannon park. following the presentation, a daily lagniappe – or little bite – is presented.

a dynamic coastal destination, the grand has excursions for every taste and pace. active guests can tee off at two championship courses on the famed robert trent jones golf trail, set sail for deep-sea fishing, play tennis or try stand-up paddleboarding. others can indulge gentler pursuits such as horseshoes, poolside relaxation and unwinding in the posh seclusion of a 20,000-square foot, pampering-filled spa. beyond our grounds, explore the eminently walkable fairhope, recognized as one of the most charming small towns in america, with its own french quarter, and numerous intriguing businesses and boutiques.
