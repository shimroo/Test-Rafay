electrical, electronic and computer engineering (eece) is a leading international centre for learning, innovation and knowledge transfer. we equip students and employees for rewarding careers and provide a competitive advantage to industrial sponsors and employers.
we achieve this by delivering both broad and hands-on beng and meng courses focused onto industrially relevant topics, and through cutting edge, world-class technological research. our specialities in microsystems, robotics, intelligent systems, signal and image processing, embedded systems, power electronics and high voltage engineering are uniquely applied internationally across industries such as communications, medical electronics, transport, offshore oil and gas, defence, energy generation/distribution and beyond.
we pride ourselves in providing life enrichment in a caring environment for the transition to graduate and postgraduate engineer, and in delivering word class research outputs that are consistently used by industry as differentiators to generate economic wealth.
