				how to search for properties			

 
there are three ways to search
using quick search:

on the map click on region in france that you are interested in
on the page you are taken to you can then filter the properties by

department
type
number of bedrooms
amount of land
price range



advanced search:
use this if you have very specific criteria or you want to search in more than one region.

area – you can select multiple regions by clicking on region name or multiple/individual departments by clicking on department names
type – again, you can select multple property types. (not all properties are necessarily assigned to a property type. these properties will have been assigned property type ‘any’)

if you find you are getting few or no results, try being more flexble with the search options you are selecting.
search by keyword/ref no
if you know the property reference number, you can use the search box (top right of every page) to find the property.
you can also use this search box to search for a keyword e.g. to find all properties with stables, enter stables in the search box.
save your favourite properties and searches:
by creating a ‘my properties’ account you can save your favourite properties and frequent searches so that they are easily accessible next time you visit.
new property alerts
we have new properties added to the site every day. make sure you don’t miss one matching your criteria by setting up an alert. we’ll email you with details of any newly added properties that match your criteria.
still need help?
then why not email us or phone us on 0845 0530380 to discuss your requirements and let us do the searching for you for free. we pride ourselves on our professional and personal approach.
