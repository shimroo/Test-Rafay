some examples of what we can do at different stages of your construction project 












 




							1. planning and design						


						this is the best time to work with us. if you do not have blueprints yet, we can provide you with ideas to influence your design plans. if you do have blueprints, we can use them to plan a system for any part of your home.					













 




							2. beginning construction						


						still a good time to work with us as we can implement many ideas after the electricians finish their work. you still have plenty of design options available that we can implement.					













 




							3. pre-wire phase						


						this is when we do most of our installation work after the planning stages. if you have reached this point without planning from us, we can move quickly to give you the best options available.					

















 




							4. drywall phase						


						our options are limited to existing rooms. stud placements are fixed and running certain wires becomes difficult. it is still better to involve us at this stage than at later stages.					













 




							5. post-construction						


						there may be some limits without resorting to major renovation work, but we can still design and install numerous options for your home entertainment, automation, and security needs.					













 




							6. completely decorated						


						we can still install a custom system that fits your home's new look. we do all the work and clean everything up like we were never there.					




























general faqs 












what does flat panel mean?

flat panel is a term used to describe thin or flat tvs. some of those options are plasma, lcd, led, or oled.







what is the difference between lcd technology and plasma?

lcd technology traps a liquid-crystal solution between two sheets of glass that is stimulated by an electrical signal. plasma uses a combination of electrical impulses and gases encased in cell structures to form a picture.







what is difference between led and oled?

the exception is oled. televisions based on organic light emitting diode display technology are fundamentally different from lcd tvs. the most basic difference is that each pixel provides its own illumination, while all of the pixels in an lcd tv are illuminated by an led backlight.







where are plasma tvs best suited for?

low-light conditions where the room can be darkened for optimum viewing. although plasma is now a discontinued product, oled would be the current replacement in terms of performance for low light conditions.

testimonialshappy customer reviews 














i have had the good fortune of having advanced-esi design and install my audio/video and lightscaping systems at my home in seagrove, on siesta key. the results have been truly spectacular. indeed their knowledge, responsiveness and professionalism have been exceptional. i value their services and talent so highly that i recommended them to our homeowners association. and in this regard, to the delight and great satisfaction of our entire homeowners community, advanced esi installed the lightscaping for the entire community. i highly recommend advanced esi to those looking for premium and top notch professional service.

what an incredible experience! we had our existing home theater system revamped by advanced esi, which they installed 8 years ago. andreas was a wealth of knowledge and guided us to get the right components for our space and system. installation was a breeze and the crew was meticulous with the installation and tweaking of the system. they walked us thru the entire system and the new features, making sure we ‘got it’ before the tech left. they even helped answer questions, after hours, if something came up. exceptional service and a very knowledgeable staff. this is your one-stop shop for your av & technology needs!

no company better than advanced-esi. we used them when we built our home theater – that was nearly 20 years ago. since then, they have been our go-to for everything we’ve done with tv, sound, equipment, configuration and support. i highly recommend these guys!



terry t






advanced esi was highly recommended to us by our realtors, and now i would do the same! they are professional, knowledgeable, and provide exceptional work.
