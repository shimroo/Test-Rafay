    about us
  





















“hank has been very good to work with and was accommodating when i needed to perform a site inspection. there have been times when i have had questions about various grades/particle size options, and specific questions about how assay was measured. hank was always prompt to respond with the information that i was looking for. we don’t have a lengthy history but it has all been good.  we hope to do business with them for the next 20+ years.”

–jeff campbell, two rivers terminal





“i love working with kmc as they are more of an extended family to us. both parties are transparent with everything we do and discuss. even if the topic were to be something negative on our/their end. trust has been established over the years and this truly shows with our daily transaction for our orders. including our forwarder team, export processes are flawless and our communication level is top notch. it is one of the worry-free accounts i have to this date. we have recently visited their plant and had a wonderful and educational time with the plant tour guided by mr. steven ashlock.” 

–kentaro umemoto, morimura bros. (usa), inc.  





“we wanted to generate a next generation product that had better properties. so kyanite mining corporation helped us with that. we were able to improve on something that we had had to sacrifice on in the past.”

–glenn stephenson





“we began working with kyanite mining corporation when we were looking at a new formulation that was better for our customers and these materials contribute to that. we also wanted a domestic supplier. the composition, the ceramic structure, the makeup [kmc provides] works well for us compared to some alternatives. both the kyanite and the mullite materials have good applications and the cost tends to be lower than some other ceramic raw materials.”

–mark grush, selee corporation 





“in my many years with kyanite mining corporation, i have never had a quality problem or issues."

–corona
