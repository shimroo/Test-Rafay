about white water rafting maine rivers, rafting and camping (tent and rv) and maine cabin rentals packages. 
 know as a leader in rafting maine rivers and as an adventure vacation outfitter and resort company since 1983, we pride ourselves  in rafting maine rivers. we begin our  maine white water rivers trips in april, and end in october. we specialize in running maine rafting trips on the kennebec river,  penobscot river, and dead rivers. in addition, we  pioneered multiple-river whitewater  rafting   trips - where you can raft multiple rivers, or  just  one   river in a single day. you can also choose to run two  different whitewater  rafting rivers in two days. best of all, our maine white water rafting  rivers are all dam-controlled. this means  you can be sure of a great trip - whenever you schedule it! finally,  we  offer rafting and camping, maine cabin rentals,    rv camping packages and custom video production of your entire maine adventure vacation (see the link below for a video covering this service).
