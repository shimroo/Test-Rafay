        graphene ink for 3d printers paves way for new possibilities

              



an environmentally friendly innovation by waterloo engineering researchers unlocks the potential of graphene – a material known for its strength, conductivity and thermal properties – in a diverse range of new areas.
the research team found a way to create the world’s first all-graphene ink for use with 3d printers for potential applications in environmental cleanup, consumer electronics and other fields.

        prof and students wear the iron ring with pride

              



a waterloo engineering professor bestowed the iron ring on her students at this year's iron ring ceremony on campus. now in its 100th year, the ceremony is an important rite of passage for canada's professional engineers, reminding them to work with integrity. 
dr. nadine ibrahim from the department of civil and environmental engineering shares why the iron ring tradition holds enduring relevance for future engineers and the societies they work in.

the university of waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the neutral, anishinaabeg, and haudenosaunee peoples. our main campus is situated on the haldimand tract, the land granted to the six nations that includes six miles on each side of the grand river. our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the office of indigenous relations.
