testimonials























human behaviour can be classified into goal-directed and habitual actions. individuals with certain psychiatric conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and tic disorder, often perform actions disconnected from the value or likelihood of receiving outcomes or rewards. our project aims to develop a novel online experiment to measure such behaviours, coupled with a battery of gold-standard self-reported symptom inventories.
my experience has been superb – being exposed to all aspects of research ranging from data collection and analysis, conducting a systematic review, ethics approval and amendment, collaboration with overseas researchers and software programmers. the incredible support from prof mitchell, dr perkes and the team was invaluable, considering that ilp was my first formal involvement in research. working with a diverse group, comprised of members with backgrounds such as psychology, computer science and science, in addition to medicine, has been tremendously beneficial in improving my teamwork skills. external opportunities such as the behavioural psychology lab meetings were also a part of the holistic experience. all in all, it was a fantastic introduction to academia, which i wish to pursue as a career.
“having a research year during my undergraduate study was an absolute privilege — my mentors have been acting as compasses, giving directions as i explore the ocean of knowledge, equipping me with skills to sail independently as a budding researcher.”

my ilp project investigated whether children and adolescents with ocd and tourette syndrome can flexibly update their behaviour in response to changes in an outcome’s value. this was done through an online vending machine game where the participants could win snacks of their choosing. it was exciting to be part of an online project, as taking research online allows access to a large population, and so this is a very rapidly advancing tool which we will see a lot of in the future.  looking at goal directed learning and the impact of a change in outcome value is relatively new in its application in the younger population. data for this project will continue to be collected over the next few years and further advance our understanding of these disorders and how we can better manage and treat them. although mostly conducted online, my supervisor ensured i was able to have some clinical contact with the participants, which was something i personally wanted and really enjoyed during my ilp year. i was also lucky enough to be part of the wider computational psychiatry team, so the cohesive environment made me feel supported across the year. i would recommend undertaking a research project in the field of psychiatry, as there are a wide range of projects to suit different interests and skills.










































“i have been extremely thankful for the team at cheba for being incredibly supportive and helpful, mentoring me through different aspects of the research process and giving me ample opportunities to practice skills i learnt.”
my research project aimed to determine the validity of intrinsic capacity, a novel multisystem framework aimed at characterising and predicting age-related declines in functional ability. i conducted my research under the supervision of scientia professor henry brodaty, dr. suraj samtani and dr. katya numbers, and i have been incredibly grateful for the support i have been given in navigating the complex and often difficult aspects of the research process. i have been particularly thankful for the mentoring the staff at cheba have offered me with regards to statistical and data analysis, which has allowed me to learn and continue to hone cutting-edge techniques used in quantitative analyses. i have also been able to present my findings to other experts in the field, and received the opportunity to prepare a paper for publication
