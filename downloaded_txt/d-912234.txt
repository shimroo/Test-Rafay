visual facilitation















we design and lead workshops. we use visual aids such as diagrams, charts, mind maps, and drawings during meetings, workshops, or brainstorming sessions to enhance understanding, stimulate creativity, and facilitate problem-solving. this is a holistic approach to turning every participant into an active, engaged creator.

our future is worth designing well






















“change depends upon installing plumbing, not just burning down the sh!thouse. every system is tied to every other system. quality visual storytelling is key to moving hearts and minds. we don't have much time to figure everything out, everywhere, all at once. we have to educate, connect and motivate people quickly.” — peter durand | founder of alphachimp, llc
