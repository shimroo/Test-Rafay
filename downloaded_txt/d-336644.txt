 googl.com
are the visitors of
googl.com actually looking for google.com? if you check the meaning of googl
in popular online dictionary and encyclopaedia websites like answers.com 
and wikipedia.com,
they explain googl as google. unfortunately, at this point of time, googl.com
does not redirect you to google.com. (important term of use: the following discussion may not be accurate anymore
once any of the facts used to support the discussion changes.)




 please help us to understand whether internet users who visit googl.com are actually looking for google.com.   (  surveys)


there are three
              ways to reach googl.com.


by typing
                  'googl.com' in the address bar of your internet browser
possibility
                  no. 1 
                  he/she is in fact looking for googl.com.
possibility no. 2
he/she is making a spelling mistake or typing error.


by typing'
                  googl.com' in the search box of a search engine
possibility no. 1
he/she is in fact looking for googl.com.
possibility no. 2
he/she is making a spelling mistake or typing error.


by typing
                  only the word 'googl' in the search box of a search engine.
possibility no. 1
he/she is in fact looking for googl.com.
possibility no. 2
he/she is making a spelling mistake or typing error.
possibility no. 3
he/she is looking for googl with a domain extension
                  other than dot com like googl.net, googl.org, googl.info, googl.biz,
                  googl.co.uk, googl.ca, googl.tv, googl.us, googl.mobi etc.








general
              rule: if a person with a reasonable mind writes or types a
              word that has no meaning or does not exist at all, it can be due
              to two reasons respectively. either that word is a spelling
              mistake or typing error (possibility no. 2) or it is a word
              which he believes to exist (possibility no.1 and no.
              3).  
now, we examine
              each possibility in details.
 
              possibility no. 1: he/she is in fact looking for googl.com.

i had tried to visit googl.com several times during the past
              two weeks but no website was shown. for this reason, i believe at
              least for the time being, googl.com does not have anything that
              may attract an internet user to look for it. that is
              to say, possibility no. 1 will not really happen.
              

possibility no. 2: he/she is making a spelling mistake
              or typing error.
 
              by looking at the structure of the word, googl, the only word that can possibly be
              spelled or typed wrongly as googl is google. this is probably why answers.com 
and wikipedia.com 
              treat googl as the same as google. option 2
              of the poll above illustrates how often you can find someone who
              spells or types googl as google or googl.com as google.com.


possibility no. 3: he/she is looking for googl with a
              domain extension other than googl.com
some examples of
              other domain extensions are googl.net, googl.org, googl.info, googl.biz,
              googl.co.uk, googl.ca, googl.tv, googl.us etc.

              it is also interesting to know the history of googl.com as
              well.
              below are a few dates showing how googl.com looked
              like at that time.

              25, 2006, dec
              23, 2007, now
from looking at the
              history and current website of all domain extensions of googl
              including googl.com, it is submitted as a personal opinion that it
              is highly unlikely that an internet user will search for any of
              them. in other words,
              possibility no. 3 will not really happen.


conclusion:

only possibility no. 2 is applicable to internet
              users who visited googl.com. 
possibility no. 2
              is represented by option 2 of the poll above: i typed wrongly in a
              search box and found this web page. i typed 'googl' or 'googl.com'
              but was actually looking for google.com. this group of internet
              users has spelled or typed google or google.com wrongly as googl or
              googl.com respectively. his or her original
              intention is to look for google.com.
 
              hence, it is absolutely reasonable for answers.com 
and wikipedia.com 
              to treat googl as the same as google!

google at a glance
if youre a typical

worlds top search engines
search engines are the 
				most important source of new web site visitors. search engines

why are you googling? search for what you want with people search companies
looking for a person can be
