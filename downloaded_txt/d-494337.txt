870-10d ecm head pressure controlif you need low ambient head pressure control for your a/c condenser with an ecm motor, hoffman controls has the solution with our model 870-10d universal fan cycle switch. installation is simple and there is no need to penetrate the system with our temperature sense technology. this control will vary the duty cycle of any existing discrete or variable speed ecm condenser fan motors to optimize head pressure for every environmental condition.






the 880-20 ecm head pressure control




this electronic head pressure control modulates condenser fan motor speed thereby varying the air volume through the condenser. the control monitors the head pressure by sensing the sub-cooled liquid line temperature.there are two temperature inputs and three outputs (pwm, 0-10 vdc and 10-0 vdc) to control the ecm or vfd variable speed fan motor.two temperature parameters can be set to optimize the range of fan speeds so that as the ambient temperature changes, the fan speed is varied in order to maintain the correct head pressure.this improves system performance while saving energy and eliminating compressor slugging. the non-invasive temperature sensors require no system penetration.if you need to control multiple motors, or have more or other input sensors, or have modbus communication, we've got a product for that also.
