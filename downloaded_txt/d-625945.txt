alexis' 
                  mcadd story
alexis 
                  had just turned 8 years old when a silent and deadly killer 
                  called mcadd swiftly took her life. her "birthday girl" ribbon 
                  still hung on her bedroom door. she had a 5 month-old baby sister 
                  that she had been wishing for ever since she learned what a 
                  baby sister was. 
alexis 
                  had no previous symptoms or serious illnesses, and there was 
                  no reason for her family to think she was anything but perfectly 
                  healthy. she 
                  led a normal, active life as a second grader at southeast elementary 
                  in parkville, mo. she took gymnastics and played soccer and 
                  softball. she loved her family, and she loved her life. 
alexis 
                  stayed home from school on march 6 with the stomach flu. the 
                  next morning she was found in her bed, unconscious and unresponsive. 
                  
rushed 
                  by ambulance to the picu at children's mercy hospital in kansas 
                  city, her condition continued to worsen. she was having seizures 
                  in her brain, which was collecting fluid and continuing to swell. 
                  her blood pressure dropped and her heart raced. there were problems 
                  with her liver and kidneys. 
she 
                  didn't move. she didn't talk. she didn't cry. she didn't wake 
                  up.
the 
                  doctors had no answers. they pumped antibiotics into her system. 
                  they did everything they knew how to do. and then, finally, 
                  they told us to pray. 
she 
                  was put on dialysis early sunday morning, two days after she 
                  was brought to the hospital, but by mid-day, after her brain 
                  continued to swell even more, the neurologists performed additional 
                  tests and our alexis was declared 100% brain dead. 
that 
                  was when the bottom dropped completely out of our lives. that 
                  was when all of our hopes for her recovery left us. we knew 
                  she was with god and we had to let her go. alexis 
                  was taken off life support that day.
for 
                  such a little girl, alexis nicole knapton left huge footprints 
                  in the hearts of everyone who knew her. she had changed many 
                  lives for the better because she lived.
because 
                  she died, we now know about mcadd and we want to share that 
                  information with as many people as possible, in the hopes that 
                  other children like alexis, with undiagnosed mcad deficiency 
                  (mcadd), will never have to go through what she did. 
we 
                  want mcadd children to live long, healthy, and happy lives.

please 
                  read all the information on our website, and if your children 
                  have not been screened, ask your pediatrician to do it. you 
                  can have your kids screened for 30 disorders, including mcadd 
                  for about $25.00. 

                  there are approximately 55 diseases currently detectable through 
                  screening. at the present time, the same filter paper blood 
                  spot specimen can test for all of them (using several different 
                  screening methodologies and equipment). the cost is as low as 
                  $95 for screening for all 55 disorders.
no 
                  matter what state you live in, you can get this done.
the 
                  information on this website will tell you how and will point 
                  you to other web sites for more information about mcadd and 
                  supplemental newborn screening.
we 
                  hope you find this information helpful.
it 
                  could save your childs life!
