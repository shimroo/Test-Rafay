current nj wildfire activitythere is no current sizable activity

  











remember, no drones in fire zones - if you fly, we can't!there are serious consequences to flying an unauthorized drone near a wildfire.during a wildfire, our aircraft fly low to the ground, often at the same altitude that a drone would fly. if a drone is detected flying over or near a wildfire, all forest fire service air support will be grounded - hampering suppression and observation efforts.please do your part, and prevent interfering with wildfire suppression by staying grounded.
