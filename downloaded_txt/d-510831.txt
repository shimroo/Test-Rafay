snakes of florida









florida has an abundance of snake species (about 50, but who's counting). out of the 50 species only 6 are venomous. so that would leave 44 species and subspecies that are non-venomous and harmless, unless you break your leg or neck trying to get away from one.â 


you may not want to hear this however, all snakes are beneficial. "no way" you say. that's right, they eat insects, rats, mice, worms, toads, frogs, fish and some, like indigos and kingsnakes, eat other snakes including the venomous ones. they help keep the ecosystem they live in at a good balance.â 


now, i've been blessed with some good ole common sense. so i say, having snakes around is a good thing. i realize that some of you are scared to death of them. just give them a healthy distance and leave them alone, they'll probably just slither away and go eat a rat or two.


if youâre curious as to what kind of snake you've found in your backyard and you haven't killed it, click on either the venomous or non-venomous link below and check them out.
