places where ciis kids had fun: lewis rocks, now known as tumbling run





 lewis rocks, tumbling run, site near early carlisle indian
school camp
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
aug 12, 1892 notes from indian helper weekly “letter.”
lewis rocks
camp
rip raps
apple fritters, prune pies and blackberry puddings
great many snakes killed
camp lies 5 miles from the railroad, uphill all the way.
at the mouth of tumbling run, under the shadow of lewis'
rock
no houses within 4 miles
otto wells (comanche) is in charge of the mule and
"thinks more of it 
than of himself."
one mule to haul supplies and passengers.
   “it is therefore no
wonder that a gentleman from carlisle not long since, seeing the un-level road he had to travel
from the station, and being unaccustomed to tramping wanted to
hire a vehicle to convey him up to camp. finding none, however,
he was obliged to tramp it like the rest of us.   should there be a
picnic down at pine grove and the cooks all want to go, a new force is put in, one a cripple and the rest as green as gourds as far as cooking is concerned, and they get up a half-cooked dinner, entirely indigestible,
while those at the school are having the idea that the camp boys must be "getting fat."
   our camp being
located on a slope, those who are not careful as to the exact levelness of their beds are inclined to roll down hill.  
our camp is located so far back in the mountains affords us beautiful and wonderful scenery. 
   waterfalls are
innumerable
   so enticing is the
scene that one being here invites our carlisle photographer over to take some views.
   so on a bright
sunny morning all start for a favorable spot o have a few pictures taken, each anxious to have his own form taken with these beautiful waterfalls.
--------------------------------------
   on monday afternoon
the campers had a scare. just over lewis' rock smoke was seen to rise. it looked as though the mountain was on fire. reuben wolf was sent out with a
looking glass to find out. if it were a fire and the campers were needed to help put it out he was to flash a signal.
fortunately no signal was flashed as the fire was down near mt.
holly.
 aug 26, 1892 indian helper

message from museum of civilizations (italian ministry of culture) in rome, italy regarding carlisle indian school photographs found in their collections





message received in may 2024, from:francesca manuela anzelmo (ph.d)curator of the native american collectionsmuseum of civilizations (italian ministry of culture)piazza guglielmo marconi 14rome, italymuseodellecivilta.it"together with my colleagues we are conducting a research on the evidence in italian archives and museums related to the american indian boarding schools in the united states between the late 19th and early 20th centuries.the starting point of our research are some photographs kept in the archive of the museum of civilization, concerning the american indian boarding school in carlisle, pennsylvania and hampton normal and agricultural boarding school in virginia. the files attached concerns the carlisle indian industrial school. these photographs had been donated to the museum in 1913 by the italian zoologist and anthropologist enrico hillyer giglioli, who received them in 1883-1884 by robert wilson shufeldt, when shufeldt was honorary curator at the smithsonian institution (1882 - 1892).  as you can see, the photos are a copy of the ones taken by choate available at the https://carlisleindian.dickinson.edu/. thanks to the digitalisation work carried out at carlsisle (https://carlisleindian.dickinson.edu), we were able to identify almost all the students of the carlsisle's school in the photographs we have in our archive. only a few are left out. of these we have not found any files. we are trying to reconstruct the identities and biography of the all children in the photos kept at museum’s archive to finally bring them out of anonymity and inform any descendants, relatives, friends. the aim of the research is also to reconstruct the historical path and the reasons that brought these photographs to italy in colonial times, a few years after they were taken at carlisle. enrico giglioli received them in 1883 – 1884.but our desire is also another.we would like to be able to let descendants, friends, relatives, know that some photos of their loved ones are in an archive of an italian national museum. we would like, of course if they are interested in doing so, to create a discussion with them to see how we can tell the story of their loved ones together.these photos arrived here at that time because italy, like other european countries, was a protagonist of the colonial culture. therefore, we believe that it is important to make known, also to the italians of today, the various ways in which italy was involved in the culture of assimilation of other human beings." ==========================================================what follows are the images and captions describing the photographs.

request for information about ciis musicians





hello everyone, 

my name is vincent veerbeek and i am a phd student at the university of helsinki in finland. my dissertation research is about the history of marching band music in government boarding schools
for young native americans including carlisle. to get a better sense of the way the marching bandsshaped school life and student experiences, i am interested to hear stories that have been passed down about what it was like to be in the band, the school band’s performances, its role in everyday life, and so on.  
in addition, i am curious about the stories of students who went on to have careers as band leaders in the indian school service. among the carlisle graduates who led school bands later in life are james and dennison wheelock, richard barrington, robert depoe, angus lookaround, alfred venne, and pablo herrera. these are the ones i know of, but there were undoubtedly others. 
if any of you have stories related to (marching band) music at carlisle that you would be willing to share with me, feel free to send me an email at vincent.veerbeek@helsinki.fi	
.  
warm regards,
vincent

about me





barbara landis


carlisle, pennsylvania
barbara landis is the retired carlisle indian industrial school (ciis) archives and library specialist for the cumberland county historical society in carlisle, pennsylvania. she has worked with individuals and nations to develop the www.carlisleindianschool.org biographical and research web pages. she urges those who study carlisle to recognize the complex responses to a failed educational experiment, from descendants of school students. as a consequence of her work, landis makes it a point to respectfully honor those students and their descendants who lived the experiment, to celebrate with those who prospered from it, and to grieve with those whose lives were diminished by it. she currently travels with a grant-funded team from the carlisle indian school digital resource center, bringing programing and making visits with tribal communities and descendants of ciis students.
