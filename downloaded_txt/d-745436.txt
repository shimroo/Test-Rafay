what's going on at the wilds?













designed by tom weiskopf and jay morrish, the wilds golf club is nestled in a breathtaking natural setting of ponderosa pines, hardwoods, wet-lands and wildlife habitats. just a short drive from the twin cities, the wilds has over 150 feet of elevation changes, water in play on nearly half the holes, swift bentgrass fairways and over 70 strategically placed bunkers. commonly referred to as minnesota's crown jewel, it's surely a golf course to put on your bucket list.












18 holes of exhilaration
the wilds stretches 7,012 yards, with a slope of 145 & rating of 74.0. multiple sets of tees and generously wide fairways enable golfers of all skill levels to enjoy the course. our clubhouse is a stylish frank lloyd wright inspired design, offering high end amenities with a spectacular view of the minneapolis skyline.
