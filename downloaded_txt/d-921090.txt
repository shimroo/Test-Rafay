what our members say






media match is awesome. i signed up as a free member just to get jobs sent to me initially, but eventually decided to pay and was able to find a great job at production company in venice within 30 days. so worth it! you will never regret it.
ricard cater



mm thank you so much for sending me the ongoing incredible job lists you offer for writers. it's clear to me that employers trust you since i'm not able to find anything close anywhere else on the web. the assurance of new jobs coming in daily has made me a much more productive freelancer.
sally johnson



 you guys rock. i have been the director of photography for quite a while working on documentaries and have always struggled to find good jobs as a cinematographer. your 10 year plus connection to the movie biz is clearly visible. i like the new look by the way.
david belle



i just got my first film gig opportunity as production assistant for a very cool company in santa monica. this would not be possible if a close friend did tell me about your website. she saw the job on twitter. i signed up and within about one week i was able to start my dream job. that what i call turnaround!
