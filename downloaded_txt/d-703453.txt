your large concrete block headquarters





retaining walls



use our large concrete blocks for gravity retaining walls. our system focuses on value engineering, delivering faster installation and less slope embedment.






security walls and barriers



our large concrete blocks form excellent barriers and security walls, due to there large mass.








railroad walls



use our large concrete blocks to build proven, reliable railroad walls for live loads close to the track.






block rentals for ballasts and counter weights



use our large concrete blocks to support tents and temporary event structures.








block structures



use our large concrete blocks to create modular, imaginative structures, saving money over traditional methods.






material containment bins



use our large concrete blocks to create versatile material containment bins, featuring quick, easy installation at a cost value.








flood control walls



our large concrete blocks create excellent flood control walls, since they are interlocking precast units which don't require mortar.






diversion barriers



use our large concrete blocks for emergency diversion barriers, featuring quick, easy installation.

segmental retaining walls

        segmental retaining walls are modular block retaining walls used for vertical grade change applications. our segmental retaining walls are generally designed and constructed as gravity retaining
				walls (conventional). the system consists of dry-cast concrete blocks that are placed without mortar (dry stacked) and rely on their keyed interface and mass to resist overturning and sliding.
				block to block interfaces include friction, shear elements, and interlock. the systems may also employ soil reinforcement that extends into the backfill and allows for the construction of walls
				with significant height (e.g. in excess of 50 ft (15.24 m)) that could not be accomplished with the blocks alone.
      


segmental retaining wall gravity blocks

        segmental retaining walls are considered flexible structures. srw blocks are manufactured in conformance with industry standards and specifications to assure that units delivered to a project
				are uniform in weight, dimensional tolerances, strength, and durability—features not necessarily provided in site cast materials.
