original nazi portable typewriter with the "ss runes" key and serial number

this is an extremely fine plus working example of the nazi-era field portable german typewriter featuring the "ss" runic symbol above the 3 key. the keys still produce clear impressions (see my typed copy example). this typewriter has a black bakelite body and comes with the removable bottom section of the portable case (the case top is gone). this typewriter has no commercial-type label or maker's name, but the typewriter frame bears a stamped serial number and may indicate possible military or government use. many of these typewriters were "de-nazified" after the war by grinding off the ss runes key. item #0711-1
