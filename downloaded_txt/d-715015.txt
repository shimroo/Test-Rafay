high, lilly.  high, lilly.  how low!





i'm a diabetic and i've had a terrible time controlling my blood sugar lately.  in a nutshell, overall my sugar is too high but i also have scary lows.



i don't mean to take this lightly because both highs and lows are serious and one time or another, both have put me in the hospital. however, the low i had last night has to win the comedy of the year award.



first of all, i should explain that when i'm in a sugar low, i become very confused and shaky.  so here's the scene in my bedroom this morning:

a half gallon of orange juice is on my nightstand.  (and no glass in sight)
cookies are scattered all over the floor.  the cookie package is on my nightstand. 
my glasses are halfway across the room on the floor.
i'm wearing no pajama bottoms but i find them on the floor covered with orange juice.
there's a thick towel on the edge of the bed.  when i pick it up, i discover another wet orange juice stain on the sheet.
i'm not using my cpap but the mask was hung carefully in the right place and the machine was still running.

i have very hazy memories of' the whole thing, but i think you could safely say that i did not handle this low very well.

buffalo bills fans show their colors







molly, the little shih tzu shown above, is the frequent subject of my cameras.  molly visits us almost every day and has been known to run away from home to come visit us.  her mom, kelly (also shown above) is a dedicated buffalo bills fan and she watches most of the football games with my husband.  we decided that molly needed a little push in the right direction (she's secretly a new england patriots fan) so we got her the official bills jersey for christmas.  kelly already had her jersey.

aren't they cute?

fired up for my kindle fire





i'm waiting ---not patiently---  for my kindle fire to be delivered.  my first kindle has been a constant companion during hospital stays, chemo, and recovery.  it has been elevated to the importance of a life necessity.  i expect the fire will give even more.

whining alert





one of the tough things about cancer is to have a major medical test and then have to wait days or weeks for the results. i wait and whine.

just rhetoric






you know how people are always saying things , like "let us know if you need some help." last week i decided that i needed help transporting a full sized scooter from inside our house to leon's room at the nursing home. i thought of a guy i know who has a teenaged son and i thought the two of them could put the scooter on their truck and off-load it at the home.

so i called. no one answered the phone so i left a message. i thought i'd get a reply the next morning. i didn't. okay, the next morning. i didn't. at that point, i decided they were on vacation. i waited a week. no reply. i waited a second week. no reply. this morning i ran into the spouse of the guy i called. they weren't on vacation.



i solved the transfer of the scooter by calling the local cab company. two of their vans have ramps. they loaded and unloaded the scooter for me and charged eight bucks. i had planned pay the other guy $25.



i'm back to ignoring offers of help. most of the time, they're just words.

a home visit





yesterday was a great day. my husband was home for the first time since february 14. hornell, a very small city, made that possible. the local bus company has some buses equipped with lifts for wheelchair patients. i called the company and arranged rides for him to come home.we are trying to adjust to our new lives and this is making it much easier. my husband is in a nursing home permanently and i'm living alone for the first time ever. wait. that's not quite true. i have my two cats.

the day a telemarketer hung up on me





yesterday a telemarketer called. i had a choice of pressing "1' if i wanted my credit card interest rate reduced. feeling a little grumpy and thoroughly frustrated by the increase in these calls, i decided to press "1". when a real live person came on the line, i asked, "does anyone there know how to read?" the telemarketer asked me to repeat what i had just said so i asked again if anyone there knew how to read. he cautiously answered yes. i said, "good. then read the national do not call list because........" slam. he hung up on me.ah, gee.
