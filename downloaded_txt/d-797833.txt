"thanks for your
                      impressive product. i am a master user on both scott studios wideorbit and
                      rcs nexgen, and find stationplaylist radio broadcasting software to be most competitive with
                      those two very sophisticated platforms.

"i am
                      amazed! i've used other automation / streaming products on my webcast,
                      and i've got to say, stationplaylist is simply awesome. over the last
                      year i've used (and paid a lot for) drs2006 and sam broadcaster, and
                      creator & studio out performs both of them in ease of use and feature
                      set.

"in my old job at a big radio station 1995-2001, i worked with
                      the
                      dalet automation which cost around $150,000.
                      studio is now more stable than that very expensive system ever was!! and i
