epsilon learning systems
epsilon learning  
              provides lectures, seminars, consultation, and research services 
              focused on the relation between learning and brain function.
a generation of research on the biology of learning has yet to 
              be fully incorporated into the systems we use to teach, to train, 
              and to learn. how do the welter of confusing and conflicting theories 
              of learning relate to how we really learn? how can we use an understanding 
              of brain function to help learners integrate new knowledge into 
              their existing cognitive systems? how do the different aspects of 
              the biology of learning relate to our personal experience of learning?
how we approach learning, and what we consider learning to be, 
              affect the efficiency with which we communicate knowledge. the goals 
              of teachers, learners, and organizations can be achieved most effectively 
              by working with the requirements of brain structure and how people 
              naturally learn.
epsilon learning offers 
              cutting-edge academic research and consultation on brain-based learning 
              on topics ranging from neuroscience and linguistics to child development, 
              cultural and evolutionary anthropology, education, e-learning, knowledge 
              systems, and related areas of research and application.
