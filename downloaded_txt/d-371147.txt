perlow concierge women’s health



























we provide whole-person healthcare for women and unique, complete pregnancy care.














about concierge medicine concierge medical practices run differently than traditional medical practices. there are two components to your care: 



1) concierge membership & feeyou get direct access to the doctor; comprehensive, whole-person care; coordination with other providers; and other amenities within an intentionally small, focused practice. there is a concierge membership fee for amenities that only cover how care is delivered.




2) healthcare services & feesin addition, actual healthcare services that might include exams, labs, consults, etc., are billed separately. these fees, for what care is delivered, are billed to your insurance or are self-paid.















we provide whole-person healthcare for women and unique, complete pregnancy care.














our approach



perlow concierge women’s health is dedicated to providing patient-focused, in-depth, collaborative healthcare. the traditional, insurance-driven healthcare model creates multiple gaps that patients—especially female patients—fall through. it bends the patient to fit into a predetermined checklist of care. the concierge medicine model fills those gaps and flips the focus of care to where it belongs: on the patient, not the system.
