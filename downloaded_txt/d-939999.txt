free credit 
							card terminal & accessories!
accept credit cards and 
							debit cards in your retail or restaurant business 
							using one of our free credit card terminals: the 
							hypercom t4100 (pictured left).  in 
							addition to traditional credit card processing, we 
							offer electronic check conversion with guarantee 
							using our free magtek check imager.  
							quick service venues (fast food, movie theatres, 
							entertainment venues, etc.), may prefer our free 
							vivopay 4000 contactless card reader for fast 
							check out.  also: get a free reprogram of any 
							existing set up.  we support almost any make & 
							model credit card equipment on the market.
 


 
 
 









free 
							wireless credit card terminal!
reliable payment 
							processing can be a challenge when you don't have 
							access to a phone line or a power source.  our 
							mobile credit card processing solutions solve this 
							problem!  our free nurit 8000 gprs wireless 
							terminal (pictured top left) is the leader of 
							the pack: integrated terminal & printer, internal 
							battery and wireless modem, with an excellent 
							nationwide
							gprs wireless footprint.  for merchants who 
							prefer to travel light, or for merchants operating a 
							fleet of salespeople or vehicles, our
							

							mobile credit card processing solutions using a cell 
							phone (pictured bottom left) may be the best 
							fit.   either solution is perfect for 
							mobile businesses (tow trucks, trade show vendors, 
							home repair professionals, etc.) or for merchants 
							who seek a reliable home based business merchant 
							account.

 


 
 
 








accept 
							credit cards online!
get a complete turn-key 
							ecommerce solution, or add
							internet credit card processing to your existing 
							merchant account set up.  our free authorize.net 
							-or- plug'n pay set ups include an 
							online payment gateway for real-time transactions, 
							as well as a virtual terminal for manual entry of 
							transactions received by phone, mail or email.  
							whether your business is click & mortar (a blend of 
							retail and internet business) or 100% ecommerce, we 
							have the right solution for you!



 
 
 




 


point of banking terminal!
for an alternative to 
							traditional merchant services, try our point of 
							banking terminal (pictured left).  accept pin entry 
							transactions for visa, mc, american express, checkcards, and debit cards.  why pay huge fees 
							for a traditional merchant account when it isn't 
							necessary?  great for any business in a public 
							access venue: food marts, bowling alleys, sports 
							bars, night clubs, etc.  works just like a 
							traditional atm, but doesn't need a dedicated power 
							source or a dedicated phone line.  no cash to 
							load, so there is no danger of theft.  earn 
							explosive surcharge revenue.  let your 
							customers pay you for the right to use their card!
