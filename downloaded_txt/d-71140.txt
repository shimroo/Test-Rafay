shivling rituals
the shivling rituals are a vital part of hindu tradition, symbolizing the divine essence of lord shiva and his formless nature. devotees perform abhishekam, pouring water, milk, and honey over the shivling, each representing purity, nourishment, and sweetness, signifying surrender and devotion. accompanied by mantras like “om namah shivaya,” bells, and incense, these rituals create a rich spiritual atmosphere. often observed during auspicious occasions like maha shivaratri, they reflect profound faith and the pursuit of inner peace, enabling devotees to dissolve the ego and connect with the divine.

yoga therapy a holistic mind-body practice using the various modalities of hatha yoga, such as, asanas, movement, meditation, mindfulness, pranayama, breath work, mantra chanting, mudra, sound therapy, energy healing, among others. the practice aims to manage and mprove a practitioner’s physical, emotional, and mental health, and overall wellbeing.
nyasa, mantra, and nada yoga sound meditation 
nyasa is an ancient holistic practice which involves touching various parts of the body while chanting a mantra together with the breath. this prepares the practitioner for the rest of the practice, allowing for the purification and cleansing of the self and connecting the practitioner with his inner energy and with his own divinity.
the class ends with nada yoga — the ‘yoga of sound’. a meditative practice deeply embedded in the ancient science of ayurveda using various sound elements, to achieve physical, mental, and spiritual balance.
holistic flow a hatha-based flow which empowers a practitioner to connect deeper to self in mind, body, and spirit. a holistic yoga practice involving asanas, meditation, pranayama, mantra chanting, and mudra. the practice is strengthening, invigorating, and relaxing, at the same time.
pranayama, meditation, and yoga nidra – the class is taken into meditation and pranayama practices for grounding, centering, and preparing the mind, body, and sprit for the practice of yoga nidra. also known as ‘yogic sleep’, yoga nidra is an ancient guided meditation technique, where practitioners enter a deeper state of conscious relaxation, moving awareness from the external world to the internal. this powerful healing practice shifts the nervous system to parasympathetic (rest and restore mode), from sympathetic (fight or flight mode). a 20-minute yoga nidra practice is equivalent to two (2) hours of restorative sleep.

enhanced hatha – a biomechanical, functional, and therapeutic approach with slow and intentional movements, with attention on the breath for strength, stability, and mobility.

▪️in chinese medicine, energy called qi, flows through the body in pathways called meridians. it controls the flow of energy to & various points in the body.
* it’s believed that stress, difficulty in processing emotions, and improper diet can block the meridians and immobilize the qi flow in the body, causing physical problems or disease. the body will not function properly and the organs will not perform their function.

 functional training





functional training, high-intensity interval training (hiit)
functional fitness involves training the body for the activities performed in everyday life.
fitness classes; 
functional fitness training is a type of strength training that readies your body for daily activities. these exercises equip you for the most important type of physical fitness, the kind that preps you for real-life, daily living stuff like bending, twisting, lifting, loading, pushing, pulling, squatting and hauling.
high-intensity interval training- hiit – it takes your cardio-work out to another level, as you push your pace out of your comfort zone. you can use hiit with any type of cardio workout, whether it’s running, using a stair climbing machine, rowing, or jumping rope. you’ll work up a sweat fast, working at a very intense level and then backing off for a slower recovery period, followed by another round of high intensity.
that strategy can save you time: you don’t have to work out as long as you would if you were keeping a steady pace. you’ll lose weight, build muscle, and boost your metabolism. plus there’s a post-workout bonus: your body will burn calories for about 2 hours after you exercise.







 sound healing





sound healing uses vibrations (vocal or instrumental-like gongs, tibetan singing bowls and tuning forks) in order to relax the body, mind and soul. some proponents also believe it can relieve certain ailments including pain, anxiety, depression or insomnia.
sound therapy is a clinical and evidence-based therapy used for dealing with mental health issues, such as anxiety, pain and sleep disorders. these issues are usually caused by high levels of tension and stress. sound healing brings one to a relaxed state with sounds created by singing bowls, tuning forks and other resonant musical instruments, including the human voice. recent research suggests that in counseling sessions, it can be a catalyst for emotional healing used in combination with other modalities such as meditation, deep breathing and visualization.
healing through sound and music is an ancient cultural tradition. the aboriginal people of australia were the first known to practice sound healing using a wind instrument called a didgeridoo. they first played it 40,000 years ago, making it one of the world’s oldest instruments.
sound healing classes
in this sixty-minute session, the sound healer will use the frequencies and vibrations of tibetan singing bowls and other healing instruments to provide deep relaxation while the client stays in a comfortable position.
the immediate benefits are mental calm, physical relaxation and waking up the next day to a good night’s sleep. consistent practitioners report an increased resilience to life’s daily stresses.
