bridgeway global opportunities




offering long-short “hedge fund” capabilities at mutual fund prices1



seeking returns uncorrelated with stock market indexes2



drawing from bridgeway’s extensive research on intangible capital intensity3

1 per evestment, the median fee for market neutral hedge fund strategies is 1.5% management fee plus performance fee of 20% of appreciation. this management fee is in addition to potential upfront fees, lock up periods, high minimums, high leverage (debt), and more complex tax reporting. per morningstar, the median management fee for mutual funds in the market neutral category is 1.25% with no performance fee. bridgeway global opportunities fund is offered at a flat 1.25% management fee and caps expenses at 1.50% of net assets. gross (net) expense ratio: 3.06% (1.68%). the investment adviser to the fund is contractually obligated, until at least november 1, 2025, to waive fees and/or pay fund expenses. please refer to the prospectus for more information. why is bridgeway giving up the opportunity to earn a performance fee?
2 based on returns correlated with the s&p 500 and msci all country world imi stock market indexes.
3 see “introduction to intangible capital intensity” and “measuring global intangible capital intensity: a global analysis .”
4 the fund’s adviser, bridgeway capital management, will close bridgeway global opportunities fund to new investors when net assets reach the range of $100-$150 million based on the prior day close. why would bridgeway close a fund at such a low level?





intangible capital intensity helps reveal added value
expenditures on intangible capital—such as research and development, general sales, and administration—have increased in recent decades. however, accounting standards have not kept pace. bridgeway’s global opportunities fund applies our research on intangible capital intensity, published in three peer reviewed articles, in 35 countries across the globe.
measuring intangible capital intensity: a global analysis








who should invest?


the adviser believes that the fund is appropriate as:

a partial replacement for equity investments for investors who want to potentially reduce stock market risk, or
a partial replacement for fixed-income investments for investors who want to potentially reduce interest rate risk and inflation risk, or
for investors who seek potential capital preservation.

the fund is not an appropriate investment for short-term investors or those trying to time the market.









why not an exchange-traded fund?
while etfs do offer some tax efficiency and cost advantages over mutual funds, they present some operational restrictions in this case. etfs are unable to close to new investments, preventing them from holding less liquid securities in proportion to a target or model. in addition, shorting individual stocks inside an etf can be an issue. mutual funds can handle all these items.








an experienced, proven team committed to research, innovation, and collaboration
the four members of the management team bring together extensive experience in international and us equity strategies, quantitative research, and risk management. they have a robust background in developing innovative solutions, spanning global, developed, and emerging markets. with a strong track record of integrating quantitative models and rigorous research, the team is dedicated to delivering scalable investment strategies while actively supporting client relationships and thought leadership initiatives across the global investment landscape.

unlocking opportunities as a focused, purpose-driven firm
in addition to the experience of the fund managers, bridgeway has over 30 years of proven experience in capacity-constrained investment strategies—ones demanding a smaller, more nimble investment firm. as a purpose-driven firm, we stand apart by donating 50% of the adviser’s, bridgeway capital management’s, profits, while focusing on our clients (investors), colleagues, and the world community. these elements of our unique culture contribute to our numerous awards as a great place to work.






smaller fund size, greater access: the boutique advantage


larger firms and funds with many billions under management are often too big to invest in smaller companies. reasons for this can include ownership limits, trading costs, and number of company shares available. as an example, $1 million of an illiquid stock is 1% of a $100 million fund, but 0.1% of a $1 billion fund. if such a company’s price were to double, its impact is meaningful in the smaller fund and tiny in the bigger fund.




why now?
we do not believe in timing the market. we do believe in managing risk. our current view is that equity, inflation, and interest rate risks are all at high historical levels. bridgeway global opportunities seeks to dial down the risk exposure to all three and provide increased diversification.
once the fund reaches $100-$150 million in assets, it will close, and the strategy will only be available through larger separately managed accounts and our private pooled fund structure.



the process of raising seed capital


institutions typically do not want to be first movers or own more than a particular percentage of a strategy. as an independent boutique firm, we could pursue a partnership with a distribution organization that typically takes half of the fee revenue earned on the first investments, known as “seed capital.”
as we considered this, we thought, “why not share that half of revenues with the investors/mutual fund shareholders themselves, rather than with a sales organization?” the concept was born:




1
reduce the fee substantially,


2
offer global opportunities to mutual fund investors, but close it to new investors when the seed capital is raised,


3
then charge the normal higher fee (including performance fees) to subsequent investors in a classical private pooled fund (hedge fund) investment vehicle with a higher investment minimum.
					we hope to attract shareholders who appreciate the lower fee, the strategy design and execution, daily fund pricing and liquidity, annual independent audit, and who plan to remain invested years beyond the close of the mutual fund to new investors.

disclosures:

before investing you should carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. this and other information are in the prospectus, a copy of which may be obtained by calling 800-661-3550 or visiting the fund's website at bridgewayfunds.com. please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
investing involves risk. principal loss is possible. the fund’s use of derivatives, swaps, and leverage can magnify the risk of loss in an unfavorable market, and the fund's use of short-sale positions can, in theory, expose shareholders to unlimited loss. the fund invests in foreign securities, which involve greater volatility and political, economic, and currency risks, and differences in accounting methods. these risks are greater in emerging markets. the fund is new and has no operating history.
diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in a declining market.
the fund is distributed by foreside fund services, llc, which is not affiliated with bridgeway capital management, llc™ or any other affiliate.
