	 citibank sucks, makemytrip sucks, dell sucks.
	 
    


i had bad experience with all 3 above mentioned companies. i mean their customer service. and trust me, i am not a fussy / demanding customer. just a regular guy who wants things to work and nothing more.  dell made me wait couple of hrs to answer a query on tracking for a ~ 1200$ laptop. i could have bought another laptop if i utilised the time in better manner. makemytrip took my money, failed to book tickets, and then took their own sweet time to compensate me. being a lazy idiot i am, i didn't care to encash their cheque. :( now comes latest tormentor. citibank sends me sms to verify address/contact details related to my card. i try to find their 24/7 phone. their website sucks. and after some creative searching, i call them. i was asked to recite my autobiography. dob, address, card no and last 2 transactions. i told them i don't remember. and the lady on other end says "i can't help". i tell her "this sinner didn't request for your help, he called you because you have asked him to and he wants to find the reason why you sent that sms". the poor lady can't answer. my irrational side comes back. i call to investigate and find answers to these fundamental question and also complain about poor answering capability of previous recepient. no change in answers. a restricted multiple choice isn't enough for all kinds of customers. i demand to get superior on the phone. my request granted. apology for inconvenience which isn't clearly defined. fine, my ego massaged, now lets det down to real issue. this lady says sms was sent to update my details (when there is no change in universal truths like dob, address..) , help me....blah,blah. i said, i can't understand your proposed help. and unfortunately i can't remember my last 2 transactions. now hang me, cancel my card. "sorry sir, we can't do that without you providing details". enough said.

	 dilemma
	 
    


you have money to spare, say 4 lakhs to donate. there is this one patient who needs 4 lakhs for his/her operation. or you can distribute it among more patients with lesser needs.  what would you do?  it's so difficult to be completly altruistic. there are people with more needs and less resources than we have.  these are the things where there will be no guidelines.  we need to make our own.

	 money
	 
    


i am trying to make money. i want to be able to afford ps3, xbox360 and a wii. ofcourse games for them. i am over doing this games a bit. last time i finished a game was over a year ago. i buy books and games beyond my finishing ability.  in other news, i am finally changing my personality. ;) yeah i bought few new garments. kidding apart, i am more willing to meet people these days. more willing to sit through presentations, talk business.  hopefully all this will make our kids rich. believe me, they need money to cater to their basic needs. like fancy toys, expensive eateries, flight journeys...

	 no sorry.
	 
    


i am busy. no, i am not busy. i just pretedn to be busy. i am doing what any other executive does. travel everywhere. talk to everybody. try to make money. i didn't get a wii. yet.  i am going to get 2 nintendo ds'. one for me and one for my son. or both for my sons?? lets wait and watch. going to goa tomorrow. to have fun. ;) should i go for a ps3 instead. naaah, though i am a sony fanboy, it's too pricey for me. and where are games? probably when metal gear solid-4 comes out. and xbox 360. i played some demoes. and i liked table tennis. i believe there are few more good games. but somehow that console feels stunted. no internet browsing. poor dvd playback.   what's happening to human race? no decent combination of console & games?  coming to books. bought a bunch of them yesterday. will take 2 months to complete them.  come april, i will have free cash with me. and i will be spulrging that on my foreign trips, consoles, books and not feel guilty. hopefully.   in other news, my son had completed hard sudoku in my mobile. i mean one puzzle. threat level needs to be enhanced. i mean, threat to my dominence over him. :)
