coopworth…the sheep for all reasonsmembers area





welcome to american coopworth registry. our purpose is to preserve and protect the coopworth breed of sheep in north america by developing a breed standard, keeping pedigree information and registering sheep that qualify as purebred coopworth. we facilitate the exchange of information between members to help them better raise their flocks and promote their products. we also foster interest in the coopworth breed to attract new members for the conservation and well-being of the breed. you do not need to own coopworth sheep to become a member. we welcome anyone who is interested in supporting our mission.










everything coopworth. — run by talented and enthusiastic acr members, the booth has established itself as a destination at the two largest wool festivals on the east coast - maryland sheep & wool festival and ny state sheep & wool festival in rhinebeck. a wonderful opportunity for our members to offer their products for sale to the public, promote the breed and get to know each other.
