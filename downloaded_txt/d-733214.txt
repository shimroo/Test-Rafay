yeowzah! - fast track brandingâ¢
image is everything and timing is of the essence. a tried and true approach to real time brand development, repositioning and brand management. we think of it as "branding at the speed of thought."

aggressiveness of timing depends on factors such as the environment in which your company operates, key constituencies involved, scope of program and the pace at which you and your organization feel comfortable moving. 
full speed, three phases for consideration.

1.) brand strategy development 
   2.) pre-launch/re-launch preparation 
   3.) implementation - we discover new futures through disruptive and innovative approaches to thinking and behavior.

yeowzah! - template for creating a timeline
      the following steps for fast track brandingâ¢ provide an easy template for creating a timeline for your brand program. yeowzah can help design a process and timeline that best meets your organization's needs and level of organizational development. 









phase 1: brand strategy development
phase 2: pre-launch preparation 
phase 3: implementation 












the internal audit is an important step in identifying key consumer insights for the brand and often includes the following components. 


review and synthesis of existing business, brand strategy, and marketing documents
review and synthesis of existing market research 
executive management and key stakeholder interviews (always include sales)
lack of differentiation, any confusion/potential confusion points, barriers to overcome
influence points analysis â identify/prioritize cross functional contact points with brand
marketing audit to review current marketing programs and materials


if branding is a new concept for your organization, it's useful to define branding components and constructs so that your team, and eventually your entire organization will have a common language and tools for branding in your company. key elements in constructing a brand strategy "strawman" are:


consumer target(s) 
source of volume
barriers to overcome
brand vision/role
reason to believe
brand essence (current product/service features and benefits; and potential future products/services)
brand values
brand personality
brand flag and slogan


market research can be used for refinement throughout the development process, depending on your company's needs and budget. 






 










once senior managment is aligned on the brand strategy, pre-launch preparation involves program development. any new trademarks or patents should be filed for protection of these key company assets. marketing and communications strategy and programs can be developed and integrated cross functionally at key influence points identified in phase                       1. 
whereas market research in phase 1 is focused on brand strategy, positioning and key elements, in phase 2, the focus moves to development and testing of marketing                       program concepts and materials. measurement and monitoring systems should be defined and baseline measures established prior to implementation/launch.
regardless of the level of development of your organization, it is sound operating procedure to have brand identity standards that provide consistent direction.                       this is especially important in an organization that is implementing a branding program for the first time.

















if building brand loyalty is the basis for enduring profitable growth, then it follows that branding needs to be a way of life for an organization...an integral part of the overall corporate culture. branding is not a one time deal. that's why it's important to think about brand development and brand management as ongoing business 
processes. refinement is imminent as new information (e.g.,market performance, competitive activity) is available.









and additionally...
      we emphasize internal and external brand launches and ongoing orientations. associates can be a brand's best advocates, especially when they take pride in the brand they represent. a strong brand is uplifing and inspiring. it's what makes employees, consumers, and anyone else who is touched by the brand, that much more passionate about the significant impact that brand has on the world around them.great joy in experiencingthis transformation and like to be a part of it in any way we can!
advertising specialties
advertising specialties is just one of the areas we have touched many businesses. beyond advertising specialties, our experience spans a range of industries, associations, agencies and firms.

while we are not an advertising agency, one of our advertising specialties is in helping clients create brand building programs. advertising is just a part of this. this broad competency comes from working in and around vendor, agency, and corporate sides of the business. we combine that with our experience in business planning, marketing and market research for a fully integrated and strategic management approach for our clients, regardless of how big or small they are.
