 my hunt smart ® course is back and better than ever
with a new format and syllabus
read all about the updated course here 

  after reading the secrets of the sambar trilogy and the hunt smart system books, and it all going in one ear and out the other, i decided to book into the course as i know there is no better way to learn than to be shown in the bush.


  so last weekend on 4-6 june i attended errol’s first course for 2021. after everyone arrived we got
  straight into it looking over the best optics for finding these deer. then we examined actual tracks and using the 4
  hooves from a 12 year old stag, errol explained the difference in size and shape between stag and hind tracks, how to
  identify the front track from the rear, how to tell the left from the right and how to tell the tracks of a young sambar
  from a mature one...

"i learnt more in 3 days with errol, than in the 15 years i have been hunting them."

errol mason's - secrets of the sambar®
sambar are large, elusive, cunning deer, revered for their ability to elude hunters.
between 2000 and 2006 errol successfully guided many hunters - some to fulfill their dream of harvesting the trophy of a lifetime, whilst the dream of many others was to harvest hinds for venison. 
under their "shikari press" banner, errol and lynne have also published the definitive sambar trilogy - "secrets of the sambar - biology, ecology, behaviour and hunting strategies" - volumes 1,2 and 3. between 2012 and 2018 errol and his wife lynne, also published 18 issues of their extremely popular magazine - "secrets of the sambar and other cervidae."
in january 2019, errol and lynne released their 464 page blue chip book - "sots - the hunt smart system." this has been an outstanding success.
between 2000 and 2006 whilst errol was still guiding hunters for sambar and other cervidae, each year errol and lynne also ran several three day hunt smart training courses.
however, the publishing of sots vol 1 in december 2006 triggered a massive increase in demand, causing the number of courses offered to increase to 12 per year. currently they offer 8 courses per year commencing in early may. these courses are literally "an investment in a lifetime of more enjoyable and successful hunting" and as a result have been fully booked every year.

hunt smart® training course


our renowned hunt smart training course is an investment in a lifetime of more enjoyable and successful hunting.


the principles of the hunt smart system ® are based upon 40 years research into the biology, ecology and behaviour of sambar. using this knowledge i have devised the most effective tactics for hunting this elusive big brown deer.

 thank you for your help and the knowledge i gained from your course... i had a very successful season... and the extra knowledge really made my hunting more enjoyable - luke myers, bacchus marsh vic
 it's now 3 years on since i did the errol mason "hunt smart training course" and my approach to hunting will never be the same - andrew rosser
 i firmly believe my success... is largely attributable to errol's course and my employment of his 'hunt smart' system - brett cooke

nicholas trupkovic - hunt smart system book success story #8

hi errol, 

on the 21/9/24 i managed to harvest this sambar stag, my first to be exact.

i utilised the “sight n go” method you describe in the hunt smart system book. using advice from your book i found fresh prints, and employing all the factors you mention in the book i started to follow them. 

i continued to glass ahead of me and two minutes later i heard something ascending up the face towards me. the stag walked straight up to me and i took a broadside shot at 40m and he dropped on the spot.
i could not believe it! 
despite many encounters with… read full story

reid hjorth - hunt smart system book success story #7

gday errol,

it was great chatting to you last week. i appreciate your time and learnt even more than i had already learnt from your book.

i only get to hunt sambar once every two years normally. i have been successful in 5 out of 6 trips. however all but one sambar were aware of my presence. with an ongoing ankle injury, i needed more knowledge for my latest trip to make my life easier and help me pinpoint where they’d be. 
i had two kiw… read full story

laurence farr - hunt smart course success story #77

i attended errol's hunt smart course with no prior experience in sambar hunting. i was a complete novice in the challenging pursuit. i had never even seen an unalarmed deer, let alone come close to harvesting one. by studying errol’s book the hunt smart system and attending his course i gained an in-depth understanding of the nuances of sambar behaviour to… read full story
