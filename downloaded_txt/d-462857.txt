release day july 19, 2024  john denicola - "king of his own world" single. 



july 21, 2024  /  john denicola





“king of his own world” from john denicola & sweetback is out everywhere now!free download link here: https://www.omadrecords.com/.../john-denicola-king-of-his...the track—a tribute to late friend & former bandmate, singer tim lawless—debuted recently via soultracks.com, who called it a "distinctive, bluesy steely dan strut."to honor lawless, denicola got their old band—'70s soul outfit sweetback—together again for the first time in decades. "king of his own world" is a heartfelt tribute—a propulsive, sophisticated, horn-laden slice of retro-soul."denicola belts and strains with a similar effort akin to donald fagen," writes soultracks. "the smart, poetic nature of the lyrics ('you can’t break the spirit of the one that’s running free') along with the hot bed of punchy horns, wurlitzer runs and sultry backing vocals on the jazz-soul arrangement feel like a reprise taken from 2000’s two against nature."https://open.spotify.com/album/2euyjyj3tbju1sxib4fuug...
