2021 park updates
01/08/21 by stevenw
hello cliff dwellers! we are the new owners of the cliffs, tina and jimmy. we have waited for this introduction until we had all the details and new rules. we did not realize it would take this long.  we are receiving an ohv grant from the idnr.  sunday, january 17th will be the last day for jeeps and trucks.  this is the rules for the ohv grant, and the only way to save the park from closing to everyone.  we are sorry to see them go but did not want to see the park close.  so to our jeep and truck customers, we are sorry to see you go, and you will be missed.  thank you for your understanding.  we have a lot of new ideas for the new year, and hopefully 2021 is better for everyone.   thank you,jimmy and tina
