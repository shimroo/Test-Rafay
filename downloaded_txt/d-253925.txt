who are we?the oblates are an international congregation of catholic priests, brothers, and sisters founded by blessed louis brisson, osfs, and venerable mother mary de sales chappuis, vhm, in france in the 19th century.our mission is “to continue the saving work of christ” (constitution 170) and “make an effective contribution to the salvific mission of the church in the world” (constitution 183). we do this through "catholic education, missionary work and pastoral ministry" (constitution 184).coming to america in 1893, oblates administered and staffed many catholic high schools and parishes with grade schools, evangelizing and educating thousands, especially youth and young adults. 















oblates orient their ministry, embrace the gospel, and grow in holiness through the very accessible, orthodox, and universally acclaimed spirituality of st. francis de sales, doctor of the church. 










"go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations" â matt. 28:19










youth evangelizationover the millennium, miracles, testimonies, heartfelt prayer and the sacraments have awoken faith and led many to deep, life-long relationships with christ and his church. like so many before us, we too offer our lives to fulfill the great commission of jesus christ: "make disciples of all nations."

"catholic education is also evangelization: bearing witness to the joy of the gospel and its power to renew our communities and provide hope and strength in facing wisely the challenges of the present time."  – pope francis











catholic educationjesus spoke of the seed "that fell on rocky ground, where it had little soil. it sprang up at once because the soil was not deep, and when the sun rose it was scorched, and it withered for lack of roots." – matt 13:5-6youth camps and retreats awaken the seed; education, prayer and service grow the roots. st. francis de sales considered education the eighth sacrament. st. teresa of avila recommended well educated spiritual directors over devout ones. oblate schools strive for graduates who are not only well educated but genuinely devout.

"live in charity and associate in christian community" â st. augustine










parishes — the center of catholic lifecampus ministry, student retreats, and summer camps are all important apostolates in oblate schools. but only the parish church offers catholics a lifetime of opportunity to meet christ through the sacraments, in sacred scripture, and through the people of god assembled. below are three of the many parishes and parish schools staffed by the oblates of st. francis de sales.

"where two or three are gathered together in my name, there i am in the midst of them.â â matt 18:20










community lifeone of the main differences between diocesan and religious priesthood is community life. through the perpetual profession of poverty, chastity, and obedience, the church creates religious families. like any large family, some brothers have similar interests and interact often, others not as much. but they are all brothers, bonded by history, profession and purpose. in times of celebration and times of grief, they are there. in support of one another's prayer life, moral life and personal life, they are there. in accomplishing works for god that could never be done by one person or in one lifetime, they are there. the best way to learn if a religious family is a good fit for you is to spend time with them. the oblate associate program and summer catholic youth camp internships are two ways to do just that. 










"great occasions for serving god come seldom, but little ones surround us daily." â st. francis de sales










salesian spiritualitysalesian spirituality flows from the lives and teachings of st. francis de sales (1567-1622) and st. jane de chantal (1572-1641). during their lifetimes and far beyond, they helped countless souls grow in holiness and live for christ. together they founded the sisters of the visitation of holy mary, a community of contemplative nuns. in time, one of their sisters, venerable mother mary de sales chappuis, convinced blessed louis brisson to found the oblates. many other religious congregations and lay organizations went on to embraced salesian spirituality as well, as witnessed by the north american salesian network. below are a few of the many websites devoted to st. francis de sales and salesian spirituality.

"i have called you by name, you are mine." â isaiah 43:1










from time to time, the holy spirit calls an oblate to the missions or some unique apostolate in the church. the provincial and community at large joins in their discernment. once approved, the congregation joins in their spiritual and material support. we share two examples below: fr. mike depcik, osfs, one of only a handful of deaf priests in the world and fr. tom hagan, osfs, founder of hands together, who lives jesus in the slums of cite soleil haiti.

"the harvest is abundant but the laborers are few." â matt. 9:37










considering a job or career? perhaps god is calling you instead to embrace a vocation and mission — to become a fisher of men and a spiritual father. the peace the world cannot give is the fruit of uniting our will to the loving will of god.“i have told you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete." – john 15:11
