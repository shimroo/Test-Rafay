new river battalion










mission
the new river battalion recruits, develops, and commissions officers of impeccable character & competence, capable of thriving in chaos as servant leaders, dedicated to lifelong service to our nation.









welcome to army rotc’s new river battalion at virginia tech. army rotc is one of the best leadership courses in the country and can be part of your college curriculum. through classes and field training, army rotc provides you with the tools to become an army officer without interfering with your other classes. rotc also provides you with discipline and money for tuition while enhancing your college experience. graduates of our program serve in a variety of career fields including operations (infantry, armor, aviation, artillery, air defense artillery, cyber, or engineers), operations support (intelligence, signal), force sustainment (logistics), or other specialty fields (medical service). in addition to two-year, three-year, and four-year scholarships, some cadets choose to join the national guard or the army reserve while in army rotc, thus qualifying them for the gi bill, in-state tuition, and other exciting benefits.

virginia tech is one of the united states' six senior military colleges and one of two such programs at a predominantly civilian university. as a graduate of a senior military college, a medically-qualified cadet successfully completing all rotc requirements is virtually assured of obtaining an active duty commission. a few cadets each year earn a reserve forces duty commission. these future lieutenants will serve as a commissioned officer in either the u.s. army reserve or the army national guard.
