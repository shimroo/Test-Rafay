engineering design & analysis, ltd.


.&nbsp.&nbsp.&nbsp.Â 
		is a specialty engineering consultancy providing analytical, project engineering, project 
		management and heavy lift engineering services to the refining, petrochemical, oil sands,
		heavy oil, pipeline and power generation industries.  
            
 Â  Â  Â  Â 
		our experience and reputation is built on providing quick-turnaround & timely, cost-effective,  reliable solutions and 
                non-acadmic treatment for ffs projects directly to facility owners, manufacturers & epc contractors.
                our analytical solutions are made to  recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices.

fitness for service (ffs) / asset integrity management 
closed form and numerical solution techniques are used to 
                                        assess the structural and mechanical integrity of facility assets in a managed 
                                        framework, perform fitness for service (asme ffs - 1 / api 579) and service life 
                                        assessments of deteriorated equipment from metal loss, crack-like defects, hydrogen damage,
					vibration-induced damage (fiv, aiv), shell distortions, creep.
                                        





design, rerate, alteration & authentication 
pressure equipment and supporting design & alteration submissions 
					entering canada and individual provinces typically requires 
					authentication by a licensed professional of the importing provincial / territorial
					jurisdiction to satisfy local regulatory authorities in order to accept valid professional
					work products. 
					





cold eyes / 3rd party review / expert witness
software aided engineering and automation tools have progressed to where intelligent 
					solutions are being delivered quickly including automated report generation.  the conclusions from  
					these "engineering reports"  may be accurate, overly-conservative or severely unconservative
					and, consequently, require vetting.  for owner-engineers and in-house subject matter experts, competent 3rd party cold-eyes review 
					are needed to assure compliance with best-in-class operations integrity practices. 
					





training, logistics & technical editing 
we provide on-and off-site training in design, fabrication, inspection & maintenance
					for the construction and post-construction maintenance of static equipment & piping in various 
					heavy industries (refineries, petro-chem, etc.).  our technical review and editing services ensure delivery 
					of quality presentations in work product for industry publications (journals, papers, etc.).
