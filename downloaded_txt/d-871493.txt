 i want to thank you and your team for another wonderful event at cci! of course i expected no less! i want to acknowledge how smooth everything ran and how you make my job just that much easier! the club was beautifully set up and very inviting. nice work!
brian 





 absolutely incredible! the country club of indianapolis made my wedding dreams and goals become a reality. literally, my pinterest board came to life. we got married outside, cocktail hour was in the parlor, and the reception was in the ballroom. the staff is absolutely incredible. they were easy to communicate with and took so much of the stress out of planning a wedding, especially during covid-19. service was excellent and food preparation was amazing. everything was absolutely perfect and stress free on my wedding day. i can not recommend this venue enough!

 the event turned out really well and all of your staff was exceptional. everyone was extremely helpful and nice. also, the food was outstanding! it looked like a picture in a magazine, and it tasted fantastic. everyone was really pleased! thank you for ensuring that everything was perfect for us for our high school reunion. i, and everyone else, thought it was an a+ location.

 just a quick note to thank you and your team once again for another fantastic day at cci. you guys killed it! i don’t think we could have had a better experience than yesterday. i have had numerous clients call and text me just raving about the time they had. best of luck with the outings coming up as the season comes to a close.
