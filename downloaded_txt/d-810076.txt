eschew normalcy!


n.x.n was my 
personal site from 
mid-1999 until late 2000 or so.  at this 
point in time (january 2003) i doubt i'll ever do much work on it again. 
the content remains; it's simply not being added to anymore. 
however, my webcomic snail dust 
continues to this day, with over three years of archived comics free for 
the viewing.
