until teachers and admins speak up, bullying of teens won't ever end








the canessa commentary

by kevin canessa jr.



west
palm beach, fla. – it continues
to happen.



a teen gets
bullied. the bullying teens get away with it. the bullied teen sees no way out,
and commits suicide. the latest example happened here just a few days ago.



but there’s
a twist this time – the mother of one of the girls accused of being a bully has
herself been arrested. and it’s about damn time.



i’ve shared
this story before, but it’s worth sharing over and over. one of the reasons i
no longer teach is because of several cases of bullying i saw whilst a teacher
that were ignored by my administrators.



the kid who
was being bullied was picked on mercilessly. he was called every name in the
book, but the predominant names included “fag,” “faggot,” and “homo.”

is it fair to blame a suicidal teen who took other lives?







the canessa commentaryby kevin canessa jr.

edison, n.j. -- 



on wednesday, we learned of the suicidal death of a 15-year-old boy, srijan saha, a student
at jp stevens high school in edison, n.j. when the story was first made known
to the public, it was believed to be a horrific crash that took the lives of
saha and two other men driving in another car. 



the two men
who died were mohammed zia, 46, and his brother-in-law, ali behzad, 36, both of
edison, n.j. the star-ledger reported the two men had gone out for a late-night
cup of coffee, and wound up being hit, head on, on state route 27.



a simple cup
of coffee turns into an epic tragedy.



but on
wednesday, we learned the boy, whose name hasn’t officially been released by
police, wrote a suicide note on himself. and what was first seen as a tragic
car crash turned into a homicide-suicide.




saha's facebook photo.


saha, at 15,
wasn’t even old enough to have a learner’s permit driver’s license. reports say
he took his family car without his parents’ knowledge.



this story
opened up a discussion on nj.com, the official website of the star-ledger, that
was, at time, poignant, and at times, downright disgusting. for me, it opened
up thoughts again of yet another teenager whose mental health was clearly in
irreparable shape – and whose mental health problems somehow appeared to go
unnoticed.



before i go further,
let me say something clearly here: three lives were lost in this crash – and
the loss of any life in a car crash is always terribly sad.

the 10-biggest mistakes of ‘grey’s anatomy’










i’ve been a huge fan of “grey’s anatomy” for a long time now. and as such, i wanted to do a series of pieces on the show. i’ll start off with a list of the 10 biggest mistakes of the show’s history. keep in mind, this is just a numbered list — it’s not meant to be a top 10.

1. allowing isaiah washington to walk. his choice of words toward t.r. knight were awful. but preston burke was a critical character of the show’s initial development. his return would really energize the show.

2. t.r. knight’s late-run treatment. in season 5, knight had such a limited role in the show it was a surprise his death was such a big deal to end the season. season 5, one of the best, could have been so much better had t.r. had a greater role.

3. killing off george. the funeral scene was epic. but i hate when characters are killed off. i’d always like to see a george return, but unless it’s with someone else hallucinating — like izzie did when she had a tumor — it ain’t gonna happen.


george o’malley, md


4. killing off mark. another vitally awesome character.

5. killing off lexie. same as above.

6. izzie’s departure. it was bizarre. does a woman really leave her husband of just a few months that quickly, only to return twice? shonda rhimes is a brilliant writer — but she missed out on this one.

7. cristina’s two pregnancies. one was enough.

8. erica hahn. i just never liked her character — ever — from the heart transplant for denny duquette to her becoming head of c.t. at seattle grace/mercy west. i was never more upset than when she was getting ready to rat out izzie for her role in denny’s transplant — but was thrilled that was her last-ever episode.



adele webber

9. spinning off addison and sending her to cali. she was such a great character. and i never quite liked “private practice.” and yet, every time she made cameos on “grey’s,” i found those episodes to be stellar. here's hoping she makes many more cameos now that pp is over.

10. adele getting alzheimer’s right in the midst of merder’s clinical trial. really? the chief of surgery’s wife just happens to get alzheimer’s as one of the most prominent alzheimer’s clinical trials is on-going at the hospital, leading to as much trouble as it did for meredith? it was just too much. also, getting to see ellis grey with alzheimer’s was difficult enough to watch — seeing adele going through it — and richard for that matter — was just way too much to stomach.

what did i miss? let me know in the comments or tweet me @kevincanessa.

the greatest jesuit i've ever known: father tony azzarto, sj









note: i wrote this piece in 2007. and yet, so little about tony has changed. i decided to 'republish' it in light of the new pope, francis, being a jesuit priest.

the canessa commentaryby kevin canessa jr.

if he knew i were writing this column, the rev. tony azzarto, s.j., of st. peter’s prep, would politely say something like: “what would you be thinking there. there’s no need for this.” with his great brooklyn accent, the emphasis would be on the word “for.” anyone who knows tony would realize this.

of course, he’s been like that his entire life. a man who has given of himself to generations of students at st. peter’s prep and to many thousands of nigerians in west africa rarely realizes just how much impact he’s had on the lives of so many people. instead, he’ll tell you it’s not what he does that has an impact on people, it’s the reaction of the people to his guidance that really creates the impact.


but the truth of the matter is that tony azzarto really has had that impact on so many — and he embodies was a member of the society of jesus should be in every sense of the word. he is the greatest living example of a man for others, something a wonderful jesuit priest, father pedro arrupe, called all associated with the jesuits to be. if there were a book written in the modern world simply on examples of being “men for others,” there isn’t a jesuit more deserving of having his photo on the front cover than tony azzarto.

tony’s story is a very simple one. as a boy, he attended brooklyn prep, a school that closed its doors in the ‘70s, and a school that was home to many a recognizable name, including curtis sliwa, founder of the guardian angels. and, like many boys who attended brooklyn prep way back when, tony went into the jesuits not too long after his high school days were over.

while preparing to become a jesuit father, he studied philosophy and theology, and had a few years as a scholastic at st. peter’s prep in the late 1960s — he taught religion back then.

he then came back to st. peter’s prep, and it likely wasn’t until 1985, immediately following his first big stint of five years in nigeria, that he had his greatest impact on the st. peter’s prep family.

when he came back, he took over the emmaus retreat program which, unbelievably, turns 30 this year. for 20-some-odd years, tony was the leader of emmaus, and can be recalled fondly by any prep alumnus who ever made the retreat.

and if you want to talk about sports — my goodness was and is he ever a big sports fan. professionally, he was a huge fan of the dodgers, perhaps because of his strong brooklyn roots. i can still recall that even though i was a fan of the new york mets, i was very happy for tony when the team from l.a. beat the mets in the 1988 national league championship series — and then went on to win the world series against the heavily favored oakland a’s. tony is the kind of guy who can really get you to love your enemy — whether a sports team, a rival, whatever. his aura of peacefulness transcended any kind of negativity — and he did a great job of it in 1988 (and heck, every other year he was part of the faculty at st. peter’s prep).

on a personal note, tony was for me a mentor — and was the single-greatest reason i considered entering the jesuits in the early 2000s. i had always wanted to be a priest, and having someone like tony as a mentor made it all the more natural that it would be the jesuits for me — or nothing at all. though i didn’t ultimately wind up entering the jesuits, a decision i still question from time to time, tony continued to mentor me well beyond my years (1988-1992) at st. peter’s prep.

when i was a teacher at st. anthony high school in jersey city, he allowed me to “borrow” the emmaus model for the students there. then, at oratory prep later, the same thing happened, and the results were incredible. our emmaus program was as successful as it was at st. peter’s, and without tony, none of it would have been possible.

so many times, when we’d have a retreat, tony would make his way up to mount arlington to the retreat house to say mass. never would he accept a penny for saying the mass, a custom most diocesan priests are used to. he would say, on a regular basis, “as long as you have a cookie or two for me, and maybe a slice of pizza, i would love to be there for you for mass.”

and there he was, time and time again, on his own weekend — doing what he loved so much — for free.

though he may not realize it, hundreds of kids from st. anthony’s and oratory prep each had an opportunity to experience emmaus because of tony. again, he’d say it was the holy spirit that allowed the kids to have such great times — but i would always disagree, and tell him that it was he who made much of that joy possible, a joy that for many kids, would not otherwise have happened.

and you see, that’s what he’s all about, is tony azzarto. he never drove a fancy car; in fact, on two occasions, when he came to say mass for us, he came in a huge yellow st. peter’s prep school bus. talk about simplicity. he never much boasted about being able to wear a roman collar. instead, he often wore regular clothing, an outward sign of his humble nature and vow of poverty. he also showed so many of us that, unlike many other priests, he firmly believed he was no better or worse a person than the average layman. he believed in that so much so that he would always invite kids to surround him at the altar when he’d say mass, and bless the bread and wine as it became the body and blood of christ.

he never as much as asked for a thank you for anything he ever did for me, or for anyone else for that matter. he was only doing the work of jesus, he’d say. prayer and pizza were thanks enough.

but really, if you want to talk about a man who is deserving of all the praise and accolades in the world, it’s tony azzarto, because he’s done so much for so many that it’s impossible to list even a handful here — it would take up so much space.

he is really the greatest man for others on this planet.

back to nigeria

a few years ago, i had an opportunity to spend an entire day at st. peter’s prep, sitting in on several classes, meeting with seniors and administrators — and i even had a chance to eat lunch with many of the women and men who taught me while i was in high school. that day turned out to be a really sad one, though, because it was the day i learned that tony would be leaving st. peter’s prep to return to a place he’d been before — nigeria, west africa.

oh what a bummer this was to learn.

for two years, tony was the pastor of a church there. and, for the most part, i didn’t have contact with him during that time period. but now, tony’s back.

he has a different role now at st. peter’s. he’s the alumni chaplain.

i haven’t had a chance to ask him yet just what alumni chaplain means. but i’m sure whatever it is, he’ll do it with class. the entire community at prep is fortunate to have him back. the school is better when he’s there.

there will also be one more fan rooting at sporting events, too. i failed to mention this before, but if there’s a prep sporting event — even if it’s freshman basketball or, yawn, a track-and-field meet — you’ll likely find tony there.

and it’s things like this that separate tony from just about anyone else you’d ever come across.

he’s a true man for others.

he should one day be canonized a saint, though he’d certainly tell you otherwise.

and now, he’s finally home — where he should be, doing the work god called him to do, right in our own backyard.

welcome home, tony azzarto!

welcome home!

10 years ago on feb. 20 -- 100 lives lost at the station nightclub fire in west warwick, r.i.








the following post appeared on this site on 5 jan. 2013.

it's nearly impossible to believe it, but on feb. 20, it will have been 10 years since the deadly fire at the station nightclub in west warwick, r.i., that took the lives of 100 people.

that night, the band great white was performing. shortly after 11 p.m., the band began its first set -- and as they played their first song, pyrotechnics were set off. merely 40 seconds thereafter, the area behind the stage was ablaze -- and just 2 minutes after the first pyrotechnics were set off, the entire club was engulfed in lurid black smoke and flames.

perhaps the most heartbreaking element of this tragedy was that while there were multiple exits to the club, most flocked to the main exit -- and scores of people fell on top of each other, trapping them in the tiny hallway that led from the club to the parking lot.







of all ironies, the night of the fire, a tv crew from a local station was on site to do a story -- on nightclub safety. the video was released to the public some time after the fire -- and demonstrates the ferocity of the fire, and just how quickly it spread. of course, a later controversy spread after it was learned the journalist who was doing the piece was actually a part owner of the club -- an egregious conflict of interest.

further, there was belief -- judge for yourself after seeing the video -- that the person with the camera didn't vacate the club quickly enough after the fire broke out. it was suggested that because he stood still as he did, he made it more difficult for patrons to exit the fire.

rhode island man looks to make profits over photo he took before 100 people died 10 years ago in nightclub fire






port st. lucie, fla. —

folks, i made a huge mistake.

a few weeks ago, when i wrote a piece about the 10th anniversary of the death of 100 people at the station nightclub fire in west warwick, r.i., i posted with it a photo taken inside the club just as the fire started. (click here to read the original piece)

i found the photo on wikipedia, not realizing it wasn't in the public domain. most of the time, there's fair use on wiki photos — but this time, i was wrong. click here to see the photo on wikipedia — i wonder if mr. davidson made wiki pay for the use of the photo or if he'll demand $100 for linking to his photo?

fast forward to a few nights ago — i get an e-mail from dan davidson, of wyoming, r.i., (yes, that's the name of a town there), who demands i send him a check for $200 for posting the photo.

folks, i made an error here. i shouldn't have posted the photo (i could have easily used a screen cap from videos taken that night that are in the public domain). but i must admit — in 20 years of journalism, i've never been more disgusted than i am by what this guy is doing.

on feb. 20, 2003, some 100 lives were lost in a most tragic way in west warwick. and this man, dan davidson, is looking to score a profit over it.

i invited him to sue me. i took the photo down the moment he e-mailed me. i make no money on this blog. though i would if i could, i've never sold an ad for it. and if he wants to tell a court of law he's suing for $200 because i used a photo that showed the last moments of people's lives before they were burned and trampled in one of the nation's most horrific fires, so be it.

but you deserved to know this story. there's a man in wyoming, r.i., looking to profit over the deaths of 100 people.

if it gets more despicable than that, let me know.

boy am i ever sorry i posted that photo.

video below was taken the night of the fire, 20 feb. 2003.

leslie gold, the radiochick, is tearing it up on fox news radio and with 'the gong show live-off broadway'







the canessa commentary

by kevin canessa jr.



new york city —




leslie gold 'the radiochick'


i will preface this by saying i consider her a dear friend, someone who i care greatly for — and someone i’d take a bullet for. with that said, this piece is instantly ok to dub “biased.”



and yet, that matters not one bit, because whenever i get a chance to share the good news about what leslie gold is doing — you remember her as the radiochick — i enjoy it.



for those of you in new york, you will no doubt remember leslie from her days on three prominent new york city radio stations — 102.7 wnew, 92.3 when it went talk and q-104.3. for years, she came into our homes and cars with her two sidekicks, butch brennan and chuck nice — and she made us laugh, she made us cry. she made us think, she made us shake our heads. 



unfortunately for us — the fm hot talk genre didn’t do well in new york (though leslie’s shows were always the antithesis to the norm of the stations … they always did well ratings-wise and in billing). so after her days on terrestrial radio were over, she and butch did a podcast for about six months.



and then, in 2009, i got to meet leslie when she founded shovio.com — and did her show there for more than a year.



but it’s the post-shovio days that have been extremely intriguing for leslie — she’s the owner of the rights to “the gong show live--off broadway,” — yes, that “gong show,” and she’s constantly filling in on fox news radio.



imagine that — our leslie is doing fantastic work on fox news radio. if it first it’s hard to envision leslie talking republican politics, think again. she’s so damn good at it that even this left-wing nutcase goes out of his way to tune in whenever she’s filling in for brian killmeade, tom sullivan or john gibson — or whomever.



she brings humor and deep insights to politics in ways no one — and i mean no one — at the network can. she can make a story like the manti t’eo hoax come to life. she can make the most ardent barack obama supporter (like me) think twice about his decisions. she can make the most ardent liberal actually want to listen to fox news radio.



that’s how good she is.



and it shows.



though she doesn’t call herself “the radiochick” on the air, quite often, callers remind the audience she’s still the chick. so she’s certainly not averse to remembering back to those days.



it’s just the topics that are different.



she still offers an amazing perspective on the news of the day.



she still gives the audience a real reason to tune in whenever she’s on the air.



in other words, though she’s leslie on fox news radio, she’s really still the chick — and brings something special — something intangible … to the mic. 



i’m going to do my best to post whenever she’s on the air, both here on this website — and on facebook and twitter, too. if you’re like me, and miss the days of chick, chuck and butch, trust me when i tell you — you won’t be disappointed when you tune in to her fox news shows. 



if the most ardent liberal in the world can do it — and i can’t put sean hannity of bill o’reilly on for more than 20 seconds without flipping the channel  — you certainly can, too.



the gong show live off-broadway



but her new incarnation goes well beyond the radio. in fact, she’s running a show she loved when she was younger. and a few years ago, when the rights to the show were for sale, she jumped and bought them.



now, once a month, “the gong show live-off broadway” is brought to life, off broadway, at the cutting room in manhattan — 44 e. 32nd st. this isn't an amateur deal either — this is as professionally run an off-broadway show as you're going to see. no amateurs. we're taking the real deal here.





leslie, seen here waving, at a recent 'gong show live-off broadway' performance.

each month, the sold-out shows bring the audience to their feet, with rip-roaring laughter and an all-around great experience. and the show has been in other places throughout the country — and could be, again.



perhaps the most amazing of the shows was a few months ago, after hurricane sandy.



leslie got a few sponsors together — and an entire performance was done in front of a house packed with people whose lives were turned upside down by sandy. each person went to the show for free — and got a free drink and appetizer, too.



and you see, this is what leslie is all about. 



for as long as i’ve known her, her biggest concerns were for others. she had every right to be angry when things didn’t work out with certain radio stations. same with shovio, too. and yet, in a real way, she’d taken every adversity she’s been faced with, and has turned it around and make life better for so many people.



whether it’s those affected by sandy, or wanting to get me a job in radio when i was first dipping my toes into the water — whatever the scenario — she’s always put others first.



and that’s just one of many things that make leslie special.



as for “the gong show live-off broadway,” if you’re interested — or if you’d like to perhaps do an office outing at the show — the show can be tailored to any office’s needs — i want you to go to the show’s website, www.gongshowlive.net. 



check out “the gong show live-off broadway.” and check out leslie’s work on fox news radio.



if you’re disappointed, i’d be shocked.



then again, i’m not worried about disappointment one bit.

for me, 'monday mornings' will be appointment tv







 
a review by kevin canessa jr.



port st. lucie, fla. —



i love to write tv show reviews. it’s just that i usually wait a few days after i’ve seen the first episode of a show to do so. but in the case of “monday mornings,” i couldn’t wait — it was that good.



the show, mondays at 10 p.m. et on tnt, gets its name from the monday morning meetings in hospitals that surgeons attend — morbidity & mortality meetings, or m&m — to discuss the good, and the very bad, in their surgical performances. 



in the first episode, we meet a doctor, brilliantly played by blake robbins (you’ll remember blake as dave brass, the hard-luck correctional officer whose achilles tendon was severed by an inmate in “oz”), who is on the proverbial hot seat. he’s drilled by the chief of surgery, dr. harding hooten (alfred molina, who we’ll profile next week) on a case of a runner who was in pain who died after the doctor missed a form of cancer a simple mri would have caught.





in an impeccable way, robbins captured the intense scrutiny these surgeons face when they’re put on stage, in front of their colleagues, and absolutely humiliated to the core about errors of judgment made. in the opening 10 minutes alone, between molina’s portrayal of arrogance and robbins’s portrayal of a doc who made serious errors, i was hooked and literally on the edge of my seat.



my heart was beating that fast. 



my heart was breaking for the patient.



my heart was breaking for the doctor.



and if the pilot is any indication, we’re going to get a myriad of emotions — anger, sadness, joy, disgust — from this show.





and for fans of “er” who have felt a certain void since that show ended in 2009 after an amazing run, we’ve finally got our sequel.



each of the doctors have extreme personalities that are relatable. 



and yet, it’s the doctor played by jamie bamber i seem to identify with most already.



those of you who are fans of “law & order uk” will remember bamber as d/s matty devlin. in this role, where he plays american dr. tyler wilson (his “american” accent is brilliant, by the way), you’ve got a surgeon we rarely got to see on “er,” except when dr. john carter spent his first years in surgery. he is perhaps the complete antithesis of “er’s” dr. peter benton — he cares deeply for his patients. he worries with his patients’ families — and he shows emotion in ways we rarely get to see in fictional surgeons.



in the debut of the series, he’s tasked with operating on a young boy who comes in with a headache, only to learn he’s got a potentially life-threatening tumor in his brain.



for fear of spoiling the episode for those who haven’t seen it yet, let’s just say bamber is magnificent in dealing with the quickly done surgery — and he shows an amazingly deep side in dealing with the boy’s mum and in the subsequent m&m.





and the surgery was hardly what one would call a “success.”



there are a few other characters in the show, too, who are just great. one is dr. jorge villanueva (ving rhames), who is peter benton with about 20 years more experience. and dr. tina ridgeway (jennifer finnegan), who is a mixture of dr. susan lewis and kerry weaver). 



we also meet a doctor whose english is poor — but whose neuro-surgical skills are impeccable. and a few others whose characters aren’t yet developed.





the bottom line, though, is this is a winner. we’ve waited a long time for a great medical drama after “er,” and this one appears to be it.



in the coming weeks, i’ll break down more of the doctors/characters. but in the meantime, “monday mornings” is worth every second of the 2,400 it runs each week.



and i cannot wait for the next episode next week.



5 of 5.



“monday mornings” can be seen on tnt every monday at 10 p.m. eastern time.

it's time for newark archbishop myers to be removed







the canessa commentary

by kevin canessa jr.





myers

after the roman catholic archdiocese of los angeles released the files of more than 150 priests accused of sexual abuse, i sifted through about 20 of them. i couldn’t help but wonder whether any lessons were learned by roger cardinal mahoney’s decades of inaction, covering up for priests, trying to avoid the police and more.



and then, i turned to the star-ledger on sunday — on nj.com — and read the absolutely unbelievable. 



the rev. michael fugee, accused and admitted child groper, was being appointed to a prestigious archdiocesan position — one that will oversee the formation and educational opportunities afforded seminarians.



in 2001, he told police he inappropriately grabbed the crotch of a boy while in a bergen county parish. 



he was convicted in a court of law — found guilty — but because of a technicality, the conviction was overturned. 



but let’s make no mistake here — the man admitted his guilt. and no technicality could or will ever negate that reality. he admitted to a “moment of arousal” when he touched the genitals of a pre-pubescent teenage boy.



as part of his agreement with the courts — didn’t matter his conviction was overturned — he is required to have no contact, none whatsoever, with children.



this all came down in 2001.



and yet, it’s obvious the archbishop of newark, john j. myers, seems to have forgotten that. and he’s forgotten this priest, regardless of what the courts say, is a predatory monster.



fast-forward to 2009. he was assigned to a hospital as a chaplain.



what a shocker here — myers never told the hospital admins.



it wasn’t until someone told the hospital powers-that-be that fugee was removed from the chaplaincy.



lest we forget — there are children in hospitals, and is there any doubt that he had contact with kids while working there?



and now this. a prestigious archdiocesan position.



it may not require him to have contact with kids, but for the love of god, could myers, who appointed fugee to this position, be more tone deaf? could he be more arrogant? could he, frankly, be any more stupid?



here’s what myers said with this appointment without actually saying it: “so what if one of our priests touches boys. we’ll just give him a promotion of sorts and put him in a position of honor.”



it’s as disgusting as anything myers has done in his 12-year reign of terror as newark’s archbishop. and i simply don’t have the time to list them here — it would take hundreds of pages and hours to write them all.



but it simply confirmed something i knew the day we learned he’d replace the last archbishop, the now-retired theodore cardinal mccarrick — and that is that myers has no business running a dollar store, let alone a flock of around 1 million catholics.



not only should fugee immediately be removed from this position, it’s time for myers to go, too. for far too long, he’s ruined everything he’s touched. he’s mismanaged the priest-abuse scandal here — and, for that matter, in peoria, ill., his former diocese — in as bad a manner as mahony has in los angeles.



he’s never really wanted to be in newark, and quite frankly, this writer never wanted him here either. and yet, he’s lasted, shockingly, as long as he has.



pick up the pen, myers. write the letter to the holy father. tell him you’re ready to leave the archdiocese.



and do it now.



because if you don’t, lord knows how many more lives — and families — you’ll ruin.



you’ve had too many chances to do that already.



and if past history — recent history — says anything, there’s no doubt you’ll strike again with something stupid, inane and outrageous. 



sooner than later.
