video transcript
assessments are everywhere in our lives. from a driving test to an english exam, from a classroom quiz to a degree - we all deserve the opportunity to have our skills and knowledge recognized.
at the assessment network we believe that effective assessment is about more than just getting questions right. we believe that valid and reliable assessments create fair and inclusive opportunities for learners, enabling them to show their full potential - and that powerful assessment opens the door to truly equitable meaningful outcomes, ensuring every person gets the chance to succeed.
the assessment network is part of cambridge university press and assessment. we equip assessment professionals with a clear understanding of assessment principles and practice, supporting professionals all over the world who are working hard to get assessments right for learners.
“effective assessments can help boost learners confidence by showing them that their hard work, efforts and also abilities are being recognised.”
“so knowing more about assessment means that you can align things better with student learning outcomes. the more you learn the more you can connect with people who are in the practice of the assessment the better it's going to be for everyone.”
“i can now create a balanced and a fair meaningful assessment this ensures that every learner in my class, regardless of their background or skill level has an equal opportunity to succeed.”
“the impact on my professional practice, it's almost turned it on its head. i use assessment as an integral part of the learning process.”
we enable practitioners to reach the forefront of their profession as recognized up-to-date assessment leaders, while uniting a global network of professionals who are connecting, sharing, learning and marking themselves out as assessment experts.
“if you can communicate and make understandable to everyone then you are in a position to be innovative. you can design, you can implement, you can tailor solutions regarding assessment to different situations you face.”
“when you are working on this assessment you actually more confident now because you're part of global network because you have members across all over the world sharing their knowhow and we are also sharing our practices.”
“if you develop expertise you can make more informed decisions, you can be more involved in the discussions to produce better qualifications because of that.”
from learners achieving their goals, to educators being recognized for their expertise valid reliable fair and inclusive assessment is where it all starts.
as assessment leaders we are committed to supporting you and your learners aspirations so that with good assessment comes great opportunity.
