rocketaware: status

rocketaware: vehicle

we use the design principles of rapid knowledge transfer: techniques proven to deliver efficient awareness.
our classification system is by subject, which means no separate pages for books and websites, for example.
we have developed rocketaware orbits, innovative filtering and presentation that shows items most likely to fit your needs and interests with less time and frustration, that still allows you to change your view to see more or less when you need it.  use one of the rocketaware piloted orbits to match your needs and interests, or fine tune an orbit of your own.
we intend to accomodate significant growth.  (while under development we have added about 1000 items per month!)

 rocketaware orbits are viewable subsets of the complete categories.
use one of the piloted orbits to see items matching preferred characteristics. 
or pilot your own orbit for full control over what rocketaware shows you first.  (on page links make it simple to jump from a piloted orbit to narrow or expand  the listing.)
