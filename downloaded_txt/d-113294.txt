dahlonega, ga: a short story

dahlonega, georgia 

i recently visited the city of dahlonega, georgia. the area has been on my must-see list for quite a while for several reasons - “there’s gold in them thar hills”; there was a branch mint of the u.s. mint located here; hiking; wine tasting. the numismatic angle is what put the place on the map for me. i’ve cobbled together a few notes about the area - enjoy and please post pictures of any and all dahlonega coins!!!

on a side note, i also visited “low country” - charleston, sc and savannah, ga – both within easy drives of the dahlonega and atlanta (airport access) area. somewhat ironically, though, it wasn’t actually low country but dahlonega where i had the best meal of the trip – a delicious “low country boil”! yummy.​
fun fact: the name dahlonega is from the cherokee-language word dalonige, meaning “yellow” or “gold”.

the first roman captives & "trophy tableau monument"

a pair of republican quinarii i’ve been wanting for a few years now...especially the first one… 

i finally found the right ones in jacquier auction 51 last week. (sammlung r.l., a multi-generation family collection, formed c. 1890s-2010.)

(so, not actually mine yet, just coins i’ve won at auction.)

c. fundanius ar quinarius (1.67g). crawford 326/2.



t. cloelius ar quinarius (1.75g). crawford 332/1a.





what makes them interesting:

these are the first coins to depict a bound captive and trophy (what lauren kinnee [2016, 2018] calls the “trophy tableau monument” -- or just "trophy tableau"). trophies appeared on greek coins, but the captives were a roman innovation -- a succinct representation of their imperialistic outlook and attitudes toward non-romans.

in this case, the trophies (mannequins adorned w/ captured weapons, armor, carnyxes) are also being crowned by...

late last december [2023], i decided to take a road trip to visit all the coin shops i could while driving back home from california to colorado. my goal was to find as many cool dansco products and coins as i could. as well as meet other coin collectors.

four states, 1500 miles, 23 coins shops, a disastrous hotel stay, and 10 days later, i arrived back home with:

dozens of albums & pages, 15 lbs of world coins, 200 world current notes, and many stories to share.

junipero serra national medal

padre junipero serra 250th anniversary national commemorative medal of the united states

a bit of history in a medal.

over the past few years, i have been on a “mission” to visit all 21 of the spanish missions in california. as of august 2023, i have visited 13 of the 21. here are pictures of my favorites so far (in terms of architecture, preservation, museum quality, etc.).

mission san diego de alcala (san diego, ca):



mission san antonio de padua (jolon, ca):



mission nuestra senora de la soledad (soledad, ca):

		
​

several of the missions had the padre junipero serra 250th anniversary national commemorative medal on display in their museums. having lived here in california for 35 years i can’t help but to have heard of padre junipero serra and the california missions. i had not, however, heard of or seen this medal before. i also...

a dive into the toned morgan market (via legend auction 7/27/23 vs prior sales at gc, etc)

tonight was one of legend's regency auctions (the “boutique” sales they hold about once every two months) and there were plenty of morgans (as usual). what i found interesting is that many of these were very familiar. i often have seen a few morgans that i have previously bid on pop up but tonight there were many. so i figured it would be interesting to compare the results.

the first is a nice semi-pl 1880-s. this coin i first saw on instagram in an ngc ms 64 star holder. it was cracked out and sent to pcgs, where it also got an ms 64. someone later upgraded it to an ms 65 and sent to great collections (april 2020), where it brought 1,293.75 (when including the buyer's fee). tonight at legend it ended at 1,204.38 (when including the buyer's fee). given that the market was still queasy in early 2020 (before taking off in the following months of that year), this isn't a great result.

gc (april 2020): 1,293.75
legend: 1,204.38...

the assarion ,and a history in late byzantine coin studies.

the city of constantinople existed from its inauguration until its final fall a total of 1,123 years and 18 days. this thread pertains to its final years of the coins of the empire, trying to understand the naming of the later denominations and clarifying the confusion of the multiple names for the same coinage.

this is important to the collector because the study of late byzantine coinage is so new (it became a serious focus in the 1960s), a real hindrance in its study is keeping the names of the denomination’s straight. as studies progress so do the changes in terminology.  a great example of this is the assarion.




andronicus ii and michael ix assarion ( 1294-1320 ) obv-half length figure st. michael rev- christ blessing kneeling andronicus ii and michael ix. 1.6gm 22.13mm sbcv-2345 lianta 793
