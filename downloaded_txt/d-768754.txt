“i wanted to reach out to tell you how pleased we have been with your company.  it was a bit overwhelming doing a big project on our home, and we wanted to be sure we had a contractor that would not only do a good job but we could trust. your company has exceeded our hopes. we have felt cared for every step of the way. 
starting with your quick response to our online inquiry, you were the first contractors we heard back from and actually contacted us on a weekend! then meeting kevin and feeling so comfortable with him, he was patient and kind all the way through the planning. then we met victoria, who helped us pick every item out and made sure we got exactly what we wanted and that we were picking current and timeless trends. then there is jamie who is always available to us and also patient and kind, willing to explain everything and take our questions. all three of these people feel like friends and have our complete trust. we have been telling all our friends and family that we got lucky and found the best home remodelers out there. it is so awesome to be doing business with you. thank you!”

dear lecy bros.,
jack and i wanted to write this note to tell you how much we enjoyed the whole process of building our new dream home. heck, if we could afford it, i’d build a new home every 5 years! all the people and subcontractors were so helpful in their offering of hints and ideas we just didn’t know were out there. we know we had the best house builders out there; we’ve been going to your open houses since we moved to eden prairie in 1980. i just wanted you to know what a wonderful experience we had building our new home!!!

“the entire lecy bros. team, from start to finish, was incredibly hard working, detail oriented, and did a fantastic, very high quality job. we are your biggest fans! thank you also for your generosity with all the extras. we really miss seeing everyone on a daily basis – we feel like we really formed some friendships during this whole process, instead of simply business acquaintances. thank you again- yours and roy’s generosity are the reasons we were able to build this house which we absolutely love.”
– d.b. & d.b.








“we have lived in our new home one year already. from the first day we met with lecy bros. to the final one year follow-up appointment we recently had with your company, you have continued to exceed our expectations. thank you for making the building process a great one for us. your entire team is outstanding. we are very appreciative of your help, suggestions, creative solutions, and superb follow-up from start to finish. you helped us in picking a lot for our home, making many selections, design ideas, on-site changes when needed and so much more. we are extremely happy with everything in our new home. your workmanship is some of the best we have seen. the follow-up and attention to detail was outstanding. again, our sincerest thank you for everything! we continue to recommend lecy to everyone we talk to about building and remodeling.”

“thank you so much for our gorgeous basement! we are so pleased with everything and we enjoy getting compliments on the finished product. with cooler weather coming up we are looking forward to hanging out and watching movies in the basement. we especially love the woodwork and i couldn’t be happier with the results. the kids love the mouse hole and the booth best! we look forward to another project in the future! front or back porch…?!”

“both jeff and i want to thank you for the wonderful job you (and your team) did remodeling our basement. to say that we are thrilled is an understatement! you made the process easy to navigate with the “selection package” and meetings. working with the many crews that lived with us for a few months was a pleasure. everyone was professional, provided quality workmanship and was just fun to have around! i miss the company. finally, the way your responded to everything was very impressive and very much appreciated. we look forward to opportunities to work you again sometime.”
– j.k. & l.k.








“thank you for the successful completion of our stunning remodel.  our goal from the beginning was to seek out the best in the business and you delivered.  your talented team with their professionalism and eye for detail, were critical for the success of the end project.  it has been a genuine pleasure!”

“i wanted you to know, that my wife and i are very pleased with the new porch and deck addition. it has exceeded our expectations and we could not be more happy! having been in my own business for over 21 years, i always heard from my customer when we made a mistake, but not often when we did the job correctly. we would be happy to recommend lecy to any future customers you have.”
