it's a livejournal cliché -- the once largely public blog that one day changes the security on all of its past entries and announces a "friends only" policy.by the end of 2006, with maybe 3 or 4 exceptions everyone on my friends page was someone i knew or met "in real life."   but i'm changing the way i'm using lj.  i just added 100-some people i've had interactions with in the past, and from here on out posts on this blog will be friends-locked.  i think it'll work better that way.  and let's remember why we're here.  this isn't blogspot or even myspace, it's livejournal.so if somehow you follow my little soapbox and aren't yet on "the list," feel free to drop me a line either in the comments here or at escapade52 {at} gmail {dot} com.  i'll almost certainly friend you back, just let me know how ya found me.  lj has no tools to follow these things, but to the miniscule but non-zero number of readers from outside livejournal who found their way here, just set up an lj account (it's free, yo).  a cookie is all it takes.happy new year.
