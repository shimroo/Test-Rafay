trish goff - the lovely fashion model

     i started this site back in late 1995 when the internet was new and cool and i really wanted to get myself one of those web page things.  it was also a time when fashion and models (particulary models) were very popular, so i created this site and my chrystele site.  i have pretty much lost interest in maintaining these sites but i put a lot of effort into finding photos and scanning them (80% of the photos on other trish sites come from this site, i can tell) so i have decided to keep them going on free hosts (and i still get a good amount of traffic).  every once in a long while i will add photos if i happen to find them.  thanks for visiting.
