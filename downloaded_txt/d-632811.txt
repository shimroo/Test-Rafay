popong 21: random thoughts on a friday night

		the day passed uneventfully. i woke up, meditated, went back to sleep, and decided to skip my early morning walk, thinking i might do it after work. that didn’t happen, despite the weather being absolutely perfect. there was, however, something else that gave me a pleasant feeling— in less than a week, i will receive my first social security payment. it will probably be a short-lived elation, receiving money without working hard for it. meanwhile, i continue my paid work, even if it's only two hours per day, and then move on to my second occupation—the work that isn’t paid but gives me immense pleasure. this includes reading, meditation, blogging, and as of yesterday, programming with ai.

i am also managing my emotions better. the desire to socialize with low-level homeless people is losing its appeal. i have outgrown that phase, and i’m better off spending time with people who match my intellectual capacity. i’m not referring to the upper crust, the upper class, or the sophisticated elite in my locality. i mean engaging with authors and writers whose minds surpass mine, allowing me to absorb lessons and teachings my brain craves. i recently read amazing books about ai, a topic i intend to explore in my blog when i get the chance. i’m currently reading about simplistic, almost monastic hermits who shun the world, money, fame, and power to live off the land, away from the comforts of technology and modern amenities. there is so much i can enjoy without spending my time working to earn a living. i can do as i please while being supported by my fixed income.

yesterday, i had a realization: i am, without a doubt, a nerd—someone who clamors for intellectual pursuits i once abandoned due to the necessities of life. i worked in healthcare all my life because it was the only safe and reliable way to earn a good income to support myself and my extended family. but i sacrificed my personal intellectual interests.

**********************

this is precisely what i fear: this nation has placed so much value on those who accumulate wealth that it equates their financial success with intelligence and genius. people surrender their lives to these figures, hoping to improve their own, which essentially means becoming wealthy. anyone who promises riches is adored and idolized—until the truth emerges. and the truth is this: those who have amassed great wealth did not do so because they were exceptionally intelligent; rather, they outsmarted the ignorance of the very people who admire them. in a society where sensational claims—true or not—can easily transfer money from one hand to another, we see repeated cycles of illusionary wealth creation.

consider the false accumulation of wealth: cryptocurrency is based on its ‘imagined’ value; tesla was hyped as the savior from fossil fuels, yet it remains far from fulfilling those early promises; same is true with spacex and mars; artificial intelligence is now marketed as the next wealth generator—naturally benefiting those who are already rich. social media entices users with the prospect of earnings, but only after recruiting more people to engage with their platforms. all these are nothing more than artificial, sensationalized ploys designed to generate excitement and awe while luring people into freely giving away their data, attention, dreams, investments, and aspirations.

now, people are turning into zombies, their minds controlled by social media, artificial intelligence, manufactured news, spectacular theories, and false validation through likes and views. these are the games being played, and the big players are laughing all the way to the bank.

***************************

i am continuing this journal on a saturday night. it was a perfect saturday as well. i meditated and walked at least six miles. for lunch, i tried to eat healthily—a meal of vegetables and fish. earlier in the day, i entered a deep mental zone, writing an exercise article with ai’s assistance. in doing so, i discovered how slow my website is when handling large videos. i realized i am better off embedding videos from youtube or other sources because they are optimized for speed. it took me hours to upload a 100mb video to my ‘images’ directory, and it was rejected multiple times. i eventually transferred the file through filezilla, which took forever, only for it to fail to play. in the end, i embedded the youtube version instead.

this experience reinforced why shorter reels perform better on social platforms. larger videos require more processing power, whereas shorter ones load faster, which explains why tiktok garners more views. the same principle applies to embedded music—it increases file size and slows down performance. these are things to consider when uploading content to different platforms.

despite my reservations about the goals of social media and modern technology—which seem focused on creating addicts of the virtual world—the internet has significantly transformed my life as a retiree. without it, i would not have access to the world as i do now. without the internet, i might become restless, roaming around, reading newspapers, or observing people like old men did in the past. retirees often turn to each other for companionship, as i still see in parks and other public spaces. the only reason i can manage without physical companionship is the presence of jim, my tenant and friend. he has become like a brother to me—the only brother, in fact. without him, i would likely seek companionship elsewhere, possibly ending up with the wrong crowd.

with the internet and social media, i can bring the world into my home. it’s similar to how older generations would sit by their windows, watching people pass by. now, all i have to do is open my smartphone and engage with whatever or whomever i choose. some of these remote connections even allow for interaction at the touch of a button. this provides a refreshing perspective on retirement, though i must be cautious of becoming too dependent on it.
would my retirement be different without the internet? most likely, but i would still survive. my days would be spent writing, reading newspapers, and visiting bookstores and libraries. i might garden more, continue my two-hour daily work, and maintain my exercise routine to manage my diabetes. the main thing missing would be the social engagement the internet provides.

before the internet, i would visit libraries for news and research. i would frequent bookstores just to feel the presence of other intellectuals, even if we never spoke. i thrived in that environment pre-internet. i would roam bookstores and cafes, enough to meet my mobility requirements for maintaining my health. i miss those days, especially my time at borders in fort lauderdale, where i found the greatest comfort. it was an exciting era of browsing shelves, magazines, and books. so, yes, i would survive retirement without the internet, and i might not be as isolated as i fear.

the internet discourages me from physically seeking intellectual nourishment—it’s all available in my room. while i am naturally inclined toward solitude, social media has reduced my desire to move around. yet, it has granted me access to limitless knowledge and the tools to refine my craft. before the internet, i aspired to publish well-written articles after hiring expensive editors. now, i can self-publish via my blog. the greatest advantage? ai as my editor, turning my thoughts into polished gems.

publishing today is vastly different from the past. instead of endless revisions and engaging with editors who cater to business interests, i can write, edit, and publish instantly. still, it’s a balancing act between the physical and virtual worlds. the physical world provides experiences to write about, while the virtual world refines and shares them. writing, moving my body, reading, and engaging with ai create a partnership between these two, physical and virtual, realms.

ultimately, i am grateful for both worlds. my physical experiences enrich my virtual contributions. the challenge is ensuring a balance between the two—engaging in the real world while harnessing the benefits of the digital one.

		1 samuel 16:1
 samuel anoints david
 16 the lord said to samuel, “how long will you mourn for saul, since i have rejected him as king over israel? fill your horn with oil and be on your way; i am sending you to jesse of bethlehem. i have chosen one of his sons to be king.”

1 samuel 16:6-13

 6 when they arrived, samuel saw eliab and thought, “surely the lord’s anointed stands here before him.”

 7 but the lord said to samuel, “do not consider his appearance or his height, for i have rejected him. the lord does not look at the things people look at. people look at the outward appearance, but the lord looks at the heart.”

 8 then jesse called abinadab and had him pass in front of samuel. but samuel said, “the lord has not chosen this one either.”

 9 jesse then had shammah pass by, but samuel said, “nor has the lord chosen this one.”
 10 jesse had seven of his sons pass before samuel, but samuel said to him, “the lord has not chosen these.”

 11 so he asked jesse, “are these all the sons you have?”
 “there is still the youngest,” jesse answered. “he is tending the sheep.”
 samuel said, “send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.”

 12 so he sent for him and had him brought in. he was glowing with health, had a fine appearance, and was handsome. then the lord said, “rise and anoint him; this is the one.”

 13 so samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on, the spirit of the lord came powerfully upon david. then samuel went to ramah.

---

i love this passage—ah, the drama! the lord does not depend on outward appearances, though david was indeed handsome. instead, he looks at the heart, and it was david’s heart that set him apart.

yet despite this divine selection, david faced crises, sins, and pain throughout his reign. this reminds us that life will never be magical or a bed of roses. true life is not a virtual experience; its realness is far from the ideal.

i have a good life. i am healthy, i have some financial security with my fixed income and extra work hours, and for now, no major issues or expenses are looming over me. yet, i struggle. this morning, i checked my stock portfolio and started buying, only to be limited by the 9 am trading start time. then i got distracted by a sleek yet inexpensive casio watch—about to buy another one simply for its design and affordability, despite already owning seven or eight watches, some of which i barely wear.

it occurred to me: having more than enough only fuels the desire to have even more. i had plenty of justifications—the watch was cheap, it would bring me pleasure, it was unique—but i had said the same things about my previous purchases. this is where the wisdom of the holy spirit becomes crucial: the wisdom to discern when something is vain and unnecessary, when something indulges the very human folly i criticized just yesterday. the folly of relying on material things for joy—a fleeting joy, an unnecessary one.

lately, i’ve been reflecting on mankind’s relentless quest for more. material possessions never truly satisfy; they may temporarily fill a void, but that void only expands. it’s like packing a tooth cavity—if the infection remains, the filling won’t heal it and may even worsen the problem.

that’s why i am grateful for the time i had yesterday to read. my current book is about daniel suelo, a man who lives without money, in harmony with nature, and seemingly content. his biography allows me to experience his life vicariously. i admire people like him, those who defy society’s expectations—not in a revolutionary or destructive way, but simply by choosing a different path.

it was suelo i thought of while browsing for that casio watch. i already own five stylish watches. realizing this, i abruptly stopped my search, much like how i disengage from social media when i sense its pull into a mindless abyss.

ah, the lion’s den. it’s been a while since i used that term. i once associated it with the dark spaces of my past—the places that enabled sin. thankfully, those have largely vanished from my life. but the den remains, now inhabited by different desires: material possessions, social media, investment gains. yet, unlike before, i can resist these temptations. the pull is not as strong. i can turn away.

yesterday, i walked five miles in the morning—returning to my old routine. later, i picked up books i had finished reading, all about ai and technology, and added two more to my reading list.

on my way home, i passed by the park and then stopped at publix for groceries. i was relieved to find that the homeless people who often approach me for money were absent. for a moment, i considered returning to that park in the afternoons. its waterways are spectacular. but my relief was short-lived. though chris and the others were nowhere to be seen, i eventually noticed jeff slumped over, his hood pulled low—clearly high. the woman with him, another regular, sat against the wooden fence, eyes closed but visibly intoxicated. they are still there, and they will likely never leave. this park is their home until something—miraculous or tragic—changes their fate.

perhaps the lord is sending me a message: stay put in my usual walking park (jpp), where i can find peace. or maybe, it’s time to seek new places, places where addicted homeless peoples don’t cast a constant shadow. not necessarily upscale communities, but different people. i am not looking for the wealthy—i seek those who are homeless by choice, like daniel suelo or mark boyle, those who embrace simplicity and divine solitude. i don’t aspire to be a radical, nor do i wish to live like a beat poet. i simply long for solitude and the pursuit of deeper thoughts.

i once desired to be a catholic monk, but life had other plans—family responsibilities, my own nature, and worldly obligations led me down a different road. for decades, i resisted my love for contemplation, study, and philosophy. instead, i forced myself into a life of work and service, pretending to enjoy the roles assigned to me. but now, in retirement, i have a second chance.

i am trying to reclaim what was lost. i do this by immersing myself in the biographies and philosophies of those who lived the life i once dreamed of. through their words, i experience their solitude, their insights, their freedom.

i can no longer live the solitary and adventurous life they had. age has tethered me, and my survival now depends on careful decisions. but i can still expand my mind, nurture my thoughts, and seek wisdom in the realm of the spirit. the physical pursuit may be limited, but my soul is still free. and that, in the end, is what truly matters.

------


this is what happens when money becomes the god of a society. when wealth is the driving force, everything—regardless of its nature or necessity—must be managed based on profit, even when it goes beyond reason. i, too, was once tempted by money until i realized its futility—how it fuels vanity and draws me closer to sin. at one point, i had a surplus of income, and when that happened, it became much easier to spend excessively. what did i spend on? useless luxuries. worse, i paid for friendships and artificial love, enabled people's vices and addictions, and exposed myself to dangers and extreme stress. all because i had more money than i truly needed.

this is what is happening in the world today. a few have built mountains of gold beyond necessity, yet they cannot even touch it for fear of erosion and collapse. their hearts and minds are consumed with maintaining or expanding their wealth.

"too big to fail" is often their mantra. when a society becomes overly dependent on material wealth—when values are equated with riches, power, and fame, and personal worth is measured solely by these things—people inevitably lose sight of what truly matters.

we are composed of two parts: the material and the spiritual. as a human being, i cannot neglect one in favor of the other. both must be nourished to experience true joy and fulfillment. this is where i stand today. i have enough resources to live comfortably, and even if i have more than i need, i choose not to be consumed by it. instead, i devote myself to other aspects of life. i consider myself blessed by god in this regard. with the right mindset, i can spend my early mornings in contemplation and meditation, which fills my soul with immense harmony. this spiritual practice is the primary nourishment for my soul—the driving force of my body.

after meditation, i follow up with a walk or jog in the park. doing this alone, free from distractions, allows me to witness the lord’s presence in all of his creation while also keeping my body healthy and stable, a fitting vessel for my soul.

i wish this material-driven world could return to its basic and fundamental spirituality. true spirituality is the most fulfilling experience, offering joy and contentment. yet, the world has nearly erased the significance of the spirit and of god, denying their existence, relying instead on the false gods of money and randomness.
