mary-alice’s best friend claire decides to adopt a ‘sister’ for her pit bull rex, so the girls pay a visit to the local animal shelter. there they meet bonsai, a japanese akita, very much in need of a forever home. for 6 long months, people have passed her by misjudging her to be too old, too big or too something. with the help of claire’s mom, the girls give this loving dog a chance but must first start off on the right paw, properly introducing bonsai to rex and m.a.’s best friend, mr. rico. along the way the girls understand the need for pet safety and excitedly await their chance to volunteer and help other animals in need.

don’t judge a book by its cover
$11.99





mary-alice and her friends like pretty clothes and hanging with the in-crowd, but when she requests a puppy for her birthday, her parents decide the fluffy one with the pink bow in the pet store may not be the best choice. instead mary-alice ends up at the local animal shelter where she not only saves the life of a loving older dog, but learns that once you look beyond the plain cover of things, you can be treated to the true joys that lie underneath! looking beyond the cover is truly canine in that dogs do not judge others based on their income, beauty or status. they live in the moment rejoicing in every kindness they are shown. humans, young and not-so-young, can learn pawmazing lessons from our four-legged friends and when they don’t judge a book by its cover.

the autumn & winter of your pet: make those senior years golden
$22.95





2016 best book awards finalist
the autumn & winter of your pet takes you on your pet’s journey of maturing and growing older through the eyes of your older best friend. as you read, the voice you hear can be that of your brown dog, calico cat, fluffy bichon, champion setter or retired service dog – you choose. maybe it’s your one-eyed, three-legged rescued ragdoll or the golden retriever of your dreams who has slowed down yet remains loyally by your side. you decide as the seasons of your canine or feline’s life unfold on the pages before you and reveal how you can enjoy them to the fullest…together. things you can’t change (genes and years gone by) and those that you can (exercise, nutrition and veterinary assistance) are explained as well as ways to improve your pet’s quality of life. the heart of it all though are the things you and your fur kid do together, creating memories that will last beyond their lifetime. end-of-life decisions and loving again make this a heart-warming and informative book for everyone who wants those later years in their furry family member’s life to be the best they can be. award-winning author denise fleck, known for her bringing pet cpr to national television, has personally taught more than 10,000 pet lovers animal life-saving skills and has a soft-spot for helping seniors live longer, happier, healthier lives. she has shared her life with eleven senior dogs and one senior cat and through this book, hopes to make sure your senior pet’s paw prints forever remain on your heart.

cats are not small dogs!  the fabulous feline is a uniquely different species, and although many first aid techniques are similar to ones used on canine friends, this webinar addresses cats specifically.  denise fleck (the pet safety crusader) will take you on a 3-1/2 to 4-hour self-guided journey, with close captioning, into cat first-aid & cpcr.  she will share with you what signs accompany various illness and injury, and the basic steps you need to take at the time of crisis to minimize complications and pain until you can reach veterinary care.
