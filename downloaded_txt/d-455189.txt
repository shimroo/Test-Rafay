hole photo: typically this name would not create a positive picture for a cinema. however in shelburne falls, massachusetts, where glacial splits in the deerfield river running through the village are a valued part of the landscape, the name works well.
when naming an organisation whose geographical reach and customers are primarily local, you can use nicknames, regional or city tradition, regional in-jokes and historical references that could be lost on outsiders. subliminally, these kinds of names drive home the message, “we’re rooted in your neighborhood.”
besides attributes of the landscape, take into consideration these sources of inspiration:
* city labels. some residents of northampton, massachusetts affectionately describe it as “noho,” so a neighborhood workshop calls itself noho yoga exercise. happy valley present in neighboring amherst also plays off a local nickname.
* historic referrals. paradise copies, paradise medspa and also paradise taxi all describe the in your area well-known reality that in 1851, swedish vocalist jenny lind articulated northampton “the paradise of america.” likewise, homeowners recognize that the calvin theater pays homage to calvin coolidge, that prior to becoming u.s. president worked as mayor of northampton.
* archaic names. geographical names no more in use may have the same sort of prestige for residents aware. norwottuck real estate business and also nonotuck area school both refer to native american names for what is currently northampton.
* local in-jokes. upingil ranch in gill, massachusetts “humorously explains its area flawlessly for those people that live below,” a colleague tells me. “i make sure the proprietor of the farm has been referred to as ‘mr. upingil’ by outsiders that do not recognize the word play here in the farm’s name.”
native markets as well as the mascots for secondary school as well as college sports groups in the area can also motivate company names with a local aura.
what about in your area influenced names for business working country wide or internationally? such a name won’t register meaningfully at a range. it will not injure however will not help the business, either. at worst, such a name can backfire.
nobscot company is named after an algonquin indian word meaning “rocky area,” as well as alludes to a community in massachusetts frequented by writer henry david thoreau. nobscot finds respectably in the u.s. but stimulates snickers in england, where “nob” is vernacular for a private part of the male makeup.
use my examples from massachusetts to stimulate insights as well as ideas for your very own location if you have a neighborhood business to name!
