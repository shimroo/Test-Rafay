  gary cooper enduring style


by g. bruce boyer and maria cooper janis  


design by ruth ansel  


introduction by ralph lauren
  


‚Äúdressed up like a million-dollar trouper tryin‚Äô hard to look like gary cooper / super duper‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúputtin‚Äô on the ritz,‚Äù irving berlin (revised lyrics, 1946)
in 1946, when irving berlin revised the lyrics to his 1928 ‚Äúputtin‚Äô on the ritz‚Äù to include those memorable lines, gary cooper had been a star for over 15 years, and it would have been hard for most men to look as super duper. he conveyed a straightforwardness and an honest, american handsomeness that seemed to both ignore and rise above the contrived glamour and studied posturing that had characterized so many other film heroes of those early years. no matter what costume he put on, he looked like he owned it. the camera loved him, and so did the box office.

  gary cooper american hero


by jeffrey meyers  


the first definitive biography of gary cooper, national icon of the american dream, from one of our most distinguished biographers.

in classic films such as "high noon," gary cooper came to symbolize american ideals of self-reliance, independence, and integrity, but his turbulent private life was often at odds with his squeaky-clean public persona.

the off-screen cooper was anything but simple -- behind gary cooper's american dream facade lay a tempestuous life. as this meticulously researched book tracks his film career in fascinating detail, it tells the parallel tale of his complicated relationships with marlene dietrich and patricia neal (to name only two of many), his involvement with the house un-american activities committee and the hollywood black-list, and his long friendship with ernest hemingway.

with the full cooperation of the actor's daughter as well as such colleagues and close friends as arlene dahl and fay wray, meyers examines every aspect of cooper's life, beginning with his youth in montana where he was a real cowboy before making the leap to hollywood. there he created some of the quintessential screen westerns in movie history -- awkward, honest men who captured america's imagination with an irresistible air of aw-shucks simplicity.¬†gary cooper¬†is a robust portrait of a great star whose contradictions only enhance the artistry with which he created some of the most unforgettable and enduring characters of hollywood's golden age.

  high noon ‚Äì the hollywood blacklist and the making of an american classic 

by glenn frankel


it‚Äôs one of the most revered movies of hollywood‚Äôs golden age. starring screen legend gary cooper and grace kelly in her first significant movie role, high noon achieved instant box-office and critical success. but what is often overlooked is that high noon was made during the height of the hollywood blacklist, a time of political inquisition and personal betrayal. in the middle of the film shoot, screenwriter carl foreman was called to testify about his former membership in the communist party, facing the painful dilemma of whether to name names or sacrifice his brilliant career. as he pondered what to do, foreman turned his screenplay into a parable about fear, repression and the cost of courage.
