puppets in the house
puppets in the house invites you to a four-day festival in verona, wisconsin! our venues combine small-town charm with big-city opportunities. we strive to create connection and camaraderie among puppet friends, both new and old, while welcoming local audiences into this vibrant artistic community.
registered attendees will enjoy three meals, workshops (designed for everyone from curious beginners to advanced artists), puppet performances—including a slam, fringe, and potpourri—an exhibit featuring a special local guest, a podcast-style educational panel, a puppet parade, and a community art market.
please note that daytime puppet shows are family-friendly and suitable for children, while evening performances are intended for emotionally mature audiences.
