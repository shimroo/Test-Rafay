about think before you pink®











overview
think before you pink® launched in 2002 in response to the growing concern about the number of pink ribbon products on the market. the ground-breaking campaign calls for more transparency and accountability by companies that take part in breast cancer fundraising, and encourages consumers to ask critical questions about pink ribbon promotions.

think before you pink 2023 is here! this year — we’re going rogue!
think before you pink goes rogue
think before you pink goes rogue is a political education campaign that connects the dots between environmental racism, fossil fuel divestment, and the politics of breast cancer.
this year, we’re breaking the mold with think before you pink goes rogue. we’re expanding beyond think before you pink’s primary focus on corporate accountability and pink ribbon marketing, and building out the campaign to include deeper political education programming, toward the goal of strengthening our community, aligning our shared understandings of the politics of breast cancer, and ultimately to build the collective power necessary to achieve health justice for all.  
how bcaction defines going rogue: to behave in a way that is unconventional, rebellious, or independent; runs contrary to established expectations and norms; especially by disregarding the usual way of doing something.

think before you pink®: a 20-year look back
over the last two decades we’ve had outsized wins and we’ve been critical of egregious pink marketing schemes. we’ve pushed back on corporations, mega-nonprofits, government leaders, and regulatory agencies that use pink ribbons and encourage empty awareness to distract from the systemic issues at the core of this crisis.


what is pinkwashing?
the term that started a movement. breast cancer action coined the term pinkwashing as part of our think before you pink® campaign.



















pinkwasher: (pink’-wah-sher) noun. a company or organization that claims to care about breast cancer by promoting a pink ribbon product, but at the same time produces, manufactures and/or sells products that are linked to the disease.
