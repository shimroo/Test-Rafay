bill's cr portfolio
conflict resolution projects portfolio for bill warters, former director, master of arts in dispute resolution at wayne state university (retired). author of mediation in the campus community from jossey-bass publishers.












about bill warters ph.d.
"working with and learning from conflict" has been a core theme of bill's academic career since he got his ba in conflict resolution at uc santa cruz back in 1984. bill went on to graduate school at syracuse university, studying at the program on the analysis and resolution of conflicts at the maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs. both as a faculty member and in his personal time working under the name "conflict learning designs" bill has developed some very creative, informative and functional online tools for conflict resolvers and educators. 



some background: by the time bill arrived at wayne state university in 1997 he had already directed a doctoral program in dispute resolution at nova southeastern university and created and coordinated campus-based mediation and conflict resolution service centers on three different university campuses where he studied or worked. these experiences qualified him as an expert in the emerging field of campus mediation and dispute resolution programming. some of his early contributions in this area are noted below.

co-chair, first national conference on campus mediation (syracuse, 1990)
moderator, ccrnet listserv
book author, mediation in the campus community (jossey-bass, 2000)
editor, conflict management in higher ed report (2000-2005)
director: conflict management in higher education resource center
chair: education section, association for conflict resolution.
co-editor: institutional and program level guidelines for conflict management in higher education








using technology for information sharing


bill probably should have been a librarian, given his longstanding interest in cataloging and sharing relevant resources and information. at first, the most exciting thing was having access to a copy machine and mailing addresses. this was quickly eclipsed by tools like listservs and discussion boards that emerged as the internet came alive.
probably most exciting, however, was the point when we started to be able to create databases that could then be displayed dynamically online. some of bill's early projects using these tools are noted here. the fact that they are still online some 15 years later is rather amazing.







													surveys of the field
												




												while serving as the coordinator of the campus mediation center at syracuse university bill developed a survey of existing campus mediation programs and maintained it for years. a related project was a delphi survey of graduate programs in dispute resolution he developed that sought to map the contours of this emerging field.  in 1999 he wrote up a review detailing the history of campus mediation systems: research and practice as part of a hewlett foundation grant project.
											






													shared training materials
												




												one of the most useful approaches for learning mediation is to participate in a roleplay of a conflict that relates to your area of practice. like any good trainer, bill developed quite a collection of campus mediation roleplays, many of which he shared online. 
											






													support for teaching and research
												




												developing a good syllabus is a labor of love for faculty members who care about their field. sharing them with others is a generous act. bill helped develop and maintain a collection of peace and conflict studies syllabi that is still available online. keeping track of the literature in an emerging field can also be challenging. bill's (then) comprehensive annotated bibliography of campus dispute resolution articles helped many folks dig into this topic. finally, bill got caught up in the podcasting craze and produced and shared some valuable materials via the conflict learning audio podcast.

campus-adr.org website


back in 2000 bill received a 3-year federal fipse grant to design and build a website to support the development of mediation and conflict resolution services on college and university campuses. the resource-rich site looks pretty dated now, but at the time it was cutting edge. it was built using dreamweaver for the front-end and filemaker for the database backend. the site has since been ported over to a server running php and mysql, but for better or worse much of the original design remains intact.
