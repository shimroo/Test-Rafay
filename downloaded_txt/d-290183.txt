black hawk down 64hz server patch

64 hz server patch is a small edit to the game executable, required only for server hosts and affecting all connected players. this change forces values that were previously only customizable for lan servers, now on servers hosted on novaworld. with the current speed of providers, everyone can now enjoy the game to its fullest.

this patch does not magically eliminate lag, the latency generated by your joining-player distance to the server will still remain. players with high distance-based ping, will still need to shoot infront of their enemy, but they will have naturally less packet loss as the server will refresh at a much faster rate, leading to a significant reduction in the perception of lag.



what are the benefits and practical effects of this community server patch?a huge decrease in the number of situations where players would teleport while moving, making perceived enemy player movement smoother and easier to aim at.
now all bullets from all weapons on the server are more effective. previously, 1/3 of the bullets of all weapons (e.g car15) were eaten due to the default low server data refresh rate of 16 hz.
all in-game sound effects can now be heard audibly. at 16 hz, many gunshots and ambient sounds were not played because they started at times when there were no packets to transmit to the player joining the server. now all players can hear weapons, vehicles and the environment in their real accurate state.
all of a player's mouse and keyboard inputs are transmitted faster to the server, making it easier to execute movements they've really wanted to do on the server. easy to notice when a player prones.
while it doesn't lower the minimum ping your players can have on a server, their ping tends to not fluctuate as much as it used to.
movements made by all vehicles are now smoother and synchronized, making it possible for a player e.g. to hit another player who is in the window of a black hawk with much less difficulty than before.
maps load much faster for everyone.

video comparing 16, 48 and 64 hz:


why did novaworld's servers run at 16 hz and why should we use more than that?
limitations of the time the game was developed culminated in methods and adjustments to accommodate players with slower connections such as dial-up. today, everyone plays with connections capable of handling higher refresh rates, so there is no longer any need to degrade gameplay quality. no more players teleporting for no reason.

why we shouldn't use more than 64 hz?
although we can go further and reach 128 hz and we've tested higher limits, the game is not prepared for this and may present some problems in animations and other things. 64 is the sweet spot, perfectly matching the frame rate at which both the server and the game is designed to run on natively. this rate is also in line with current gaming standards, allowing new players to have fun and not be negatively impacted.

compatibility
this patch is not compatible with modifications that also change the game executable.

a new tool for importing df2 quick missions

posted 07/12/2023 by --bulletmagnet--
4 comments









delta force quick mission importer is a new tool for importing quick missions into df2 with custom briefings and thumbnails.

novalogic didn't provide any tools or med support for distributing a mission with proper briefings and thumbnails, and editing/distributing pff and bin files is tedious and heavy-handed, so this tool abstracts that process.

the instructions are documented in the readme. this is a quick-and-dirty proof of concept, so if there is interest in making this easier or supporting other games, please send me that feedback.

download the tool from novahq.net here: https://novahq.net/files.php?id=778

tip of the spear: task force elite early access 4.0

early access 4.0 : new game mode and more!

early access 4.0 is now out! as we get closer to the full game release, this new update introduces a new game mode: team conquer, as well as several improvements, content, tweaks and fixes to the game.

eddie, our upcoming custom map maker, based on unreal engine 4 platform, which is the most asked feature by the community, is now completed. we're currently working on the documentation, tutorials and file system clean up to reduce the hd requirements for the tool. we've also completed the integration with our server manager tool, to create a seamless experience for map makers and server hosts. eddie will be subject of a separate release, first dropping to the map makers who have signup on our official forums, www.taskforceelite.com, up to march 15, as alpha testers for the tool. we will get in touch with the testers in the coming days, after we address any issues or bugs that may arise of this new update 4.0

we'll continue to polish and debug the game further in coming weeks, before we announce the date for the full game release. thank you for your support.

the full changelog:

-new game mode: team conquer
-new map overhaul: pharaoh (team conquer)
-added team conquer support to multiple existing maps
-added addition check for storage access to fix the - infinite access to storage
-adjusted outpost spawn armor: reduced by half
-increased time cooldown for spawning on outposts
-updated personal profile stats from official to global
-added delay after applying class change from storage
-fixed e outpost display issue
-game voices overhaul
-hud tkoth display bug fix (experimental)
-abandoned airbase zone setup overhaul (to attempt a fix on zone bug displaying wrong number of players inside)
-replaced duplicated rank images for general classes
-update to server tool to fix auto-crash and add team conquer

team conquer.
how it works?

-there is a new type of objective: checkpoint.

a) checkpoints work differently than the traditional outposts. checkpoints come in two forms: spawnable and non-spawnable. the icon for both is slightly different.

b) if you attempt to conquer a checkpoint, you touch the flag pole but you need to make sure that there isn't enemies inside the zone of the checkpoint (yellow area on radar/map). if enemies are inside the zone, the progress bar to conquer the checkpoint is halted, and it resumes once you eliminate all enemies from the zone.

c) some maps are using large zones while other maps are using small zones. this is experimental to better understand the game flow on both styles.

d) if your team holds all checkpoints, the timer starts counting, and after a certain period of time, if you continue to hold all checkpoints, you win immediately

e) if a team holds all checkpoints, and the timer is counting, but the enemy touches the flag pole of one of the checkpoints, the timer is halted. it only resets if the enemy successfully conquer the checkpoint.

f) bots will now attempt to conquer checkpoints and play for objectives

have fun!

						if you are hosting a df:bhd or df:bhd ts server and you dont have any statspage to your server you are free to share the stats page i host. 

all you have to do is to pm me your server name and i send you the upload link you need to put in the bmt. 

it is all for free and it would just be fun to let more servers upload stats to the site. 

the domain name is www.df-bhd.com. 

it is a pure stats page.

task force elite

						for those looking to fill the missing void of old novalogic games come check out task force elite. map maker is coming out in a month or so and will allow custom maps. just like the old days!! 

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1...k_force_elite/

it has the feel of blackhawk down and none of the excess frills of the modern fps games. no kill streaks. no pay to win. no random spawns. no bs.

tip of the spear: task force elite is an online multiplayer shooter with competitive gameplay inspired by military fps titles from the late 1990s and early 2000s. featuring a unique blend of run-and-gun gameplay and a fast time to kill, players wage war across middle eastern streets and rolling terrains 19 miles (16 km) in length. 

staff and devs as very receptive to feedback and respond daily, also the game is still in beta. 
(full discloser i am on staff as discord community manager)
