pensacola celebrated its 450th birthday in 2009!












					pensacola, founded by spain in 1559, is the first 
					european settlement in the united states. it developed into a vibrant, major seaport of the 
					19th century and a region that today is considered one of the fastest growing areas in the united states. "the visit from king juan carlos i is the highlight of the city's year-long 
					celebration," said mayor john fogg. "his visit brought our city international attention, 
					confirming the significance of pensacola's place in history as north america's first major european settlement."
it's a great place to visit, live, or retire to.
