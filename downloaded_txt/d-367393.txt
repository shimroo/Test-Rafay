kanm has been granted land to build a permanent site on the corner of vermont avenue and 6th street. it is located at the heart of koreatown and is walking distance from the korean consulate, metro stops, shopping centers, restuarants, and cafes. we look forward to the day when we have finished building our museum, the day when we will open our doors to welcome everyone inside, 
and to celebrate 110 years of korean american communityâ€™s rich cultural heritage.
