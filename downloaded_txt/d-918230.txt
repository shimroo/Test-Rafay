crystalite, inc.
your clear choice®


				crystalite is a northwest washington manufacturer of high quality roof glazing, sunrooms, and railing systems. we are a dealer based manufacturer. look for our products at your local lumber yard and glass shops. please call our sales representative in your area to find our products at a dealer near you.
			












established in 1982

				crystalite was incorporated december 10, 1982. its founders, steve richter and jan searle (retired dec., 1998), felt that a better and more energy efficient product could be produced. the belief of the company continues to be to provide quality workmanship  in the fabrication of skylights, sunrooms, and railings in support of our many dealers and distributors.
			

				today, our primary facility is in everett, wa with distribution and sales locations in salem, or and spokane, wa. our primary sales areas include washington, oregon, california, idaho, montana, nevada, alaska, and hawaii - while selling in all 50 states is common.
			

				crystalite, inc. manufacturers products for the residential, commercial, and industrial markets - specializing in custom overhead glazing and fabricated skylight products. additionally we manufacture a robust aluminum railing system, structural sunroom additions, and other building related products.
			





employee foundation


				crystalite employees foundation is a not-for-profit charitable group organized and maintained by crystalite employee volunteers. with monetary donations and the help of the employees at crystalite, we have been able to help provide support for various efforts in our surrounding community.
			

				through the donations to crystalite employee’s foundation, here is a partial list of organizations we have been able to help: everett gospel mission, everett police officers, snohomish county red cross, boys and girl’s club of america, imagine children’s museum, ymca invest in youth, special olympics, children’s hospital, sharing wheels, and many others. each spring we fund scholarships for select local area students to help them with expenses for higher education. we also sponsor a thanksgiving food basket and a christmas giving tree for a different local family in need each year.
			

				we are particularly happy with the success of the blankets and bears program we support through court appointed special advocate or “casa”. employee volunteers sew small blankets with kid friendly ‘fun’ material and then a small stuffed animal is wrapped up inside. these packages are then given to children that have been placed into protective custody by law enforcement. this can happen at any hour of the day or night, and often these children have only the clothes that they are wearing at the time. the blanket and stuffed animal can provide comfort and reassurance to these displaced children during a difficult time. our blankets are even used to wrap babies at children’s hospital!
			

				if you have any questions on any of our projects or would like to make a donation, please call cathy at (425) 259-6000. we are very grateful for your support.
			

				sincerely,
crystalite employees foundation
