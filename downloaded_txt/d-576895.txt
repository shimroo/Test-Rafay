  owners & renters beware  if a whistler property managers' services or pricing sound too good to be true, they
probably are.
over the years, whistler has seen many property management companies come and go. usually, the new managers on the street charge low prices to get a piece of the whistler market.  as their growth outstrips bookings, service declines, and the owners and managers of the company burn out. some companies close down while many others get purchased by larger property managers.
when dealing with a property manager, both owners and renters should be cautious. there are rules and regulations in the industry, but little enforcement. for example, managers are required to place all rental deposits in a trust account (for safe keeping). personally, i know of companies who did not follow this law.
you may ask why this matters? history has proven here...
"it is possible for dishonest property managers to steal thousands of dollars in rental deposits and skip town. in this case both the owner and vacation renter lose their money and the renters are left searching for a place to stay..."
whistler blackcomb home owners and holiday renters now have an alternative to property management... vacation rental by owner. 
any motivated owner with internet access and some available time can rent out their whistler vacation condo or chalet without property managers.
advertising a whistler rental property used to be very expensive...  ski magazines, big city newspapers, and printed brochures.  and, on top of these costs,  there were dozens of telephone calls to deal with.  with rapid development of travel planning on the web, those days are gone.
if you own a home in whistler resort, you should consider being your own property manager.  there are vrbo websites available for your advertising. 
it is much easier to do owner-direct vacation rentals using email than it ever was using the telephone. for whistler vacation rentals by owner we recommend resortac.com.
