the wedding people


a new york times bestsellera today show #readwithjenna book club picka propulsive and uncommonly wise novel about one unexpected wedding guest and the surprising people who help her start anew. it’s a beautiful day in newport, rhode island, when phoebe stone arrives at the grand cornwall inn wearing a green dress and gold heels, not a bag in sight, alone. she’s immediately mistaken by everyone in the lobby for one of the wedding people, but she’s actually the only guest at the cornwall who isn’t here for the big event. phoebe is here because she’s dreamed of coming for years—she hoped to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband, only now she’s here without him, at rock bottom, and determined to have one last decadent splurge on herself. meanwhile, the bride has accounted for every detail and every possible disaster the weekend might yield except for, well, phoebe and phoebe's plan—which makes it that much more surprising when the two women can’t stop confiding in each other.in turns absurdly funny and devastatingly tender, alison espach’s the wedding people is ultimately an incredibly nuanced and resonant look at the winding paths we can take to places we never imagined—and the chance encounters it sometimes takes to reroute us.









the dark hours

the rules of fortune


"a gripping novel about power, money, and secrets." --mindy kalinga daughter's investigation into her family history threatens to destroy their legacy in a gripping novel about power, money, and secrets by the author of token black girl.on their martha's vineyard estate, the carter family prepares to celebrate. but when the billionaire patriarch dies right before his seventieth birthday, the media is quick to question the future of the multi-industry conglomerate that makes the carters living legends. amid the succession crisis, his daughter, kennedy, is questioning her father's past.kennedy is an aspiring filmmaker, and the documentary she'd planned to present at her father's party begins an inquest into the life of a man she never really knew. a thoughtful outlier in an elite and fiercely guarded dynasty, she's not interested in keeping up the appearances that define her impeccably poised mother or in the capitalist games her ruthless brother plays. kennedy wants only to understand the origins of their empire, and the lethally ambitious man behind it. that understanding comes at a cost.as a twisted history emerges, the fault lines in the family grow. torn between morality and the promise of maintaining wealth, kennedy must decide what's most important--the carter legacy or exposing the shocking truth of how it was built.









victorian psycho


virginia feito's mrs. march was hailed as "a brilliant debut . . . [by] a writer who keeps pace with the grandees she invokes" (sarah ditum, guardian)--from daphne du maurier and shirley jackson to patricia highsmith. now, feito returns with her "silver-polish sentences and her eerie psychological acumen" (constance grady, vox) to unleash an entirely new antihero on us all.grim wolds, england: winifred notty arrives at ensor house prepared to play the perfect governess--she'll dutifully tutor her charges, drusilla and andrew, tell them bedtime stories, and only joke about eating children. but long, listless days spent within the estate's dreary confines come with an intimate knowledge of the perversions and pathetic preoccupations of the pounds family--mr. pounds can't keep his eyes off winifred's chest, and mrs. pounds takes a sickly pleasure in punishing winifred for her husband's wandering gaze. compounded with her disdain for the entitled pounds children, winifred finds herself struggling at every turn to stifle the violent compulsions of her past. french tutoring and needlework are one way to pass the time, as is admiring the ugly portraits in the gallery . . . and creeping across the moonlit lawns. . . .patience. winifred must have patience, for christmas is coming, and she has very special gifts planned for the dear souls of ensor house. brimming with sardonic wit and culminating in a shocking conclusion, victorian psycho plunges readers into the chilling mind of an iconic new literary psychopath.









booster shots: the urgent lessons of measles and the uncertain future of children's health


a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist warns of the resurgence of measles, the antivaccine movement, and how we can prepare for the next pandemicevery single child diagnosed with measles represents a system failure—an inexcusable unforced error. the technology to prevent essentially 100 percent of measles cases has been in our hands since before the moon landing. but this serious airborne disease, once seemingly defeated, is resurgent around the globe. why, at a time when biomedical science is so advanced, do parents turn away from vaccination, endangering their own children and the health of the wider population?using a combination of patient narrative, historical analysis, and scientific research, dr. adam ratner, pediatrician and infectious disease specialist, argues that the reawakening of measles and the subsequent coronavirus pandemic are bellwethers of forgotten knowledge—indicators of decaying trust in science and an underfunded public health infrastructure. our collective amnesia is starkly revealed in the growth of the antivaccine movement and the missteps in our responses to the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, leading to preventable tragedies in both cases.trust in medicine and public health is at a nadir. declining vaccine confidence threatens a global reemergence of other vaccine-preventable diseases in the coming years. ratner details how solving these problems requires the use of literal and figurative “booster shots” to gather new knowledge and retain the crucial lessons of the past. learning—and remembering—these lessons is our best hope for preparing for the next pandemic. with attention and care and the tools we already have, we can make the world much safer for children tomorrow than it is today.









calling in: how to start making change with those you'd rather cancel


from a pioneering black feminist and macarthur “genius” fellow, an urgent and exhilarating memoir-manifesto-handbook about how to rein in the excesses of cancel culture so we can truly communicate and solve problems together.in 1979, loretta ross was a single mother who’d had to drop out of howard university. she was working at washington, dc’s rape crisis center when she got a letter from a man in prison saying he wanted to learn how to not be a rapist anymore. at first, she was furious. as a survivor of sexual violence, she wanted to write back pouring out her rage. but instead, she made a different choice, a choice to reject the response her trauma was pushing her towards, a choice that set her on the path towards developing a philosophy that would come to guide her whole career: rather than calling people out, try to call even your unlikeliest allies in. hold them accountable—but do so with love.calling in is at once a handbook, a manifesto, and a memoir—because the power of loretta ross’s message comes from who she is and what she’s lived through. she’s a black woman who’s deprogrammed white supremacists, a survivor who’s taught convicted rapists the principles of feminism. with stories from her five remarkable decades in activism, she vividly illustrates why calling people in—inviting them into conversation instead of conflict by focusing on your shared values over a desire for punishment—is the more strategic choice if you want to make real change. and she shows you how to do so, whether in the workplace, on a college campus, or in your living room.courageous, awe-inspiring, and blisteringly authentic, calling in is a practical new solution from one of our country’s most extraordinary change-makers—one anyone can learn to use to transform frustrating and divisive conflicts that stand in the way of real connection with the people in your life.
