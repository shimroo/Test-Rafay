what clients are saying about us

here are just a few of our reviews from satisfied customers. we’ve been fortunate to work with some amazing clients to deliver beautiful spas and swimming pools in southeast michigan.



the owner has been very helpful with my father-in-law’s pool and answering his questions about setting up solar panels that he didn’t even purchase through them. great company and more than willing to go above and beyond. i would recommend them for all your pool needs.
-brandon s.



was at another pool store down the road needing assistance. when the kid behind the counter gave me a glazed over look and was googling to help me, it was time to go. drove down to pooltown. great mom & pop store. knowledgeable staff. will definitely go back.
-john k.



our pool was turning green. went to a competitor cause they were closer, spent way too much money on chemicals that didn’t help (even with a water sample). went to pooltown and got the correct chemicals and fantastic customer service!!! thank you pooltown!!!
