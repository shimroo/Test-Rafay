                                        point loma village florist recently merged with their sister shop, rainbow flowers; however there's really no change as it's all under the same family. i ordered just this week, and i see no difference in the high quality. as usual, it exceeds my expectations.

                                        i was thrilled when the recipient texted me a pic of the arrangement i ordered!  it was just like the photo that inspired me to order it from pint loma village.  so nice to know that it lived up to my expectations, when so often out-of-state orders do not.  i will not forget this florist -- and highly recommend them!

                                        i was so grateful that they were able to accommodate my same-day delivery request. 
the website was easy to use and the representative i spoke with was very helpful. 
the flowers were absolutely beautiful and the recipient was thrilled with them. 
i highly recommend this florst to anyone looking for a reliable flower delivery service, even if you live outside of the united states.

                                        this team of creative, talented, kind and always always go above and beyond team are the best i’ve ever interacted with! their flowers last for a long time, and they create the most beautiful arrangements. i consider the staff my friends, and i know they care about my intentions for the recipient. when i go to san diego in a couple of months, i will be sure to stop by there and give hugs to you all… your rainbow arrangement you made for my mom carmel on inez street was the most spectacular arrangement ever created?
