waco poetry music and more



who says local talent can't be found and celebrated in waco, tx? it can. and we will find those who may think they don't have what it takes to create something beautiful and give them a venue in which to do it in.  we also will help promote creative arts audibly and visually.  producers produce and sell to consumers who consume. it's the creators the producers must invest in, for if they have nothing to produce, then there is nothing for the consumers to consume. where are all the creators?

it's been a long time waco poetry and music scene!





i couldn't remember the email address i used to sign on to this blog, so that's one of the main reasons i've been mia.  sorry!i wish i could say i have this grand announcement that there's a lot of great things going on, but that's not the case.  it's saturday night and i am at home, blogging about nothing to do around waco.  the best thing this summer has been tuesday nights at the $1 movies (50 cents all day) and a nice evening of putt-putt with jen.   it's been a pretty boring year since beatnix coffeehouse closed last summer.  boring.school starts on the 24th and we head back to work on monday.  i'm still teaching at carver, and shall be just as busy, however, looking forward to finding some cool adult activities during the school year.  any ideas???i'm sure we'll attend the cultural arts fest in september.  i think this year, i might volunteer.
