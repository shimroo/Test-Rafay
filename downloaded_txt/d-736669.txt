jon's 24th birthday





we love you jon!we love you jon! we miss you lots. you were the best brother and son! your nephews all miss you too, especially milo and kaleb! jon with his buddiesthe muscles!school friendshe made this hat jsut for the picture!cody and jonmrs. haskins and jonsarah and jonfriend from floridafamily in floridaapril 28th would have been jon's 24th birthday, so i have been thinking about him just a little bit yesterday and today. i thought i would just share a few things about him probably jsut for my benefit. jon was my smallest baby at 6'2". he spent a week under the lights for jaundice. i had to take him in every day to get poked so they could check his blood. they let me hold him while they did it as i didn't fall apart. it was sure hard! but i wasn't going to not be there with him.he was such a fun kid and did so many crazy things. i remember the huts the neighborhood boys used to make in the backyard with anything they could find. he love to jump off the roof onto the tramp especially with the sprinklers on. fixing up golf carts and riding them around was another passion he had.

knees





well the time has come for my knees to be done. i have now had both of my knees completely redone. i am a bionic women now!on june 7th at 5:30 a.m. i went into dixie regional hospital and had my first knee done. it was strange as i do remember waking in the middle and it sounded like that were using a hammer and chisel on my knee. anyway they had me up and walking the next day, doing therapy twice a day. i stayed in the hospital until thursday and then i went over to coral desert rehab. i continued doing therapy twice a day and walking the halls.picture of the 1st knee! 35 staplesmy poor arm!no more staples  my 2nd knee only 30 staples in my left leg i stayed there until june 21st when i went back the the hospital and had my other knee done. i am still at the rehab place for a few more days or sometime next week. i am doing great other than some pain. loratabs right now are my best friend.  i will be coming back up to bountiful sometime in july around the 12th. hope you like the pictures and all the black and blue. i am doing well!

i decided since we have had three new babies this year i needed a new grandma picture. sarah was going to stay until after jenny had her baby so we would have all of the grandchildren here. we asked jenny's friend jessica if she would take the picture. so two days after jacob was born we all headed to jessica's house for a picture. it was fun trying to get 4 children 20 months and younger to smile and look the same way. anyway i love my picture with my grandchildren. they are the joys of my life.grandma and her treasures! left to right: alethia 10 months, braxton 2 months, kaleb 20 months, milo 7, jacob 2 days

new addition





we are so excited to have a new member in our family. jacob dal miche was born november 30th at about 12:45 in the afternoon. he weighed in at 7 ' 4" and was 21 inches long. it was a scary arrival as the cord was wrapped around his neck. he was given cpr for just over a minute. he is doing great! we are certainly enjoying this new addition. he has a wonderful big brother who loves to give him lots of loves. i love giving jacob lots of loves too!

brand new grandbaby!





i am so excited to have another darling grandbaby. robyn and robbie had there first child october 5, 2009 at 1:30 a.m. braxton lee simpson is 20 inches long, 6 lbs 11 oz with blonde fuzz on top. it was a very long sunday and monday for the three of them but they are all doing great! robyn and rob just want to come home to their own bed. we love braxton and are so excited to have him as part of our family. everytime i hold one of my new grandchildren i reflect on the fact that they have just come from our heavenly father and they know so much more than we do at that moment. i am sure that is why they don't talk when they first come to us. congratulations robyn and robbie! we are so happy for you.
