welcome tohinman & carmichael













hinman & carmichael llp has focused on the laws related to the production, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages since 1989 when lynne carmichael (an m&a partner with the san francisco brobeck firm) and john hinman (the former general counsel of the publicly traded sonoma vineyards venture that farmed over 2,000 acres of vineyards, owned and operated three wineries in two states and managed the then largest direct to consumer wine business in the us)  joined forces to provide specialty legal services to other law firms and to alcoholic beverage licensees. today the firm is guided by john and his partners beth aboulafia and erin kelleher, both leading experts in their fields.we address our clients’ needs in licensing and qualification, business and marketing practices, and represent our clients (either directly or via our extensive network of affiliated law firms) before federal and state agencies throughout the us and in foreign countries that regulate alcoholic beverages. our experienced lawyers provide expert witness and related expert services to clients and to other law firms in our areas of expertise (which include wine and spirits distribution, entity acquisition and licensing, and grape purchase and sale agreements) and we act as special counsel to law firms throughout the world in transactions involving licensees and in civil, administrative, and criminal proceedings that may affect license privileges. we have directly represented our clients in accusation proceedings before the california abc and the federal ttb for over 30 years and regularly respond to regulatory agencies throughout the us in matters involving enforcement of direct to consumer wine shipment regulations.   we are well-versed in the statutes, rules and policies that apply to alcohol business operations in the entire u.s. marketplace, including operations, distribution and marketing regulations throughout the us. we take pride in keeping our clients up to date with significant legal developments affecting these regulated industries. we work with industry members and the organizations that represent them to improve state and federal laws. our lawyers regularly teach courses in alcohol regulation and related matters at uc davis, the sonoma state university wine business school and at conferences and retreats hosted by industry organizations (such as the national association of state liquor law administrators [ncsla], national association of wine retailers [nawr] and other trade and industry associations we serve or are involved with).   our firm provides pro bono legal services to many organizations that further industry initiatives including wine america (where we are special counsel for industry legal affairs), the international wine lawyers association (aidv, where we are on the board of directors),  the national association of wine retailers (general counsel and board member), zinfandel advocates and producers, and the california nightlife association (founding general counsel and board member), among others. our firm is also an associate member of the wine institute, wine america, family winemakers of california, monterey county vintners and growers association, discus, nabi, and the sonoma county vintners association, among other trade organizations.  whether you are an experienced or new industry member, we encourage you to engage in comprehensive legal planning before embarking on new alcoholic beverage programs or ventures.
