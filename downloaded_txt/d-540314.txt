[26 mar 2006|01:25am]





hey girls,as some of you know i make a lot of icons. i love to make them and to share them with you. i like it when you guys comment and also when you snag. i make those icons becaue i love to make them ..and for mine and yours private use (like lj or on boards) i dont make them so some of you can come here, snag them ..and put them on your xanga pages, telling people "oh hey *i* have new icons to share" like you made them... i already stopped posting my icons on boards and stuff, i only posted them here on lj with the rules (comment; credit; dont post on xanga) well i again fount at least 10 of my icons from the last post on xanga pages.so from now on.. all my icons will be posted friends onlyif you still want to see my icons.. add me.. but you need to leave a comment and tell me why i should add you back.. i wont add anyone wihtout knwoing whyif you already added me.. and i didnt add you back i´m sorry.. but some of those nicknames i didnt recognice .. so please if you want to be added .. write a short post with name and reason you like to be added and i will add youi am so sorry to do this to you guys... but i dont want my icons on xanga pagesi hope you understand thatlovesuz
