          milwaukee software process improvement network presents "from mechanical to mastery: silent killers of scrum revealed" with chad beier and jeff bubolz

see the details here: https://lnkd.in/g6iexuvy

presentation description:
many organizations adopt scrum with high hopes of enhancing agility, productivity, and team collaboration. however, the reality often falls short as teams find themselves trapped in a cycle of going through the motions without realizing the true benefits of scrum—a state often referred to as "zombie scrum" or "mechanical scrum."
 
in this talk, "from mechanical to mastery: silent killers of scrum revealed," we will delve into the critical root causes that lead to these ineffective practices. targeted at organizational leaders, this session will uncover the often-overlooked variables that silently undermine scrum's effectiveness. we’ll explore how common organizational behaviors, cultural misalignments, and leadership decisions contribute to these pitfalls and provide actionable strategies for moving from a mechanical implementation of scrum to an effective state that drives business outcomes.

          i've been thinking a lot lately about ways of structuring iac code, specifically - should this code be separate from application's code, or they can (should) be kept close to each other.

when writing backend code, my rule of thumb about managing transactions (and other resources, like connections) is that a method or class cannot interfere with its (transaction's) state if that transaction has been started somewhere outside of that code. in simple words, only a piece of code that started a transaction should make a decision to commit or roll it back.

looks like this model can be applied to codifying infrastructure as well. if an application owns the lifecycle of an infrastructure resource, it is okay to put them in one source code repository.

          i wonder. why when you cut a class from one source file to paste in in another - you have to deal with all the imports once again. it is really annoying. ok, ok, you can move a class by f6/refactoring. but cut-n-paste experience is way more natural than picking a target package/whatever destination you fancy to move your stuff to.

q. do you experience the same frustration of this micro-ux problem?

          working on a specification for https://lnkd.in/g-pbfaqv. then i can verify it with tests and https://blprnt.tech/. 

i'm reminded that wormwood is optimized for readable source code, not ux. there is very little syntax validation.

          watched a portion of the old brian will video on why oop is bad (https://lnkd.in/epvfrppr), and bombed out fairly hard when he came out with the puzzling assertion that messages between objects properly speaking shouldn't include object references. well, there goes your visitor pattern; there goes the ui staple of registering objects with some event bus for callbacks when particular events happen.

is there some source in the literature (alan kay, i guess) for this odd restriction? it seems like a basic misapprehension: sure, messages should transfer representations of internal state and not haphazardly leak references to the state itself (otherwise external parties can mutate it without going through the owning object's protocol), but it's also a pretty basic affordance of message-passing systems that the addresses of things that can receive messages are first-class things that can be passed around (compare uris in rest, or channels in pi calculus).

the other odd assertion was that permitting many objects in an arbitrary graph to hold a reference to an object and access its methods was as bad as having global shared state. it fairly obviously isn't: the ability to exercise the protocol for reading or updating a particular bit of state can get passed around to wherever it needs to be, but isn't immediately available to everything, and pretty much the whole point is that you're passing a pointer to the protocol, not the rights to inspect and modify the data structures it guards.

it seems that will wants to argue for a hierarchical flow of messages down a dag-shaped stack of routines and subroutines with a single controlling root procedure, rather than a potentially cyclic call graph with objects fielding requests from all angles. in practice that's what your average spring boot service actually does of course: controller to service to persistence or external client layer, and back up again. but (and this is an argument for a future post) that's because the average spring boot service is fundamentally procedural code, with a bit of indirection between modules. other topologies are possible, and appropriate for particular use cases.

the most generous reading i can give of will's argument is that oop offers more flexibility than perhaps a majority of actually existing programs really need, and we'd be happier and less burdened by object bureaucracy if we wrote those programs in a more constrained idiom. i actually think that's kind of true, but haven't got to the bottom of what it means in practice just yet.

          ‘in this episode of “the engineering room” dave farley chats with renowned author, speaker and expert software developer kevlin henney.’

https://lnkd.in/gsenvbmq

‘in their wide-ranging discussion they talk about:
• why kevlin henney is famous for big public software failures!
• software engineering, mathematics and the interesting gap between formal programming and sloppy humans.
• architecture, empiricism and three ideas for design.
• coping with incomplete knowledge and making stuff that works in the real world.
• confidence, certainty and loose-coupling.
• learning from actual failure, not just simulation.
• programming is deceptively easy to start, and gets complicated really quickly: low code is no exception.’

          if not react, then what?

frameworkism isn't delivering. the answer isn't a different tool, it's the courage to do engineering.

code that runs on the server can be fully costed. code that runs on the client, by contrast, is running on the devil's computer.
as a result, an unreasonably effective strategy is to send less code. in practice, this means favouring html and css over javascript, as they degrade gracefully and feature higher compression ratios. declarative forms generate more functional ui per byte sent. these improvements in resilience and reductions in costs are beneficial in compounding ways over a site's lifetime.
stacks based on react, angular, and other legacy-oriented, desktop-focused javascript frameworks generally take the opposite bet.

"our product stack has bet on react and the various mythologies that the cool kids talk about on react-centric podcasts. you're asking us to rethink the whole thing. which silver bullet should we adopt instead?"

javascript remains at least 3x more expensive than equivalent html and css, byte-for-byte.

the choice isn't between javascript frameworks, it's whether spa-oriented tools should be entertained at all.
for most sites, the answer is clearly "no".

sites built to inform should almost always be built using semantic html with optional progressive enhancement as necessary.
sites that have content that changes more frequently should look to "classic" cmses or tools like wordpress to generate html and css.
blogs, marketing sites, company home pages, public information sites, and the like should minimise client-side javascript payloads to the greatest extent possible. they should never be built using frameworks that are designed to enable spa architectures.

managers and tech leads that have become wedded to frameworkism often have to work through a series of easily falsified rationales offered by other over reactors in service of their chosen ideology. note, as you read, that none of these protests put the lived user experience front-and-centre.

"...it works for facebook"
to a statistical certainty, you aren't making facebook. your problems likely look nothing like facebook's early 2010s problems, and even if they did, following their lead is a terrible idea.

"...react is industry-standard"
this is, at best, a comforting fiction.
at worst, it's a knowing falsity that serves to omit the variability in react-based stacks because, you see, react isn't one thing. it's more of a lifestyle.

across more than 100 consulting engagements, i've never seen two identical react setups.
there's nothing standard about any of this. it's all change, all the time, and anyone who tells you differently is not to be trusted.

and if you don't mind me asking, how's that "css-in-js" adventure working out? still writing class components, or did you have a big forced (and partial) migration that's still creating headaches?

          another thing i do is track my time, religiously. every single bit of "work" time i spend is tracked by client (which is sometimes my own company), project, and task. this makes it easy for me to see what i was doing, when, who it was for, and how long it actually took.  i can also generate reports to see how much time i spent on certain types of tasks, including mundane things like "processing" (which includes email, slack, etc.)

          15 years ago i contributed 2 chapters to clean code(https://a.co/d/5gulezq), both related to threading.

a second edition is coming out, and it occurs to me that while i don't do much direct threaded/parallel programming anymore, many issues around parallel execution still occur in systems where the stack "takes care" of all those details.

here's a collection of recent examples. this is a draft of a personal blog. the second version will go on the industrial logic, inc. website. the final version will likely be added as an update for the 2nd edition of clean code.

comments welcome, enjoy!

          there were other examples of this around the web, but none explained _how_ automatic reloading worked in django. some implementations felt half-baked. i think this one stands apart.

          4 things you should put in your daily dev log

to harvest meaningful patterns from your dev log, you’ll need to capture the same things daily.

i’ve been engineering software for 25 years, and i’ll share what i’ve routinely kept in mine. your context is different, so your list will be also. just make sure you capture the same things daily.

use this list as a skeleton to start from. it’s easier when you aren’t starting from a blank page!

pull requests

i keep track of every pr i submit, approve, or merge.

almost any work product i deliver or review flows through git. my lists of prs serve as a personal task-level kanban board of work in progress that i am connected to. these help me easily reconstruct a story of what i’ve done throughout the week.

personal interactions

i make note of every personal interaction i have, scheduled or otherwise.

in addition to these notes, i keep a page for each person, and i link to that page from my daily notes. as i note patterns of interaction with a person, i’ll describe those patterns on their page. over time i build a library of every person i’ve collaborated with and what we worked on together.

project actions

i keep a running narrative of the things i’m working on.

i keep a section for each thing i’m working on. these might be at the product or story level - it just depends. each time i hit a stopping point or interruption, i make a note of what i’ve been doing and what i plan to do next. guess what i use to inform my daily standup updates?

perplexing puzzles

i make a note of everything that surprises me.

these could be strange program behaviors, blockers, production issues - anything unexpected. as i review these periodically, i ask myself how i can use what i’ve learned to improve my mental models.

hopefully this list helps you get past the starting line. do this faithfully for several months and see where it takes you!

          it is crazy how much weaker openai gpt-4o is at coding from the completions api than gpt-4. i'm not sure if this is the intended result, but very surprising nonetheless. the training recency is very evident, i.e. it knows about much more modern things, but the difference between its logical output is great with gpt-4 just thinking in a much more sophisticated fashion.

          i once asked a lead engineer on angular: which is better: angular or react? his response: "both require good engineering to be effective."

so, my developer friends, consider this a reminder that "frameworks" like diátaxis are fine, but they still require good engineering--such as ux, information architecture, style, maintenance processes, and so on--to create great documentation experiences for your customers.

alas, the framework alone isn't enough.
