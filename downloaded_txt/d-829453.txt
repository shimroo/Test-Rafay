the new amazonation...dedicated to the rebirth of the amazon
      nation.


the new amazonation

my heart bears the emptiness

and longing 
to return one day 
to our nation 
the amazon nation.

after





















              a five thousand year reign of male icons in the western
              world, 
we
              have the exhilarating privilege of witnessing a global
              reappearance 
of
              the divine feminine.  women will retake their power
              in the 
millennium. 
amazons





















              will be in the forefront of this movement.

 amazonism
is





















                a universal phenomenon.  in time and reality, the
                amazon kingdoms not only comprise
                 an extremist end of matriarchy
                 but also are a beginning and a purpose in
                themselves. 
 in
the





















                bright light, their boldness turned

into





















                wisdom.

accounts





















                the amazons played a crucial role in the long bloody
                transition
                 from the matriarchies to the patriarchies. 
                 no doubt we are presently at a juncture in history
                in which 
                the amazons return to perform a similar function as the
                transition is reversed.

artemis 


      artemis is emerging in the popular culture as a new source of
      strength, power, and integrity.
      she is the protector of life, the activist who never gives up, the
      idealistic heroine who cannot be subdued.

i

i
                long for my sisters. 


i  have come to
            a new trinity, triumvirate, artemis, athena and nike.

it was a natural
            progression.  after reading v. noble's theory that
            artemis and athena 
were lovers the rest
            fell into place.  so, i add athena and nike to the mix.

                you hear the call of the amazons?

        the amazon is powerful, deadly, glamorous and free.
        the amazons are a memory of a kind of female power, the nature
        of which we
        have almost entirely forgotten.  but memory is coming back.
        we have to go back and retrieve what was discarded or rejected
        and bring it back into
        consciousness again.

may artemis bless you in the dark night and the queens of
        amazons past
        protect you.
