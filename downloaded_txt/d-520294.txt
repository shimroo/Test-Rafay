welcome! this site is made available as a public service. its purpose is to provide a gateway to tax resources available on the world
wide web. the information is organized by subject area. i have kept the look and feel of the site simple in order that the pages load as
fast as possible. i keep the number of links by subject at a level that will provide meaningful content. 
whenever a user may benefit from a tax form and its instructions, i have included a link to that form. all of these links will be colored green.
under each subject area you will usually find links to irs guidance or irs publications that are relevant to that subject. please pay careful attention to the dates of any irs form or publication.
 most documents are updated to current status toward the end of the calendar year and at the beginning of january. the irs also starts to release the next year's information forms (e.g., 1099s) 
 at the beginning of the calendar year.
there are four special pages identified as federal tax library, california tax library,
foreign & international taxation and retirement resources. each of these pages provide links to relevant
subject material for understanding federal tax law, california tax law, taxation of nonresident aliens and us citizens and residents abroad and taxation of retirement income. for example, on the
federal tax library page you will find links to practically every form of published guidance available from the irs and the federal courts.
some of the links, especially those for forms and instructions, point to documents in the adobe® acrobat® "pdf" format. whenever you
see this icon , or the letters "pdf", you will know that the document requires a "pdf" viewer. all web browsers have the ability
 to view pdf files. if you want or need another pdf viewer application, you can find a list of freeware pdf viewers at 
 wikipedia. 

i generally verify the accuracy of the links at least once a month. each of my pages will contain the date that the links were
last checked as well as the date that the page was changed.

a word of caution:
many of the sites that you may link to are owned by entities that are selling a service or a product. you should pay careful attention
to the source of any information. the information provided here and at any of the links should not be construed as a substitute
for professional tax services nor as advice. please see my disclaimer here.

notice!  whenever changes in tax law occur, not all sites on the web update their content on a timely basis. there remains a large body of data that does not
reflect current law or thinking on the subject in question. this is especially true for major federal tax law changes as well as state income tax changes. the only way to stay current on changes to state income taxes,
 is by checking with that state's tax authority. you can find links to every state at the  federation of tax administrators. for changes
 to federal law, you will find links to public laws containing new and/or changed tax provisions on my  tax laws page. if you are interested in the latest tax changes, go to
the  what's new link on my site. for a summary of the covid-19 tax relief, go to 
coronavirus tax relief and economic impact payments at irs.gov.   if you have an interest in reviewing proposed legislation of the current us congress that is tax related, you can try
 congress.gov or kpmg's
 taxnewsflash.
