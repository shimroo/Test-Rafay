welcome to engineers guide usa
we serve as a reference tool to give users easier access to online sources of license status information about engineers, land surveyors, and architects.  licensing requirements for these professions vary from state to state.  
                to facilitate the verification of the license status of practitioners, most states provide license lookup web tools accessible to both the general public and industry professionals.  while some states provide a license lookup tool 
                that permits confirmation of license status for multiple professions, other states operate separate license verification tools for different professions.  directories of state-operated license lookup tools applicable for engineers, 
                land surveyors, and architects can be found within engineers guide usa.
