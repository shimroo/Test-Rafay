"a cozy, well-located inn in anacortes! it makes for an easy spot to hang your hat overnight before catching an early ferry to the islands. the newly updated rooms are well appointed, the beds are comfortable, and bill, the on-site manager, is super friendly and accommodating. loved the fire pit outside, too. we will surely stay again soon!"
