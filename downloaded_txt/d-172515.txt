the history of clearwater





through the decades, “sparkling” clearwater has been many things to many people. clearwater is a hometown, the site of a happy family vacation, it’s a religious retreat, a place away from harsh winters, a place to see spring training baseball, a place to retire to and a place to do business. many have walked these streets over the years, and many more will as the years go by.

meet a scientologist
                    
                        » florida
                    
                    








                                                    
                            jack—business owner
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet jack, an owner of a classic car restoration business.
“i've been a scientologist since 1976,” says jack. “just the miracle of being able to have a very wonderful family, stable life and be able to achieve my goals. i dreamed this thing up and it's been successful and each and everything that i've done has been successful because i applied what i learned in scientology.”








                                                    
                            matt—real estate agent
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet matt, a real estate agent.
“even as an able guy,” says matt, “i had some problems. when i turned to scientology i was able to find the answers to those problems and handle them. i’m at the point now where i’m able to expand and win at life as much as i really want to.”








                                                    
                            wilman—soccer coach
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet wilman, a soccer coach.
“with scientology i've come to discover that i have a lot of certainty,” says wilman. “if i don't have the ability or the skills i can get them. i find joy and humor in a lot more things that i never even knew were out there. i wake up and i'm just happy."








                                                    
                            stephanie—graphic designer
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet stephanie, a graphic designer from the usa.“scientology has helped me live my life so purely happy,” says stephanie. “before i started implementing a lot of things that i learned, i didn’t know who i was. i was acting like somebody else constantly. i didn’t like myself and i didn’t ever wanna be alone. i knew that there was something wrong but i just kind of wanted to push it away. then i started doing a lot of courses and i didn’t think that this could have been real or achievable, like true, true happiness.”








                                                    
                            sara—mother
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet sara, a mother from the usa.“i was living my life. i was doing really well,” says sara. “then i had the unfortunate incident where my mother was killed in a car accident. i had this overwhelming grief, anger—all of these things.“so i read the book dianetics. that saved me. with the simple techniques in the dianetics book, i was able to move on and to make her proud and to be a happy, productive person that you see now.”








                                                    
                            chip—swimming pool company owner
                        
                        

who are scientologists? meet chip, an owner of a swimming pool company from the usa.“my family is super important to me,” says chip. “i have awesome daughters and grandchildren. being a scientologist for me is about being able to understand someone, whether they’re 3 years old or 10 years old or 30.”
