reuniting families separated by adoption. if the birth or adoption was in south carolina you are in the right place!


        
        fundamental right to know: judge wade s. weatherford, jr., seventh judicial circuit court, sc, said 
	        in a ruling on an adopteeâs petition to gain access to adoption records: 
          "mankind is possessed of no greater urge than to try to understand the 
	        age-old question: âwho am i?â âwhy am i?â... those emotions and anxieties 
	        that generate our thirst to know the past are not superficial and 
	        whimsical. they are real and they are âgood causeâ under the law of man 
	        and god."judge weatherford, jr -  


        adoption laws are exercised by individual state law - and not a federal law. the state law that applies to an adoption is where the adoption took place which is usually where the adoption parents resided or filed the adoption decree. in s.c. we have found adoptions that went thru the state where the parents were not a full resident at the time. the law applies to the state
	    where the adoption took place which is usually where the adopted parents lived
	    at the time the adoptee
  was placed in their home.

confidentiality in adoption 
confidentiality in adoption means that those who are separated do not andâ  can not know each other.â  
      in   most states there are a minimum of seven ways people can and do  find and know each other without having an original birth   certificate.,â 
everyone has the right to refuse contact.â  
      that is the only degree of confidentiality that exits, and it exists   whether you do or do not have your original birth certificate.â 
several ways adult adoptees and birth parents can find each other   under the sealed birth certificate system in most states


â good causeâ  - under the law in most states, all   sealed birth certificates may beâ  accessed withâ  a showing â of good cause.â  the   birth certificate accessed could be the one that locates the one birth parent or   adoptee who does not want to be found.â 


support groups - support groups have a very good   reputation for helping triad membersâ  access birthâ information and locate birth   relatives.â  the relative they find may be the oneâ 
          birth parent or adoptee   that does not want to be found.â 


black market - for a price, most people can be   found if the information has notâ  been falsified,.those with means can find;   those without cannot


agency searchesâ  - finding one member of the   birth family gives possible access to allâ  members of the â birth family.â  access   to any member may lead to the one birth parent who does not want to be found 


internet - finding on the internet is rapidly   becoming a science.â  this can lead to the oneâ  birth parent or adoptee who does   not want to be found.


identifying informationâ  - given to adoptive   parents or keeping the adoptee's originalâ  birth nameâ could locate that one   birth parent or adoptee who does not want to be found.â 


private investigators - can find the one birth   parent or adoptee who does not want to found.â 


sealed birth certificates are a symbol of a confidentiality that   does not exist -â  not when people can and do findâ each other   daily.â unsealed birth certificates are a symbol of an adoptee's identity and   their civil rights as a citizen.
