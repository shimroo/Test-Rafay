"i put on over 10lbs of lean muscle last summer training at sst. i'm feeling stronger and faster on the ice, ready for just about anything. i can't recommend sst enough."

"after being at big box gyms for 10 years, i wanted to give something else a try. i decided to try sst and i was amazed, the group training atmosphere is something i canât do without anymore."

"the atmosphere at the gym forces you to get better on a daily basis. training at sst has given me the opportunity to excel to new heights, on and off the ice."

"it took me having a health scare to get my butt in the gym. now being here for a year plus iâm the healthiest iâve ever been and feel absolutely amazing. i wish i started at sst 20 years ago!"

"they have helped me achieve my goals of getting bigger and stronger and have provided me with the strength base in order to be successful as both a football player in the past, and now as a highly competitive skier. sst is the only place for serious athletes; just look at me all they do is deliver results!!!!"

"i've been working at losing weight for a while and have been at sst for about a year and a half now. a while back i plateaued at 20 pounds of lost weight and the staff at sst gave me the tools and support to lose 20 more. i've lost 40 pounds since i've signed up and still working hard to achieve my goals!"
