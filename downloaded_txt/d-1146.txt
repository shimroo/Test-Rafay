experience with my clinicals and practicum, and that was partly because my nurse managers and charge nurses already had a positive attitude toward herzing from their work with previous students. it was nice knowing that they respected me, and getting to know the nurses you work with can give you an advantage when job searching. jordan sharon nursing alumni | orlando campus i liked the small class sizes at herzing and the fact that the instructors really got to know the students. they would make themselves available whenever we needed help, and i still talk to many of them now. samantha sprasky nursing alumni | kenosha campus going back to school after nearly a decade was challenging. but the support i received from my family as well as the herzing community made the experience enjoyable and valuable. i felt myself grow as a person because i had challenged myself. laura wolter healthcare alumni | minneapolis campus as a woman, i can see how underestimated and underrated we are within the it industry. one of my professors was very candid with me about it. he pushed me to excel and learn as much as i could. the foundational challenge for us is how overlooked we are and how we must keep proving ourselves regarding information technology. sharee a. smith technology alumni | minneapolis campus   previous    next recent blog posts         nursing industry changes to
