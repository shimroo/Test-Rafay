bayshore school is no longer in business
we had a great run for nearly 30 years where we worked with countless homeschooling families. but, it was time for director, lenore hayes, m.s. to retire. bayshore school officially closed at the end of the spring 2021 semester (june 30, 2021). this website will remain active with resources and articles. and lenore will remain available for special needs homeschooling consulting.
bayshore school and educational was created in 1992 to fill the need for a private k-12 independent study program (isp) that would accept california homeschooling families of all faiths, races, ethnicities, lifestyles, and edu-political philosophies.  enrollment with bayshore school required self-motivation, the desire to release rigid notions about learning and children, and a sense of humour.
bayshore school’s philosophy has been to empower each family so that they may develop the best approach by which to nurture their children’s education. our role has been to assist families in their quest to meet the individual needs of each child, while staying within the parameters set forth by the california education code.
