wizardrealm





unlocking the mysteries of the universe










wizardrealm was created in 1996,
back then known as "barbarian's lair", as a personal web site.  in
1999, it acquired its own domain and continues to provide information
to the internet community for free.  you will find no annoying
pop-up ads here, and nothing for sale.  
as the webmaster, i have created
wizardrealm in the original spirit of the internet; that of a place
where information may be freely exchanged.  sad to say, but most
of the internet is no longer that way.  every day, it become
harder and harder to find a site with pertinent information without
being bombarded by ads for things that we don't want and don't
need.  so wizardrealm is supported and funded solely by my own
efforts, and i intend for it to remain that way.
the navigation links below will
take you deeper into the realms.  enjoy your stay, my friends.
