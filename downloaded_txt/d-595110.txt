a bit about filey for those who do not know the town

the beachfiley is a wonderful traditional seaside town which has always been really popular with visitors over the ages. you will be able to spend time on filey beach, which is filey’s jewel in the crown. it stretches for miles and has won awards. it is safe and well sheltered by both flamborough head and filey brigg.rnli lifeguards look after the central part of the beach in front of hope cottages. this central part is washed daily by the tide. peter’s daughter actually saw a pod of dolphins at the water’s edge in front of our cottages one day.the briggmost visitors take a walk along the brigg, play in its rock pools and look at the wild life. you can walk from your front door of hope cottages. you should find all sorts of crabs and other creatures. children love scrambling about looking for things.the brigg is also famous for its fishing, giving access to deep water. cod can be caught at any time of the year if you have the right gear. mackerel coalfish and pollack are often caught in the summer months. you can read more about the brigg’s natural history at the filey bird observatory & group . you will also see a picture of a whale taken from the cliff top. it is in the wildlife mammals section.there was even a report of a minke whale in the bay one day. even if you are not that lucky, you are almost certain to see a seal’s head bob up if you keep your eyes peeled.filey is not too developedvisitors find filey has not been developed to the same extent as the other yorkshire coast resorts, and so retains an old world charm and tranquillity. there is only one amusement arcade on the seafront on the busy coble landing. filey’s lifeboats are also on the coble landing as well as shops, cafes and a pub. there is a filey museum and also filey animal park which are both popular attractions.central for other resorts and attractionsfiley is also close to lots of attractions in scarborough, bridlington, whitby, flamborough and the north york moors. the well televised bempton rspb reserve is very close by.you can easily see the towering white cliffs of bempton cliffs from filey seafront and hope cottages, although you will need to visit them and use a medium telephoto lens to catch a photo like this. you can get very close in places.compact town centrefiley self-catering allows you the freedom of eating as and when you wish. you have a good choice of shops in filey including butchers, greengrocers, bakers and supermarkets and of course sterchis the famous chocolatiers. there is also a big choice of cafes restaurants and take aways including of course several excellent filey fish and chip shops.as filey is not a large town many of the big chains have not arrived, allowing the friendly local businesses to thrive. you can find more information on the filey and yorkshire coast page as well as lots of photos.







a bit of history you may not know

these seafront holiday cottages have been in the watkinson family for about 100 years, providing self-catering holiday accommodation. john and peter watkinson with their wives cath and sue have managed the holiday cottages since 2005.our grandfather bob who bought the cottages was a fisherman. he had a herring drifter called silverline with his brother, which was based in scarborough. hence, the names of the two cottages.there are pictures of silver line the drifter. there is also a painting of our father’s small fishing boat, samaki. peter is still a fisherman. he fishes out of bridlington harbour for crabs and lobsters sustainably.bridlington is one of europe’s biggest shellfish ports and exports all over europe. you can see the fishing boats unloading from a viewing platform above the landing berths of bridlington harbour. this is usually in the late afternoon or early evening, depending on the tide.you really should read the exciting story about the drifter silver line and a heinkel iii during the second world war at http://www.angelfire.com/de3/fileycasualties/silverline/silverline.htmi remember the gold ring well and treasure the presents that rudolf behnisch brought us all.
