filed under: main tagged with: relationshipsby dave desire system review – dr. david’s shocking new training course
the desire system, is a new training program for men who want to learn the secrets of creating intense female desire using newly discovered neuro-scientific methods.
the system, which was created by a famous dating coach from singapore has shocked many in the men’s dating advice community with its raw no-holds barred approach.
and i can’t lie, theres something very refreshing about this new, albeit controversial take on sparking female desire. this is the reason it has become such an underground favorite.
>> special: discount on the desire system (limited time offer!)
 
what’s the desire system for attracting women?
as somebody who considers myself a lifetime student of social dynamics, i am always eager to learn about the newest research on the science of female arousal. i don’t know if you’ll agree with me here, but i feel like neuroscience is such a fascinating field, and theres really no debate that many lessons learned in this area that can be applied to one’s dating life.
so, when i heard about the dr. david’s new desire system i wanted to learn more about it, and see if it was something that i could recommend to you, or even use myself in my own personal life.
one of the main benefits to this course is that is shows you how you can, in a very brief window of time, in essence “transfer” feelings of desire directly into a woman’s subconscious emotional mind using david’s newly discovered methods.
what do you get with the desire system?
the program is delivered in a digital format via a secure member’s area. in addition to the core training customers receive access to additional bonus materials including “friends into lovers” a training on how to quickly transition out of the friend zone, a subliminal hypnosis program entitled “complete confidence hypnosis”, and an easy to use conversation formula called “endless conversations”, as well as other assorted bonuses.
the best part?
one of the best things about the desire system is the fact that these methods will, in many cases, go so far as to inspire the woman to take the lead in moving things to a more intimate level! we may not like to admit it, but a lot of times guys will get nervous because they don’t know if the woman they are talking to is ready to, for instance, start kissing.
so obviously it’s a relief when the woman makes it clear that she is interested in this sort of activity, either by displaying obvious signals or by actually making the first move herself.
recommendation:
lets face it, it can be frustrating as a guy because you don’t want to jump the gun and make a move too quickly, because that can totally ruin your chances. and, on the flip-side, taking too long to make your move can make you come across as lacking confidence and masculinity.
too many guys make the mistake of trying to “woo” women by taking them out on fancy dinner dates and spending money on them when really this is about the worst thing that you could ever do if you are serious about having a real relationship.
this new system is recommended because it gets guys to focus on whats really important – getting a woman to feel desire.
i’ve studied a bunch of courses over the years, and learned a lot – which is a huge part of why my current sex-life is amazing.
this program is hands down the best thing i’ve seen yet.
so if you aren’t having sex at least 3 times a week with a very attractive woman then i definitely recommend going through this material asap! i highly recommend it to all heterosexual men.

filed under: main tagged with: relationshipsby dave language of lust review – lawrence lanoff’s “survival guide” for the modern man?
popular men’s dating and relationship expert lawrence lanoff’s has just released a new program called the “language of lust” system.
the multimedia training program promises to reveal 33 proven methods to help men improve their love lives.lawrence lanoff’s newly launched language of lust system for men is being lauded as a breakthrough program in the world of men’s dating advice, as websites across the internet are weighing in with reviews of the program.
so we here at kfns have decided to join the discussion, and share our own in-depth review of the system.

the story behind lanoff’s system:
let’s face it, now more than ever, men around the world are feeling confused by what they see as the ‘mixed signals’ that they receive from women on the dating scene. in fact, studies show that increasing numbers of men are finding modern dating to be such a challenging endeavor that they are simply giving up on finding a partner, rather than subjecting themselves to continued rejections.
luckily however, lawrence lanoff’s new language of lust program is offering new hope to men looking for a viable means for improving their dating and relationship success. a video posted on lanoff’s website details an account where he was nearly arrested by a security guard at a trader joe’s supermarket after attempting to engage an attractive young lady in conversation.
lanoff was drawn to the woman’s beauty, and shapely physique that was on display in her tight fitting yoga pants!
apparently, this incredibly embarrassing event served as a something of a wake up call for lanoff who proceeded to go on a mission to discover more effective ways to communicate with the fairer gender.
by all accounts this mission has proved wildly successful, as men around the world are eager purchasing lanoff’s course and reporting results on lanoff’s website.
what do you get in the language of lust system?
the language of lust system includes an array of 33 different methods men can employ to help them tune into a woman’s subtle mating signals. included in these 33 techniques are special phrases lanoff refers to as “linguistic triggers” which can apparently be used to arouse a woman’s sensual side.the program includes a collection of pdfs, an audio version, and video training modules.
the language of lust is also currently being offered for purchase with a number of complimentary bonus trainings.
my recommendation:
one of the things that really impressed me about this program is just how easy it is to implement lanoff’s techniques.
rather than just providing theory, the system gives you step-by-step actionable content that you can take and go out and use right away. and the best part is that you don’t need to become somebody else or do anything that seems weird or unnatural. it’s all about learning to speak the language of women, which imho is well worth learning.
