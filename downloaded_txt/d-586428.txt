... and it doesn't stop there!








we spell cilt with a 'c' in wales as there's no 'k' in the welsh alphabet, although we use the usual spelling throughout our website to help customers find us easier (perhaps that's how you got here)!
 
hire or buy your welsh, scottish or irish tartan kilt online or pop into our retail store in swansea. see how easy it is to order by reading our reviews from lovely customers all over the world, from the uk to usa, kenya to new zealand! a small deposit can start your kilt wearing experience, helping you spread the cost.
 
with over 20 years experience in the kilt industry, our friendly attentive staff are ready to help with your needs. we also provide welsh gifts, both tartan and non-tartan, perfect for birthdays or christmas (or even to spoil yourself)! scarves, ties, bow ties, aprons and cufflinks just to name a few!
if you're a kiltmaker or a store looking to sell our products, please click here for more info.
