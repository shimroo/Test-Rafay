“adventure aquarium is a perfect family day! entertaining, educational and fun. ❤️”
google review november 2022






“the "behind the scenes" tour was immensely educational and inspiring. would recommend purely for that experience.”
google review, january 2023






“tons of exhibits and plenty of hands-on activities for kids of all ages. wonderful huge tanks filled with sharks and rays. the kids had a blast and the entire facility was clean and well-kept. it was well worth the drive to stay nearby and spend a day here.”
google review, may 2023






“a well-designed aquarium perfect for kids and adults. it’s very interactive, the views are great in every tank, and the hippos and the blue penguins are a truly unique addition. love that the 3d movie is included, and all of the feedings are a nice touch!”
google review, july 2023
