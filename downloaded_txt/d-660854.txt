i met bobby and dave lamattina when i was 12 and they are 2 of the best people i know. one of my bigest regrets was when i stoped taking classes when i got into high school. i'm 41 now and my daughter and take classes now my first day back was like coming home. i love you guys and thank you for every thing you do for your students and the community.

best kickboxing classes!! love the environment, people and all the teachers!!!

sarah krauss 





this is an amazing place and has exceeded my expectations. not only do they teach self defense, they teach the kids to respect themselves and others. hands down this place is just awesome! i would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a self defense studio adult or child!

cynthia livingston  





it teaches discipline, honor and respect. important qualities that seem to be lost these days.
