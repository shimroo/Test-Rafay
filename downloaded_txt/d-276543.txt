the patient with cirrhosis: poised to bleed or poised to clot? 





it turns out to be a little of both. a number of reviews
have addressed this. [1]  [2]  [3]  here are
some of the key points:
the
old maxim that cirrhotic patients are auto-anticoagulated is a myth.
severe liver disease is associated with a delicate balance between
bleeding and clotting. in general, cirrhosis tends to be a
hypercoagulable state. the relative risk for vte in such patients has
been estimated at around 2. 
what
are the mechanisms for the hypercoagulability of liver disease? 

in
primary hemostasis, while platelet numbers are often decreased these
platelets tend to be hyper-functional. this is due to low levels of
adam ts 13, correspondingly increased levels of vw factor and
multifactorial endothelial dysfunction. 

in
secondary hemostasis, reasons for hypercoagulability include
decreased levels of liver dependent natural anticoagulants such as
protein c, protein s, and antithrombin. factor viii  (not synthesized
in the liver) tends to be increased. 

there
is also impaired fibrinolysis with increased levels of pai-1 and
decreased levels of plasminogen.


what
are the clinical implications? 

traditional
hemostatic tests are generally used but are of limited reliability.
there's been increasing interest in global hemostatic tests such as
viscoelastic assays which are conceptually more valid but are not yet
ready for translation into clinical practice. 

for
low risk procedures, prophylactic hemostatic products peri-procedure
are  generally not indicated. 

antithrombotic
treatments  should be given in accordance with standard clinical
indications recognizing a potentially increased risk of bleeding. 

doacs
 can be used in many patients but certain published restrictions apply.

special circumstances where warfarin is favored over doacs





 when is warfarin favored over doacs? valvular atrial fibrillation. this term is becoming obsolete. for anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation  doacs are contraindicated and warfarin favored in severe rheumatic mitral stenosis and mechanical prosthetic valves.liver disease. if child pugh is c doacs are not recommended. if b, apixaban and rivaroxaban can be used “with caution” (fda labeling ).   child pugh calculator. antiphospholipid syndrome. warfarin is favored (up to date). morbid obesity: doac is okay for bmi up to 40. above 40 rivaroxaban and apixaban are acceptable but other doacs should be avoided. history of gastrectomy or weight loss surgery: warfarin preferred. this review summarizes the rationale and recommendations regarding morbid obesity and patients who have had weight loss surgery.in addition, certain drug interactions with doacs are category x thus prohibiting use.

acc atrial fibrillation guidelines 2023





 a few key points from the 2023 atrial fibrillation guidelines american college of cardiologynew classification: the old classification is maintained but it is encompassed in a broader classification outlining the stages of risk and /or the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. stage 1:  at risk. this refers to the presence of risk factors such as obesity and hypertension. stage 2: pre atrial fibrillation encompassing structural abnormalities such as lae or warning arrhythmias such as  atrial ectopy.wiithin atrial fibrillation itself the traditional categories of paroxysmal persistent and permanent remain. right above permanent atrial fibrillation is another designation referring to successful ablation. flexibility is built into the cha₂ds₂-vasc score for anticoagulation decisions. if the risk is intermediate there is considerable equipoise and shared decision making is advised. increased preference for early rhythm control.there is an increased emphasis on early rhythm control especially in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. catheter ablation via pulmonary vein isolation now he has a class 1 indication particularly in patients with who present with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction at the time of the onset of atrial fibrillation detection.   specifically:rhythm control recommended over rate control if decreased left ventricular function and persistent or high burden atrial fibrillation, class 1 if atrial fibrillation is symptomatic, class 2a. specific arrhythmias related to fibrillation have been defined. atrial tachycardia is defined as a rate greater than or equal to 100, non sinus. mechanisms can be automaticity, triggered or micro reentry  atrial flutter. is considered any tachyarrhythmia  that involves macro re-entry. typical flutter involves macro reentry that goes through the cavo tricuspid isthmus. all others are considered atypical.caffeine avoidance is noted not to be beneficial. the designation of valvular versus non-value or atrial fibrillation has become obsolete. the recommendation now is that for a mechanical prosthesis or severe rheumatic mitral stenosis warfarin is recommended.  doacs are preferred for all other patients unless there are certain disease-related or pharmacokinetic contraindications. in cases of cryptogenic stroke there is a 2a recommendation for extended monitoring. the guidelines do not specify the duration of monitoring. for device detection of high rate episodes, (specifically pacemaker detection), stroke risk is believed to exist but believed to be less than that of clinical episodes. if a high rate episode is detected and lasts greater than or equal to 5 minutes it is almost always atrial fibrillation. for device detection of high rate episodes lasting greater than or equal to 24 hours systemic anticoagulation is given a 2a recommendation.   for the range of 5 minutes to 24 hours this same situation has a 2b recommendation. in both cases there is considered to be sufficient equipoise that shared decision making applies.atrial appendage occlusion devices such as the watchman have a 2a recommendation if cha₂ds₂-vasc  is greater than or equal to 2 and anticoagulation is contraindicated. for high bleeding risk but not a contraindication the device is given a 2b recommendation. there are some changes in systemic anticoagulation recommendations for varying degrees of kidney disease. up to and including stage 3 systemic anticoagulation if otherwise recommended for atrial fibrillation has a class 1 recommendation. it drops to class 2a for stage 4 and to 2b if there is  esrg/hd. in atrial fibrillation with rheumatic valve disease or mechanical prosthesis for which vitamin k antagonist anticoagulation is recommended the cha₂ds₂-vasc  score does not apply. the long-term rate control goal is an upper rate limit of 100-110 and has a 2a recommendation. acute rate controlif ef is greater than 40, iv beta blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium blocker, class 1.  digoxin  if above ineffective or contraindicated class 2a. iv mag sulfate class 2a. it may be better than standard agents. up to five grams is considered low dose. occasionally one could use greater than or equal to 5 g.  the main use is adjunctive.amiodarone if others ineffective or contraindicated, class 2b.avn ablation indicationsav node ablation if rate control is refractory to medication and the patient is otherwise a candidate, 2a. this will be combined with pacing obviously and initial lower rate limit, to avoid malignant ventricular arrhythmia, should be set at 80 to 90 with plans to program down by monthly decrements of 10 until 60 is reached.  stroke prevention associatied with cardioversion  if atrial fibrillation could have been going on greater than or equal to 48 hours 3 weeks of anticoagulation first or tee prior to cardioversion and anticoagulation for greater than or equal to 4 weeks afterwards.  drugs to maintain sinus rhythm long-term. the guidelines are not very explicit about whether drugs should even be used in the first place. they merely say that such are “ reasonable “  for patients who are " not candidates for, or decline” ablation. similarly those who prefer antiarrhythmic therapy to ablation are considered reasonable candidates. the implication is that you should probably do something to maintain sinus rhythm. if normal ef and no structural heart disease and no coronary disease then fleccanide or propofanone 2adronedarone 2a if no recent decompensated hr and if hf class ii or better.dofetilide 2a if

dofetilide. in pts with prior mi, structural disease or ef less than or equal to 40% no recent decompensation or functional class iii or worse, dronedarone is 2a.when does antiarrhythmic therapy need

ablation (pulmonary vein isolation ):if antiarrhythmics not tolerated, contraindicated or not preferred, class 1.  for younger patients with no or few comorbidities class 1 as  first line even if the atrial fibrillation is paroxysmal. for atrial flutter, class 1 ( it would be implied that this is typical flutter ). for a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction both at the same time early rhythm control is class 1 and ablation is said to be “ beneficial when appropriate” class 1.

autonomic dysfunction as a cause of cardiovascular disease





 

this free full text review focuses on neurodegenerative
synucleinopathies and briefly, in addition, touches on other
disorders such as pots, vasovagal syncope and inappropriate sinus
tachycardia.


synucleinopathies
result from misfolded protein aggregates of α-synuclein.  the normal
function of α-synuclein in the nervous system is not well
understood.


the
synucleinopathies are parkinson disease, lewy body dementia, pure
autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. any of these disorders
can be accompanied by autonomic dysfunction.


orthostatic
hypotension, supine hypertension, or both may occur.  all of the
long-term consequences of hypertension may be associated with the
supine hypertension seen in autonomic dysfunction. use of a short
acting antihypertensive administered at night is a suggested
treatment strategy.

nucleic acid testing for viral pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia





 


	
	
	
	


the
american thoracic society has published a guideline for this
in the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine.
these are soft recommendations based on low-level evidence.

the
guideline does not address influenza or covid.  for influenza,
the idsa community-acquired pneumonia guidelines recommend influenza
pcr testing during flu season (in preference to antigen testing ).
the  guidelines did not address covid-19 as there was
insufficient data at the time of the literature review.

the
guideline calls for viral pcr panel testing in the following groups
of patients: those with neutropenia, those undergoing active cancer
therapy, those with a transplant history, those with advanced hiv, 
those with a history of chronic immunosuppression including systemic
corticosteroids, and those whose community-acquired pneumonia is
classified as severe.



criteria
for severity overlap with some of those just mentioned and include
the presence of  septic shock or need for mechanical ventilation.
absent these two conditions three of the following minor criteria
denote severity: impaired respiratory physiology in the form of
either a respiratory rate greater than 30 or a po2 to fio2 ratio
below 250, multilobar infiltrates, altered mental status, bun greater
than 20, white blood cell count less than 4,000, platelet count less
than 100,000,  hypothermia less than 36.8 centigrade or
hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation.

could aspergillus be hiding out in your critically ill patient?





 

an
issue from the american journal of respiratory and critical care
medicine contains two articles and a related an editorial addressing
this subject.




this
study looked for evidence of aspergillus infection in
patients diagnosed with vap:





rationale: aspergillus infection
in patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia remains
uncharacterized because of the absence of a disease definition and
limited access to sensitive diagnostic tests.

objectives: to
estimate the prevalence and outcomes of aspergillus infection
in adults with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.

methods: two
prospective uk studies recruited 360 critically ill adults with new
or worsening alveolar shadowing on chest x-ray and
clinical/hematological parameters supporting suspected
ventilator-associated pneumonia. stored serum and bal fluid were
available from 194 nonneutropenic patients and underwent mycological
testing. patients were categorized as having
probable aspergillus infection using a definition
comprising clinical, radiological, and mycological criteria.
mycological criteria included positive histology or microscopy,
positive bal fluid culture, galactomannan optical index of 1 or more
in bal fluid or 0.5 or more in serum.

measurements
and main results: of 194 patients evaluated, 24 met the
definition of probable aspergillus infection, giving
an estimated prevalence of 12.4% (95% confidence interval, 8.1–17.8).
all 24 patients had positive galactomannan in serum (n = 4),
bal fluid (n = 16), or both (n = 4); three
patients cultured aspergillus sp. in bal fluid.
patients with probable aspergillus infection had a
significantly longer median duration of critical care stay (25.5 vs.
15.5 d, p = 0.02). icu mortality was numerically
higher in this group, although this was not statistically significant
(33.3% vs. 22.8%; p = 0.23).

conclusions: the
estimated prevalence for probable aspergillus infection
in this geographically dispersed multicenter uk cohort indicates that
this condition should be considered when investigating patients with
suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia, including patient groups
not previously recognized to be at high risk of aspergillosis.



another study in the same issue looked at the prevalence of aspergillus
in patients on mechanical ventilation with covid-19. they found it in
over 20% of patients.



the
accompanying editorial cited additional evidence all of which
suggests that aspergillus infection is under-diagnosed in critically
ill patients. 

patients need not be immunosuppressed in
the traditional sense although the use of corticosteroids, even
short-term, is a major risk factor. the main use of corticosteroids 
was for treatment of copd exacerbations.

antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients





 

this review focuses mainly on gram-negative bacteria. although
it approaches the problem in light of the covid-19 pandemic it has
general applicability. 



first a few
definitions.


eskape 
microorganisms :  klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii,
pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp


enterobacterales:
new term for enterobacteriaceae


mdr: resistant to at
least one antibiotic in three or more categories


xdr (extensive
drug-resistant): resistant to at least one antibiotic in all but two
or fewer categories


pdr (pan
drug-resistant): resistant to all antibiotics


difficult to treat
resistant pathogens: resistant to front line agents and requiring
second-line agents of greater toxicity and often lower efficacy (eg
aminoglycosides, colistin). 





rates of infections
due to esbl  producing organisms and carbapenemase producing
organisms are rising.  k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) producing
bacteria are the ones predominant in the united states.  the  new
delhi metallo-beta-lactamase   (ndm) and the oxa-48 carbapenemase are
rising in importance.


acinetobacter is a
complex and rising concern.  from the review:


finally,a. baumannii
complex frequently causes nosocomial  infections,  particularly  in 
icus  where the incidence has increased over time. the sentry program
evaluated the frequency of cases and anti-microbial susceptibility
profiles of the a. baumannii collection  from  medical  centers 
registered  in  this program [13]. this study showed that these
isolates were recovered mainly from patients with pneumonia   and  
bloodstream   infections   and   evidenced reduced susceptibility to
most antimicrobials tested.  in  all  regions,  colistin  was  the 
most  active  agent followed  by  minocycline. 



despite this
seemingly grim picture the pipeline seems to have kept up with these
trends reasonably well.  newer agents include:


ceftolozane and
tazobactam (zerbaxa)   enhanced pseudomonas activity; activity
against esbl organisms but significant resistance rates; no activity
against carbapenemase producing bacteria.  (if used for intra
abdominal infections coadministration of metronidazole is required).


ceftazidime–avibactam
(avycaz) and imipenem–relebactam (recarbrio) are active against
most carbapenemase producing bacteria.


not mentioned were
fosfomycin (not yet available in iv form in the us) and omadacycline
(nuzyra).  omadacycline, though expected to be bacteriostatic, has an
impressive spectrum.   from another paper:


omadacycline
maintains activity against difficult-to-treat pathogens, including
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa),
vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), enterobacteriaceae that
produce extended-spectrum β-lactamases (esbls) and carbapenemases,
and multidrug-resistant (resistant to greater than or equal to 3
classes of agents) strains of acinetobacter spp. and stenotrophomonas
maltophilia (2).

anca testing in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (egpa)





 


	
	
	
	


the
american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine  published
a consensus statement on the use of anca testing in patients
with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
(egpa,formerly churg strauss syndrome).  the article serves is a
helpful update and review on some aspects of egpa.

first
some basics about the anca test. the two main types have two
different nomenclatures of designation depending on the assay used.
in the elisa test, which uses specific antigens, the two antibodies
are proteinase three (pr3) and myeloperoxidase (mpo).  these
correlate mainly (and there are some exceptions) with the
immunofluorescent patterns of c and p anca respectively.




what
about disease associations? granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(formerly known as wegener's granulomatosis) is generally associated
with c anca. microscopic polyangiitis (mpa) is generally associated
with p anca. the same is true of pauci immune  renal limited
vasculitis. these categories are not absolute.

when it
comes to egpa it's a little more complex. only 40% or so of patients
with egpa are anca  positive and the predominant pattern is anca
p.  test characteristics of anca for gpa,  mpa and renal
limited vasculitis are pretty good. this, as is evident from the
above, is not the case for egpa.




now
on to the paper.




despite
the poor test characteristics the consensus panel recommends testing
on all patients or suspected egpa patients because it may point to
the correct diagnosis and has implications for disease phenotype.
here's the specific recommendation, from the abstract of the paper:




mpo-anca
should be tested with antigen-specific immunoassays in any patient
with eosinophilic asthma and clinical features suggesting egpa,
including constitutional symptoms; purpura; polyneuropathy;
unexplained heart, gastrointestinal, or kidney disease; and/or
pulmonary infiltrates or hemorrhage. a positive mpo-anca result
contributes to the diagnostic workup for egpa. patients with
mpo-anca–associated egpa have vasculitis features, such as
glomerulonephritis, neuropathy, and skin manifestations, more
frequently than patients with anca-negative egpa. however, the
presence of mpo-anca is neither sensitive nor specific enough to
identify whether a patient should be subclassified as having
“vasculitic” or “eosinophilic” egpa. at present, anca status
cannot guide treatment decisions, that is, whether cyclophosphamide,
rituximab, or mepolizumab should be added to conventional
glucocorticoid treatment. in egpa, monitoring of anca is only useful
when mpo-anca was tested positive at disease onset.




according
to the paper there are some important clinical correlations. egpa
patients who are anca positive tend more to have a vasculitic 
manifestations such as glomerulonephritis, neuropathy, pulmonary
hemorrhage and skin lesions. those who are negative tend more toward
the infiltrative aspects of the disease which translates into cardiac
involvement and pulmonary granulomas.




treatment
decisions are made more on clinical grounds than on the basis of the
anca test. again, from the paper:




glucocorticoids 
are  the  cornerstone  of  therapy  for 
egpa.  additional  immunosuppressive agents  (e.g., 
cyclophosphamide)  should  be  prescribed  for 
patients  with  life-  and/or  organ-threatening
manifestations, such as heart disease, glomerulonephritis, alveolar
hemorrhage or mononeuritis  multiplex,  and  can 
be  considered  for  selected  patients 
with  glucocorticoid dependence  or  recurrent 
disease  [51].

myths and facts in antibiotic stewardship





the current issue of the american journal of medicine (the green
journal) has an article titled top myths of diagnosis andmanagement of infectious diseases in hospital medicine.  this is
one of the better articles pertaining to antibiotic stewardship that
i have seen. ten myths are listed. they are not complete myths
(exceptions apply to just about all of these principles); rather,
they are misconceptions. 



myth one:
antibiotics do no harm. high-level data refute this myth. for
example, a recent metaanalysis showed
that the use of procalcitonin guidance to shorten the duration of
antibiotic therapy was associated with lower mortality.


myth two: antibiotic
durations of 7, 14, or 21 days are typically necessary. although
these are common recommendations, evidence is lacking. in many
situations (and there are exceptions) shorter duration  therapy is as
good as longer duration. examples include 3 to 5 days for community
acquired pneumonia; eight days for nosocomial pneumonia; 5 to 7 days
for pyelonephritis; four days for intraabdominal infection; five days
for acute exacerbations of copd and 5 to 6 days for cellulitis. there
are notable exceptions. certain deep-seated and difficult to
eradicate infections are not candidates for either shorter duration
or procalcitonin guidance for discontinuation. these include
tuberculosis, meningitis, prosthetic joint infections, staphylococcal
bacteremia, endocarditis and invasive fungal infections. the same
caution applies to some immunocompromised patients.


myth three: if one
drug is good two (or more!) must be better. this requires nuance.there are some  indications for combination therapy. they are
exceptions rather than the rule. the main indication for combination
therapy is initial empiric treatment for life-threatening infection
such as sepsis. the rationale is to cover all likely pathogens.
de-escalation is appropriate if and when  culture and sensitivity
results indicate that a single agent would be appropriate. this
principle is also applied in meningitis where in patients  50 years
of age or older we include listeria coverage such that in non pen
allergic patients ampicillin is added to the  combination of
ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  also in meningitis the combination of
ceftriaxone and vancomycin accommodates the possibility of relative
resistance of strep pneumo which might cause treatment failure with
cephalosporin monotherapy.   in community acquired pneumonia
requiring hospitalizations the guidelines call for combination
cephalosporin and macrolid therapy.  for patients admitted to icu it
is recommended that mrsa coverage be added (this is in the idsa
mrsa guideline, not the pneumonia guidelines).


a frequently asked
question is what to do about serious gram negative infections.
traditionally “double coverage“ with two gram-negative agents has
been used. for the most part this is not supported by evidence. one
exception is in the initial (empiric) antipseudomonal coverage for
hap/vap., the guidelines for which indicate double coverage
initially which should be de-escalated later if microbiologic data
allow.  in contrast, the cap guidelines for patients with
pseudomonas risk  recommend monotherapy---not double coverage--from
the start.  



myth four: oral
antibiotics are not as good as iv antibiotics for hospitalized
patients. this is, in general, a myth but there are exceptions. iv
therapy is not inherently better than oral if there’s adequate
bioavailability with the oral agent and if susceptibilities allow
switch to an oral agent.  cautions apply in bacteremia.  some of
these (eg staphylococcal bacteremia ) require intravenous therapy for
the entire course. in other bacteremic infections step down to oral
agents  may be appropriate.  examples include  certain streptococcal
bacteremias and  gram-negative bacteremic urinary tract infections.
in such cases a switch to oral therapy can be considered as early as
day four. 



myth five: bacteria
in the urine signifies a uti and should be treated.  if it is
asymptomatic treatment is only warranted in  pregnancy and patients
about to undergo a urologic procedure.


myth six: history of
penicillin allergy means the patient can never receive a beta lactam
antibiotic. former thinking was that  there’s a 10 to 15% cross
sensitivity rate between penicillin and cephalosporins. more recent
findings indicate that the cross sensitivity rate to penicillin
allergy is more like 3% for cephalosporins and 1% for carbapenems.
the article provides some general principles for decision making in
patients with purported penicillin allergy.  for  reactions that are
mild and non specific a cephalosporin can be given.  if the reaction
was anaphylactoid either an alternative antibiotic to a cephalosporin
or penicillin desensitization is recommended. severe non anaphylactic
reactions such as stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal
necrolysis  and dress syndrome are in a different category. in those
cases the use of any beta lactam  is contraindicated as is penicillin
desensitization. 



myth seven:
antibiotics for surgical  prophylaxis should be continued for 24
hours or more .


myth eight:
antibiotics must be continued for as long as drains are in place. 
although clinical judgment is required here there is no robust
evidence to support such a practice.


myth nine:
nitrofurantoin can be used for utis only if the creatinine clearance
is greater than 60. this is in accordance with product labeling but
the data indicate  30 may be more reasonable cut off.


myth  ten: 
fluoroquinolones are first line agents for many infections.  we now
have mounting evidence of adverse effects (cns toxicity,, tendon
rupture, dysglycemias, irreversible neuropathy,  qt prolongation and
aortic dissection) such that  fluoroquinolones have been relegated to
 a lower position in the sequence.  they should be used only when
safer and equally effective alternatives are not available.


in a related
antibiotic stewardship topic this article from cinical infectious disease looked at the
utility of mrsa pcr screening. negative pcr can allow for
discontinuation or avoidance of  mrsa therapy such as vancomycin in
many situations. those studied in the article were  bloodstream
infections, intra-abdominal infections, respiratory infections, wound
infections and urinary tract infections. negative predictive value
was 93% or better in all those situations.

diagnostic time out





what is a diagnostic time out? succinctly defined, it’s a
deliberate exercise in differential diagnosis and systematic clinical
reasoning in the care of an individual patient. but wait, i hear
someone say… isn’t that what we do already?  well, no. we’re
all familiar with the traditional model for clinical reasoning that
we’re taught in medical school but those of us in the real world of
 practice nowadays, if we’re honest, realize that it seldom
happens. there’s just not enough time when you’re forced to see
too many patients each day. and hospitalist incentives, with their
emphasis on speed and quick adoption of specific diagnostic labels,
run in opposition.   what do we as hospitalists do instead?  well,
aside from all the care pathways and metric incentives that tell
us what to do, we rely on clinical instincts and rules of thumb.
because they bypass formal analysis, they save time. they serve as
cognitive shortcuts. we call these heuristics. this  method of
thinking (fast, instinctive, intuitive) is sometimes known as  system
1 thinking. it has the advantages of being
efficient and fast and sometimes, in critical situations, life
saving.  but it comes at the cost of a certain error rate. in order
to better understand the  process of system 1 thinking we have given
the various heuristics names and categories. i recently listed some
of those in this post. 


if system 1 is our
usual measure of processing to get around time constraints the
alternative is system 2: formal clinical reasoning . 
 system 2 thinking was the topic of a recent paper in criticalcare clinics. although based on a
survey of people working in a nicu the article has general
applicability. the authors contrast system 1 and system 2 thinking in
this manner:


dual process
theory holds that individuals engaging in medical decision-making
use one of 2 distinct cognitive processes: a system 1
process based on heuristics – the use of rapid pattern
recognition and rules of thumb – or a system 2 process,
based on deliberate analytical modeling and hypothesis generation.
while invoking system one processes individuals can think fast and
reflexively and can even operate at a subconscious level, using
pattern recognition to sort vast amounts of clinical information
quickly before an illness script that allows for the rapid
elaboration of a differential diagnosis. in contrast system 2
processes require focused attention and are purposefully analytical,
relying on  deliberate counter-factual reasoning to generate
hypotheses regarding the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which a
patient’s symptoms are produced.


the authors
introduced the concept of the diagnostic time out to describe
this shift of thinking because it requires deliberate effort. it’s
not going to arise spontaneously in the natural course of the ward
routine.  (the authors were not the first ones to use this term). the
diagnostic time out can be considered the cognitive equivalent of the
better known procedural time out.


why is a diagnostic
time out needed? research on diagnostic error has indicated that
while some instances are due to system problems  (such as failure to
communicate test results) most are cognitive errors. these can be
linked to the heuristics of system 1 thinking. the diagnostic time
out, or the deliberate exercise of system 2 thinking, is a way to
complement these cognitive shortcuts with a more analytical process.


some opinion leaders
in the field of diagnostic error have suggested universal adoption of
system 2 thinking. this is problematic due to time constraints. 
besides, there are some essential benefits of system 1 thinking,
particularly in acute life-threatening situations. the real trick is
how best to selectively employ system 2 thinking. in other words what
are the situations in which system 2 thinking should be used? the
authors suggest handoff situations in complex patients including er
to hospitalist, off service/on service and icu to ward transfers.


how does it work?
the authors propose a template but it’s really just the traditional
clinical reasoning process. one of their points really got my
attention:  during the  time out diagnostic labels should be removed
and replaced by signs, symptoms, manifestations and clinical
concerns. this of course is the opposite of what your coders and
hospitalist leaders want you to do.


what are some of the
barriers to implementation? in addition to time constraints, fear of
ambiguity is an important factor. we are afraid to admit what we
don’t know. one thing you will never hear a hospitalist say out
loud is “i’ll have to think about that.”

a little more on metacognition





this article from academic emergency medicine, published in
2002, remains applicable today. it makes the point that heuristics in
medicine are valuable even though they can lead to error. the article
also makes the statement:


the increasing use
of clinical decision rules, as well as other aids that reduce
uncertainty and cognitive load,  e.g.,  computerized  clinical 
decision  support,will  improve  certain  aspects  of  clinical 
decision making, but much flesh-and-blood clinical decision making 
will  remain  and  there  will  always  be  a place  for  intuition 
and  clinical  acumen.


it presents an
exhaustive list with detailed descriptions of the various cognitive
shortcuts.

indulge me in a little metacognition





i found an interesting post about
cognitive shortcuts in medicine. i have a minor objection to the
title of the post which is cognitive errors.
cognitive shortcuts, known as heuristics, which are examples of fast
instinctive thinking (system one), often lead to error.  in
some cases, however,  they can be useful because they are efficient
and time saving.  there is an up side as well as a down side to
system one thinking in medicine.


let’s go down the
list.   i’ve skipped some of them.


the first example
given is affective error. this refers to  an emotional
response  surpassing objectivity. 



next is aggregate
bias. i struggle with this one. the author says that the
aggregate bias is the belief that  data in the aggregate don’t
apply to the patient in front of you. my understanding (maybe i’m
wrong) is that aggregate bias, otherwise known as the ecological
fallacy, is the opposite. that is, it refers to inappropriate application of
population data to an individual.  it has more to do with treatment
decisions than diagnostic error.  remember, one of the first
principles of evidence-based medicine  is that clinical reasoning
decision making starts with the unique aspects of the individual
patient.  after looking at a variety of references, it would appear
that both definitions have been used.  most medical references define
aggregation bias the way the blog author does.  those outside of
medicine define it as inappropriate extrapolation.


the ambiguity
effect is really a bias against ambiguity. so we tend to
stick with things we are more familiar with. that may cause us to
ignore other possibilities and take too narrow a view of things. as
originally conceived it had to do with probability.  that is, people
have a tendency to gravitate toward choices in which the probability
is known or explicitly stated. of note, the ambiguity effect was
first  described by daniel ellsberg.


the anchoring
heuristic is one of the better known cognitive biases. this
refers to the tendency to stick with one’s initial hunch despite
new evidence to the contrary. you may be so proud of  your initial
hunch that you ignore new information. confirmation bias and
diagnostic momentum are related concepts.


ascertainment
bias, as
the author points out, is an umbrella category. it encompasses a lot
of stereotypes and biases. in essence it’s just—-well, bias. 
it’s not very useful as a unique category in discussions of
cognitive error.


availability
bias  is one of the better known cognitive shortcuts. this refers
to the influence of prior experience. this causes bias toward the
first thing that comes to your mind. for example, if you’ve been
burned by having missed a case of aortic dissection you may tend to
be over concerned about aortic dissection in every future case of
chest pain. the flip side is you may fail to consider things you
haven’t seen in a long time.


base rate neglect
is a cognitive shortcut that may be considered harmful and
wasteful in ambulatory medicine but may be your friend in the arena
of hospital and emergency medicine.  it’s a failing to consider the
true prevalence of diseases in  clinical reasoning.  it ignores the
old aphorism  “common things happen most often.” in the high
acuity world of the hospital,  where you really need to be
risk-averse, base rate neglect may be beneficial. put another way you
and and your patient may be better off if you consider worst case
scenario.


then there’s
belief bias. i’m not sure this belongs in a discussion of
diagnostic shortcuts as it has more to do with treatment
recommendations. i cringe when i hear somebody say they “believe“
in a particular treatment, implying  that belief surpasses reasoning
from evidence .


blind spot
bias is similar to the dunning kruger effect in which we think
we're smarter than we really are. humility is the remedy here. does
this lead to a form of cognitive shortcut? maybe in that we fail to
pause and consider carefully that we might be wrong.


confirmation bias
is akin to anchoring. this is the tendency to be selective in what
type of accumulating evidence you consider.  that is,  you consider
mainly evidence that supports your original hunch.


the framing
heuristic is another well known  shortcut.  we are biased toward
diagnostic possibilities in accordance with the way the initial
presentation is framed.  though it  can be useful it restricts our
differential diagnosis in a way that excludes a wide range of
possibilities.  not every returning travel with fever has a parasite,
for example.


the gamblers
fallacy, according to the blog author, is “the erroneous belief
that chance his self correcting.“ this is a cognitive error that
tends in the opposite direction to the availability heuristic.


the order effect
is something i was vaguely aware of but had not considered as a
cognitive error category. it refers to the tendency to focus on
information that is proximate in time and to do so at the expense of
the totality of events over time. this typically occurs at the point
of hand off in a patient who has had a very long hospital course.


premature closure
is just what it says. it’s a tendency for thinking to stop once
a tentative diagnosis has been made. it overlaps with other
categories such as anchoring. there is probably a subtle difference
between premature  closure  and anchoring. anchoring implies an
emotional attachment to a diagnosis whereas premature closure implies
diagnostic laziness.


representativeness
restraint has also been known as a representativeness heuristic.
it is a cognitive shortcut characterized by focusing too much on the
prototypical manifestations of a disease. this may cause the
clinician to miss atypical presentations.


search
satisfaction is another example of laziness in clinical
reasoning. it’s a tendency to stop searching once an answer has
been found. the author gives the example of missing a second fracture
on an x-ray once the first one is identified.


sunk cost fallacy
is a type of emotional heuristic as well as diagnostic laziness. it
is the tendency to ignore new information and not consider
alternative diagnoses once the original diagnosis has been arrived at
after a great time effort and expense (the sunk cost).


sutton’s slip
might be the dark side of sutton’s law (going where the money is).
pursuing  the obvious might lead to error because of other
possibilities being ignored.


zebra retreat
is the avoidance of rare diagnoses to a fault.  it’s  an opposite
of base rate neglect.
