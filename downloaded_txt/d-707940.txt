experiential extensions

in this series, i use algorithms to craft compositions from visual artifacts of my experiences. i explore and record my surroundings seeking out unique perceptual shapes from the enclosed edges of visual phenomena. i call these shapes primers. sometimes, the primers are the perceived edges of clouds, the unique shapes created from the visual contrast of light and shadow, or even the negative space of the sky created by overlapping tree branches. the time data associated with these captured shapes informs the resulting spatial compositions, which i call voxelations. i often create 3d-printed sculptures of the voxelations.
