why choose
gateway seed? 



every sale that we make at gateway is a commitment to your livelihood, and we take that seriously. because our sales are based on our excellent service and earning trust from farmers, we are not a company that leaves you after the sale is made. we stand behind our products, taking pride in the fact that farmers are involved throughout the entire process. our dedicated team of experts continually use your feedback to make our products better. gateway seed will go the extra mile to earn your trust and help you get the best yield. we value the voice of our farmers because we know that a great crop doesn’t start with a seed. it starts with a farmer. 







faq’s 










what regions are you currently serving?

right now gateway is largely focused in the midsouth, southern illinois and indiana along with north central missouri. we are also moving into areas along the east coast. the maturity lines that we carry allow us to target several areas. of course within any of these areas we focus on the specific needs that we can fill with our product lines.













where are your products grown?

the majority of our soybean products are grown right in our market areas. our corn is grown by reputable producers in the corn belt that we have worked with for years.













who picks out your products?

with the help of experienced genetic suppliers gateway will work to select a group of products that fit best for the area. then we take that group to the area and the farmers to help us narrow it down to the products that work best for them on their farms.













who works for you?

currently we have a staff that has worked in the target areas for many years. we don’t sit behind big desks and expect the job to get done. we all help to make sure the customer is taken care of. if that requires the sales manager or operations manager to make deliveries or help put in plots then that is what they will do.
