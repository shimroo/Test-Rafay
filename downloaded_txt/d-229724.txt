mail is personal. your labels should be personalized. after almost a century of manufacturing and selling everything from address labels to stampers and stationery, we like to think we know a few things about top quality merchandise, value, and exceptional service. but beyond that, we know that our customers have a wide variety of needs—what works for one family’s holiday card probably won’t work for a couple’s baby shower announcement. luckily, we offer hundreds of designs so that you can find something for any occasion.

we at current labels® are here to meet all of your personalized printing needs while providing convenient customer service—ourcustomer service team is available by phone, email, or chat during normal business hours.
