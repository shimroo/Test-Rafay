 this site is a little window into the things i love!
    those include my fabulous husband, our wonderful pets, some great friends, beach volleyball, and travel -- especially to
            archeological sites. in particular, i have a
            penchant for climbing around all sorts of magnificent, ancient
            monuments. please come in and stay for a spell... and please do sign
            the guest book before you go. j
