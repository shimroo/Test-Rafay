osu wrestle-off shocker!!! 
141 ian paddock upset ncaa all-american hunter stieber tonight by a 
commanding 7-2 score. paddock has become sort of a "forgotten man" for the 
buckeyes due to injury, but clearly is back strong. whether this is an 
aberration or he is really that good remains to be seen, but it's a damn 
impressive showing. 

125 nikko triggas over johnni dijulius 5-4. dijulius was up 4-1 with :50 riding 
time after two perods, but in the third triggas got his patented arm bar in and 
turned him for three and picked up a riding point for a 5-4 win. it's my 
understanding that dijulius will redshirt regardless as the cut has become too 
difficult.
184- kenny courts 12-2 over craig thomas
285- pete capone 3-1 over orey elor
133- logan stieber by fall over drew stone
149- cam tessari 3-1 over alex gordon

165- mark martin 12-4 over joey grandominco

welcome to ovaec wrestling



(ohio valley athletic ex coach) the purpose of this 
web site is to promote o.v.a.c. wrestling and the individuals that make it all 
possible. i don't proclaim to know everything about the 

o.v.a.c.'s or wrestling, but i have coached in the o.v.a.c.'s for the past 8 
years so i do have some knowledge of the sport, coaches and the wrestlers(2002).
