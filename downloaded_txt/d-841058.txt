winter tree care is much more than merely seeing if you have a problem with your tree or a few dead branches. there are many other vital steps you need to take to ensure that your tree will thrive during the colder months of the year and that you won’t have any unwanted issues down the road. providing proper winter tree care for the trees in your yard is a significant tree care maintenance effort designed to keep and preserve your trees and your landscape’s future.

the first step you should take to ensure proper winter tree care is to make sure that you are prepared for the upcoming cold. you want to be ready for the winter and have adequate equipment to handle the cold weather if it should occur. an excellent first step is to prepare your yard and property by taking down all the trees in your yard.
next, it is time to begin digging the trenches where you are going to bury your tree. this should take about two weeks after your last snowfall. by the time you are digging, your trees should have grown into the ground and are now ready for their winter tree care routine. one of the most important things to remember is that you will need to cut the stump down before you bury it. this will allow for adequate space between the tree and your new stump so that any roots that might grow there won’t damage your existing trees or interfere with the snow pile you placed down below.
after the soil is dug around your tree, start filling the holes with snow. while you fill the trenches, make sure you leave enough room for the tree’s trunk to grow freely. if your tree has a solid trunk, it can grow in several inches or more into the snow. this is very beneficial for the tree because it prevents the tree from freezing while digging the soil. when the snow melts, you will notice that the tree’s root ball is more extensive, and the roots are not frozen.
by this time, you will probably need to remove some of the existing roots that are on the root ball but do not cut them down completely. the root ball is what is going to help to provide the tree with the nutrients that it needs to survive the winter. after the snow melts, the snow will go on top of the root ball, and you should make sure it does not remain on top for an extended period.
one final step you should take when implementing winter tree care is making sure that you check the soil around the tree and remove any grass clippings from the ground before it freezes. any snow that has been left in the ground will cause the ground to be slushy, and the roots of your tree will be exposed and susceptible to frostbite and rot if you leave them unprotected for long periods.
for serious cases where a tree needs to be removed, call the tree removal madison, wi trusts for quality, affordable tree care.   tree removal can be necessary in many situations where the tree is dead, seriously distressed, a hazard to property structures, or just an overall nuisance in your landscape.  for these, and other situations, removing the tree may be your best option.

posted on february 7, 2020july 28, 2020tree care – the things you can do yourself 




the best thing about tree care is that you never have to worry about the cuttings rotting or the roots breaking under the weight of the leaves. if you’ve got a healthy tree that gives you a healthy yield, it’s a fine way to spend your time.
there are many ways to keep a tree in good shape, but tree care should always be one of them. sure, you can get people to trim the branches and prune the tree, but you never know what happens. there are some other things you should do that will not cost you a lot of money or go through the length of a home inspection process.

when it comes to tree care, you can do some things without spending a lot of money on a lot of extra things you need to purchase. keeping your tree healthy takes more than cutting a few branches. there are some simple things you can do that will help your tree lives for years to come.
consider planting branches around the tree. this will give it more shade and help it retain water and nutrients. some plants require more shade than others, and if your tree is too large for you to plant other trees around it, consider adding some other plants. you don’t want to do this if the size of the tree is too large to support other kinds of plants.
pruning your tree can be difficult, and sometimes it’s not even necessary. if you don’t prune your tree, it’s a waste of the tree’s time and effort. if you have a lot of leaves, you may want to trim them.
don’t forget to wash and dry any cuttings before you put them into containers. some watering products will cause the plant to grow rather than replanting the cuttings.

posted on february 7, 2020february 7, 2020why residential landscaping is important 




residential landscaping does not always mean a good looking garden or a well-manicured lawn. it may also mean adding to the quality of life and the beauty of the surroundings. making the most of a garden or a lawn is a process that needs careful consideration.
one thing that residential landscaping can do is make it possible for someone who is confined to a wheelchair to enjoy their garden and lawn. this means that the caregiver is able to give them that same feeling that most people take for granted. it also means that they are provided with more freedom to move about the property.
adding more shade and privacy to the landscape will add some of the same attributes that a garden can provide. it will also be another addition to their comfort and quality of life. this will have positive implications on their overall well being for those who use the home as their residence.
there is another benefit that could be made out of any work done to the exterior of the home or outdoor furniture. this is the safety of the homeowner, the elderly, the disabled, and those who use the home. if the home or furniture can be kept safe from the elements, then the enjoyment and quality of life can be increased as well.
residential landscaping can enhance a home in a number of ways. it can change the aesthetics of the outside of the home as well as the exterior of the home. it can even change the look of the interior of the home.
the outdoor garden furniture and landscaping done will increase the ability of the family to do things outside of the home that they may not be able to do otherwise. this can include gardening, walking, or other recreational activities that the family enjoys.



landscaping should not be thought of as simply a task that is accomplished in the summer months. it should be thought of as something that can be planned and done throughout the year. this way, the homeowner will not have to wait until it is too late to make changes.

posted on february 7, 2020july 13, 2020what’s the difference between stump removal vs. stump grinding? 

do you have got a stump on your property?  perhaps the tree was too near your driveway; perhaps it was had become a security hazard. for any reason, your tree is gone and all you are left with is that this stump and its origins. like most people, you would like to be rid of the eyesore. you may be thinking you desire this stump”eliminated” — and we know that. nonetheless, it’s very important to understand that”eliminating” the stump signifies something quite different than”grinding” the stump. in fact, stump grinding is most probably your very best option.
to assist you to embark upon the practice of vanquishing your own stump, we have committed this article to answer questions such as”what is the distinction between stump removal and stump grinding?”
as we mentioned, most people that have a lawn they care about are not likely to need to pursue stump removal. that is because stump removal involves not just pulling the stump but also each one the roots attached to it. consequently, you are likely to require a bobcat or any other heavy-duty part of the gear. additionally, the origins of your tree could have spread out over half of the lawn.
thus, you could wind up churning through a lot of the dirt in your property. usually, homeowners just elicit complete stump removal services if they’re clearing a whole property for construction, in which case, the aesthetics do not concern them.
stump grinding is a considerably more reasonable course of action for property owners to select since it does not involve removing the entire tree stump. employing a stump grinder such as the one pictured below, we will grind the stump and shave the rest of the tree trunk till it is gone. by definition, a stump is what is left of this tree trunk, which residual tree trunk extends to the floor. so, getting your stump floor down will leave your lawn with a pit, but one which is much less enormous than if you moved the stump removal path.
some equipment may grind stumps as low as 24 inches to the ground. nevertheless, the industry norm would be to grind the stump until there is not a back anymore. in reality, that is the way we do it at wind tree service, which is the tree service akron property owners trust.  perhaps you’re wondering, how well, how heavily does one tree stump go? the solution is, it depends. some trees have shallower trunks compared to others. the general guideline is a white pine trunk extends deeper than the usual sycamore’s, and also a sycamore backward goes deeper than the usual cottonwood. beyond that, the neighborhood arborist will estimate the thickness of the back when they are outside to grind it.
faq #1 – what happens to origins left after stump grinding? could they resprout?
we get this question a good deal. the solution is no, tree roots can’t re-sprout a tree following the stump was ground down. the origins will just deteriorate as time passes. some people hear this and fear that there may be a gaping sinkhole within their lawn in five years — however, this is not something you need to be concerned about. the origins decompose in the soil such that there will not be a vacuum cleaner, so to speak. additionally, this practice is quite slow down, so about the off-chance, there are a few small caving-in of the topsoil, it would not be for at least a couple dozen years. and it is the persistence of those origins which brings us into our next question.
faq #2 – could i replant in which my previous tree was?
the brief answer is yes but we suggest that you do not. the propensity of homeowners would be occasionally to plant a new tree at the hole where the old one has been. we find this to be true when the homeowners were especially reluctant to eliminate the tree in the first place — say, if it had been damaged or diseased — and they had been sorry to see it move.
conversely, the roots which remain after stump grinding will make it difficult for a tree to grow.  not only do the older roots take up areas where fresh roots would have to take hold, but their decomposition will also alter the acidity of the ground. therefore, the new tree might have difficulty growing.
it will be especially challenging to get a tree to grow if the previous tree was hickory. these kinds of trees secrete a poison (especially, juglone poison ) to the dirt around their foundation, which prevents other plants from taking root. (ever wondered why marijuana does not grow up to the foundation of a pine tree? that is largely due to the poison these trees secrete).
obviously, in the event that you simply can not live with no foliage in that specific area in your lawn, you will find remedies. to begin with, you are likely to need to pursue the stump removal procedure instead of the stump grinding process, to eliminate the roots. second, you will want to reestablish the acidity of the ground. to do so, you ought to get your soil analyzed. you’re able to find that done with a local research institution or college — for instance, the university of iowa provides soil testing for only $35! they’ll then inform you precisely how to care for your soil to get ready for the tree.
however, this may be costly and time-consuming. that is why we typically advise finding another location on your lawn for the tree.
faq #3 – what do i do with all the wood chips left after the stump is ground down?
this is another question we receive a great deal. once stump grinding is done, you need to use this wood chip to fill the gap left from the tree stump. however, odds are you’ll have more chips leftover then. in wind tree service we drag off your additional wood chips and require it into a compost bin, where it finally gets turned into landscape mulch. if you do not choose to have your tree service haul off the wood chips, remember: those fresh wood shavings may bring bugs, such as termites. thus, it’s ideal to eliminate it quickly by carrying it into a compost bin or landfill.
therefore, what’s the takeaway with stump grinding? most critical is the difference between stump removal and stump grinding.  bear in mind, the latter takes a lot longer and is more labor-intensive, and that’s why we implore our residential customers to utilize to stump grinding services. beyond this, if you’ve some questions regarding stump grinding, please hit us at the comments below!  or, ask your local tree service if you need a quote for stump grinding or removal.
