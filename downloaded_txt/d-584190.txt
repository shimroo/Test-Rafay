“we share the same world, don’t we? this world you would die to save. it’s coming. i’ve seen it in the probability. seen it plain as day. all you heroes protecting this world. do you think you’re the only ones? do you think this the only world? we’ll see what happens when you have to protect this place from the others.”
the marvel cinematic universe is truly at a crossroads. since the last avengers film the studio has released one disappointing film after another. the big tentpole stars and characters have been lost along the way, and that star power has seriously damaged the franchise since that time. certainly there have been some bright spots. spider-man no way home was the lone exceptional outing, and the recent deadpool & wolverine film was just plain fun.  with robert downy, jr.’s iron man. gone. chris evans captain america. gone. scarlet johanson’s black widow. gone.read more

i’ve never been much for will ferrell. his brand of comedy never really resonated with me. i always just found it too ridiculous and outlandish.  i suppose you’re cordially invited will be the exception to that rule. while the film does play right into ferrell’s wheelhouse with the over-the-top antics such as wrestling an alligator, it is actually the dynamic, should i say the rivalry, between ferrell and reese witherspoon that is the highlight of the movie. the film is similar to bride wars and the neighbors, which makes a measure of sense as the director of the latter film is actually the director of this film as well. further aiding the film’s success is that, like ferrell and witherspoon, a majority of the cast all have established comedy backgrounds. joining ferrell and witherspoon was geraldine viswanathan (blockers) as ferrell daughter and one of the brides-to-be, meredith hagner (vacation friends) as witherspoon’s sister and the other bride-to-be, stony blyden (hunter street) as one of the grooms-to-be, and jimmy tatro (home economics) as the other groom-to-be.read more

“what f&#k is a shark doing on a plane?” 
you remember samuel jackson back a few years was fighting off snakes on a plane, yeah? well, now we’ve got sharks on a plane. so how in the heck did they do that? well, it requires going back to the 1970’s when irwin allen was the master of the disaster film, and he had a legion of followers. writer andy mason and director claudio fah found themselves a tardis and took their behinds to those golden days of movie mayhem. if you are willing to totally throw logic out the window and just hang with these guys for about 90 minutes, you’ll have a bit of fun, and likely you’ll forget it by the next day. i happened to catch the film yesterday, and … let me see … someone was doing something, and there were sharks on an aircraft of some kind. let me go and watch it again. hold on …read more

with the end of the year upon us, i felt this was the best time to talk about what i feel was the best film of 2024. first i want to start by saying that this hasn’t been my favorite year for cinema, especially when you look at the kind of films you see at award shows, mostly all those films were forgettable and not anything i feel will become cinematic classics. that being said, when it comes to the horror genre, this has been a pretty great year. for a while i would have said late night with the devil was going to be my favorite horror film of the year, but then the substance came out, and that just floored me, and i’ve kind of become a bit obsessed with the film. it’s the only film this year that has stuck with me for days and just had me wanting to watch it again so i could savor its visuals, whether they be beautiful or grotesque.read more

” well, you can forget what you’ve learned at training college. because at the end of the day, there’s just one thing that matters in this job – a copper’s gut.” 
wallace and gromit is the brainchild of animator nick park. the british filmmaker tried for years to bring his clay creations alive, but on his own finished a mere 10 minutes in a little over 2 years. when he met up with aardman animations, he was teamed up with the creative talents he needed to make his dream come alive, and come alive these two characters did indeed. they’ve become an overnight sensation in the uk and now all over the world. i was introduced to the characters with the full length feature wallace and gromit in the curse of the were-rabbit. i have to admit that i was completely won over by the magic of this creation. it’s so simple looking that it almost appears to be child’s play. the truth could not be further from the perception. stop motion animation goes back to the beginning of the cinema itself. read more

buy at amazon.com

not sure if this has ever happened to me before: to like the movie adaptation as much as i like the book itself. naturally much of this feeling is due to the inclusion of peter dinklage into the cast of this film, but that said, i found the thicket to be among my favorite movie adaptations of this year, which is interesting given the amount of creative license taken with the material. based on the joe r. lansdale western novel of the same name,the film follows jack parker, a boy who, after his sister is kidnapped by a violent killer known only as cut throat bill, enlists a fierce bounty hunter named reginald jones, who becomes the leader of the group of outcasts searching for the stolen girl. joining dinklage is juliette lewis as cut throat bill, hanna’s esmé creed-miles as lula parker, jack’s sister, and the old man’s gbenga akinnagbe as eustace howard, an ex-slave who assists jack.read more

“killing is bad. like, unacceptably bad.”
i had such high hopes for this romantic comedy. i didn’t expect that it would raise the level of the genre, but i figured that it would be some lighthearted fun like in the ugly truth or sex tape. the unfortunate part is that i feel like it had that potential; it just required better story development. a shame; this really could have been a win for kaley cuoco. not that she needs one; of the big three of the big bang theory, i’d say she’s the one with the fullest dance card. it’s like she hasn’t taken a breath since the series ended. but then again one could argue that she’s always been on the go since her days on 8 simple rules. even so, i really wanted to like this film, and while it had a couple of good moments, the lackluster story development really diminished any traction that the film gained.read more

“this is a game about winning the points that matter. you beating me is a nice story for you to tell people when you’re giving them tennis lessons, but i guarantee you the thing they’ll all be the most excited about is that you met me at all. they’ll ask you what i’m like. they’ll ask you if i’m nice. they’ll ask you if we were friends. and then they’ll ask you how i did it. they’ll ask you and you won’t have no $#*%ing clue what to tell them. and even if you did want to know, i couldn’t possibly explain it to you in a language you’ll understand, because the thing you learn when you’ve been operating at my level for as long as i have is that it’s so $#*%ing lonely to win this much. nobody gets it. but everyone on earth gets what it’s like to be you.”
so the truth about this film when i learned about it was i knew it was destined to be a movie that my wife would drag me to the theater to see. i’ve never been one for tennis, and while i have a rudimentary understanding of the game’s rules and how it is played, it falls into the same category as golf; it’s just not that exciting a sport for me.read more

for just about the past decade i feel samara weaving has earned the title of scream queen in the horror genre. she may not be a box office name like jenna ortega, but i feel samara weaving has a more impressive resume of cool and fun horror films, and she just consistently delivers. ready or not in a lot of ways is the film that best showcases her talents, and i thought for sure she’d level up to a-list status, but it seems the movie gods have other plans for her. thankfully she is still cranking out some fun films for genre fans. azrael is weaving’s newest dip into the horror genre, a film that was written by simon barrett, who previously wrote the horror gems you’re next and the guest, and to sweeten this ghoulish cinematic pot, it is directed by e.l. katz, who directed the 2013 dark comedy cheap thrills. does this all add up to another genre hit, or is this a dud?read more

it’s hard to maintain the attention of the 21st-century child. animated movies have to combine enough elements of charm and action to keep their attention for a little under two hours. if you want to keep a franchise going, you have to rip out your sequels on reasonably tight schedules. it was over four years between kung fu panda 2 and kung fu panda 3, and we waited nearly that long between the first and second entry. that’s a long time in a culture where we move from fad to fad almost by the hour. but if the films are good enough and leave enough of an impact, you might be able to bridge those years successfully. read more

“if i could stay funny, i can stay alive!”
that was the mantra that kept jamie foxx alive, which he explains in this testimonial stand-up special about the events that nearly cost him his life back in 2023. we all heard the rumors about what happened. renowned triple threat jamie foxx suffered a serious medical event resulting in him becoming hospitalized. amid conflicting reports about the nature of his condition, including rumors that he was gravely ill, his condition for the most part remained a mystery and a closely guarded secret within his family. then the rumor mill started to include tales that the actor had died, and the family was keeping it secret. and as if that was not outlandish enough, following the actor posing a video clip in which he commented about his health, saying that he had been to “hell and back,” then the rumors started that the actor had been cloned, this coming after the release of the film they cloned tyrone, in which the jamie foxx is featured. read more

the reel world by brent lorentson on december 28th, 2024

there is something about how the french make their horror films that i find a bit hard to resist. films like high tension, inside, and martyrs are films i go back to time and time again and just have a blast with, and with the release of mads i was a bit optimistic that this could also be a film to add to my rotation when i’m on a french horror film kick. what really gave me hope for this film is seeing that it was directed by david moreau, who gave us the criminally underappreciated home invasion horror film them (2006). if you are a fan of home invasion horror and you’ve missed on them, i highly recommend checking it out. as for mads, it seems moreau was going for something a bit different, this time doing a one-shot horror film about a virus outbreak that causes those infected to go “mad” and violently attack people. sure, we’ve seen it before, but is the one-shot approach a fresh enough take to make this an experience worth sitting through?read more

“project shadow is far beyond anything we’ve encountered. shadow’s story began a lot like yours, sonic. but where you found family and friends, shadow only found pain and loss.”
i’ve been patiently awaiting this installment since the 2022 mid-credit scene hinted at the idea of shadow’s introduction into the franchise. now here we are with that idea becoming a reality, and with keanu reeves voicing the character, no less. sonic the hedgehog 3 takes the series in a darker direction than the previous installments as the happy-go-lucky sonic finds his worldview challenged by the reveal of another hedgehog that received a much worse reception than he did. in that regard, i appreciated the director staying true to form with shadow’s backstory.read more

as awards season has come around this year, i found myself watching several films involving the catholic church, from russell crowe’s the exorcism to sydney sweeney’s immaculate, and finally cabrini. and now conclave. i was surprised to find that all four films were relatively respectful, even as they might be pointing out the flaws of the ancient church. all four films were replete with wonderful performances that carried the emotional beats of the stories. at the top of my list from those films is cabrini, with conclave coming in a close second. read more

it seems it would be easy to do a film about the urban legend where a driver picks up a woman in white who turns out to be a ghost. we are all familiar with this story, though the details of the urban tale can vary from one storyteller to the next, and it really seems like something so straightforward that it would be hard to make a mess of it. i at least thought so until i watched black cab. the film at first glance just seemed like something in my wheelhouse that couldn’t go wrong; it was a ghost story starring nick frost, whom i’ve been a fan of since first seeing him in shaun of the dead and spaced, but despite how likeable he is, there is just nothing much that could have saved this movie, which was mostly dead on arrival. anne (synnove karlsen) and patrick (luke norris) are a recently engaged couple. after a night of celebration turns sour, they attempt to take a cab ride home, but instead their night is about to go from bad to worse as they discover their driver is a bit unhinged. as for their cab driver, ian (nick frost), his plans for the couple remain ambiguous for a good portion of the film,read more

“between 1889 and 1910, over two million italians immigrated to the united states. they were desperately poor, often illiterate, and almost never spoke english. many americans considered these italians to be of inferior intelligence, fit only for menial labor and a threat to the very fabric of america.” 
i have to admit to a particular bias here. i am italian. my grandparents immigrated here in the early 19th century. i am also catholic, as most of these italian immigrants were. in addition, i feel a bit of a connection to mother cabrini. the first school i attended back in first grade was that attached to my italian catholic parish, and it was called the cabrini academy. so there is a certain bias toward the subject here, but i might point out it also leads to very high expectations that these subjects are treated correctly. i still very much demanded a compelling story and an inspirational lead. in director alejandro monteverde’s cabrini, i was fortunate enough to find both.read more

when i first heard anna kendrick was stepping behind the camera to direct her first film, i kind of expected it to be another pitch perfect film … but to find her instead doing a thriller about a real life serial killer and rapist who appeared on a game show in the 1970s was a curve ball i wasn’t expecting. but this isn’t simply a true crime story but instead is about how women were marginalized and heavily objectified. but the biggest takeaway i had while watching this was simply how dangerous things were back then and just how easily a serial killer could be prolific and walk the streets while no one suspected a thing. to get it out of the way, my major gripe with this film is that we meet rodney alcala (daniel zovatto) in the very beginning, and we see that he’s a vicious serial killer who lures his victims with charm while posing as a photographer. read more

but that’s really just the beginning. writer/director osgood perkins has created one of those serial killer films that is bound to draw comparisons with some of the best of those films and most certainly silence of the lambs. let me just get that out of the way fast. this is a pretty solid film that deserves some attention, and is absolutely worth a look.read more

blumhouse is one of those horror factories that have changed the way horror films are created, seen, and marketed. there have been some powerful horror films to come out of those doors. when i think of meg3n, the first couple of paranormal activity films, and even the purge franchise, i see clever and innovative films. but the production house can be a bit feast-or-famine, and there have been a number of famine films on the bill.  among the famine list of films you’ll find truth or dare and the crazy horror/hybrid take on the old fantasy island series. what do both of those films have in common?read more

“let me tell you a story. a story of a great king.”
let me begin by admitting that the original 1994 classic animation feature film the lion king has remained my all-time favorite animated film. it wasn’t just the elton john/tim rice songs, but that didn’t hurt. i’ve been an elton john fan as far back as i can remember. there was just something special, something timeless, in that film. since that time i regard it as the very last breath of the walt disney studios classic animation. it started the studio’s last string of hits, and it was the end of an era. so that film has become somewhat bittersweet for me. the animated sequels were low-budget made-for-video quality, and the more recent “live action” version did not impress me with anything more than the technology it displayed. the heart has been gone for a long time. with the release of mufasa, walt disney is attempting to pull on the heartstrings of people like me who love the original.read more

it’s the end of a tour of duty for the cast and crew of blue bloods. on friday, december 13th, the show aired its last episode. it’s time to say goodbye to the reagans … maybe not forever, but for now. after 14 years and 293 episodes, the show comes to an end. it wasn’t because ratings had dropped. they most certainly have not. the show was actually still growing after 14 years. it wasn’t because the actors wanted out. not a single cast member wanted out. more on my thoughts later. for now paramount is releasing blue bloods: the final season on dvd so you can complete your collection. read more

“so a psychopath walks into a bar and sees this famous clown sitting there all alone. totally drunk;, it’s pathetic. “i can’t believe you’re here,” he says. “what a disappointment. i used to watch you on tv. what can i get you?” and this clown turns and says “well, if you’re buying you can get me anything.” “perfect,” the psychopath says. “how about i get you what you f’in deserve?”
folie a deux. french for madness of two. from the moment that title was an announced, it was presumed that harley quinn would be making an appearance, and i applaud lady gaga’s selection as joaquin phoenix counterpart. however, i suspect that the reason for her selection was twofold given the decision to make the film a musical. perhaps not an official musical, but in my humble opinion, i don’t think it could have been any more official. unfortunately, this was among my issues with the film. it was too long, and there were too many songs.read more

director jaume collet-serra has been a director i’ve been following for some time now. for me he just consistently puts out films that are in my wheelhouse that i just know i’ll have fun with. his films just remind me of what it was like to watch the action films of the 90s, and i kind of feel he’s like the new renny harlin, and i say this with love. if you compare the two filmmakers’ resumes the similarities are pretty incredible. both have a shark film, both have an adventure film involving a boat that sadly was a commercial failure despite being fun, both have an action film at an airport during christmas, and now come to find out collet-serra is remaking cliffhanger, which happens to be a renny harlin film. i mean, seriously, what are the odds of that happening? the moment i found out that netflix released the new jaume collet-serra film, i couldn’t be more excited to check this film out and take a break from the awards season films and just enjoy some popcorn-friendly cinema. was it a hit, or did it crash and burn?read more

i saw this film as an opportunity to gauge whether a movie could hold my two-year-old son’s attention. this is something i am particularly interested in, because it would demonstrate that my baby boy is finally ready for a theatrical experience. unfortunately, he is not quite there yet. he watched for a bit, but then he eventually wandered off. ironically, i didn’t notice his absence at first, as i was too focused on the movie. based on the new york times bestselling novel of the same name, the wild robot stars lupita nyong’o as roz, a rozzum unit 7134 robot that becomes shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and must learn to adapt to the harsh surroundings, gradually building relationships with the animals on the island and becoming the adoptive parent of an orphaned gosling. joining nyong’o is pedro pascal in his animated movie debutread more
