sewage is used water and wastes discharged by a visitors and collected from the drains of sinks, showers, toilets and laundry facilities and flows into sewer lines, or collection systems, from the drains in homes and businesses. from the sewer lines, it is then transported to a sewage treatment facility.
sewers back up when sewage collection lines get clogged by items flushed down toilets and drains such as fats, rags oil and grease (frog) that get caught in the line and plug it up.  in addition to the costly repairs, sewer back ups are messy, foul-smelling, and pose a serious public health threat. 
never flush down the toilet or drain

motor oil
disposable diapers and baby wipes
disinfectant wipes 
cleaning cloths
big chunks of garbage
cat litter including “flushable” cat litter
feminine napkins, tampons and applicators
