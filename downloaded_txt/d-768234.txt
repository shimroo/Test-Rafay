brought to you by saxophonist and composer pete thomas, cafésaxophone is the ideal online establishment for saxophone players to meet, have a chat, a debate, listen to and critique each others' playing, share ideas or just find stuff out. players (old & new), teachers, students, saxophone manufacturers, retailers - all are welcome to contribute.
you don't need to be an expert, just have a love of the saxophone and saxophone players. maybe you are a teacher with some unique or exciting method. maybe you are a beginner with some frustrating experiences and solutions to share. whatever, there is something here for you to teach and/or learn.
