rent an italian vacation villa, farmhouse or apartment - it's easy!
for a very special holiday in italy, spend some time with us and review one of 
the most complete catalogs on the web for italian vacation rentals. we offer an 
impressive collection of italian villas, farmhouses and apartments 
	in the most desirable regions for your italy stay.


an 
italian villa rental offers great advantages, especially if you desire 
a close personal experience with the people and countryside of italy. take in 
the views from a tuscany villa, visit the nearby towns like san gimignano, siena 
or florence. or maybe you would prefer to relax with a view of the cinque terre 
coastline, or along the waters of lake como, maggiore or orta. for the 
experienced traveler, find an italy rental off the beaten path in small and less 
visited areas in the tuscan countryside, umbria or even puglia.

from a vacation rental property in italy, you can set your own schedule, take 
day trips to find the best small towns, vineyards, local churches, museums and 
restaurants. at the end of the day, return to your own villa to the privacy or 
your own place and relax by the pool. spend the day at the market and come home 
to your italian kitchen, pour a glass of wine and create your own culinary 
masterpiece. 


you 
can also find the perfect italian vacation apartment rental here in the most 
popular locations in italy. a florence apartment rental offers you a marvelous 
opportunity to visit the uffizi, the ponte vecchio and other sites and then 
return to your own cozy refuge for a little rest! many italian holiday apartment rentals 
offer easy access to the hill towns and villages that give italy its 
characteristic charm. apartment rentals are also available in smaller towns and 
out of the way places -- take a look!
