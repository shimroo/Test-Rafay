have won other numerous prizes, and she had the honor of being selected as one of the world’s distinguished quilt artists to exhibit three selected quilts in tokyo, japan in 2003.  because suzanne is self taught, she developed some new approaches to applique and hand quilting, her most popular workshops. suzanne has also written several books about quilting to help and inspire quilters around the world.  her quilt patterns
