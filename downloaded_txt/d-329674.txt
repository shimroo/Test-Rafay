compatibility
                      questions?
                      

since the release of windows
                      vista and windows 7, many visitors have asked about compatibility of codebrain (and other)
                      java applets.  all codebrain applets are fully compatible with vista and
                      windows 7;
                      and, as well, with all standard browsers (firefox, netscape, internet
                      explorer, etc.).  java applets are both cross-platform and cross-browser
                      compatible - designed to run anywhere!.

                      bar styler 5.5


sbs 5.5 is
                      a software tool that generates scrollbar css
                      "style"
                      code for colored, flat-style, and custom scrollbars.

it also creates javascript code for multi-color
                      blinking scrollbars.

super for styling your page and building eye-grabber
                      scrollbar effects.
