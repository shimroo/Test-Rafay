benefits of solar

huge savings on energy bills
                                    
you save by eliminating electricity usage and using energy generated by the sun. savings on energy bills kicks into high gear once you've cut enough in electricity bills to recoup the installation cost.
                                    






reduce carbon emissions
                                    
the electricity produced from solar has no greenhouse gases whatsoever, which helps to reduce the effect of climate change. solar power is pollution-free and a renewable source of energy.
                                    






readily available
                                    
solar produces renewable, clean power available every day; even on cloudy days, some energy can be synthesized.
                                    






add value to your home 
                                    
you can expect an increase in retail value of your home at just under $6000 per kw of solar energy. this means if you install 5kw worth of solar panels, it could add an additional $29,000 onto its current price!
                                    






feed-in tariffs
                                    
if you have a grid-connected solar system, power produced must be immediately used, or it will feed into the shared electricity grid for other properties to use.
                                    






low maintenance
                                    
with little maintenance, twice-yearly cleaning, solar panels will perform at optimum levels for up to 25 years.
                                    






affordable 
                                    
generous government rebates, interest-free loans, and other incentives are available to help with upfront costs.
                                    






sustainable living
                                    
clean, renewable energy is the way of our future. every solar panel installed is helping to build a more sustainable future for generations to come.

off-grid
                                
off-grid solar power systems, also known as stand-alone power systems or remote area power systems, are for households and organisations who are committed to clean power and who are unable to connect, or choose not to connect,
                                    to the state electricity grid.
                                






hybrid
                                
a hybrid solar system combines the best of both worlds: the convenience of a grid-connected system — including the ability to earn feed-in tariff credits — with the extra peace of mind of a battery backup. this means that
                                    even during a power blackout, you still have electricity.






grid connected
                                
a grid connect photovoltaics system generates 100% clean electricity via panels on your roof. this electricity is used first for the needs of your household or building; then any excess is fed back into the power grid,
                                    potentially earning you credits from feed-in tariffs.












 abundant. accessible. affordable. 


















advantages & rebates







												federal government incentive 




                                            the renewable energy target is an australian government scheme designed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the electricity market, and to encourage the generation of electricity from sustainable and renewable sources. these incentives are managed
                                            under the small-scale (stcs) & large-scale (lgcs) renewable energy schemes. residential solar installations are covered by the small-scale scheme, which provides an upfront discount on the cost of a solar installation.

our impacts


global warming is one of the most pressing concerns of our time. at going solar, we are leading the transition towards renewable energy by providing solar power systems. according to the international energy agency (iea), we
                                must decarbonize our power sources at four times our current pace if we're to witness an evident decrease in carbon emissions by 2040.
 at going solar, we understand our responsibility towards our planet, our communities, and our customers. this commitment drives our sense of purpose to inspire the nation to commit themselves to a journey that leads to the
                                world's sustainable energy future. having worked on more than 500 projects and installing over 22,500 solar panels, we have saved over 93,650 mwh of energy and the stats are rising by the day.
                            
 we have placed sustainability at the heart of going solar, we're focused not on meeting industry benchmarks, but exceeding them and setting new ones. going solar considers the social and environmental impacts, and works hard
                                to make people’s lives healthier while supporting the fight against climate change.
