burn camp

parkland’s camps for young burn survivors
parkland’s burn camps allow children who have been hospitalized with burn injuries a chance to share time with others who face similar life-altering challenges.
when children who have been burned get to be around other burn survivors, their self-esteem is raised by people who accept them as they are. by offering young people the chance to interact with others who have been burned, they know they are not alone.
camp activities are offered in summer or winter and focus on letting children with burn injuries be just plain kids in a supportive environment. camp activities include fishing, canoeing, horseback riding, nature hikes, arts and crafts, cookouts, games and much more.
parkland’s camp is one of only 32 such camps nationwide that are designed to address issues specific to burn injuries.
summer camp

parkland’s annual summer camp is called camp i-thonka-chi, which is choctaw for “a place that makes one strong or fearless, not afraid to face life.” usually held the first week in june, camp i-thonka-chi offers a caring environment for young people who have experienced burn injuries. activities include swimming, fishing, boating, a ropes challenge course, horseback riding, sports, arts and crafts, water games and other special events. camp i-thonka-chi is held at camp john marc in meridian, texas, about 85 miles southwest of dallas in the peaceful, rolling hills of bosque county.


winter camp

in the winter, campers and counselors travel to steamboat springs, colorado to attend camp with winter activities including snowboarding and skiing as well as other group activities and programming.
who can attend?

parkland’s burn camps welcome youth who have been hospitalized with burn injuries, ages 6 to 18 years old. they do not have to be a parkland patient. each burn survivor camper may also bring one sibling, ages 6 to 18 years old.
camp is free thanks to generous donors and volunteers. transportation is provided from parkland hospital to camp and back.
if you would like to register, please fill out the camper application.
for more information about parkland’s burn camps, call 214-590-2920 or 1-800-850-1477.
