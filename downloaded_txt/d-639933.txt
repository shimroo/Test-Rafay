"my heart said unto thee, thy face, lord, will i seek." [psalm 27.8]"prosopon" is a word encountered many times in the greek bible. in one of its most common usages, it expresses the aspect of god turned toward the world—his countenance. in iconology, which is the attentiveness to the image of god, “prosopon" can thus be used to indicate the perceivable revelation of god. it can delineate all that which is subject to contemplation within the divinity of the triune god through the grace of his uncreated light. the divine prosopon can be seen as the archetype, revealed in jesus christ, to which all iconography aspires. "lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us" [psalm 4.6]
