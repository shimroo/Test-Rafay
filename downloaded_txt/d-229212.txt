						only been using ads for a little over a month now, but every single interaction with the company is extremely professional. they fix issues right away and are very responsive to any inquiries. their techs are friendly and helpful, as well.					


adam motz 






						we have had ads protect our home for over 14 years.  they are far superior to the two companies that we had before we moved to the chicago suburbs.  they have always contacted us in less than a minute when we have accidentally set off our alarm.  recently they contacted us to advise that one of our batteries was weak and needed replacement as they have done a couple of times before.  the technician, jose arrived as promised and quickly diagnosed what the real problem.  he ended up replacing both of batteries in our 2 controllers and replaced one of the controllers completely as an upgrade.  he was very courteous and cleaned up completely before leaving.  our radio backup has been great when we have had power failures and phone line problems.

						ads is a local company that we have used for fifteen years or so now. in that time we have had maybe a dozen alarms (all accidental, thankfully) and their response has always been perfect! their service is excellent. they do all of the work themselves, no subcontractors to worry about. we have always been more than satisfied and recommend this company to anyone contemplating installing a full service alarm system.					


colin c. campbell 






						exceptional customer service, on site professional technicians and russ was very polite explained all the issues, walked us through what he was planning to do to get the issue fixed. he was prompt on time, fast and provided an excellent service. we would recommend that choosing ads will be a long term best choice anyone can make.. they are the best in this service industry. invest your money in a company which pays dividends by form of their service.

    i have been with alarm detection services going on 16 years.  over that time, i have had some false alarms and even had the police show up on one occasion.
from the beginning with sales and installation every person we came in contact with was friendly, knowledgeable and quick to respond.
since, we have had to have routine service calls and again the service was excellent from customer service to the technician who was sent on the call.  every error made on our part was answered quickly with friendly responses.
i would highly recommend ads to family and friends with no reservations.
