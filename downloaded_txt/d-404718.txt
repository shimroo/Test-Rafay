	 dvd update
	 
    


yahoo! according to tvshowsondvd.com, the eighth season of charmed will enter stores on september 11th, 2007. take this with a grain of salt, though. this news isn't official. however, it's highly favorable. so mark you calenders and save your coins, the last season of charmed will be on dvd before you know it!p.s. no box art yet, but as soon as it's available, i'll post it.

	 connection
	 
    


every time i watch it's a connection. i remember from four years ago, when sword and the city was debuting on television. this season six episode was the episode holly found out that she was pregnant with her first born, finley. and every time i rewatch that episode, i make that connection. it might be why that episode is such a great one for me. why not? it was a huge time for holly. and as it is with all mothers-to-be, they instantly become this new and radiant person, which no doubt effected how i saw her as an actress and as a charmed one.are there any connections that you have with a charmed episode?recall: airdate of sword and the city was november 9, 2003.

	 one!
	 
    


yep! i've finally reached a year here at charming talk. i know that i haven't been that great at keeping the blog flying, but let's face it. i'm no charmed one. i'm not even a witch. just a devoted fan, who has lost her way.anyway. with this milestone, i've decided that i might try to restart my constant blogging here. don't know exactly what or when i'll do it, but i do have some ideas and thoughts that i'd like to share. so be patient and come visit!p.s. one year. oh, yeah! oh, yeah!note: icon borrowed.

	 yes and no!
	 
    


yes, i have received my seventh season of charmed. no, i don't like the menu screen. but, i'll live!wow. i haven't seen the seventh season since...what...two years ago. yes, i have some taped...no doubtably my favorites...but i haven't really rewatched the complete seventh season since it orbed onto the television two years ago. it's great by the way. some episodes are iffy and some are truly amazing. but what have they done to the menu screen? yes, i love the update of a main menu and an episode menu. plus, the box looks so pretty, so eloquent in its purple hues, but the menu screens are so wrong. they are definitely a rip off of the oversea boxset. that yellow and black is an exact match to their boxset. anyway. as i said, i'll live. i just wanted to type to let you all know that i'm still alive, still completely in love with charmed and still as buried with school as i ever was. also, i thought that i'd drop off some stills of the menu screens. just for those who haven't seen the shots yet!they're not bad, really. it just upsets me that they match the oversea boxset and not our boxset.okay. rant over! :)

	 season 7 out!
	 
    


wow. that seems really fast. it doesn't seem that season seven should be out now. but it could be that i haven't yet received my copy of the season seven boxset of charmed. i thought it came out later in february and decided to wait until my birthday to get it. turns out that it's one heck of a wait, seeing as how it hit store shelves on the seventh of this month. anyway. i just wanted to remind all about it and hope that you are enjoying each and every episode of the season.

	 s8 dvd news!!
	 
    


that's right. i have used my crystal and found some wonderful news about the upcoming season 8 dvd collection of charmed. unfortunately, my premonition powers have felled. i didn't receive any messages about the release date. i have, however, obtained information about the special features the cast and crew have brewed for the final season of charmed.according to thecharmedones.com..."on the charmed dvd front...there will be dvd extras on the charmed season 8 dvd's. fans have been persistent and now have been rewarded! the extras are interviews with some of the actors, and running commentary on an episode with brian krause and brad kern and interviews with some charmed fans."more specifically, the boxset will be magically bounded with three commentaries, a gag reel and featurettes. there will be (the power of) three featurettes: charmed: the mansion, the history of charmed: genesis and  the history of charmed: charmed again. wonderful news, huh? i think so! plus, it's pretty funny that there seems to be a repeat of the number three within the special features. long live charmed! long live the power of three!p.s. i'll post more news on the boxsets of charmed as soon as i can scry for them and orb them here.

	 it's off...
	 
    


...like two crooks in an armed-truck. there is no return. you are probably thinking..."what's off?" well, it's sad. so sad that i'm having difficulty even processing it.according to the (jan. 3rd) fox press release, the oc will have its series finale on february 22nd. yep. it's over after the eight unwatched episodes hit television airwaves starting tomorrow.*sob*"the o.c. season four finale will also be the series finale. this feels like the best time to bring the show to its close, said josh schwartz, creator and executive producer of the o.c. thanks to the hard work of our cast, crew and writers, we have enjoyed our best season yet, and what better time to go out than creatively on top. it has been an amazing experience and a great run. for a certain audience, at a certain time, the o.c. has meant something. for that we are grateful." *sob*what makes it worse is that my birthday is two days before the series finale. talk about the dark cloud looming over my day. *sigh*note: i'm so heartbroken that i'm posting it on all my blogs.

	 mondays just got a little better...
	 
    


you are probably wondering how mondays are getting better. well, the tnt network is making every monday a charmed monday. starting this past monday (dec. 1st), the "we know drama" network is giving charmed a four to nine slot on their schedule. that is a staight, five-hour magic marathon. the first monday featured the bad, bad, bad, bad world parts 1 & 2, something wicca this way goes...?, still charmed and kicking and malice in wonderland. and next monday is even hotter with there's something about leo, witchness protection, run, piper, run, desperate housewitches and rewitched. even with this magic mountain charmed feature, the tnt network will still keep charmed at its regular schedule slots during the week. every monday thru friday, charmed will be in repeats from 8 am to 10 am and 4 pm to 6 pm. to access the tnt site, click here.
