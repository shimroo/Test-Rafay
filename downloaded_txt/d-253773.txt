monkey jewelry





was there ever an animal more  amusing and probing than the monkey?  monkeys are clever, inventive,  mischievous, and have an insatiable curiosity. although often popular,  their ideas are seldom taken seriously, thus leading to the expression  “to monkey around”. this phrase illustrates the humor that the monkey  can bring to any situation; it is no wonder the monkey has become a  standard collector’s piece. their cleverness and versatility allow  them to be successful in many areas; however, by themselves, they can  get into a lot of trouble. their imagination can lead to good or evil. the monkey is a witty animal.  people used to compare it to an intelligent person. they are thereby  bestowed with auspicious meaning and have in the past appeared on pictures  pasted on walls and doors to predict good fortune. most people born  in the year of the monkey are vivacious, flexible, and multi talented.  they love moving and sports. to help others they put their own business  aside. when communicating, they do not like to be controlled and have  a strong desire to present themselves as unique individuals. in their  work, they will show amazing creativity.   here at skystone and silver  llc, were serious about our approach to designer monkey charms. but  we know how to have fun too, as illustrated in our full line of monkey  jewelry. from monkey pendants to monkey money clips and even monkey  key chains, we try to keep it as light as possible without losing focus  on our strict standards of high quality and customer satisfaction.  master jeweler, rick sindeband,  creates all of our monkey jewelry by hand. each and every piece is unique  and unavailable anywhere else.  sindeband’s monkey jewelry gets attention  from both silver collectors and monkey collectors alike.  people  all over the world have acquired pieces from the collection and are  sure to have their own unique meanings behind their love of monkey collectibles,  choose your favorite piece and make your own memories today! the posts in this blog are valid and we thank you for reading them. we have chosen to utilize a different blog format and so we have continued our blog at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/blog/. our website has access to most of our web published information at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/articles.html or always on our site map at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/storemap.html.

spoon rings





something old, something new, something borrowed...something old: sterling silver spoon rings are said to have originated in 17th century england. legends state that servants who could not afford wedding rings would steal silverware from manor houses, and in turn, make the stolen silverware into wedding rings. precious metal was out of reach for most servants during this time. spoon rings are an old-time tradition whose popularity has varied over the past 35 years.something new: the original sterling silver spoon is made into a spoon ring by using the spoon handle. the spoon portion of the silverware is cut from the handle portion, and with the handle, the jeweler uses various techniques to achieve the rings shape and size. sterling silver spoon rings can be very versatile, they almost always are adjustable to fit any ring finger and size. the original spoon becomes new when it is transformed into your ring!something borrowed: the old time wedding tradition of borrowing an item to symbolize longevity fits perfectly with our sterling silver spoon ring collection. our rose spoon ring, lily, sunflower, tulip, daffodil, and large flower spoon ring all come from aged silverware collections. each ring that is fabricated is done with one of our unique aged silverware pieces that we have acquired through the years. in turn, each new ring that is made is from a unique and beautiful borrowed silverware handle.spoon rings make great gifts for any occasion. brides, bridesmaids, maids of honor, best friends, or any special time when the gift you need has to be something unique and different. these rings are gifts that will be treasured forever.....http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/merchant2/merchant.mv?page=sky/ctgy/spnthe posts in this blog are valid and we thank you for reading them. we have chosen to utilize a different blog format and so we have continued our blog at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/blog/. our website has access to most of our web published information at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/articles.html or always on our site map at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/storemap.html.

peace sign jewelry





on march 18, 2003, lynn yaeger, of the village voice in new york city, included skystone and silver's peace sign jewelry to be ranked among the top online sectors selling peace sign goods during the start of the war.the article entitled "peace goods no blood for oil, and other fashion statements" went on to say:the fabulous surge of power and solidarity you feel when you attend a peace demonstration begins way before you get to the rally: it starts the minute you board the subway and see so many other people demo-bound too. there is nothing like the thrill of collective action, but if you're not wearing a symbol or a slogan somewhere on your body, how will everyone know you're headed to the same place they are?after all, the function of clothes isn't merely to keep you covered and warm—it's also to tell the world, before you even speak, what crowd you run with. in a season when more and more citizens are taking to the streets, many for the first time, we searched the internet for peace-themed merchandise, assuming that since the web has been instrumental in building the movement so quickly, it would probably also offer a wide assortment of anti-war accessories.the good news is, there is no lack of left-leaning merchandise online. the bad news? most of the slogans and symbols have taken up residence on the t-shirt, an item whose ubiquity has rendered it, at least in fashion terms, more than a little boring.of course, there are people who wouldn't be caught dead with a patch but who nevertheless want the world to know which side they're on. (if it's truly a mass movement, there ought to be at least a few dior coats and manolo's in the crowd.) for these types, we recommend http://skystoneandsilver.com, a site that offers sterling silver peace sign pendant, rings, lapel pins, and for capitalists against the war, even a money clip.these peace sign items are still as popular as ever and i am enjoying shipping them all over the world! feel free to take a look at my designs and let me know what you think @http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/merchant2/merchant.mv?page=sky/prod//classicpeacesignthe posts in this blog are valid and we thank you for reading them. we have chosen to utilize a different blog format and so we have continued our blog at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/blog/. our website has access to most of our web published information at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/articles.html or always on our site map at http://www.skystoneandsilver.com/storemap.html.
