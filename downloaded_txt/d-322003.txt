 looking to make a statement after a more than solid start to his career at the big a last summer when he ran a game second to gsw mentee (city of light), colloquial (vekoma– terminology, by bernardini) graduated over the same strip on friday afternoon and earned himself a 'tdn rising star' in the process.

tdn's racing editor steve sherack highlighted the initial effort by colloquial in his 'second chances' series in december. in the seventh race at aqueduct june 15, mentee looked in firm control at the quarter pole, but the george weaver trainee was in don't-quit-mode. with a final push, colloquial almost nailed fierceness's little full-brother at the wire and his figure came back as a promising 88.

taking a break since that debut and tabbed as the heavy favorite at 75 cents on the dollar here, the colt overcame a bobble out of the blocks and began to track one nine hundred (dialed in) up the backstretch. ranging up on his target with gusto around the far turn, the 3-year-old hit the accelerator and sailed by. colloquial sported a strong finishing kick and won by seven lengths. his preliminary beyer speed figure registered as an eye-catching 106.

a half-sister to msw stormin monarcho (monarchos), the winner's dam is responsible for 2-year-old filly one more guitar (bolt d'oro), who glen hill farm purchased for $275,000 during keeneland september. terminology foaled a colt by girvin last year and was entered in taiba's book for this season.
