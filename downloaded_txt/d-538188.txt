boston youth symphony orchestras
boston youth symphony orchestras (byso) is one of the most prestigious,
comprehensive, and remarkable youth orchestras in the nation. for over 65 years, musical
excellence has been at the heart of byso programming. each year byso auditions nearly
900 students and serves nearly 600 children, ages 4 through 18, from greater boston
and throughout new england. our programmatic scope includes three full symphonic
orchestras, two young string training orchestras, six chamber orchestras, a preparatory
wind ensemble, a chamber music program, and a nationally recognized training program
that provides rigorous instruction to students from underrepresented communities.
byso offer over 20 performances annually at some of bostonâs finest venues. bysoâs
premier orchestra has built an international presence with tours and performances in
renowned venues throughout the world.under the direction of mark miller, repertory orchestra (rep) is an advanced, full symphonic orchestra
composed of 107 players of great technical and musical ability. rep has performed at several prestigious
venues in greater boston including symphony hall, sanders theatre at harvard university, jordan hall at
new england conservatory, and the tsai performance center at boston university. all rep members begin
the season at byso camp, which is held at new england music camp (nemc) in sidney, maine. during the
season, all members participate in one of two chamber orchestras, repertory sinfonietta and repertory
camerata, in which they explore music of the classical period, including works by haydn, mozart, and
beethoven. by studying this repertoire in a chamber orchestra setting, rep members develop specific
techniques of ensemble playing and musical phrasing to a degree they may not otherwise experience
within the larger orchestra.


  
cape symphony youth orchestra
the cape symphony youth orchestra program (csyop) is a year-round program that consists of three levels of ensembles: cape symphony youth orchestra (advanced), repertory (intermediate), and debut (adv. beginner). each ensemble focuses on varying levels of musicianship and technique and aims to place students with similar ability together. all members of csyop will learn to rehearse and perform, like the cape symphony, exploring the beauty and intricacy of historyâs greatest compositions while continuing to grow their musicianship and technical ability. we welcome all young musicians who play orchestral instruments (up to age 21, generally) to audition for placement in one of our ensembles.the cape symphony youth orchestra is an advanced ensemble geared toward high school and college students. in this ensemble, members will rehearse together as a full symphony orchestra and prepare repertoire similar to that of a professional orchestra. our conductor, mark miller, has more than 30 years of experience working with talented youth orchestra musicians and is motivated to grow the cape symphony youth orchestra into an ensemble that will inspire and train the next generation of cape symphony musicians.it is our mission to inspire joy and we achieve that goal by sharing our love for music performance and education with the next generation of cape cod musicians.
