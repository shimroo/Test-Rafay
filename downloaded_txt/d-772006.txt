aboutthe riverside arts center is a regional anchor for creative practice and learning. home to galleries, artist studios, and a school that showcases the art of our time, rac serves as a hub for artistic exploration and community engagement. since 1993, the riverside arts center (rac) has been providing riverside, its surrounding suburbs and the city of chicago with vital arts programming. we host exhibitions, arts classes, special events, and celebrations of creativity. located in the heart of historic riverside, il, the rac includes the freeark gallery + sculpture garden, the flexspace, and a variety of studio spaces, including a renowned clay studio that has a full range of electric, raku and stoneware kilns.our missionthe riverside arts center strives to be the epicenter for contemporary art in the near west suburbs of chicago. through exhibitions, education, artist studios and public events, the rac is an advocate for the vital role the arts play in nurturing community, and amplifying diverse experiences, ideas, and backgrounds.equityriverside arts center is committed to equity & inclusion in all our programming, including our classrooms and exhibition spaces. through art, rac connects a community of artists, art lovers and students that extends from the residents of riverside to greater chicago and beyond. we treasure the diversity of the people we touch, and we welcome everyone. “art invites us to know beauty and to solicit it from even the most tragic of circumstances. art reminds us that we belong here. and if we serve, we last.”   --toni morrison
