the jackson local school district is again stark county's no. 1-ranked school district, in the latest rankings released by niche.com. jackson local's overall ranking in ohio improved to no. 31 and our ranking as one of ohio's best districts for student-athletes remains extremely high.
niche rankings
no. 31 in ohio (overall)
no. 7 out of 597 in ohio (student-athletes)
the niche rankings are a testament to the collaborating among our faculty, staff, students, parents and caregivers, and community stakeholders. thank you, polar bears!
