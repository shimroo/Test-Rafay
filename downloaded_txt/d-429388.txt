customers enjoy sunbeams from the heart!





 i
just happened to take a look at my collection of twelve romantic short stories
sunbeams from the heart on amazon, and saw this comment from amazon itself!
interesting!
“customers
enjoy the short stories in this collection. they find the stories delightful
and heartwarming, ideal for holiday reading or any time they want to feel
loved. the author develops each plot with care. ai-generated
from the text of customer reviews.”
sunbeams
from the heart is available on amazon and at other online book retailers in
paperback (regular and large print) and as an e-book. i think a few copies are
still available at logos, harbour bay, nassau. copies of sunbeams from the
heart make beautiful gifts! go to sunbeams from the heart

losing stuff when moving!





 amazing
things are always happening to erskine and me! this is the drawer of an old
bedside table that was in the spare room of our rental apartment when we moved
in. the drawer was stuck so i thought we hadn't put anything in it.
a
couple months after unpacking and stowing everything away, i needed one of my
two old address books but couldn't find the books anywhere. i thought they
would probably just turn up. however, recently i really needed one of them so
we went throughout the apartment, searching! we even tried to open the stuck
drawer several times. no luck, so we figured the address books couldn’t be in
there and didn’t try to open it again. then yesterday i decided to try the
stuck drawer one more time. as i approached the drawer, i saw that it seemed to
be very slightly ajar! i pulled on it and it opened easily right away! inside
were the missing address books! in all the unpacking and putting things away
after we moved in, somehow the drawer couldn't have been stuck at that time and
i must have placed them in there and then forgotten about them. strange though
how the drawer now managed to become unstuck all on its own!

season's greetings!





 this is an old photo from the mid-nineties when erskine and
i managed the islands club, oceanfront condominiums opposite quality food
store, cable beach, and next to what became the luxury bayroc condominiums. we
lived in a lovely little cottage on the grounds and this is the gorgeous beach
where the islands club was situated.
most of the residents back then were “snow birds”, who
flew down to the bahamas in the winter to escape the freezing cold weather in
the north. usually there were no owners in residence during the summer and
erskine was able to do his real estate broker work in his spare time. now the
islands club mostly has occupants year round.
i hope you are enjoying this special time of the year
wherever you are. merry christmas, happy holidays, happy hanukkah, joyeux
noël, feliz navidad….! may your holiday season and the new year be filled with
much joy, happiness and success.

history of a guitar





 one of our followers at on our tiktok platform asked: "i like your
music. where did you get your guitar?" my husband erskine has had many guitars (electric as
well as accoustic) but he bought this accoustic guitar from a music store in
davie, florida in the early nineties. it was made by hohner, one of the oldest
german guitar makers.

sinner man





"sinner man" is a traditional spiritual song
about a sinner trying to hide from divine justice on judgement day!
there are several versions going back to the one by
the les baxter orchestra in 1956, but it possibly originated from the spiritual
"no hiding place down here" recorded in 1928 by the old south
quartet.click here for sinner man
