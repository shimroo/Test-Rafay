⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
when i got a job in a british company, i was really nervous. i decided to take some english classes so that i would feel more confident and also to improve my fluency. my teacher, james, was very patient. he helped me to write better emails, he taught me lots of vocabulary relevant to my sector, and he helped me to prepare presentations for video conferencing. after one year, i find it much easier to write complex  emails and i have much better working conversations with my international colleagues.
