this was my first time moving my business and i didn't know what to expect. the team at toronto movers explained the process to me every step of the way. i couldn't be more satisfied with how they relocated my office and all of the equipment.

find answers and general relocation informationfrequently asked questions to help you understand the moving process.1. when is the best time to move?while the peak season in residential moving is in the summer and fall, the best time to move your home really depends on you. choose a time that lines up with your personal timeline – whether you’re closing on a new home, starting a new job, or planning around the school year.
2. how long does it take to move?most local moving in toronto can be done within just one or two days. if you have a larger home, more household items, or want to move certain things to multiple locations, this would extend the duration of your move. we’ll work with you to determine a schedule that works best.
3. how is the cost of my move determined?generally speaking, the cost is determined by the size of the move – the amount of stuff you have – and the distance. in some cases, additional complexity such as sensitive or oversized items, many flights of stairs, or other case-by-case factors can affect the total cost of relocation.
4. how and when should i pay?to ensure high integrity in the moving process, payment typically takes place before moving day. if you have specific needs relating to payment, please let us know and we’ll work with your particular circumstances.
5. can my possessions be stored temporarily?we partner with local facilities in the event you need storage in toronto as part of your household or commercial relocation.
