  why our audiences love us 
 


“spencer was absolutely spectacular. there are no words to describe his act. if you call it a comedy show, you are selling it short. if you call it a magic show, you are selling it short. even when calling it a combination of the two, you are still selling it short. spencer does a wonderful job of making you feel at home as he gives you an experience of a lifetime.”

— johayra b. 




“this was such a great show and performance. spencer is not only a craftsman in his trade, he’s talented and funny. i’m still scratching my head on some of his tricks.”

— rick s 




“this is the best magic show i’ve ever been to! spencer and his staff are incredible and make you feel at home.”

— claudia p.  




“i’m amazed. i had no idea that there was such a gem in south baltimore! i can’t say enough good things, but do yourself a favor and go to illusions.”

— janine t.
