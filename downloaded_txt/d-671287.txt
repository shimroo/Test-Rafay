                                 we had called other agencies and brian was the only one to seem interested in helping us. he called us back immediately and was very willing to help us find what we were looking for. not being very computer savvy, he talked us thru different issues with paperwork. as we were out of state,  he was very accommodating when we were unable because of health issues to make it down to look at properties... taking extra photos, videos etcbrian was awesome, if we ever need help again,  will definately give him a call and we have already given name and business number to others!brian has helped to make dreams come true! especially for the wife. can't thank him enough!

                                 brian took his time in listening to what we were looking for.  his extensive knowledge of the are was crucial for us since we were from out of town.  people are what makes a great experience.  brian's laid back attitude/personality was a perfect fit for us.  he is witty and easy to get along with.  i don't often make referrals, however, i will whole heartedly refer family and friends to brian if/when the need arises in the future. a++ agent.  thanks brian!
