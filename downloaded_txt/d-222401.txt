ten signs you might be a scrapbook addict
you know you’re a scrapbook addict when:
1. you decide what to wear each day based on what colors will coordinate with the scrapbook paper you plan to use to make today’s “a day in the life of” layout.
2. you get in a car accident and your first thought is, “oh goody! this is the perfect excuse to go to the scrapbook store and buy more paper, stickers and punches!”
3. you beg your husband to take you camping so you can use those adorable camping stickers you just got even though you hate camping.
4. your family frequently eats off of tv trays in the living room because the kitchen table is covered in your scrapbooking supplies.
5. you made your wedding or baby registry at hobby lobby or michael’s.
6. the only thing you have ever lied to your husband about is how much money you spend on scrapbooking supplies each week.
7. you go on a long trip only to realize you forgot your son’s diapers but remembered your camera and scrapbooking supplies.
8. you plan your children's birthday party themes around the coordinating stickers and pretty paper you have already purchased for your scrapbook.
9. you consider having more children just so you don’t have to waste your adorable baby themed papers and stickers.
10. the only time you consider stopping buying so many scrapbooking supplies is when you realize you’ve run out of places to hide them from your husband. then, you find new hiding places and keep buying.

3 things to consider when selecting the right scrapbooking class for you
scrapbooking classes can be a lot of fun. not only do you get to learn new tips and techniques, but you also get to make new friends and catch up on your scrapbooking. however, the key to having a blast at a scrapbooking class is finding the right class for you. here are three things to consider.
1. what you want to learn
not all scrapbooking classes teach the same concepts. start by figuring out what you would like to learn more about. you may want to learn basic scrapbooking tips and tricks or you may prefer to learn advanced photography for scrapbookers.
2. what classes are available
you will also want to consider which classes are even available to you. there are several places where you can find scrapbooking classes. see if your local scrapbooking store, community center or community college might be offering classes. if you cannot find the type of class you are looking for at a location near you, you can always look on the internet for online classes and tutorials.
3. which style you admire
scrapbookers are a creative bunch, and all scrapbookers have their own unique style. when looking for a class, consider the style of the person teaching it and try to find a teacher whose style is similar to yours or whose style you admire.
scrapbook classes are always fun no matter which one you attend, but you will get the most out of it if you find the one that is right for you.
