            breakfast is booming at us restaurants. is it also contributing to high egg prices?


feb 15, 2025


it’s a chicken-and-egg problem: restaurants are struggling with record-high u.s. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem. breakfast is booming at u.s. eateries. first watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. fast-food chains like starbucks and wendy's added more egg-filled breakfast items. in normal times, egg producers could meet the demand. but a bird flu outbreak that has forced them to slaughter their flocks is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. some restaurants like waffle house have added a surcharge to offset their costs.

            us eggs prices hit a record high of $4.95 and are likely to keep climbing


feb 13, 2025


egg prices have reached a record high in the u.s. the consumer price index released on wednesday confirmed what consumers, bakers and food companies already knew: an ongoing bird flu outbreak that began in 2022 are making eggs terribly expensive right now. the average price of a dozen grade a eggs in u.s. cities reached $4.95 in january, eclipsing the previous record of $4.82 set in january 2023. of course, that is only the nationwide average. a carton of eggs can cost $10 or more in some places. and specialized varieties, such as organic and cage-free eggs, are even more expensive.

            trump blames 'obsolete' us air traffic control system for the plane and chopper collision near dc


feb 7, 2025


president donald trump says he thinks last week’s deadly collision between a passenger jet and army helicopter wouldn't have happened if the u.s. had a more modern air traffic control computer system. trump said during an event at the capitol building thursday that “a lot of mistakes happened” on jan. 29 when an american airlines jet collided with an army helicopter as it was about to land at ronald reagan national airport near washington, d.c., killing all 67 people on board the two aircraft. he says the crash wouldn't have happened if the country's air traffic control computer system was newer, and that he plans to replace it.
