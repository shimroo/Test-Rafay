what is antiphospholipid syndrome (aps)?

aps is associated with recurrent clotting events (thrombosis), including premature stroke, repeated miscarriages, phlebitis, venous thrombosis, and pulmonary thromboembolism. it is also associated with low platelet or blood elements that prevent bleeding. recently, however, even more disease states have been linked with apl, including premature heart attack, migraine headaches, various cardiac valvular abnormalities, skin lesions, abnormal movement/chorea, diseases that mimic multiple sclerosis, vascular diseases of the eye that can lead to visual loss and blindness.

find a doctor

with the help of our medical advisory team, our forum members, and other aps patients, we have compiled a list of doctors who are familiar with aps and currently treat aps patients. the doctors on this list may not be “experts” in aps, but other aps patients have recommended them. the aps foundation of america, inc. does not endorse any of these doctors—they were suggested to us by others who have had luck with them. every aps case is unique, so you may not have the same positive experience. please be sure to call their office to inquire directly to ensure that they accept your health insurance and are accepting new patients.
