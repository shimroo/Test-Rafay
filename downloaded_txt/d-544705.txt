grammarandmore.com one of 2013's "top 101 best back-to-school websites"


		grammarandmore.com has been 
		named one of 2013's "top 101 best back-to-school websites" by 
		howtolearn.com. grammarandmore.com offers many resources to support not 
		only students who are heading back to school, but their parents and 
		teachers as well:

• hands-on 
		english: the english handbook that makes grammar visual -- 
		so that students can understand grammar and remember it. 
		easy-to-find, easy-to-understand information about usage, 
		capitalization, punctuation, writing, studying, and more helps students 
		complete their schoolwork efficiently and effectively, minimizing their 
		frustration and building their independence and confidence.

• tips for 
		success in school: two 
		dozen things parents can do to promote their children's school success. example: recognize 
		that there will be times when your child will be frustrated by a 
		difficult task. resist the temptation to solve the problem yourself. 
		your child will learn and grow from this experience and will emerge with 
		confidence to face the next challenge.

• improve kids' 
		reading: ways to help even reluctant readers develop 
		comprehension strategies -- possibly without a book in their hands. example: help 
		your child recognize that things are not equally important. even through 
		conversations not related to reading, help him identify relationships -- 
		similarities, opposites, sequence, cause, examples, etc.

• tips for 
		teaching writing: breaking a complex process into manageable parts. 
		for teachers, parents, and adult writers themselves. example: make writing enjoyable for 
		both you and your children. children are more likely 
		to enjoy writing when they understand the value of communication and can 
		share ideas they care about. they are more likely to enjoy writing when 
		frustration is minimized.

				to make the upcoming school 
		year more successful for the students in your life -- and more enjoyable 
		for you as well as for them -- treat yourself to hands-on 
		english, and explore the other resources 
		at grammarandmore.com.



grammarandmore offers a variety of resources to help you
enjoy english and use it effectively.


portico books,
our sponsor, offers products that take the mystery out of
grammar by using icons to represent parts of speech. for
example, a cube represents a noun, and a spring represents an
action verb. a paintbrush depicts an adjective because it can
change the appearance of a cube the way an adjective modifies
a noun. icons can be combined to show the components of
different kinds of sentences.


the icons are an integral part of all of portico books'
products -- from hands-on english, a concise handbook,
to hands-on sentences, a card game that helps develop
familiarity with parts of speech and skill in sentence
construction.


in addition to grammar, the hands-on english products and other
resources on our grammarandmore site will help you develop
skill in usage, punctuation, capitalization, spelling,
vocabulary, reading, and writing. these skills will help you
communicate more effectively.


our products, 
hands-on english, the activity book, hands-on
sentences, and hands-on icons were developed by fran hamilton, using her
years of "hands-on" classroom experience teaching students
about grammar and the effective use of language.

	grannie annie encourages students to share their stories with their extended 
	family and their community -- and to submit the stories to the grannie annie
