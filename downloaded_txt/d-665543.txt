                      most links now lead to the new website.


this is the website for and about quakers (the religious society of friends) in aotearoa new zealand. our worship is generally silent, with some spoken ministry. everyone is welcome at our worship. we are organised into nine monthly meeting areas, and you can access information for each of these from the map and list on the left of this page. you can expand the map to see the exact location of worship groups. quakers (we often refer to ourselves as "friends") are often involved in a range of current social issues.
our new website is now live. please contact your clerk if you have not received instructions on how to access it.
