camp images

official image site of
camp book ii
 
camp images was created
in 2005 with the purpose of being the repository for scans of bsa camp
patches.  it was hoped that collectors
would share their images for others to enjoy and to promote the collecting of
camp patches.
a side purpose of camp
images was to provide information on camp patches to the collecting community
and to promote the interest in others to start and maintain the history of
their camps before the history was lost due to consolidation of councils and
the physical loss of camps.
currently there is in excess of 16000 different scans of camp patches and
with over 3 million page hits we believe that our goals are being meet.
designated as the
official image site for camp book ii we hope to increase both the amount of
scans of camp patches available as well as providing additional information for
those seeking knowledge of the various bsa camps.
camp book ii is a
combined listing of bsa camps.  the
printed content of the camp book ii is in excess of 1000 pages.  for further information on the book and how
to obtain a copy in various formats click on the book icon.
