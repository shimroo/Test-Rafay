for peter pan on her 70th birthday“some say that as we grow up we become different people at different ages, but i don’t believe this. i think we remain the same throughout, merely passing in these years from one room to another, but always in the same house. if we unlock the rooms of the far past, we can look in and see ourselves beginning to become you and me.” sarah ruhl’s endearing look at siblings being called back to their own neverland 50 years later, as they face their own inevitable aging, the death of their father, and the dreamy allure of never growing up. performances february 7-16, 2025.
