        baseball for windows (apba) replay site 


i have replayed all major league baseball seasons from 1876 to 1989! 

      this project has been very fulfilling. i hope you enjoy the statistics
      i have provided.

      thank you apba and
      miller associates for many years of enjoyment. 
      thanks to the creators of norwood
      career database, 
      special thanks to ron bernier for his recaps program.

dad throwing 1st pitch at wrigley 09/02/07 




did you know this about dad...?




 on
        september 24, 1971 against the phillies, milt struck out the side on
        9 pitches? he whiffed greg luzinski, don money and mike anderson


 when
        milt retired in 1974 he ranked 20th all time amongst pitchers by belting
        20 lifetime homers


 milt
        won 209 games without winning 20 in one season


 milt
        won 99 games in the a.l., 110 in the n.l.. he would have been the 3rd
        pitcher to win 100 games in each league (joining cy young and jim bunning)
        at the time he retired.


 on
        september 2, 1972 against the padres, came within one batter of a perfect
        game? he retired the 28th batter to preserve his no hitter


 
      dad is in 4 hall of fames:
    ahepa hall of fame
    michigan sports hall of fame
    chicago sports hall of fame
    baltimore oriole hall of fame



 milt
        had a very similar lifetime record to that of hall of famer don drysdale?
