 june 7, 2023june 7, 2023  kevin harris



it's only fair to share...facebookgoogletwitterlinkedin
in the face of disturbing sexual harassment statistics, the importance of comprehensive workplace training has never been more apparent. particularly in california, where state laws have set robust requirements for workplace education. this post will focus on the specifics of implementing effective “sexual harassment training california”, emphasizing its role beyond mere compliance and its potential to enact real, positive change.

understanding california’s training requirements
under california’s senate bill 1343, employers with five or more employees must provide sexual harassment training california. supervisory employees require two hours of training, while non-supervisory employees need one hour, repeated every two years.
going beyond the mandate: comprehensive sexual harassment training
while meeting state requirements is critical, it should be the minimum standard. effective sexual harassment training should be comprehensive, addressing all forms of harassment, real-life scenarios, bystander intervention, and the process for reporting harassment. it should also be interactive and engaging, fostering open discussions rather than just being a one-way flow of information.
incorporating bystander intervention in training
bystander intervention is a powerful tool in preventing sexual harassment, teaching employees to recognize inappropriate behavior and take safe, effective action. incorporating this into training can help create a supportive, respectful workplace culture.
training as a part of a larger strategy
sexual harassment training should not exist in isolation; it should be a part of a broader strategy to prevent harassment. this includes clear policies, a safe and confidential reporting system, and a commitment from the top management to uphold a zero-tolerance approach towards harassment.
the role of regular refresher courses
regular refresher courses are crucial to keep the message fresh in employees’ minds and to update them on any changes in policies or laws. these courses can also address any questions or concerns that might have arisen since the previous training.

conclusion
when implemented effectively, “sexual harassment training california” has the potential to go beyond legal compliance, fostering a culture of respect and safety. it’s about building workplaces where employees don’t just know the rules, but understand and uphold them, contributing to a healthier, more productive work environment.

 how do they teach? 
there are so many platforms that offer the option of learning chinese online. you cannot lack a platform that works for you. these chinese online schools have levels to their teaching depending on what the learner wants. 
chinese language schools normally use hsk levels to assess the proficiency of non-native chinese speakers in chinese. hsk is an international standardized exam that is used to test chinese language proficiency among learners in their day to day lives. there are six hsk levels and the further you go the more fluent you are in the language. 
online schools, therefore, create their courses in a way that their levels of teaching enable their students to answer the levels of hsk tests. they divide their classes in such a way that you go from the basic levels to expert levels and for one to be considered an expert they should have gotten up to hsk (vi) 
they have a beginner course; here you will learn the basics of the chinese language like greetings and basic conversations. after comes the elementary course; where you get to expand your vocabulary from the basic greetings and directions. the next course is the conversational course; in this stage, you will focus on more advanced topics such as job-seeking which will equip you with more conversational skills. then is the intermediate where you polish your speaking skills and understanding with more advanced topics. another is the advanced course, here one reaches fluency and can comprehend high-level texts. last but not least, the expert level; here the learner will perfect their skills and will be able to make speeches in chinese, read magazine articles in complex chinese language, and even translate texts. 
how long are the courses? 
depending on what level you want to get to, the courses can take between 4 weeks to 12 weeks. each week one can pick a schedule that works for them. it could be two or three days every week for two hours each session. chinese is not very simple and therefore a lot of work is put into the learning process. therefore it may need more hours and more days as compared to other languages. each school has its methods of teaching so the time taken to learn the language may vary across different online schools. 
what are the charges? 
the charges vary. normally the schools charge per hour. the charges may be around $5 – $8 per hour. depending on the package one has chosen, one pays for the number of hours the package entails. if it is 6 hours per week for 12 weeks, and you are paying $8 per hour, then you have to pay $576 for the entire session. 
conclusion 
learning, especially that of foreign languages has been made very easy to access. just a few clicks and you are all set to start learning. if you have the means to pay to learn these languages then go for it. there is nothing you have to lose by learning a foreign language but actually, you have a lot of added advantage online classes in chinese by yi mandarin

private schools
all over the world, private schools have been developed by either individuals and in some cases, the church, in order to provide students a high-class education in comparison to public schooling. by definition, a private school is any school that does not receive any funding or guidance from the government and it has been defined as a school that is independent or non-governmental. unlike public broward county school, private schools carefully select their students as per their standards and you will find some holding tests for interested pupils to take. another key differentiator between a private school and a public school is that a private school depends wholly on their students paying tuition either fully or partially in order to receive an education. some have scholarship programs where a student gets in because they are really talented either in spots or art while some allow for tax credit scholarships.
school fees structures in private school
basically, when you join a private school, you are expected to pay tuition in full to cover your education. even mccarthy high school though some private schools have bursaries, the fees are usually higher than the ones charged by public schools, if any is being charged at all. most private schools justify the school fees by virtue of their location, the kind of teachers they have and also the kind of tuition they offer. of course, the ability of the parents to pay the school fees plays an important role.
students who get scholarships to private schools can end up paying no fee or paying a partial amount depending on their scholarship. scholarships are usually full or partial arch of miami and are strongly dependent on grades even if the student got in through sports, art or any other merit. if a student got in on a sports merit, for example, they would be expected to continue playing the sport in order to secure their position.
school fees in private schools are never the same and the above factors play a very important role. the classification of the private school could also affect how much the fees are. for example, there are private schools that owned by the church and their fees would be very different from those owned by individuals or other institutions.

types of private schools
when we talk about private schools, we are looking into primary and secondary school. colleges and universities are never really categorized when we look into private schools. in the uk and other commonwealth countries, the definition is applicable to private and secondary education which is then further categorized into other classifications that are either military or religious etc.
there are private schools that are boarding in nature meaning that they take students who board in the school. others are day schools and student report in every day. most private school students are expected to wear a uniform which is different from the public schools where students dress up as they please when attending classes. the uniform usually has a very distinctiveness to it that make its students stand out.
running of private schools
private schools are mostly run by independent structures which are free form the government. this could mean that they adopt a very different curriculum form the public schools or they could still adopt it and tweak it to their specifications. some private schools opt to completely overhaul the public school system and have their pupils learn using a different schooling system. even so, there are regulations set in place that see that private schools conduct their activities as per government standards.
private education is very different in different countries. in places like the us where the public education system is well developed, private schools don’t get a very high intake unlike counties like lebanon where private schooling has a very high intake due to the poor state of government-run public schools which seem to be deteriorating by the day.
private schools are found attractive by parents who can afford them because the student to teacher ratio is usually very low, the specialized attention given to a student can’t be ignored and also the curriculum teaching methods are usually different and more specialized when you compare to that found in public schools.

sharing containers have also been on the rise these days, especially when it comes to logistics of small quantities of goods. the ability to share resources has been a way to make the best of limited resources to come up a profit in business.
getting a container for a short while at a certain cost is one of the best ways to do logistics if you don?t own a container for yourself. one of the best scenarios is when you are importing a car. renting a container becomes the most viable option for this. there are different considerations that you have to check before taking this option.
a business will only be successful if you make a profit. this means that before you decide to make this option your way out you have to calculate the total cost, then subtract what you actually spend on the renting, insurance and the profit that you make. if the goods don?t cover these costs, then this is not the right venture for you. the value of the goods matter at lot. in this case, you could either look for a cheaper means of logistics, or you could consider sharing a container. renting is often done with the aim of making a killing out of the goods you are moving or if it?s a one-time thing like finally importing your dream car.

with this type of , you can carry any amount you wish to. you have total control of the logistics, and there are no conflicts of sharing costs as the only thing you owe someone is the fee for renting the container.
this is the alternative where you share the  regarding space and cost of logistics. it involves partitioning the shipping containers and getting your goods in your section. the total cost, including insurance and paying the container, is divided between you or among you depending on how many parties are in question.

choosing the right private school for your child can be a tall order for most parents. this is because every parent wants their child to have the best education available to them. besides, that private schools are also common in many places now and choosing amongst all those available can be confusing. here are some of the things that the parent can consider to ensure they get the best private school.
academics are the primary reason why you want your child to go to school. you want them to know how to count, read and write. therefore a school of choice should be able to provide these essential academic activities through subjects like math, languages like english or french, science, art and many other topics. besides just ensuring that these issues are being offered it is also important to check on the performance of the school in those subjects. schools usually keep production records and mean standard scores of the students in the tests carried out. such records are important in gauging the overall performance of the school.
extracurricular activities are important in ensuring that the talent of a child is well nurtured. it is in these activities that the students can participate in music, drama, games, sports and club memberships. these activities are important in keeping the child occupied beyond the classroom. they require extraordinary commitment from all the teachers, the school management, and the students. a school that performs well for instance in a certain sport can produce sports people and also can have a good reputation for itself.

it is important for the parent to consider the alumni of the are they involved in the school running and mentorship of the students? do they sponsor students and help nurture talents? having an active alumni association helps the school grow, and the students have people to look up to. the alumni of the school are also able to maintain the school traditions.
the teachers should be the required number to cater for the students. the private school should also be able to hire qualified teachers and keep them for long. the school is just as good as the teachers, so it is important for the private school to maintain qualified, adequate teachers. most of the schools will even go a step further and give their teachers the incentives to go back to university and get masters degrees. it is important for the teachers to be as knowledgeable as they can be in their teaching subjects.
