	 and there was anger at the fact that [catholic hospitals] can disregard medical issues for their religious beliefs
    


if you are a female patient in a catholic hospital your health does not matter. your life does not matter. neither does the medical standard of care. also, your needs, wishes, desires, and your family are irrelevant.

jessica mann is 33. her doctor suggested that due to the risk from an inoperable tumor in her brain, she should take pains to prevent future pregnancies after the birth of this baby, who is due next month. mann decided to have a tubal ligation while under anesthesia during the upcoming birth.

her hospital, however — genesys regional medical center — has refused to allow the procedure to take place on its premises.

“i was surprised and upset,” said mann. “and there was anger at the fact that they can disregard medical issues for their religious beliefs.”


as a pregnant patient in a catholic hospital you are just a uterine container at the mercy of  catholic bishops.

 

catholic hospitals are taking up a growing portion of the u.s. market share as provider networks grow and absorb other hospitals. according to a study by the aclu and public advocacy group mergerwatch, the number of catholic hospitals increased by 16 percent even as the overall number of hospitals in the country declined.

“by 2011, the report found, 10 percent of all acute-care hospitals were catholic-sponsored or -affiliated, representing about 1 in 9 hospital beds in the country,” wrote the post‘s sandhya somashekhar.





if you are a female patient stay away from catholic hospitals if at all possible. it is the only way to ensure you receive proper medical care.

	 domestic terrorists attack planned parenthood, again
    





(krem.com via ap) 

pullman, wash. (ap) — a pre-dawn blaze that heavily damaged a planned parenthood clinic was arson, fire investigators in washington state determined friday. 

pullman fire department investigator chris wehrung also said a task force involving local agencies was investigating with the help of federal agencies. he declined to release other details. 

 ... 

the fire started around 3:30 a.m. in the college town of pullman and may keep the clinic closed for a month or more, planned parenthood spokeswoman tanya riordan told the spokesman-review (http://bit.ly/1pqdfnr). 

the fbi and the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives are involved in the investigation because of the history of anti-abortion activists targeting health care providers offering abortion services, fbi special agent frank harrill said.

	 no more cheap plan b one-step on amazon
    









you can still buy plan b one-step, the 1 pill emergency contraceptive brand, on amazon. the current price is $46.90 and this might be the reason why:

it is normal for prices to vary from store to store, but such a steep drop in price raises red flags, especially since the wholesale acquisition cost (the cost for wholesalers to purchase the product from the manufacturer, teva women’s health) is estimated to be $32.50 for plan b one-step. wholesalers then sell the product for an estimated $39.00. therefore, it is highly unlikely that any amazon.com vendor would be able to acquire plan b one-step wholesale and sell it for $16 without taking a substantial financial hit.

	 what's wrong with this [gardasil] picture?
    





the ap reports on a story about a scientist who falsified aids vaccine research data. can you spot the glaring mistake? hint, above and below:






the human papillomavirus (hpv) and the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) are not one and the same. which is why gardasil, a quadrivalent hpv vaccine, has nothing to do with hiv and should not be used to illustrate an article about the hiv vaccine.
