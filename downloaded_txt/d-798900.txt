january 8, 2025
1-2pm
via zoom
presented by the scla intellectual freedom committee and the long island library resources council
this presentation will explore the limits of freedom of expression by looking at the works of several
“transgressive” artists. does their work have socially redeeming value or are these artists purposely
prurient, shocking, and socially subversive? who gets to decide whether these artists are given a platform or are cancelled?
presenter: william burns is a professor of english at suffolk county community college. his research
interests include transgressive art, alternative cultural movements, and post-modernism.
