aluminum tracks vs. plastic tracks
 


this is a rigid, tough, smooth 
				track. no plastic tubes, no strings or cords,
				no weights to hang and no flexible 
				lanes that need support between joints with pieces of wood like 
				other aluminum tracks. 
there is no stronger track!

				is a great

				great event for all ages!

and 
				it's convertible!


our unique design is the
		original all aluminum track.
		it's 
		strong, lightweight, and the joints are smooth due to our proprietary 
		extrusion design with 3/16" diameter registration pins between sections.  
		this ensures a fast and fair race. no more 
		"fast lanes" or cars jumping off halfway down the track.

we designed
		besttrack® with 
		cub scout® 
		and other organizations standards in mind. it has the standard
3-1/2" wide lane width with 1/4" high center guide rails. 
		notice that we cleared out the area in the middle of the rail for 
		additional ground clearance to help out the occasional scout who puts 
		his weights under his car. each lane interlocks with the next lane due 
		to our exclusive "nesting" ridges on the sides of the extrusions. end to 
		end registration is assured by  3/16" diameter registration dowel 
		pins at each joint. the most accurate alignment system available.
		
 
		rubber pads are 
		included to protect your floor and to provide a stable and secure race 
		track.  we can pre-punch your track for the most popular timer 
		systems, at no extra charge. please let us know if you don't want it 
		punched. (please note that we punch only the sensor holes. you may need 
		to drill additional holes to mount your timer.) 
contact 
		information
please call or e-mail 
		us for more information. please order early as delivery could take a 
		little longer during the busy season (october through april). get in 
		line for the finest pinewood derby® track available!
