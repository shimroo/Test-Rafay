continually representing and advocating for you during your dui caseas experienced orange county dui attorneys will attest, specialization is necessary to understand the nuances of dui charges and defenses. anyone seeking a dui defense attorney should consider these factors:though the most common of all offenses, dui is one of the most complex to understand and defend properly.the stakes in a dui case are high – higher in the long run than for most other crimes.a unique system of legal standards and procedures exists in dui cases, a system geared to facilitate a conviction.as knowledgeable and experienced california dui defense attorneys, we are aware of these factors, so they can properly defend clients. although a dui is common, it represents one of the most difficult criminal offenses to understand and litigate.



let’s analyze the primary issues in a dui case:what was the blood alcohol level in the defendant an hour or so prior to the analysis of a breath sample or blood sample?to what extent did alcohol chemically affect the brain tissue of the defendant, and in such a way as to “appreciably” impair his “judgment,” his motor reactions, and his coordination?what is meant by “appreciably” impaired?how does one define “judgment”?how is individual tolerance to alcohol measured?what effects do various drugs and medical conditions have on the metabolism of alcohol?is there any inherent error in breathalyzers?these issues can continue seemingly without end.make no mistake: dui is one of the most complex of all criminal charges, and defending a client on such a charge without extensive preparation constitutes nothing short of malpractice.another misconception commonly held by both clients and inexperienced  dui attorneys  is that the penalties for drunk driving are only minor. after all, isn’t dui only one step removed from a traffic citation? again, this is false.

we thoroughly understand the complexities of a dui defenseour decades of experience in defending clients in  dui arrests and loss of driving privileges means that we thoroughly understand the stresses and considerations of the people who come to us for help. driving under the influence of alcohol (dui) is the most common offense in the united states. as your award-winning dui attorneys in orange county, we approach our clients with kindness and understanding and fiercely advocate for their best outcome.the majority of people charged with a dui have little knowledge of the legal system because they have never been in trouble with the law before. noncriminal, respectable citizens are suddenly faced with charges that are more complicated than they realize, and attorneys who haven’t specialized in dui cases realize.representation of dui defendants is sometimes attempted by attorneys not versed in drunk driving defense. typically, the defendant’s business or family lawyer will undertake to represent him “as a favor”. this is not beneficial for the person charged with a dui.  drunk driving defense is way more than fighting a glorified traffic offense—and demands expertise beyond the defense of even the most violent crimes.


























"i would recommend this firm with no qualms!"
i received counsel in a sensitive legal matter from lawrence taylor sr., and his advice was spot on. i did some research and i also know that the senior mr. taylor is in the top echelon in his field. he has written text books on dui and he has taught the topic in law school.  i would recommend this firm with no qualms!

jerry s.























"i have come across many attorneys in my life and i have never been treated as well as i have her"
i have come across many attorneys in my life and i have never been treated as well as i have here. every phone call was returned in a timely and courteous manner. the first consultation was very professional, and my attorney chris patiently answered every question i had. in situations like this, responsiveness is key and this firm never left me feeling uninformed. i was very satisfied with the outcome of my case and would definitely recommend this firm to anyone in need of a dui defense attorney.

anthony d.























"this is a top level law firm. the bible of dui's comes from this firm!"
this is a top level law firm. the bible of dui's comes from this firm! these are the guys other attorneys call when they are stuck on a legal issue or need some guidance. there is no other firm or dui attorney that has the kind of experience these folks do. i have practiced for a long time, and can tell you that when these guys walk into court the clients will fair 1000% better! most attorneys do not have trial experience, and if your case must go that direction it's scary to see non experienced dui attorneys walking in with no experience.  not these guys. chris taylor is one of the best trial attorneys i have ever seen; and a force to be reckoned with.  the folks i have recommended have had nothing short of positive experiences. a dui is nothing short of stressful, and can have such an impact on a persons life between restricted or no driving privileges, classes, the cost, and the general stress of it all. this law firm handles all of these issues with such ease, and most important you know you are the most well represented client in any court or dmv hearing

"they will fight strategically to help you win your case."
these are the best lawyers in la/oc when it comes to dui cases. they will fight strategically to help you win your case. my attoney chris taylor was impeccable in many aspects; one he interrogated the officer causing him to fumble with his initial statement; two he is well respected within the courtroom; three he keeps you well informed with everything he is doing and what you may need to do. i can't be more pleased with the outcome of his performance. thank you god for taylor and taylor!

kendall l.























"chris not only got me down to a wet reckless but was able to significantly reduce the penalties i would face."
im am so glad that i read the reviews of taylor and taylor after my first "incident" and immediately contacted them.  chris was great at calming my nerves as this was my 1st offense and at a .06 it was right on the line on a trial or pleading it out.  chris not only got me down to a wet reckless but was able to significantly reduce the penalties i would face.  his whole office staff was also very helpful and he returned my calls when i had questions if not the same day, the next. i plan on having my record expunged and will be going back to him for that.  he attended all dmv and court hearings on my behalf which took a lot of stress off me.  i strongly recommend him.

suzi j.























"won dmv hearing and got my case expunged for a minor issue"
truly great team of lawyers. handled everything the very best they could. won dmv hearing and got my case expunged for a minor issue, so no record, as it should be! can definitely rely on them.

nick t.























"christopher always made me aware of what was going on with my hearings, and got me the best outcome possible."
when you need to get a lawyer, you aren't usually in a great situation. i wasn't at least.  christopher and his team never made me feel ashamed, they just help me get through a situation where sh*t happens. christopher always made me aware of what was going on with my hearings, and got me the best outcome possible. he made things easy to understand, helped with the paperwork, and i while i *hope* to not have to seek his services again, i would highly recommend him and his team for anyone needing a lawyer!

jessica s.























"thankfully mr. taylor was able to help fight my case without me ever having to go to court"
you should never drink and drive anywhere, but especially don't do it in la jolla! cops down here have nothing better to do then make your life miserable. it is also a college town which adds assault to injury. i should take my own advice because i was recently arrested for a dui down in la jolla. a friend of mine referred me to mr. taylor's office and i am extremely glad i got into contact with them. i hardly blew over the legal limit and did perfectly fine on the sobriety tests but still was arrested. thankfully mr. taylor was able to help fight my case without me ever having to go to court and i was able to have the charges dropped. extremely professional law firm with the experience to get you the results you want.

how to find a good dui attorney















what to expect from a drunk driving arrestdepending on the jurisdiction, of course, a first time ca dui offender may be:fined $1,500 and placed on probation, as a beginningin addition, the court and/or dmv may take his driver’s license, a license that may be critical to operating his business or performing his jobhis car may be impounded, or he may be required to have ignition “interlocks” placed in ithe will have to attend special dui schools, occasionally for a “fee” of hundreds of dollarsaccording to one dated study in auto club news-southern california, a convicted first offender’s average cost for bail, a dui defense attorney, treatment programs, and fines exceeds $5,000, assuming no accident. that figure is much higher todaymany jurisdictions now impose jail sentences for first offenders. on his second conviction he will almost certainly spend time in custody. this is not time served by a hardened con but by a terrified citizen totally unfamiliar with the callous penal system.already the person charged with dui has suffered more punishment than the majority of convicted felons dobut there is more: a convicted defendant will end up paying thousands of dollars over the next few years in increased auto insurance premiumshe is required by law to carry automobile insurance, but he is now a convicted drunk driver who falls into a high-risk category; his premiums will be far higher than those of a bank robber or murdererfurther, the client may be suffering from alcoholism. in effect, he may be criminally prosecuted and punished for having what is now recognized to be a medical (and possibly genetic) condition

questioning by an officer



if you have been pulled over for reckless driving or are stopped at a dui checkpoint, an officer might question you through an interrogation process.when conducting this process, an officer may not notify you with a miranda warning or the right to an attorney.your statements, known as “incriminating statements,” can later be used against you.



tests to detect intoxication



although the law does not require these tests, the officer could request you take a breath test in addition to several kinds of field sobriety tests.if an officer escorts you to the police station, it is probable you will be asked to take a breath or blood test.if you refuse, your license could be automatically suspended or you could face longer jail time.if your blood-alcohol content (bac) from a test is over 0.08%, the officer will confiscate your driver’s license and serve a “notice of suspension” form.



driver’s license suspensions and hearings



it is essential that you schedule your administrative hearing within ten days of your arrest date. if you do not schedule your hearing in this period of time, you lose the right to a hearing and potentially lose any opportunity to have the suspension “set aside.”the average license suspension for a first offense is approximately four months.if the hearing is lost, suspension starts thirty days after the arrest, when notified by mail.if you refuse a chemical test, the suspension will be one year.



criminal charges and consequences



the criminal charges for a driver are either driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs or driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.08% or higher.unless you refuse to submit to breath or blood testing, you can be charged with both.while you can be convicted of both charges, you can only be punished for one. dui penalties can be even harsher than a felony offense.dui legislation can be very complicated, so make sure to hire a dui defense attorney that has experience handling criminal offenses as well as dmv license suspensions and hearings.don’t hesitate to reach out to the law offices of taylor & taylor. we are here for you.



police evidence in drunk driving charges



driving symptoms: may include weaving in-and-out of lanes and reckless driving. make sure to visit the national highway traffic safety administration for a list of indicators.appearance and behavior: personal behavior and appearance play a major role in this category. alcohol on the breath, thick and/or slurred speech, flushed face, etc.field sobriety tests: alphabet recitation, the horizontal gaze nystagmus (following an object such as a pen or finger from side-to-side with your eyes), fingers-to-thumb, hand pat, etc. federal studies have shown that only three tests are effective in detecting intoxication: walk-and-turn, one-leg-stand, and nystagmus. other tests have been disapproved and deemed unreliable. as a result, three standardized field sobriety tests have been recommended and are being adopted by police agencies across the country. in california, however, police officers continue to administer tests of their choosing. contrary to popular belief, the tests are not required; you may refuse to take them with no legal consequences.incriminating statements: miranda warnings do not need to be given until after the arrest has been made. the officer is free to ask incriminating questions, prior to arrest, during their initial investigation.blood alcohol test: the test involves a choice of either breath or blood. note: the preliminary alcohol screening (pas) units, also called evidential portable alcohol systems (epas), are often given as part of the field sobriety tests, but not legally required (unless you are under 21 years of age) until after an arrest.
