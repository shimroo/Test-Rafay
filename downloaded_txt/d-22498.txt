a worldwide destination


dripping in the golden desert sun and spread across 335 acres in the heart of las vegas, unlv provides nowhere-else opportunities in this 24-hour metropolis. and while las vegas might be the center of it all, it doesn't take long to slip the
      bonds of this little oasis and get out into the desert, as we are just minutes from natural getaways and less than a day's drive from the entire american southwest.

hieu nguyen quote

"living in the international city of las vegas, i have experienced diverse cultures both on campus and around town. the opportunity to connect with people from around the world has made me more aware and understanding of traditions and ways of life. being culturally intelligent is especially beneficial in the hospitality industry."

hieu nguyen - major: hospitality management; hometown: hanoi, vietnam

rebels make it happen


here's the first thing to know about rebels: you can't define us. there is no “average” rebel. one third of our students are the first in their families to go to college. tagalog is one of the most-spoken second languages among our students. military times lists us as one of its best for vets. all that ripples throughout our campus. it creates a climate where you can both find your people and expand your worldview.
