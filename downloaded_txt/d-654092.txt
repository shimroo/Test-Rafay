background


the u.p.c. is today's most widely recognized barcode. it can be seen in every facet of the supply chain - from retailers to wholesalers to manufacturers to distributors. and yet, it is the one component of a supply chain that is - sadly - considered last when planning, implementing, or executing systems.
part of the problem lies in the fact that the gs1 (formerly the uniform code council) system of u.p.c.'s is voluntary in nature (required only by certain trading partners), and part of the problem exists because gs1 standards are numerous and not well known.
