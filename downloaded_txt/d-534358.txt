miller sellner
heavy equipment
miller sellner's roots go back to 1926 when evan implement was started. when owner art miller retired in 1963, international harvester insisted that the dealership move to sleepy eye. glennis "bud" miller, art's son, and norb sellner, a longtime mechanic at evan implement, went into business together in a brand new building on the south edge of sleepy eye. in 1997, miller sellner implement merged with darfur implement. the darfur implement facilities in darfur and windom were consolidated, and in 1998, a new facility was built in bingham lake. in 2012, miller sellner implement and equipment acquired slayton international. april 1, 2019 miller sellner acquired rabe international in fairmont, mn. today, the partnership continues as the third generation carries forward the traditions and customer service started by bud and norb. stop in today at one of our 4 locations - sleepy eye, bingham lake, slayton or fairmont, and check out what we have in stock for you. with over $8 million dollars in parts inventory, we are sure to have what you need. with over 25 parts personnel, you will be assured to receive friendly and courteous service in a timely manner. if the part isn't available from our inventory, we will get the part for you. we have access to check and see if another case ih dealer or one of case ih's parts depots would have the part within seconds.
