welcome to kenosha 
- a wisconsin harbor town -





picture a lakefront community with two lighthouses standing tall along miles of lake michigan shoreline. picture streetcars passing through a vibrant downtown filled with museums, boutique shops, restaurants, and public art. picture yourself in the middle of applause at an outdoor concert or theatre performance. picture scenic trails to bike, hike, and ski, as well as opportunities for fishing, golfing, and sailing. picture a destination that lies beyond the expected right in the heart of the midwest. picture your kenosha.
