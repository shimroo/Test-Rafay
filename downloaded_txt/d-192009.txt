why farmers markets? farmers markets serve communities all over oregon. over 136 farmers market locations operate throughout the state, and each has its own local flavor!farmers markets provide families of all income levels access to nutritious locally and regionally produced foods. more than 90 oregon markets accept snap benefits and other critical food assistance because we believe that fresh, healthy food is for everyone.farmers markets are small business incubators. data recently collected by ofma suggest that over half the vendors at a typical rural farmers market are brand-new entrepreneurs with less than three years of experience.




    2023 market data
  











 











did you know……only $0.15 on the dollar goes to farmers when you buy food at a grocery store? support your local farmers by shopping at the market, where they keep 100% of those dollars!…customers at farmers markets have 15 to 20 social interactions compared one to two at a  grocery store? farmers markets are great for their communities. visit your farmers market this week and chat with your neighbors.…farmers market food is way fresher than food from traditional retailers? farmers market fare averages half a day since harvest, compared to 13 days at a traditional retailer. that's a delicious reason to support your local farmers market!…the united states loses one acre of farmland every day? support the vendors at your local farmers market to help keep working lands in production! 














 

without thriving local economies, we have no food. without food, we have no community. food is essential and so are farmers markets.
