it came from the 70s

share:




the 1970s were a time of radical change in the field of ceramics. artists began to grasp clay’s potential when it came to conceptual art, minimalism, land art, performance art, and other movements of the era.
in the wake of the 1960s, artists felt free to use humor for self-expression, shock value, or to serve as a “spoonful of sugar” to deliver a message. while the 1970s are usually seen as a time of wild individual expression, the decade also saw the development of a network of galleries and collectors that would ultimately professionalize the field and develop grudging respect from the fine art world. it came from the 70s features groovy works from the everson collection that tell these stories.

simply simon: pottery from the collection of michael simon and susan roberts

share:




over the course of five decades, georgia-based potter michael simon’s name became synonymous with american functional pottery. simon was born in minnesota and studied with legendary pottery warren mackenzie. after building his own kiln near athens, georgia in 1980, simon began setting one exemplary piece from each kiln firing aside for posterity. these “pick of the kiln” pieces are a testimony to simon’s enduring influence on the field of ceramics.
in 2018, simon donated one of his favorite “pick of the kiln” vases to the everson’s permanent collection. with the vase came a donation of more than thirty functional pots by other artists that simon and his wife susan roberts had collected over the years. simon passed away in august of 2021, but left an immense legacy through his work, which now graces the collections of more than a twenty museums across the united states. the works exhibited in simply simon reflect the qualities that simon valued as a potter, while also illuminating his enduring relationships with his friends and colleagues.

at water's edge: reflections on 200 years of the erie canal

share:




2025 marks the 200th anniversary of the erie canal’s completion. the canal transformed new york state in the 19th century. today, eighty percent of the upstate population lives within twenty-five miles of the waterway, yet in much of the public’s imagination, the canal remains confined to the past. the 2024 erie canal artists-in-residence—alon koppel, judit german-heins, and clara riedlinger—each embarked on a year-long photographic exploration contemplating the canal’s current condition, activating the landscape, and considering the waterway’s lasting impacts on present-day american culture. at water’s edge: reflections on 200 years of the erie canal highlights the culmination of these artists’ projects.
at water’s edge is organized by the erie canal museum, syracuse, new york. the artist-in-residence program was created through a partnership between the new york state canal corporation and the erie canal museum in syracuse.
