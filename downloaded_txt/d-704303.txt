on behalf of corvette legends

the show was held on july 10, 
	2021, at the summit heritage park in canton, mi. this was our 18th annual 
	all corvette show.  the weather and the show was perfect mainly because our 
	club members turned out to work the many positions that make the show one of 
	the best around.  thank you for supporting our show.

camp a.b.l.e. is our state licensed summer camp 
designed for campers aged 8 to 14 years with disabilities.  for over 16 summers, 
this camp has been extremely successful and has set the precedent for 
therapeutic recreation camps to be modeled after throughout western wayne 
county.  participants take part in a variety of activities throughout the day, 
interacting with their peers, enhancing social skills, gross and fine motor 
skills, and gaining independence.  camp a.b.l.e. runs mondays thru fridays, and 
consists of three field trips per week (mondays, thursdays and fridays), with 
two days of specially planned activities at the camp site, and swimming at the 
summit aquatics center on tuesdays and wednesdays. for more information about 
camp a.b.l.e, please visit canton therapeutic recreation on face book or
