welcome















welcome primo incense lovers
as you probably know, primo incense has closed its doors. we are so grateful ourfriends at primo have referred their devoted customers to us at prasad gifts and promiseto take excellent care of you.
primo has made its recommendation for two reasons. the first is that our prasad celestial incense line is made by the same indian family that has made primo all these years, so you can expect the same exceptional quality incense you’ve enjoyed from primo, even though we packageour incense under our own prasad celestial incense label. (it's available in both 10 gram/10 stick prasad celestial packages and in 250 gram bulk packs.)
the second reason primo has sent you our way is prasad gifts’ 33-year tradition of treating ourcustomers like family. we truly are committed to your complete satisfaction.
we sincerely hope you will give us the opportunity to serve you.
wth warm regards,sandy and jonas magramprasad gift, inc.
