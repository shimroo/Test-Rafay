great service. big selection of fireplaces and fire pits. very knowledgeable and helpful! picked up a new set of fireplace logs and ordered an outdoor fire pit plate with igniter. ken was wonderful, informed me of all the options... i called a few other fireplace stores, but wasn't impressed. definitely highly recommend this place. don't listen to these other clowns bashing this place. if you're nice and polite, they will bend over backwards to help you. can't wait to recommend them to all my friends and family.– trav g.

after looking at and talking with a few fireplace companies in santa rosa, we went with malm because of their very helpful people, their options, their prices and especially the installer, lance. we just had them install a gas log set in our family room fireplace. this will work even during power outages which is exactly what we were looking for. they were great - definitely recommend!– nanci b.

this place is great. my 15 year old pellet stove's firebox burned through. discovering your igniter lying in your ash box on a cold rainy january evening is not a fun thing. trust me. i searched the web for the part number i found in the owner's manual, but the matches i came with pointed me to a whole different model of pellet stove. i gave malm a call as soon as they opened. not only did they point me in the right direction with the part, but they had it in stock for less than i had seen it online. i brought the old firebox and igniter up and we verified that they were a match. got that fire burning tonight. thank you malm fireplace center.– saill w.
