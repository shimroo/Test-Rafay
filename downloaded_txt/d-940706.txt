verse of the day




* * * four important things to know:

#1) for all (americans, muslims, jews, catholics, hindus, 
buddhist, asians, presbyterians, europeans, baptist, 
brazilians, mormons, methodist, french, etc.) have sinned 
& fall short of the glory of god.

#2) for the wages of above (see #1) are death (hell, eternal 
separation from god, & damnation) but the gift (free & at 
no charge to you) of god  (creator, jehovah, & trinity) is 
eternal life (heaven) through (in union with) jesus christ 
(god, lord, 2nd person of the trinity, messiah, prince of 
peace & savior of the world).

#3) for god so greatly loved & dearly prized the world 
(americans, muslims, jews, catholics, hindus, buddhist, 
asians, presbyterians, europeans, baptist, brazilians, 
mormons, methodist, french, etc.) that he even gave up 
his only begotten (unique) son, that whosoever (anyone, 
anywhere, anytime - while still living) believes  (trust in, 
relies on, clings to, depends completely on) him shall 
have eternal  (everlasting) life (heaven).

#4) jesus said: "i am the way, the truth, & the life. 
no one (male/female - american, muslim, jew, catholic, 
hindu, buddhist, asian, presbyterian, european, baptist, 
brazilian, mormons, methodist, french, etc. ) comes (arrives) 
to the father (with god in heaven) except by (through) 
me (no other name).

*** this wonderful loving god gives you the choice - - -
(rev. 3:20)

{please note that church membership, baptism, doing good 
things, etc. are not requirements for becoming a christian -
however they are great afterwards!!!}


*** jesus said, "wide is the gate and broad is the road that 
leads to destruction (hell, damnation, eternal punishment), 
and many enter through it.  but small is the gate and narrow 
the road that leads to life (heaven, eternal happiness, 
forever with god), and only a few find it.    





d i s c l a i m e r

if someone should ask if it's legal to download songs 
found on various non-commercial sites, such as this one.


well, i'm neither a lawyer nor a technician,
and i've begun to wonder if it was legal for
us to tape music off the radio back when
tape recorders first came into being.

and were we committing a crime when we recorded
a movie shown on tv with our vcrs? and was it
really legal to buy a dual-deck recorder for the
express purpose of duplicating cassettes?

my answer to all of the above is, "i don't know."

nonetheless, here is a formal statement in
some kind of legalize that appears to apply
to this kind of file availability:

the songs on this site are copyrighted by their respective artists and are placed here
