patient testimonials

thank you leanne for your prompt reply. my wife and i are very happy with monroe hospital. we were with the iu network and we have become very disappointed with their performance and service.i had an appointment today with dr. provaznik and was extremely pleased that he actually examined my eyes, ears, nose, and throat, heart and thrombotic pulse in my legs. i was pleasantly surprised by his kindness and thorough attention to my medical issues. he actually read my medical records and history.my wife and i both look forward to working with monroe network of professionals and hospital monitoring our health.great job again by our amazing staff. thank you for all you do.  we received fantastic care yesterday (sunday) in the er. nurse was bill but i don’t recall the dr’s name. my 5-year-old son fell face first on some ice while sledding and obviously needed stitches. from the time we left my home and got back home afterwards it was just over an hour. he was stitched up clean and the process was smooth from check in until we left. i can’t thank the providers enough for doing so well with my 5-year-old. it was our first time with an emergency like this for one of our kids and i’m so glad we came here. thank you!!!!!  i had to come into the er around 2:30am this morning for an allergic reaction. i had never had a reaction to anything before in my life, so i was very nervous. there was no wait, and they took us right in. nurse was kind and quick, doctor diagnosed me with hives and a minor allergic reaction. they gave me a few shots, asked if i had any questions and sent me on my way. great experience would return.  i go to monroe hospital for my mammograms, i love being able to get the 3d. dora robbins fleetwood did an exceptional job! she also was the one who did my foot x-ray in february that showed a fracture. i had been to other places and was told it was not broke. but she could tell by my pain that something really was wrong. she took the time to call my np to request a different view, she got the order, and it showed the fracture!! thank you so much dora for your kindness and caring concern. you are great!!!  i came in with my grandma with abdominal pain that had her crying. she was seen very quickly and they were quick to get her pain under control as well. she needed emergency exploratory surgery and came out of that very well. she is currently still there being monitored but everything went smoothly, and she feels much better! thank you for taking care of her!  i want to praise monroe hospital for their prompt care and kindness in treating a friend with a kidney stone. we were admitted, treated and released within 2 hours and the hospital was very busy. the staff, nurses and er physician were great. thank you
