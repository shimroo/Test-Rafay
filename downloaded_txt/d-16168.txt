our services

non-profit fundraisers















jks events has a true expertise in non-profit gala planning. we tackled our first benefit in 2001, and since then we have helped conceptualize and execute hundreds of non-profit events. we assist with all aspects of fundraiser planning, and have helped organizations produce their first annual fundraiser, and others, a seasoned gala that raised over a million dollars. we have managed non-profit luncheons for 300 guests, to sit-down dinners of over 1,000 guests. some of our specialties include: silent and live auctions, raffles, celebrity performances, and awards presentations.



corporate events















we have a sweet spot for corporate events. we take pride in our sense of style, and the ability to surpass any client’s expectations. we consult on new trends, venues, gift ideas, and party etiquette, and help our clients create the best event possible. whether you need to impress your clients with an appreciation party, blast the market with a new product, or simply thank your employees for a job well done, jks events can help create a memorable occasion that your guests will be talking about for years to come!



celebrations















we know that every social event takes on a life of its own. a wedding, mitzvah, or milestone birthday celebration, can appear to have endless details. this is where jks events comes in. whether it is deciding how far in advance to print the invitations to finding the perfect napkin ring for the occasion, we will be there to take care of every last request. no matter if you have two weeks, two months, or even two years to plan your special event, jks events will help you make it to the day with minimum stress and maximum enjoyment.



virtual events















hosting a virtual event requires the same care and attention as an in-person event. in both cases, we need to craft an event strategy to effectively promote the event, engage your attendees, create memorable moments for attendees, and prove event success. the only thing that’s missing is the venue and the attendees on-site. but, by thinking of virtual events not as small one-off presentations or as a webinar, but as value-added, engagement-driven experiences, you can create an impactful event that extends well-beyond a computer screen!
