past updates:
            some long overdue updates to the mono pacific            legend 
              *by popular demand - 
          added discography index




 


although the press would seem
              to have you believe his middle name is "[comma] son of
              ringo [comma]" and that he was plucked out the blue from
              an old "friends of moonie" address book for the who gigs,
              zak starkey actually has a long and varied list of credits to his
              name. chasing down his appearances has led me to discover (as well
              as re-discover) some terrific music. 
the information presented here is by no means
              definitive, or even guaranteed to be accurate! it is just an assemblage
              of bits & pieces of what i've stumbled across in my collecting,
              and i am always looking to fill in the blanks. so, if you have
              additions, corrections, encounters, pictures, articles, official
              bio's, etc, email
              me! also, please be sure to check out my wanted section.
