pioneering education for the deaf and hard of hearing












american school for the deaf









		founded in 1817, the american school for the deaf was the first permanent school for the deaf in the united states and a nationally renowned leader in providing comprehensive educational programs and services for deaf and hard-of-hearing students.

		the american school for the deaf strives to be an inclusive community that welcomes and celebrates diversity.  as a society, we have work to do in the fight against racial violence and discrimination.  asd maintains the fundamental principle that equity should prevail for all, and we uphold the school-wide values of respect, responsibility and safety.  as a learning community, we must engage in productive dialogue to combat systemic racism and social injustice.  by teaching the importance of equality, we will allow our students to grow into responsible citizens who will change the world – for the better.
