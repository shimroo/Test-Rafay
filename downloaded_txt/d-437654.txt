breast lift
breastlift, or mastopexy, is a surgical procedure to raise and reshape sagging breasts–at least, for a time. (no surgery can permanently delay the effects of gravity.) over the years, factors such as pregnancy, nursing, and the force of gravity take their toll on a woman’s breasts. as the skin loses its elasticity, the breasts often lose their shape and firmness and begin to sag. mastopexy can also reduce the size of the areola, the darker skin surrounding the nipple.

breast augmentation
breast augmentation involves using implants to create fuller breasts or to restore breasts that may have lost volume due to weight loss or from pregnancy. if you are unhappy with the size or shape of your breasts, augmentation surgery is a choice to consider. breast augmentation can increase the fullness and projection of your breasts, improve the balance and proportions of your figure and improve your self-image and self-confidence.

breast reduction
breast reduction, technically known as reduction mammoplasty, is designed for women with very large, pendulous breasts. these women may experience a variety of medical problems due to the size of the and excessive weight of the breasts-from back and neck pain and skin irritation to skeletal deformities and breathing problems.

candidates
when rhinoplasty is performed by a qualified plastic surgeon, complications are infrequent and usually minor. nevertheless, there is always a possibility of complications, including infection, nosebleed, or a reaction to the anesthesia. you can reduce your risks by closely following dr. kim’s instructions both before and after surgery.

planning for your surgery
good communication between you and your physician is essential. in your initial consultation, dr. kim will ask what you’d like your nose to look like, evaluate the structure of your nose and face, and discuss the possibilities with you. he will explain the factors that can influence the procedure and the results. these factors include the structure of your nasal bones and cartilage, the shape of your face, the thickness of your skin, your age, and your expectations.

the surgery
rhinoplasty usually takes an hour or two, though complicated procedures may take longer. during surgery the skin of the nose is separated from its supporting framework of bone and cartilage, which is then sculpted to the desired shape. the nature of the sculpting will depend on your problem and your surgeon’s preferred technique. each surgeon has his or her own way of performing the procedure. therefore it is important to view before and after photos to see if your doctors techniques tend to create your desired result.

recovery
dr. kim will give you more specific guidelines for gradually resuming your normal activities. it is recommended to avoid strenuous activity (jogging, swimming, bending, sexual relations-any activity that increases your blood pressure) for two to three weeks. avoid hitting or rubbing your nose, or getting it sunburned, for eight weeks. be gentle when washing your face and hair or using cosmetics.

im an out of town patient from san francisco area, and found dr. kim through his youtube videos. i was very picky when selecting a surgeon and didnt want to settle for any one but the best. making the trip to los angeles for my breast augmentation was definitely worth it. my breasts have such a perfect yet natural look to them and plus they feel amazing.
