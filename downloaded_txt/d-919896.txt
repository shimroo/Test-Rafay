last night, the board of education proudly recognized four exceptional individuals from washburn rural high school for their leadership, dedication, and positive impact. the honorees included junior conner schonlaw and staff members jessica morrissey, kaylee barber, and jessica luse.
conner schonlaw, recipient of the ‚ú®shining star award‚ú®, is an active participant in various sports programs, including unified bowling, basketball, and soccer. he is a dedicated three-year member of the boys basketball program, serving as team manager across all levels. beyond athletics, conner‚Äôs positivity and kindness have left a lasting impact. "affectionately known by all the guys as 'big c,'" said athletics director charlie nimz, "his infectious positivity and constant smile brighten the lives of everyone around him, and his kindness serves as a reminder that if we all treated everybody the way that conner does, the world would be a better place."
jessica morrissey was presented the ‚ú®all-star award‚ú® for  exemplifying the qualities of a top-tier classified staff member. known for her attention to detail, collaborative spirit, and unwavering reliability, jessica consistently delivers work of the highest standard. "her dependability is unmatched," said principal ed raines. "whether it's managing deadlines, coordinating complex schedules, or anticipating the needs of those she works with, jessica always handles everything with grace and efficiency."  her dedication, capability, and problem-solving skills inspire admiration and respect from all those around her, making her truly deserving of this recognition.
student council sponsors kaylee barber and jessica luse were also recognized with ‚ú®all-star awards‚ú®. "they are literally the cogs in the wheel," remarked assistant principal kelly younger, "ensuring every detail is meticulously planned and executed. from designing and facilitating events that bring our student body together to overseeing large scale gatherings that appear effortless, their dedication and hard work make it all possible." their relentless efforts foster kindness, build community, and inspire students to grow as responsible leaders who collaborate toward shared goals. their passion encourages students to think boldly and dream big. 
please join us in celebrating these bright stars for their extraordinary contributions!
