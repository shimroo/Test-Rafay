give yum!


















 
















when you feed orphaned kids, great things happen!rice bowls partners with loving, grass-roots children’s homes around the world to cover 100% of their delicious, locally sourced meals. the homes can then focus on loving, teaching, protecting, and providing for the children in their care. orphaned kids grow up to become chefs, software engineers, welders, doctors, teachers, ministers, marathon runners, and flat-out awesome human beings!

















































be a small part of something big!every single one of the kids we serve is a hero who has already overcome so much. rice bowls provides bite-size opportunities for people like you to help these heroes (and those who care for them) reach their potential.
