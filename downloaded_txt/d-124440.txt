some of our ladies at work...





we are a small garden center and apiary located in garden valley, ca. we also have an online store. we ship throughout the united states and its territories. we carry organic fertilizers, sprays, naturally grown plants, vegetables, and fruits for sale. in our garden center, we have plants suited for foothill and mountain gardening. deer resistance, cold tolerance, with dry, hot summers are some of the challenges california mountain gardening brings. flavorful fruits and vegetables, warm summer nights, and astounding beauty are some of the benefits of living here.we are also a resource for people from all over. we have an online store where much of what we carry here is available. we bring the same friendly, small-town ethos to our online business. whether you live in san francisco, new york, or the marianas islands, we will provide you with quick and efficient service.  go here to our amazon storefront. we have a vast knowledge base and invite you to take advantage. got a question for our horticulturalists? just ask!
