years of operationwe were incorporated as an educational, non-profit organization in october 1974. in our 45+ year history, there have been ten chieftains and the games have been held at eight locations in and around san diego. in 1984 we held our first two-day games, in balboa stadium (since demolished) to accommodate the united states interregional highland dance championships.
