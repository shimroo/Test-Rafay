  case study

 case study: quantitative hedge fund - powering an investment strategy with python-based derivatives pricers 

key to the fund’s alpha generation strategy is the ability to run high frequency backtests of their trading and investment ideas, so they can try them out under various scenarios before putting “real money” to work. the backtest environment needed to be easy to use and connect into python (their preferred programming language).
