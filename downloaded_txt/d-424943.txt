snu life
it feels like home. it‚Äôs our priority to create a place for you to connect. for some, this means hanging out in the comfortable residence halls, a visit over a hot cup of coffee at our campus coffee shop, laughs over lunch at the on-campus chick-fil-a¬Æ,  teaching a small group or leading chapel worship, maybe diving into student government. snu fosters a christian atmosphere where each student is valued. however you want to be engaged on campus, there‚Äôs a place for you.

meet abby rodriguez, a sophomore from oklahoma city majoring in elementary education! abby‚Äôs college journey at snu has been filled with meaningful connections, and she credits her friends and faculty for making her feel right at home. she feels especially grateful for the professors and staff who have gone the extra mile to make her feel valued, whether that is through meaningful conversations or even getting lunch together.‚Äúi‚Äôve made lifelong friends here, and i‚Äôm so thankful for the community,‚Äù abby shares. ‚Äúwhether it‚Äôs just a cozy game night in the dorms or grabbing a sweet treat after class, those moments make college life so special for me.‚Äùgrowing up in oklahoma city, with both her parents serving as pastors, it was not until the summer before her freshman year of college that abby truly began to embrace a personal relationship with god. despite being surrounded by faith, she struggled with self-doubt and questions throughout her high school years. her journey truly began when abby decided to lay down all her fears and uncertainties before god.‚Äúi was filled with doubt during my senior year of high school, but when i finally chose to give it all to god, i started to change,‚Äù she shares. ‚Äúi became so curious about who god is and how he sees me. that moment shifted everything, and i never looked back.‚Äùas abby continues her studies at snu, her faith has grown stronger, and she has learned to trust god‚Äôs plan for her life. ‚Äúi‚Äôm constantly amazed by how god works in my life. my time at snu has been a beautiful growth journey, and i‚Äôm excited to see where he takes me next.‚Äù abby‚Äôs passion for teaching, her heart for others, and her growing relationship with god continue to shape her future in ways she never imagined.thank you, abby, for being such a light on campus. we are so thankful to have you as part of our snu family!
