for over 50 years ed brown has set the standard for the highest quality 1911 parts and handguns. so what happens when we apply our philosophy and experience to other handgun platforms? they become fueled® by ed brown.
the first platform of choice for this series is the smith & wesson m&p 2.0. available in four different options we broke this platform down to its foundation and applied our lifetime of experience to redesign and remanufacture each of its key components.
i have some awesome new guns, i can't wait for you to show me what they can do what do. what do you got because i've got some drills for us to run. i've got the new m&p's fueled® by ed brown series. they're so awesome!
i'm bri van scotter. i'm a professional chef, hunter and all-around gun enthusiast. today i'm going to spend some time downrange with my good friend ian who's going to give me some tips and tricks on gun speed and accuracy and we're going to do some drills.
my name is ian matthews. i'm currently in the army. i'm a staff sergeant. i'm a financial management technician, so think of me like a mobile banker. when we go overseas we carry around large sums of cash so we have to be discreet with how we protect that cash so we carry sidearms. so because of my background i train other people as a squad leader and i've helped train friends and family as well.
here it is. let's see it. tell me what you think. all this talk on the way down here, it's got me excited. i've seen them. i think they're pretty badass. yeah this is that rmr cut you were talking about. the trijicon sight.
so i'm out here, we're gonna do some pistol training. we're gonna shoot the ed brown series m&p's. we're going to focus on some target shooting and then we're going to go over to the steels to work on some speed and transitions. i'm really excited about it because i personally enjoy training people on firearms.
all black beauty right there. yep there you, go back in black, you know. all right so this has that that flat trigger you were talking about earlier. i like this so as i'm playing with these you don't get a lot of rattle that you do the some. yeah. i'm pretty excited because i like m&p's a lot. i own one. i recommend them to friends, so it's cool to see companies taking them to the next level. i'm excited to see what they can do.
all right there we go remember what i showed you? yep. all right thumb over this hand right there yeah wrist locked elbows bent. oh! that's okay, that's why we're here, we're gonna practice. it looked like you got a little excited with the trigger. it looked like you went through that wall really quick. it was an easy trigger and i'm pulling a little too hard on it. it is but that's okay. i'm gonna go to the wall yup like you said and then just snap it. i'm gonna snap it. yep. let's do this. all right let's go. look at that, that's a ten ring.
far beyond gunsmithing to be fueled® by ed brown the m&p pistol is broken down to its foundation for a complete overhaul. at its core is the custom accuracy rail which improves barrel lockup and accuracy allowing for an exceptional fit of the slide frame and barrel. next is the threaded stainless button rifled match barrel customized with ed brown tread flutes and custom thread protector. combining that with suppressor height sights makes it fully suppressor ready.
all right let's go let's. compress out go to the wall. yep. your support hand and your grip is good. look at that that's another ten ring. good job. the slide is fully machined from 17 4 stainless with custom cuts dehorned and treated with a black nitride or stainless finish to give you the hottest custom polymer pistol on the range. designed for a unique and striking appearance while maintaining functionality, the slide is beefed up in all the right areas and ready for hard use. each slide is cut for the trijicon rmr and includes a matching cover plate. so what we're going to do is we're going to engage the target on the left with two rounds and then we're going to shift over to the target on our right and engage that with two rounds. you're going to present and then you're going to drive with your hips and your eyes the gun over to the right target. so in a handgun i'm looking at the red dot sight. i'm looking at the trigger. i like a light trigger, i don't want something that i really have to put a lot of time and effort to to get to the wall or a rolling trigger that is seven pound. i think a trigger should be light but firm so something around the three to four pound range is preferred to me.
ed brown uses a custom flat face trigger for the fueled® series. a fine upgrade to any m&p. topping off the slide is the ameriglo pro glow tritium front sight and plain black rear both in suppressor ready height to make them co-witness with trijicon's rmr reflex sight. a redesigned and re-engineered custom extractor mates perfectly to the custom slide ensuring the best reliability possible. the 360 degree mag well paired with machined base pads make for lightning fast reloads allowing for two extra rounds in the magazine.
the combination of the perfectly machined rail machined trigger pin and a custom trigger give you exceptional performance and reliability. final details like machined frame pins and its aluminum back plate with custom serrations help complete the package.
you're going to present and then you're going to drive with your hips and your eyes got your gun over to the right target. okay. you don't let the gun drive you you drive the gun all right harder the target. gotcha. anybody can pick up a gun and with enough training be proficient with that gun but that gun has to be comfortable in your hand. there you go look at that a-zone. there you go a-zone again. the fueled® series is available in four options the mp-f1 finished in black nitride, the mp-f2 features a spectrum multi-colored barrel, the mp-f3 is two-tone with a stainless steel slide and the mp-f4 with a golden titanium nitride barrel. each one has all the features and quality only ed brown can deliver.
i really liked it. i want to add some parts to my own for it. the slide cut is awesome, it's very well done. the tolerances are tight for the rmr. the trigger is very solid the wall is crisp and it's distinct and then it snaps really easy to allow precision shots. the accuracy rail which they're which they engineered is awesome. in addition to the new fueled® m&p pistols, a full line of fully machined parts and accessories are available for your m&p and m&p 2.0.
so you like the all black and that's the one you pick to shoot but we both talked about how you like the gold. i think i'm going to customize it with that gold barrel. right i think that's a nice little touch. yeah so what about you? you own? so i do own one of these yeah. yeah so you're going to jazz it up with some ed brown now? i think i might. so what's going to be your first purchase? definitely the slide and the mag well and then i'll probably go with the barrel.
shooting with you was so much fun today. i loved all the pointers you gave me. shooting these m&p's was a blast it was. so let's definitely get another range day on the books. let's do it. thank you for bringing them out.
if you want to get the most from an m&p, make sure it is fueled® by ed brown.
