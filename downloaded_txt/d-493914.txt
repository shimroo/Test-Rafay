this is how it came to pass...


jan. 9th, 2007 at 9:32 pm



 


thepixieinsidein ancient israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of abraham comdid take unto himself a young wife by the name of dot. and dot com was acomely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. indeed, she had been called amazon dot com.and she said unto abraham, her husband: "why dost thou travel far from town to town with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?"and abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said: "how, dear?"and dot replied: "i will place drums in all the towns and drums in betweento send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. and the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by uriah's pony stable (ups)."abraham thought long and decided he would let dot have her way with the drums.and the drums rang out and were an immediate success. abraham sold all thegoods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent.but this success did arouse envy. a man named maccabia did secrete (look itup, it means to hide) himself inside abraham's drum and was accused ofinsider trading.and the young men did take to dot com's trading as doth the greedy horseflytake to camel dung. they were called nomadic ecclesiastical rich dominicansiderites, or nerds for short. and lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that thereal riches were going to the drum maker, one brother william of gates, whobought up every drum company in the land. and indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with brother gates' drumheads and drumsticks.and dot did say: "oh, abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."and as abraham looked out over the bay of ezekiel, or ebay as it came to beknown, he said: "we need a name that reflects what we are."and dot replied: "young ambitious hebrew owner operators." "yahoo," saidabraham.and that is how it all began.and thank you, lady_j_usa for that! ;)

first read of 2007!!!


jan. 2nd, 2007 at 5:04 pm



 


thepixieinsidebook #1 book title: darkly dreaming dexter author: jeff lindsaygenre: mystery# of pages: 288my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: b- short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): meet dexter morgan. he's a highly respected lab technician specializing in blood spatter for the miami dade police department. he's a handsome, though reluctant, ladies' man. he's polite, says all the right things, and rarely calls attention to himself. he's also a sociopathic serial killer whose "dark passenger" drives him to commit the occasional dismemberment.mind you, dexter's the good guy in this story.adopted at the age of four after an unnamed tragedy left him orphaned, dexter's learned, with help from his pragmatic policeman father, to channel his "gift," killing only those who deal in death themselves. but when a new serial killer starts working in miami, staging elaborately grisly scenes that are, to dexter, an obvious attempt at communication from one monster to another, the eponymous protagonist finds himself at a loss. should he help his policewoman sister deborah earn a promotion to the homicide desk by finding the fiend? or should he locate this new killer himself, so he can express his admiration for the other's "art?" or is it possible that psycho dexter himself, admittedly not the most balanced of fellows, is finally going completely insane and committing these messy crimes himself?despite his penchant for vivisection, it's hard not to like dexter as his coldly logical personality struggles to emulate emotions he doesn't feel and to keep up his appearance as a caring, unremarkable human being. breakout author jeff lindsay's plot is tense and absorbing, but it's the voice of dexter and his reactions to the other characters that will keep readers glued to darkly dreaming dexter, as well as making it one of the most original and highly recommended serial killer stories in a long time.my thoughts: i loved the beginning of this book. i really like dexter. the story, as it got closer to the end, really disappointed me. the end was just not what i expected. however, that being said, i really do want to watch the show and think i will give it a chance!currently reading: i am about to start the pursuit of happyness by chris gardnerx-posted to my book community, bookz_n_07 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

shortly after ‘spices epigonic nitpicky reexpel coevally sags’s release in december 2006, thepixieinside received a death threat from the pope who warmed them that if they released such unadultured shite in the future they would disappear in the night.

killing kittens member profiles

thecolornine thanks to thecolornine less than heavenly vocals, listening to a killing kittens record will take 10 years off your life. 
g0ldenr0ad</p> to g0ldenr0ad, chords are merely a fashion accessory. literally. according to recent insider reports they own about 100 pairs of them.


allykatt87 it is fair to say that allykatt87 is a stroppy old bastard. they’ve threatened to pack killing kittens in after they received a death threat from the ghost of mother thersea who reportedly said in a whispered tone “i’m trying to rest in piece here yer prick! cut with the bollocks before i smear yer pod in shite!”
thetinydemon thetinydemon cannot drum for shit and should quit before a wise man trolleys them in the head with a well-placed bullet.


osnadurtha learning your trade from a withered old church organist is one thing osnadurtha, but fucking her on the altar is something else altogether!

thepixieinsidebook #80 book title: next author: michael crichtongenre: sci-fi# of pages: 415my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: b- short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com):  welcome to our genetic world.fast, furious, and out of control.this is not the world of the future--it's the world right now.is a loved one missing some body parts? are blondes becoming extinct? is everyone at your dinner table of the same species? humans and chimpanzees differ in only 400 genes; is that why an adult human being resembles a chimp fetus? and should that worry us? there's a new genetic cure for drug addiction--is it worse than the disease?we live in a time of momentous scientific leaps; a time when it's possible to sell our eggs and sperm online for thousands of dollars; test our spouses for genetic maladies and even frame someone for a genetic crime.we live in a time when one fifth of all our genes are owned by someone else, and an unsuspecting person and his family can be pursued cross-country because they happen to have certain valuable genes within their chromosomes. . . .devilishly clever, next blends fact and fiction into a breathless tale of a new world where nothing is what it seems, and a set of new possibilities can open at every turn. next challenges our sense of reality and notions of morality. balancing the comic and bizarre with the genuinely frightening and disturbing, next shatters our assumptions, and reveals shocking new choices where we least expect.the future is closer than you think. get used to it. my thoughts: the beginning of this read was interesting, but after about the first half, the story just didn't seem to come together. imo, i thought that there were way too much sub-plots going on at the same time, and the read (at times) got to be a bit on the tedious side. i had to give it a b- though for its effort. plus, i really do like michael crichton... book #81 book title: the myth of you & me author: leah stewartgenre: fiction# of pages: 276my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: c short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): stewart peers into the complicated heart of friendship in a moving second novel (after 2000's body of a girl). ever since a cataclysmic falling out with her best friend, sonia, after college, cameron's closest companion has been oliver, the 92-year-old historian she lives with and cares for in oxford, miss. oliver's death leaves cameron alone and adrift, until she discovers that he has given her one last task: she must track down her estranged best friend (whose letter announcing her engagement cameron had so recently ignored) and deliver a mysterious present to her. cameron's journey leads her back to the people, places and memories of their shared past, when they called themselves "cameronia" and swore to be friends forever. it was a relationship more powerful than romantic love—yet romantic love (or sex, anyway) could still wreck it. stewart lures the reader forward with two unanswered questions: what was the disaster that ended their friendship, and what will be revealed when cameron and sonia are together again and oliver's package is finally opened? the book is heartfelt and its characters believable jigsaw puzzles of insecurities, talents and secrets, and if cameron's carefully guarded anger makes her occasionally disagreeable, readers will nevertheless welcome her happy ending.my thoughts: well, to be honest, it seems that there was not much of a story here. it really did have potential, but the story seemed to fizzle, especially when the reader finds out why cameron is no longer sonia's friend...it was disappointing! anyways, the plus side was the style in which this novel was written. i would like to read her other work, if i knew it had a better plotline to it.currently reading: darkly dreaming dexter by jeff lindsayx-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

thepixieinsidebook #78 book title: shadowmancer author: g.p. taylorgenre: fiction# of pages: 275my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: b+ short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): an apocalyptic battle between good and evil is vigorously, violentlyfought in british author g.p. taylor's suspenseful, action-packedfantasy. the story, set in the 1700s on the yorkshire coastline,revolves around vicar obadiah demurral, a corrupt-but-inept,dead-conjuring "shadowmancer" who desires to control the universe byoverthrowing god, or riathamus. when two hard-luck near-orphans,(13-year-old thomas barrick, a bitter enemy of demurral, and histroubled friend kate coglund) band together with a young african stranger named raphah, they spend the rest of the book trying to stopthe wicked vicar as if their very souls are at stake...they are. alongthe way, the three youths meet an enormous cast of friends and foes,some agents of riathamus, others of satan (pyratheon), and some godless(but not for long) smugglers like jacob crane.readers who love fanciful storybook characters will find mermaidlikeseloth, smelly hobs, leg-dragging servants, goodhearted whores, andbenevolent boggles. age-old superstitions abound, though old magic andwitchcraft are clearly denounced here as the work of the devil. indeed,the author, an english vicar himself, tells a very christian story andhis often deliciously dramatic adventure lapses into stiffly presentedglowing-halo touched by an angel moments(readers will be lured  into the enchanted forest, but tricked into sunday school). nonetheless,  shadowmancer,the first of a series, is a pageturner bursting with magic and myth,and will appeal to fantasy lovers who don't mind the bible mixed inwith their boggles.my thoughts: this was a different kind of fantasy novel! it was christian-based, which i was pleasantly surprised by! the only problem was that the characters did not seem to be developed very well. overall though, it was a very enjoyable read.book #79 book title: the notebook author: nicholas sparksgenre: fiction# of pages: 256my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: c short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): "somewhere," muses noah calhoun, while sitting on his porch in themoonight, "there were people making love." anyway, head elsewhere forgreat literature, but if you're in the market to get your heartstringsplucked, look no further. the notebook,a southern-fried story of love-lost-and-found-again, revolves around asingle time-honored romantic dilemma: will beautiful allison nelsonstay with mr. respectability (to whom she happens to be engaged), orwill she hook up with noah, the romantic rascal she left so many yearsago? we're not telling, but you have two guesses and the first onedoesn't count. decades later, after allison develops alzheimer's, herbeau uses "the notebook" to read her the story of the great love she'splumb forgot. the notebook--film rights already sold, thank youvery much--is a little glazed doughnut of a book: sticky- sweet,satisfying, not much nourishment. but who cares? take an extra vitaminand indulge.my thoughts: i usually really like sparks' novels, but this one was just too sappy even for me! the writing style was great, but it just didn't live up to what i expected it to be.currently reading: ireland by frank delaneyx-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

one for the money


nov. 15th, 2006 at 7:05 pm



 


thepixieinsidebook #77 book title: one for the money author: janet evanovichgenre: fiction# of pages: 320my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: a+ short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): first novels this funny and self-assured come along rarely; dialoguethis astute and raunchy is equally unusual. the gutsy heroineintroduced here is stephanie plum of trenton, n.j., a recently laid-offlingerie buyer who has no job, no car and no furniture. she does have ahamster, a deranged grandmother, two caring parents and several pairsof biking shorts and sports bras. finding work with her cousin vinnie,she becomes a bond hunter and scrounges money enough to buy a gun, achevy nova and some mace. her first assignment is to locate a copaccused of murder. joe morelli grew up in stephanie's neighborhood.possessed of legendary charm, he relieved stephanie of her virginitywhen she was 16 (she later ran over him with a car). in her search,stephanie catches her prey, loses him and grills a psychoticprizefighter, the employer of the man morelli shot. she stealsmorelli's car and then installs an alarm so he can't steal it back.resourceful and tough, stephanie has less difficulty finding her manthan deciding what she wants to do with him once she's got him. whilethe link between the fighter and the cop isn't clear until too late inthe plot, evanovich's debut is a delightful romp and stephanie flauntsa rough-edged appeal.my thoughts: oh this was one really great read! i have heard that the rest of the series gets better from here on out, and i cannot wait to read them all! i just ordered the next two used. if you like mysteries with a sense of humor, check this series out!currently reading: artemis fowl by eoin colferx-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

me talk pretty one day


nov. 14th, 2006 at 6:12 pm



 


thepixieinsidebook #76 book title: me talk pretty one day author: david sedarisgenre: non-fiction# of pages: 272my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: b- short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): david sedaris became a star autobiographer on public radio, onstage innew york, and on bestseller lists, mostly on the strength of "santalanddiaries," a scathing, hilarious account of his stint as a christmas elfat macy's. (it's in two separate collections, both worth owning, barrel fever and the christmas-themed holidays on ice.)sedaris's caustic gift has not deserted him in his fourth book, whichmines poignant comedy from his peculiar childhood in north carolina,his bizarre career path, and his move with his lover to france. thoughhis anarchic inclination to digress is his glory, sedaris does have atheme in these reminiscences: the inability of humans to communicate.the title is his rendition in transliterated english of how he and hisfellow students of french in paris mangle the gallic language. in theessay "jesus shaves," he and his classmates from many nations try toconvey the concept of easter to a moroccan muslim. "it is a party forthe little boy of god," says one. "then he be die one day on two...morsels of... lumber," says another. sedaris muses on the disputesbetween his protestant mother and his father, a greek orthodox guywhose easter fell on a different day. other essays explicate his deepkinship with his eccentric mom and absurd alienation from his ibm-execdad: "to me, the greatest mystery of science continues to be that a mancould father six children who shared absolutely none of his interests." every glimpse we get of sedaris's family and acquaintances deliverslaughs and insights. he thwarts his north carolina speech therapist("for whom the word pen had two syllables") by cleverly avoiding all words with ssounds, which reveal the lisp she sought to correct. his midget guitarteacher, mister mancini, is unaware that sedaris doesn't share his obsession with breasts, and sings "light my fire" all wrong--"as if hewere a webelo scout demanding a match." as a remarkably unqualifiedteacher at the art institute of chicago, sedaris had his class watchsoap operas and assign "guessays" on what would happen in the nextday's episode. my thoughts: this wasn't nearly as good as naked or dress your family.... i think i prefer sedaris's stories about his childhood and teenage years.currently reading: janet evanovich's one for the moneyx-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

this weekend...


nov. 13th, 2006 at 7:52 pm



 


thepixieinsidei was so busy this weekend, that i didn't get to update!!!friday nite we all went to a nice seafood restaurant for my granny's birthday dinner. i thought it was ok, but a bit too pricey for the quality of the food. we were all hungry, so we ate a lot anyways. my granny really liked it, and that's what mattered the most!saturday, we all were supposed to go to my good friend josh's wedding. unfortunately, my dad's only surviving aunt on his father's side died and he and my granny went to her funeral, while my mom and i went to the wedding. the ironic thing is, we saw my dad's aunt last weekend. i think it was god's way of telling us we need to see her one last time. my parents and i also went to the mall on saturday. i got my mom the lovely perfume for her birthday and i cannot wait to give it to her! i also got me talk pretty one day by david sedaris, and i'm already almost finished with it! i really like his writing style and want to get holidays on ice before christmas starts.it has been a week since miss kitty had to be put to sleep. this house is empty without her. i still am thinking she is just around the corner, and i find myself shutting doors, thinking that she is going to try to come in certain "forbidden" rooms. i cannot wait to get her urn and see what it looks like.  i want to thank you all for your thoughts and prayers for our family. it has meant so much to me! my aunts and uncles have sent me cards and flowers as well. we all feel so loved because of you all! *very big huggles*i am bored. what do you all have for me? ;)

dress your family in corduroy & denim


nov. 10th, 2006 at 7:48 pm



 


thepixieinsidebook #75 book title: dress your family in corduroy & denim author: david sedarisgenre: non-fiction# of pages: 257my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: b short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): in his latest collection, sedaris has found his heart. this is not to suggest that the author of me talk pretty one day and other bestselling books has lost his edge. the 27 essays here (many previously published in esquire, g.q. or the new yorker, or broadcast on pri's this american life) include his best and funniest writing yet. here is sedaris's family in all its odd glory. here is his father dragging his mortified son over to the home of one of the most popular boys in school, a boy possessed of "an uncanny ability to please people," demanding that the boy's parents pay for the root canal that sedaris underwent after the boy hit him in the mouth with a rock. here is his oldest sister, lisa, imploring him to keep her beloved amazon parrot out of a proposed movie based on his writing. ("'will i have to be fat in the movie?' she asked.") here is his mother, his muse, locking the kids out of the house after one snow day too many, playing the wry, brilliant commentator on his life until her untimely death from cancer. his mother emerges as one of the most poignant and original female characters in contemporary literature. she balances bitter and sweet, tart and rich—and so does sedaris, because this is what life is like. "you should look at yourself," his mother says in one piece, as young sedaris crams halloween candy into his mouth rather than share it. he does what she says and then some, and what emerges is the deepest kind of humor, the human comedy.my thoughts: this was a cute and funny read. however, i did not find it near as good as naked. if you like humor and memoirs, then i would suggest reading naked and then this book.haws anyone read any of his other works? are they worth buying?currently reading: nothing yet...x-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

thepixieinsidethe vet called a little earlier, and told us that miss kitty is doing a bit better. she was able to walk on her front two paws, but is still very weak, so your prayers are very much appreciated! :) i just hope that she gets through this and is able to stay with us at least a little while longer.on another subject, i am reading neverwhere by neil gaiman. it is a good read! has anyone else read it?is anything good coming on tv tonight? i am still pretty worried about the cat and need a good distraction for now. :/

thepixieinsidei would like you all to keep my cat miss kitty in your prayers. to put it simple, she is dying. she has kidney failure and it's getting worse. she's at the vet's this weekend and they're going to give her iv's, and i hope it will make her better (if not for long, at least we will have a little bit of time left with her).miss kitty has been a big part of the family and whatever happens, it will be hard to get through this. at least she will not suffer. :/

for one more day


nov. 1st, 2006 at 11:42 pm



 


thepixieinsidebook #74 book title: for one more day author: mitch albomgenre: fiction# of pages: 197my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: a+ short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): in this second novel from tuesdays with morrie and the five people you meet in heaven author albom, grief-stricken charles "chick" benetto goes into an alcoholic tailspin when his always-attentive mother, pauline, dies. framed as an "as told to" story, chick quickly narrates her funeral; his drink-fueled loss of savings, job ("sales") and family; and his descent into loneliness and isolation. after a suicide attempt, chick encounters pauline's ghost. together, the two revisit pauline's travails raising her children alone after his father abandons them: she braves the town's disapproval of her divorce and works at a beauty parlor, taking an extra job to put money aside for the children's education. pauline cringes at the heartache chick inflicted as a demanding child, obnoxious teen and brusque, oblivious adult chasing the will-o'-the-wisp of a baseball career. through their story, albom foregrounds family sanctity, maternal self-sacrifice and the destructive power of personal ambition and male self-involvement. he wields pathos as if it were a louisville slugger—shoveling dirt into pauline's grave, chick hears her spirit cry out, " 'oh, charley. how could you?' "my thoughts: wow! this was just a beautiful, touching story! this book really makes you think about the relationships in one's family. i highly recommend it to everyone!currently reading: nothing yet...x-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

elsewhere


nov. 1st, 2006 at 8:08 pm



 


thepixieinsidebook #73 book title: elsewhere author: gabrielle zevingenre: fantasy;ya fiction# of pages: 275my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: b+ short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): what happens when you die? where do you go? what do you do? zevin provides answers to these questions in this intriguing novel, centering on the death of liz hall, almost 16 years old and looking forward to all that lies ahead: learning to drive, helping her best friend prepare for the prom, going to college, falling in love. killed in a hit-and-run accident, liz struggles to understand what has happened to her, grief-stricken at all she has lost, and incapable of seeing the benefits of the elsewhere in which she finds herself. refusing to participate in this new life, liz spends her time looking longingly down at the family and friends back on earth who go on without her. but the new environment pulls her into its own rhythms. liz meets the grandmother she never knew, makes friends, takes a job, and falls in love as she and the other inhabitants of elsewhere age backward one year for each year that they are there. zevin's third-person narrative calmly, but surely guides readers through the bumpy landscape of strongly delineated characters dealing with the most difficult issue that faces all of us. a quiet book that provides much to think about and discuss.my thoughts: this was an interesting read! i think that the plot was great! the downside was that it was a young adult read, and it showed. even though i tend to have a soft spot for young adult books, the writing seemed to be choppy and it seemed to be written in a bit of a rush, in my opinion. i would suggest this book to people who love to read ya fiction, but don't buy it, just get it at your local library. currently reading: i think i am going to read the glamour by christopher priestx-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

thepixieinsidewhat american accent do you have? your result: the midland "you have a midland accent" is just another way of saying "you don't have an accent."  you probably are from the midland (pennsylvania, southern ohio, southern indiana, southern illinois, and missouri) but then for all we know you could be from florida or charleston or one of those big southern cities like atlanta or dallas.  you have a good voice for tv and radio.the northeast the inland north the south philadelphia the west boston north central what american accent do you have?i do not sound like that at all! i have a southern accent!

a great & terrible beauty


oct. 31st, 2006 at 9:58 pm



 


thepixieinsidebook #72 book title: a great & terrible beauty author: libba braygenre: fantasy;ya fiction# of pages: 403my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: a+ short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): a victorian boarding school story, a gothic mansion mystery, a gossipy romp about a clique of girlfriends, and a dark other-worldly fantasy--jumble them all together and you have this complicated and unusual first novel.gemma, 16, has had an unconventional upbringing in india, until the day she foresees her mother’s death in a black, swirling vision that turns out to be true. sent back to england, she is enrolled at spence, a girls’ academy with a mysterious burned-out east wing. there gemma is snubbed by powerful felicity, beautiful pippa, and even her own dumpy roommate ann, until she blackmails herself and ann into the treacherous clique. gemma is distressed to find that she has been followed from india by kartik, a beautiful young man who warns her to fight off the visions. nevertheless, they continue, and one night she is led by a child-spirit to find a diary that reveals the secrets of a mystical order. the clique soon finds a way to accompany gemma to the other-world realms of her visions "for a bit of fun" and to taste the power they will never have as victorian wives, but they discover that the delights of the realms are overwhelmed by a menace they cannot control. gemma is left wi! th the knowledge that her role as the link between worlds leaves her with a mission to seek out the "others" and rebuild the order. a great and terrible beauty is an impressive first book in what should prove to be a fascinating trilogy. my thoughts: wow. this is one pretty amazing read! so amazing that i just ordered the sequel rebel angels! i was not sure if i would like this book, but it was written so beautifully, in the style of a victorian novel. i think that any woman that loves fantasy will most definitely appreciate this engrossing read.  currently reading: i just got elsewhere by gabrielle zevin from the library, so i think i will try reading it next.x-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p

a good year


oct. 29th, 2006 at 10:39 pm



 


thepixieinsidebook #71 book title: a good year author: peter maylegenre: fiction# of pages: 287my rating of the book, f- [worst] to a [best].: a short description/summary of the book: (taken from amazon.com): mayle's breezy, uncomplicated fifth novel (chasing cezanne, etc.) and ninth book follows 30-something max skinner from a sabotaged financial career in london to his adoption of the provençal lifestyle on an inherited vineyard in france. max spent holidays at his uncle henry's vineyard as a child, so when he inherits the place, the prospect of returning is tempting; a generous "bridging loan" from ex-brother-in-law charlie seals the deal. the estate, le griffon, is in a dire state of disrepair and the wine cellar is filled with bottles of a dreadful-tasting swill, but it's nothing that vineyard caretaker claude roussel and prim housekeeper madame passepartout can't resolve. max settles into his new life easily thanks to the attentions of local notary nathalie auzet and busty cafe owner fanny. the arrival of young californian "wine brat" christie roberts, uncle henry's long-lost daughter, complicates matters for max, but her surprise offer and charlie's arrival lessen the impact of a vicious vineyard scandal involving a delicious, high-priced, discreetly produced wine called le coin perdu. mayle's simple story provides lighthearted if unadventurous reading and a fond endorsement of the pleasures of viniculture. my thoughts: this was such a cute and lighthearted read! i enjoyed every page of it and hope that others will read it and enjoy it as well. i want to see the movie with russell crowe, even though it looks like a lot of the plot has been changed significantly.currently reading: i don't know what to read next!!!x-posted to my book community, book_it_2006 and a whole lot of other places! ;p
