this year, the colorado democratic party will go through its reorganization process.



reorganization or ‘reorg’ is our party’s process of electing officers to lead our 64 county parties. these officers, including county chairs, vice chairs, treasurers, secretaries, and other additional officers, hold incredible influence over the direction and vision of our party.if you are ready to not just see change happen but be the change, then we want you to be part of building our party in 2025. we need your energy, ideas, and vision. 































volunteer

we are always looking for talented and passionate people to help get dems elected. we have both in-person and remote opportunities to engage with the party, so reach out today!
