h.p. blavatsky
(1831-1891)



helena petrovna blavatsky (1831-1891), russian-born occultist
and co-founder of the theosophical society, demonstrated
psychic powers of a startling nature and claimed personal contact
with highly developed masters living in tibet and india. a
well-versed student of metaphysical and esoteric lore,
she promoted a greater western knowledge of eastern religions,
philosophies and mythologies. madame blavatsky's major works
(isis unveiled, the secret doctrine, the key to
theosophy, and the voice of the silence) are
considered classics in occult and theosophical literature.

"we
          came into contact with certain men, endowed with such mysterious powers and such profound
          knowledge that we may truly designate them as the sages of the orient. to their
          instructions we lent a ready ear.   the work now submitted to public judgment is the
          fruit of a somewhat intimate acquaintance with [these] eastern adepts and study of their
          [esoteric & occult] science." 
h.p. blavatsky, 
isis unveiled, 1877.

"helena petrovna blavatsky is surely
          among the most original and perceptive minds of her time.  she is
among the modern world’s trailblazing psychologists 
of the visionary mind."  
theodore roszak,
unfinished animal: aquarian frontier 
& the evolution of consciousness.

"blavatsky's esoteric synthesis has
          served as a basic source for later esotericists, literati, scientists, and entire
          movements, including the new age.  unlike most of her contemporaries, she is as
          visible today as an modern trendsetting guru, and she will most likely
          remain the most memorable and innovative esotericist of the 19th
          century."  
james a. santucci, 
dictionary
          of gnosis & western esotericism.

"madame blavatsky...stands out as the
          fountainhead  of modern occult thought, and was either the  originator and/or
          popularizer of many of the ideas  and terms which have a century later been  
          assembled within the new age movement.  the theosophical society, which she
          cofounded, has been the major advocate of occult philosophy in the west and the single
          most important avenue of eastern teaching to the west."  
j. gordon melton, jerome clark &  aidan a. kelly,
          eds., 
new age almanac.

"theosophy occupies a central place in
          the history of new spiritual movements, for the writings of blavatsky and some of her
          followers have had a great influence outside of her organization....the
          importance of theosophy in modern history should not be underestimated. not only have the
          writings of blavatsky and others inspired several generations of
          occultists, but the movement had a remarkable role in the restoration to the colonial
          peoples of nineteenth century asia their own spiritual heritage."

an introduction to esoteric principles by doss mcdavid. revised and expanded fifth edition.a good introduction to the basic teachings of theosophy as found in the writings of h.p. blavatsky and the mahatmas. 
under the direction of her teachers, helena petrovna blavatsky (hpb) introduced the world to a set of esoteric teachings that had previously been hidden from the public. the origin of the universe, the seven-fold structure of the human constitution, the nature of life after death, the process of evolution, and the path to spiritual enlightenment were explained as part of a system of thought that came to be known as  theosophy. unfortunately, blavatskys voluminous writings are not easy to read and many readers find it difficult to tell the forest from the trees. this book was written years ago as a study guide for students seeking a map of the major features of the theosophical landscape as it was laid out in the early days of the theosophical society. this new expanded version contains extracts from hpbs "theosophical glossary "and the entire text of w.q. judges "epitome of theosophy" to supplement and throw further light on the explanations given.  to provide the student with some suggestions for further reading, a  list of the source materials from the early days and an extensive bibliography is provided.

"...no other book you could possibly read will give you the same sense as this one that you have known h. p. blavatsky, the person, as well as she can be known more than a century after her passing from this world --- not alone hpb, the writer, the theosophist, or the controversial figure, but also hpb, the unique individual in the midst of her travels, her ups and downs, her daily life."  dr. robert ellwood in his review of esoteric world of madame blavatsky in the quest magazine nov-dec 2001, p. 236.


"...this book...[is] an extremely useful collection of primary documents about blavatsky. there is nothing else in the literature about theosophy's history quite like it. the esoteric world of madame blavatsky will undoubtedly be a standard work in blavatskian bibliographies for many years to come.   not only will it provide the sources that future researchers need for their own work on blavatsky....it will give the general reader a vivid sense of blavatsky as others knew and experienced her....caldwell helps us to appreciate...what this first generation of theosophists appreciated: the radical nature of blavatsky's affect on those around her...."  dr. w. michael ashcraft in his review of esoteric world of madame blavatsky in theosophical history, july 2002, p. 264.

death and the afterlife. helena petrovna blavatsky (1831-1891) was the first person in modern times to claim contact with certain eastern adepts or mahatmas. in september and october 1880, mme. blavatsky visited a. p. sinnett and a.o. hume at simla in northern india. the serious interest of sinnett and hume in the theosophical teachings of these masters prompted mme. blavatsky to establish a contact by correspondence between these two englishmen and the these two adepts.

during the years 1881-1883 in their letters to sinnett and hume, mahatmas k.h. and m. gave a detailed account of what happens when we die. this book extracts from these letters the teachings setting forth what happens to a human being between death and rebirth.  

you will read their letters on "death and the afterlife" in the order the letters were actually received.  some of the topics included:  dying and soon after; the death struggle and gestation state; the second death and devachan; reincarnation and karma; suicides and accidents; the two egos and immortality; psychism; communication with the dead and spiritualism; mediumship versus adeptship, etc.

a casebook of encounters with the theosophical mahatmas. h.p. blavatsky claimed personal contact with certain adepts, masters and mahatmas living in tibet, ladakh, india, sri lanka and elsewhere. during her lifetime and since her death, there has been a great deal of controversy and skepticism concerning the existence of these mahatmas. almost all of h.p.b.'s critics have doubted the actual existence or reality of her masters. nevertheless, more than twenty five people testified to having seen and/or been in contact with the mahatmas during madame blavatsky's life time. in the pages of this book, the reader will find the detailed accounts and testimonies of most of these witnesses in which they relate their sightings, encounters and meetings with h.p.b.'s adept teachers.

concerning mme. blavatsky and the last year of her life, walter r. old, a member of the inner group, wrote in 1893:

"...she gathered closer round her such of her pupils as circumstances
rendered the most accessible, and began a system of regular instruction,
opening up new lines of thought and study which, if steadily pursued,
would yield fruit indefinitely.   questions on the esoteric philosophy,
on the teachings of the secret doctrine and her various writings, were
answered as fully as possible, and the whole body of information thus
elicited, was written down.  these instructions occupied a special evening
each week, and continued until the fatal sickness came upon her...."  the

missing:   h. p. blavatsky's christmas letter
 of 1886 --- a video talk by dr. james santucci. .
dr. santucci gives a talk about his research and findings on h.p. blavatsky's december 25, 1886 letter to j. ralston skinner.  this letter with a detailed introduction will be published in a double issue of theosophical history in early 2025. 





"following the publication (in theosophical history vol. xviii/1-2) of h. p. blavatsky's thirty-six page letter to james ralston skinner, dated february 17, 1887, it came to my attention that another letter, known only to a small number of researchers and apparently at one time located in the andover-harvard divinity library's collection of the j. ralston skinner papers (bms 516), predated the february letter by two months....in reviewing the provenance of the letter, it gradually became clear...that an earlier letter composed by blavatsky and addressed to skinner, dated december 25, 1886 and originating from ostend, may have been part of the collection. if it were included in the skinner papers, it inexplicably disappeared from the library without any evidence that it ever existed...."   dr. james a. santucci, editor of theosophical history.

"anita atkins (1915-2000) has made a great contribution to a better public understanding of madame blavatsky by writing the biography hpb: the extraordinary life and influence of helena blavatsky. this biography was first published in 1993 under anita's pen name sylvia cranston.  i first corresponded with anita around 1975.  by the early 1980s i no longer wrote letters to her but
had started calling her on a fairly regular basis at her new york residence.  i found
this was the easier way to communicate with her.  in fact, on the phone we could go over in much greater detail all sorts of
matters regarding our mutual hpb research.  i would send her material; she would send me material.  it was
in late 1982 or early 1983 that anita told me over the phone about the discovery of the hpb letters to skinner at harvard.  she said she would send me copies of her typescripts of these letters.  anita had personally gone to harvard to see the originals of these letters.  i clearly remember the day i received that 
large manilla envelope from anita with the typescripts.  i ripped the envelope open and read all these letters.  of course, the first letter i read was hpb's christmas letter of 1886. at the top of the first page of this typed copy of the christmas 1886 letter, a prefatory note
by anita reads:
"original in andover-harvard theological library cambridge massachusetts".  many years later, i also acquired a photocopy of this original letter in h.p.b.'s own handwriting that was found among the papers of the late john cooper in the natonal library of australia.in 2016, upon learning that the original dec. 25, 1886 letter at harvard had somehow gone missing, i sent both anita's typescript and the photocopy of the original to dr. santucci for publication in theosophical history."   daniel  h. caldwell, founder and organizer of the blavatsky study center/blavatsky archives.  for more, see sylvia cranston:  an eyewitness.

"j. ralston skinner, author of the source of measures, corresponded with hpb during the writing of the secret doctrine.  one of the topics addressed in their correspondence was the 'numerical cipher of the ancients,' which skinner had, in part, discovered.  writing to skinner, hpb complimented his discoveries and told him that he would have never been successful in the work he had accomplished without the unseen guidance and help of the masters.  she did, however, take issue with skinner's ideas about the preeminence of the hebrew language and insisted that the inhabitants of india had a fully developed numerical system for sacerdotal purposes thousands of years before the development of hebrew....[hpb's] letter to j.r. skinner, [is] dated december 25, 1886.  original in the andover theological library, harvard university...."  william doss mcdavid, "gematria, senzar and the book of dzyan," the quest magazine, september, 1998, pp. 7, 12. for more on the "numerical cipher of the ancients" and gematria as related to the book of dzyan, see doss mcdavid's
