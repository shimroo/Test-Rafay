art of the creator through man of knowing & compassion








welcome to jin shin jyutsu

                    art of the creator through man of knowing and compassion
                



jin shin jyutsuÂ® physio-philosophy is an art of harmonizing the life energy in the body. born of innate wisdom and passed down from generation to generation by word of mouth, the art had fallen into relative obscurity when it was dramatically revived in the early 1900's by master jiro murai in japan.
after clearing himself of a life-threatening illness, master murai devoted the rest of his life to the research and development of jin shin jyutsu, gathering insight from a range of experiences and resources, including the kojiki (record of ancient things). the resulting knowledge of jin shin jyutsu was then given to mary burmeister, who brought it to the united states in the 1950's.
mary burmeister began teaching the art to others in the early 1960's, and today there are thousands of students throughout the united states and around the world.

                                         my friend had a twenty-year history of asthma. i showed her how to hold her ring fingers to strengthen her respiratory functions. she remarked on being able to breathe more freely after holding them and decided to receive some jin shin jyutsu sessions from me. i focused on balancing the second depth. after three sessions, she said she felt like a new person. she didn't need any medication or vaporizers since receiving jin shin jyutsu. also, she said she could feel her lungs become more clear for the first time.

                                         whenever i find myself at a higher altitude, i seem to be susceptible to headaches. these leave me incapacitated for at least a day. recently, a friend instructed me on how to hold the base of my thumbs at safety energy lock 18. she told me that this would help to clear up the pressure that i felt in the back of my head. i used this on myself during my next trip to the mountains, and was pleasantly surprised at the result!
                                    

~reprinted with permission from the touch of healing





                                        i had a great deal of fear about an upcoming business trip. my left low back began causing me increasing pain, to such an extent, i wondered whether it would be possible to go on my trip. i went to a chiropractor to be adjusted, but my back still hurt. finally, i boarded the plane for my trip, with my back still causing me a great deal of pain. as i sat in the plane, mary's words came through loud and clear- "keep it simple-when your back hurts, simply hold on to your index finger." i held my index finger, feeling my fears melt away, and to my surprise, so did my back pain. throughout the entire week of my trip, my back was pain free--and i was reminded of the simplicity of the art of jin shin jyutsu.
