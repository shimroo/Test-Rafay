welcome to gardens ablaze, the site for anyone with an interest in gardening!   my purpose is to enhance your 
gardening experience by providing quality information and resources free of 
charge to anyone interested in gardening - or to anyone interested in learning 
more about gardening.  quality links 
relative to vendors for that hard-to-find herb, flower, shrub, tree, or outdoor 
accessory  are provided throughout these 
pages.  humor is interjected periodically where halfway appropriate.  
if you are looking for something that has not yet been researched on this site, 
please bookmark, as it will be added for sure at some point within the next 1 
week to 15 years.  that's an absolute guarantee from gardensablaze.com, 
assuming i live that long.  if not, then you know what happened and your 
bookmark will not work anymore. send daisies, my personal favorite.
thanks for stopping by, and always remember 
the gardens ablaze secret.....

the hapless gardener's glossary of terms



notable quotes 
 
in the vegetable 
garden.....
....the trouble is, you cannot 
grow just one zucchini.  minutes after you plant a single seed, hundreds of 
zucchini will barge out of the ground and sprawl around the garden, menacing the 
other vegetables.  at night, you will be able to hear the ground quake as 
more and more zuchinnis erupt. - dave barry
....i do not like broccoli.  and 
i haven't liked it since i was a little kid and my mother made me eat it.  
and i'm president of the united states and i'm not going to eat any more 
broccoli - george bush, u.s. president

 breaking
      new ground...

....the best way to 
garden is to put on a wide-brimmed straw hat and some old clothes.  and 
with a hoe in one hand and a cold drink in the other, tell someone else where to 
dig.
texas bix bender



battle
      of the sexes......

....women  are like fine wine.  they all start out fresh, fruity, 
and intoxicating to the mind, and then turn full-bodied with age until they go 
all sour and vinegary and give you a headache.
male author unknown
....men are like a fine wine.  
they all start out like grapes, and it's our job to stomp on them and keep them 
in the dark until they mature into something you'd want to have dinner with.
female author unknown
