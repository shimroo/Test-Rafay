ugh
i see that livejournal has actually killed automatic crossposting on their end, which is vexing.i guess i'll just start crossposting everything manually, because i didn't pay $150 in 2005 for a permanent paid account to not have full access to it until either livejournal dies or i do. that's $215.94 with inflation!

vid rec: me and the devil, folk of the air, jude/cardan
some straight-up fae magic here by hurleybird. the actual sources are the netflix series cursed and the cw series legacies, but the edit is astonishing.makes me want to reread the folk of the air books again.

a surfeit of football
we've had ‚Äúsuper wild card weekend‚Äù (i.e. six wild card games instead of the previous four) twice now, which i think is officially a sufficient sample size to say that it sucks. the seven seeds don't belong there (because they aren't very good). the two seeds don't belong there (because we should have a bye). six games is too many games. sure, i could simply not watch some of these games, but i would still know that they were happening and that would be just as bad.the chiefs-steelers matchup was actually extremely fun! nick allegretti caught a touchdown! travis kelce threw a touchdown! neither of those things were supposed to happen (because allegretti and kelce are an offensive lineman and a tight end, respectively). that's apropos, because the entire game should also not have happened.luckily there were no real injuries during the game, so we were able to enjoy this harlem globetrotters-style performance with no regrets‚Ä¶this year, anyway.

whitmerrifield: had bsinger51 convinced that kylezimmer11 wedding was black tie. dress code couldn‚Äôt of [sic] been more clear on the invitations. he‚Äôs rocking a 3 piece with a bow tie in cabo‚Ä¶(full video in the original tweet.)absolutely hilarious that brady would still believe anything whit told him at this point. he may look sharp, but he's not too bright‚Ä¶

math with whit and brady
in response to a prompt from royals, someone posed the following question:if whitmerrifield can paint a house in 3 hours & bsinger51 can paint the same house in 5 hours, how long does it take for them to paint it together?whitmerrifield: 5 hours. i make brady paint the house while i crack a beer and watch.bsinger51: you don't even drink beer.too cute.

those smug sign-stealing shits
wow, if i had a nickel for every time dusty baker skippered a cheating orange team to the world series, i'd have two nickels. which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice, right?now i just hope that the 2021 astros meet the same end as their 2002 counterparts. although ideally not dragging the series out a full seven games. ugh, i'm already so sick of watching postseason games in that cacophonous train-riddled hellbox they call a stadium.
