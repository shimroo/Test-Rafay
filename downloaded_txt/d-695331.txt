community and economic development














the community and economic development (cedev) graduate program provides individuals with the knowledge and skills to work with citizens and leaders to establish and maintain viable communities and community organizations.
the cedev graduate program, offered online through penn state world campus, has two innovative educational opportunities:

master of professional studies degree
graduate certificate

these offerings are designed to meet the needs of community and economic development practitioners and those aspiring to work in this area.
knowledgeable leaders, professional staff and citizens who understand and can apply the theories and practices of community and economic development, are vital to enhancing the quality of life in our communities. a significant aspect of this program is the incorporation of multidisciplinary perspectives drawing on economics and sociology, and the attention paid to application of theory and research to the practice of community and economic development. the multidisciplinary approach recognizes and addresses the complexity of working in and with communities and organizations.
testimonial
"i am grateful that penn state offered a program geared to the working professional. now, i have the tools and resources to assist in community and economic development work with an emphasis on effective facilitation and leadership." ~melissa piper nelson, cedev certificate graduate
