ssgt arthur j. rambo 

bill passes to rename the kootenai river bridge to the staff sergeant arthur j rambo memorial bridge (posted 1/19/2025)
libbymt.com
the montana legislature passed sb59, a bill that renames the kootenai river bridge in libby, montana as the staff sergeant arthur j. rambo memorial bridge. the bill was passed on january 16, 2025 and signed by montana governor greg gianforte.the bill dedicates the bridge on highway 37 in libby, over the kootenai river, to honor army staff sergeant arthur j. rambo. he was a montana native who heroically served and was killed in action in 1969 in vietnam, just short of his 24th birthday. he was awarded the silver star after working courageously to save his crew members during an attack in november, 1969.  three fellow soldiers were also killed in the attack.  by naming this bridge after rambo, the libby community wishes for the legislation and bridge to permanently recognize his sacrifice and service to the country. the bill also directs the montana department of transportation to design and install commemorative signs on the bridge and to create a memorial plaque near the bridge. ssgt rambo served in the 11th armored cavalry regiment (the legendary blackhorse regiment) near the cambodian border.  he was the section chief of an m-109 self propelled howitzer.  for the bravery he displayed in the firefight on thanksgiving day, november 26, 1969, he was awarded the silver star posthumously.  the silver star is the third highest medal awarded in the military. ssgt rambo left behind a wife and two infant daughters. he is buried in the libby cemetery.silver star  posthumous - sergeant arthur john rambo26 november 1969howitzer battery, 3rd squadron11th armored cavalry regimentsergeant rambo distinguished himself by gallantry in action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile force on 26 november 1969 while serving as an artilleryman with the howitzer battery, 3d squadron, 11th armored cavalry regiment, in the republic of vietnam. on this date he was located at the squadron command post when it suddenly came under an intense mortar and ground attack from a north vietnamese army force. in the initial moments of the firefight, a rocket propelled grenade slammed into a cargo vehicle next to him, and the vehicle erupted in explosions and fire. sergeant rambo immediately began alerting the personnel in the area and directing them away from the area. he then crawled to the fiercely burning vehicle and attempted to drive it out of the area. suddenly another grenade hit the vehicle and he was thrown to the ground. undaunted, he crawled to a self-propelled howitzer and started the engine. as he began driving out of the area, the vehicle was hit by yet another rocket propelled grenade and he was fatally injured in the ensuing fire and explosions. sergeant rambos heroic actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the united states army.headquarters, ii field force vietnam, general orders no. 4896 (23 december 1969)this bill originated through a conversation between libby high school alumnus mark fennessy (1965) and libby vfw harper erdman post 1548 vice commander keith kidwell. the renaming is in response to a request from the libby community, many of ssgt rambos friends, the rambo family, and libbys vfw post, to honor this soldiers memory.the rambo family said in a media release, "the staff sergeant arthur j rambo memorial bridge will be a testament of arthurs service and duty to his country but it will also be a reminder to remember and honor all vietnam soldiers.  arts family and friends hope this will be healing for those who lost loved ones and those who came home to an ungrateful nation."the family expressed their appreciation to senator mike cuffe of eureka, representing lincoln county, for presenting this bill and orchestrating the stages it took to pass through both houses of the legislature, smoothly and in record time. they also expressed appreciation to representative neal duram, also of eureka, for his role presenting and moving sb59 through the house of representatives. governor greg gianforte stated he felt honored to sign the bill - the first bill to be presented and passed in the 2025 montana legislative session.plans are now being formulated to create the plaques by the mt department of transportation.  the plaque will be mounted on each end of the bridge.  there will be a formal dedication celebration at a later date. related links:blackhorse memoriallibby bridge to be named after fallen soldier by sean wells, 8kpax, jan. 12, 2025effort to rename libby bridge after fallen soldier headed to legislature by scott shindledecker, the western news, jan. 3, 2025

winter

winter in montana means snow, and lots 
of it! for those who love to play in the deep powder, the libby area offers tremendous 
winter fun. turner mountain ski area, located 
just 22 miles from libby, offers challenging downhill skiing with a beautiful 
view. their slogan is "steep, deep and cheap", and turner definitely 
lives up to that. it's still fairly undiscovered, so you can escape the crowds 
and get the cheapest lift tickets around. for those who love snowmobiling, 
there are hundreds of miles of backcountry roads to sled on in the kootenai national 
forest. cross-country skiers and ice fishermen also can find solitude on a lake 
and miles of quiet forest trails to enjoy the outdoors. those who are a bit on 
the wild and crazy side will love the antics of the libby polar bear club.
members take winter-time "swims" in frigid libby creek every sunday
from october to april. plungers have ranged in age from 3 to 61. as long as the
ice can be broken on the creek, if it has formed, the group will take their plunge,
no matter the temperature.
