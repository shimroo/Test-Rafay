honor. integrity. truth. character.
32° scottish rite freemasonry is a fraternity of brothers committed to going deeper into the highest principles, teachings, and ideals of the masonic craft. it is open to all master masons looking to continue the journey of self-discovery and finding a deeper sense of purpose.
as freemasons, we believe in something greater than ourselves, and strive to be good men who want to be better.
become the best version of you. answer the call.
