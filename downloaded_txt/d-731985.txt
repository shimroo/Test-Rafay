listenhomeschedulereadarchivesradiocontact from the pastor's deskthe following excerpt is taken from the writings of jonathan edwards describing the work of the spirit of god during the great awakening in the american english colonies.  this is what we need today!warning!don't expect the nations to change unless the homes and churches are changed. pray for revival and awakening in every nation.the spirit moves among the peopleby jonathan edwardsin the latter part of december 1734, the spirit of god began to set in extraordinarily and to work wonderfully among us. very suddenly, one after another, five or six people were miraculously converted. i was particularly surprised by the story of a young woman who had been one of the greatest company-keepers in the whole town. when she came to speak with me, i had never heard that she was serious about anything. yet by the conversation i then had with her, it appeared to me that what she gave an account of was a glorious work of godâs infinite power and sovereign grace.  she told me that god had given her a new heart, truly broken and sanctified. i could not then doubt it, and i have seen much in my acquaintance with her since to confirm it.though the work in this womanâs life was glorious, i was filled with concern about the effect it might have on others. i was ready to conclude (though too rashly) that some people would be hardened by it in carelessness and looseness of life and that they would use it as a reason to open their mouths in reproach of religion. however, it worked in the opposite way to a wonderful degree. god made it, more than anything else that ever came to pass in the town, the greatest occasion of awakening to others.through my private conversations with many of the people, i have had abundant opportunity to know the effect this womanâs story had on them. the news of it seemed to be almost like a flash of lightning on the hearts of young people all over the town and on many others. those people among us who used to be furthest from seriousness, and who i most feared would make a mockery of her story, seemed to be awakened by it. many went to talk with the young woman concerning what she had met with; and what had come about in her seemed to satisfy all who spoke with her.  read more it is our prayer in these tumultuous times that churches would be united in preaching the truth of jesus christ; hearts and homes would be healed; all nations would hear the everlasting gospel of repentance and faith; and peace would reign on earth, all through our lord jesus christ.269-751-6114937 royce avenue holland mi 49090 usquick linkshomeschedulereadradiocontactservice hourssunday worship - 9:30 am & 6:00 pmtuesday bible study - 7:30 pmwednesday prayer - 7:30 pmcopyright â©  zion chapel, all rights reserved.we use cookies to enable essential functionality on our website, and analyze website traffic. by clicking accept you consent to our use of cookies. read about how we use cookies.cookie settingsrejectacceptyour cookie settingswe use cookies to enable essential functionality on our website, and analyze website traffic. read about how we use cookies.cookie categoriesessentialonthese cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our websites. you cannot refuse these cookies without impacting how our websites function. you can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described under the heading "managing cookies" in the privacy and cookies policy.analyticsoffthese cookies collect information that is used in aggregate form to help us understand how our websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are.save settings
