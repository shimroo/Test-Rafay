{cross-post of a blog post i published on dailykos.com on 9.27.2020}   i don’t need to tell you the news. today every state legislative race in the usa got a huge kick in the pants . (link to amy klobuchar speaking for all of us.) our best and first line of attack is our state legislatures. who we elect and where we elect them  matters. now, more than ever. not just in terms of defending our rights and fighting the gop gerrymander, but also in terms of passing laws that reflect the will of the people. and yeah, whether it’s the aca  or roe , gun sense  or lgbtq equality , voting rights  or blm , if the republican party can’t respect the clearly expressed voice of the people then the people need to kick the republican party out on its posterior . (that link is to the just released dlcc act blue page targeting 48 races to flip power in no fewer than 10 republican controlled state legislatures .) so let’s talk about arizona. arizona’s state legislature is currently...

every union organizer has a ritual.  it might be where you stand near the gate where the cars drive up to the job site. it might be how you hold the clip board when you get ready to knock on a door. it might be how you sort and re-sort your list, going over names of workers, shifts and departments until you know them like they were permanently etched inside your skull. for me, in this case, it was a table, in a cafeteria, in a hospital.  i'd order a cup of coffee and sit in the same chair, facing the same direction with my materials carefully tucked away and my ball cap sitting on the chair beside me. and then i'd wait...   it was a big city children's hospital serving kids from all over. if you live anywhere near me, you've seen it from the freeway, life flight helicopters occasionally touching down yards from traffic. i'd sit at a central table, facing the entrance, cashiers and serving stations to the right of me and salad bar at my back. i'd be there morning...

dear arsenal fans,   at a moment when many in the press have made arsenal and arsene wenger the focus of unkind jokes, and even some fans are giving in to pessimism, i think there's still strong reason for hope.  arsenal's financial position is strong and the team has a stable core of experienced players. there is time in this window and a powerful rationale for more players to join; arsenal will compete in four competitions and may well win a trophy, or even a title, this year.   that doesn't negate the stark realities facing the team.   first, having cleared out a large number of players, some of whom played a good bit last year (gervinho, arshavin) and also struggling with short (arteta, vemaelen) and long term (diaby, ox, podolski) injuries, arsenal need to add depth to the squad.  depth is needed not just to avoid fatigue in a season with four competitions, but also to fuel the attacking style of play that arsenal is famous for.   second, the team needs, and has needed...
