f-series
the best-selling trucks in america for 50 straight years.

since 1977, f-150 and super duty have been the best-selling trucks for some very real and hardcore reasons: rock-solid durability. up-to-the-nanosecond technology. and jaw-dropping capability. leading the way for 40 straight years is grueling, intense and tough. yeah. just the way f-series likes it.
