louisiana prospers: a meauxmentous milestone in 2024
five years ago, the louisiana board of regents adopted louisiana prospers, its master plan for higher education, setting an audacious goal to support economic growth and strengthen the quality of life in our state by increasing the percentage of louisiana’s working-age population (ages 25-64) with a credential of value beyond high school to 60% by 2030. this goal represents an ambitious target and provides a roadmap to a future in which all of louisiana’s residents can prosper in both their work and lives. our pursuit of the louisiana prospers goal has resulted in the state’s educational attainment level reaching its current all-time high of 51% in 2024, more than a full percentage point higher than last year.
