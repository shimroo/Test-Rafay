what's happening






cottonbaler pistol

                        there has been a request for another order of the cottonbaler 1911a1 pistols that leonard collins arranged for back in 2009.
                    

                        i have been in contact with leonard and he is planning on another order of pistols. at this time, there is not a price. he has to price out the pistol and then the engraving.
                    

                        here are 2 photos of my cottonbaler pistol and the flyer he had at the 2009 reunion.

the cottonbaler creed

                        before you stands a damn fine soldier â¦ a cottonbaler â¦ by god! i can be counted on to accomplish any mission â¦ any task â¦ any job. i have been in the arena. my face is covered with dust, sweat, and blood. i have known the sweet fragrance of freedom for
                        i have paid the price. i am a damn fine soldier â¦ a cottonbaler â¦ 
                by god!


                        i earned my nickname at chalmette in the war of 1812. we stacked cotton bales on the levee and with andrew jackson stood the fury of the british square. with spent musket and cannon the british retired from the field that day. they had met some damn fine
                        soldiers â¦ a cottonbaler â¦ by god!


                        i remember the alamo â¦ traveled south and left my mark and my blood at monterey, vera cruz and cerro gordo. i marched triumphantly into mexico city â¦ proudly proclaiming â¦ cottonbalers â¦ by god!


                        the sound of fury from fredericksburg, chancellorsville, chickamauga and chattanooga still rings in my ears and i witnessed the closing acts of the internal strife at gettysburg. i had fought my brother but done my job â¦
                        a cottonbaler â¦ by god!

history of the 7th infantry regiment

                        the rich heritage of the 7th infantry regiment spans 200 years and 12 wars with 76 campaign streamers earned and 14 unit decorations received. the regiment has served in more campaigns than any other infantry unit in the united states army. it was initially
                        organized in response to the âquasi-warâ with france during the summer of 1798. the first major conflict in which the regiment was engaged was the indian war of 1811 where it fought under general william henry harrison in ohio
                        and indiana. its first encounter against foreign troops took place in the war of 1812 where the 7th infantry saw action in canada, florida and louisiana.
                    

                        it was the battle of new orleans in 1815, while being commanded by andrew jackson, who later became president of the united states, that the 7th infantry was dubbed the âcottonbalers.â during that battle the 7th successfully held their position against
                        the british forces from behind a breastwork of cotton bales. the nickname âcottonbalersâ was proudly accepted by the regiment and a cotton bale was incorporated into the regimental coat of arms and to the distinctive unit insignia.
                        subsequent to the war of 1812 the 7th infantry served in florida and on the arkansas frontier. thereafter, it saw action in the mexican war in such famous battles as the battle at monterey, cerro gordo, and vera cruz. following
                        the mexican war, the cottonbalers were busy with such frontier tasks as building forts and roads, and protecting settlers. between 1815 and 1846 the 7th infantry participated in several campaigns climaxed by the florida war against
                        the seminole indians.
