take a kite ride in the clouds, swim 
          with dolphins, hold a piece of the sun, tango with a tidal wave, travel 
          with prehistoric astronauts, pull the devil's tail, fly in an inventor's 
          hot air balloon, meet a mischievous magician, bureaucratic teapot, sorcerer's 
          apprentice and fall in love with three oranges.
