bang-inc – rifle scopes reviews you can trust 

i have personally bought and tested every rifle scope.

read my scope reviews


how do i review scopes?
every scope reviews on bang-inc undergoes a comprehensive evaluation. i subject each scope to a meticulous testing regimen. this process is designed to assess the scope’s capabilities across a wide spectrum of shooting scenarios, from close-quarters engagements to long-range precision work.
i simulate diverse environmental conditions, including low-light situations, inclement weather, and varying temperatures. this allows us to gauge the scope’s durability, clarity, and overall performance in real-world settings. additionally, we evaluate factors such as eye relief, field of view, and adjustment precision to ensure that each scope meets the exacting standards demanded by both professional shooters and enthusiastic hobbyists.

creator & author of bang-inc.com
hello,
i’m jerry miculek, and i created bang-inc. i’m a lifelong hunter and sport shooter, and i know a lot about guns and gun accessories. and like most gun owners with too much time on their hands, i like to play around with accessories. if i see a new cleaning kit or scope, there’s a good chance i’m buying it.
i created this site because it can be hard to find a good scope. finding a good rifle is easy. there are plenty of reputable websites and publications that tell you all about them. and today’s internet culture has spawned an array of forums where you can chat with other gun owners and get their input.
scopes, on the other hand, can be tougher to nail down. there are too many models, and to be honest, a lot of what you can buy online these days is garbage. the glass is cloudy, or the crosshairs won’t stay zeroed in, or the mounting rings are too loose.
i got tired of buying low-quality scopes, and decided to create bang-inc to share my thoughts. that way, you can find the best scopes without trying out a bunch of clunkers.

why should you trust bang-inc?
because i am firearm an optics expert. moreover, because i personally install and test every scope i review. i’ve never written a paid review, and i don’t accept product placements – even if i like the manufacturer.
when i evaluate a scope, i treat it as a blank slate. each scope goes through the same rigorous testing process. i also do my own background research to ensure my readers know everything they need to know.
this site is about 100% accurate information, along with my own personal opinions and experiences. that’s my commitment to you, and i’m sticking to it.
you might wonder why i’m so passionate about this.
to begin with, i’m angry! some things in life don’t require precision. nobody really cares whether their burger patty weighs 4oz or 4.1oz. but when it comes to shooting, precision is important. and too many manufacturers are flooding the market with outright garbage. the good scopes, meanwhile, deserve some praise!
for another thing, my reputation is important to me. i spend a lot of my time teaching young shooters about gun safety and caring for their equipment. and i want my readers to end up with a scope they can truly rely on.
