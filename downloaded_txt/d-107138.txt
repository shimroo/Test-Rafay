wall street is taking president donald trump’s latest threat on tariffs in stride, on the whole, and u.s. stock indexes are rising. the s&p 500 rose 0.7% monday, coming off a losing week bookended by worries about how potential tariffs could threaten the economy. the dow jones industrial average added 163 points, and the nasdaq composite rose 1.2%. stocks of u.s. steel and aluminum producers jumped after trump said he will impose tariffs on all such imports. mcdonald's also climbed on strength for its restaurants outside the united states. treasury yields held mostly steady in the bond market.

            the nfl announces the steelers will play in dublin in 2025 for ireland's first regular-season game


feb 7, 2025


dublin will host ireland’s first nfl regular-season game when the pittsburgh steelers play at croke park in 2025, the league announced friday. the announcement came two days before the chiefs and eagles meet in the super bowl in new orleans. the irish capital joins madrid and berlin as first-time hosts next season as the league continues to expand its global footprint. the nfl announced earlier this week that a game would be played in australia in 2026. the steelers have long-standing ties to the emerald isle and a partnership with the gaelic athletic association, which operates croke park. the date and pittsburgh’s opponent will be announced this spring.

            mahomes, kelce and the chiefs' quest for a three-peat faces its toughest challenge vs. the eagles


feb 5, 2025


patrick mahomes, travis kelce and the kansas city chiefs are pursuing history and a few of taylor swift’s records. saquon barkley, jalen hurts and the philadelphia eagles stand in their way. the chiefs (17-2) will try to become the first team to win three straight super bowls when they face the eagles (17-3) on sunday in the superdome. it’s a rematch from two years ago when hurts nearly led the eagles to a championship only to watch mahomes snatch it away by rallying kansas city to a 38-35 win on harrison butker’s 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left. mahomes lifted the chiefs to an overtime win against san francisco in another super bowl rematch last year. now, they’re poised for a three-peat, a word coach andy reid doesn’t use much.

the young figure skaters whose lives were cut tragically short when an american airlines flight collided with an army helicopter and crashed into the potomac river on wednesday night were just beginning their journeys to stardom. some of them were quickly rising through the ranks of u.s. figure skating, while others were still learning the very basics. all of them were coming home from a development camp in wichita, kansas, some of them accompanied by their parents and coaches. and all of them had stories that were only just beginning, and just waiting to be told.
