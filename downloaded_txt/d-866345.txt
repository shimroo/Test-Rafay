marching for the lives of teachers





photo  of students with banner, “it’s in your hands to respect and value life. i love it, do you?”dear  friends,  more than 2,000 students and teachers  marched through the streets of puerto berrio on march 17 to protest the killing  of a teacher and his wife. duvian rojo  and veronica cadavid were killed by two gunmen in the center of town on the  evening of march 13. puerto berrio is  controlled by paramilitary death squads that have relations with the police and  military, and the killing occurred just two blocks from the police station. duvian and veronica were the parents of twins  that are less than a year old.  the paramilitaries have been extorting  more than 20 teachers in the town – demanding that they pay protection money in  order to avoid being killed. duvian  filed a complaint with the prosecutor’s office that led to the arrest of two  men, although none of the paramilitary leaders were arrested. his colleagues believe that he was killed in  retaliation for speaking out about the extortions.   i felt a lot of tension at the beginning  of the march, more so than at any other activity i’ve accompanied here in  colombia. i asked the parish priest, who  had invited us to the march, if i could take some photos. he responded that it would be better if i did  not. one of my teammates, who had been  married by the priest, talked to him later and he agreed to let me get some  shots. i was introduced to a man who  then walked with me to the front of the march. the march stretched out for several blocks and it was very inspiring to  see so many students in the streets of puerto berrio.   we met with a group of teachers after the  march in the church, our lady of sorrows. one man was wearing a t-shirt with a photo of duvian that read, “friend  duvian, you will always be in our hearts.” the teachers were very concerned about their safety and asked us to not  mention their names. “you wonder if  you’ll be the next victim,” one of them told us.  they described the relationship of the  paramilitaries with the police and military. “these groups are mixed together with the authorities.” they also talked about the location of the  killing – two policemen are usually stationed there and it’s near the  station. “they (the killers) exited to  the left and the police came in from the right.”    puerto berrio is a town of 50,000  inhabitants, located two hours south of barrancabermeja. two paramilitary groups are fighting for  control of the cocaine trade in the region, and one of those groups has  apparently entered into an alliance with the national army of liberation (eln)  guerrillas. the priest told us that  three to four people were killed each week in puerto berrio during  february. in the midst of all this, the  teachers are determined to continue forward and to denounce the abuses that  occur in their town.   sister miriam accompanies workers in the palm  oil plantations near barrancabermeja. during the meeting with the teachers, she said “peace can appear to be a  distant dream. however, there are new  sprouts and signs of hope. we’re weaving  together networks of people.”  in love and  solidarity,  scott

gunshots, explosions and fear





dear friends,  we  heard gunshots as we were having dinner in the community of filipinas  (arauca) on june 25. farc guerrillas were attacking the soldiers that had arrived in town that  morning. i looked at my watch and noted  that it was 5:12 p.m. – something concrete to focus on in order to  avoid the fear that i was feeling.  the bursts of  gunfire were becoming longer and the direction of the sound was changing. it seemed as though the shots were coming  closer. there was a particularly long,  and ugly, burst of automatic rifle fire. at one point, shots were fired in the plantain grove – 100 yards  away.  we also heard  explosions which could have been army mortars or guerrilla cylinder bombs. the guerrillas sometimes launch propane  cylinders filled with shrapnel – deadly devices that often veer off course and  miss their intended target.  a group of  soldiers had set up camp in the neighboring house – 50 feet away. i was afraid that the explosions could have  been cylinder bombs and that the guerrillas would attempt to hit the army  encampment. i counted the explosions  (something else to focus on) and noted 16.  “my god! my god!” cried the woman who had invited us  for dinner. “why don’t they just leave?”  she said in relation to the soldiers. she was also afraid that their presence would draw bullets or bombs.   i motioned a  few times to my friend nidia and mouthed, “let’s get on the ground!” but she and  the others didn’t seem to think that was necessary. we heard some more shots and i finally said  to everyone, “you can stay seated, but i’m going to get down on the  ground.” i then laid down on the dirt  underneath the table. the family puppy  joined me and i nicknamed the two of us, “the brave ones.” the sight of the gringo and the puppy  provided some comic relief and, at that point, the gunfire and explosions  ended.  i  dusted myself off and we walked to the center of the community. gunfire sounded again while i was inside a  small store. this time i didn’t hesitate  – i immediately laid down on the floor. i looked at my watch and noted that it was 6:03  p.m.   a helicopter  came and circled overhead five minutes later. a roar of machinegun fire came from the helicopter – the ugliest sound  i’ve heard in my life. i looked behind  me and saw nidia crouched underneath a table with her son brandon, who was  crying. one of the bullet cases tore  through the metal roof of a house fifty yards away and landed on the ground a  few feet from a mother and child (see attached  photos).  the following  morning we learned that four soldiers had been seriously wounded in the  attack. the troop commander came to talk  with us and we expressed our sorrow for those soldiers. we stated our concern that the ongoing  presence of soldiers in the community, and encamped in people’s homes, was  putting the civilian population at risk. the guerrillas were also endangering civilians by attacking the soldiers  inside the community.  we had  traveled to filipinas for a human rights workshop organized by the arauca  peasant association (aca). the workshop  was suspended because of the danger posed by the presence of the soldiers and  guerrillas. the troop commander told  nidia, the workshop facilitator and me that we would have to leave the  area. before leaving, we went to the  home of the aca president – at least ten soldiers were encamped around the  house.  gunshots rang  out again about half an hour after we left filipinas. the aca president’s horse was struck by one  of the bullets and killed.   i’ve been experiencing a growing commitment  to the non-violent struggle for justice. the actions of both the guerrillas and the soldiers put the children and  adults in filipinas at grave risk. seeing their fear, and experiencing my own fear, has deepened my  opposition to the blind hatred embodied in the barrel of a gun.     in love and  solidarity,  scott

terror of the "people's army"





dear friends,  the “revolutionary  armed forces of colombia – people’s army” (farc) guerrillas murdered two  teachers here in the state of arauca during the week of june 8. i traveled to arauca city on june 12 for  their wakes – which were held in the arauca teachers union auditorium.  pablo rodriguez, of  the sikuani people, taught in the indigenous school in marrero. he was murdered in his classroom by the farc  on june 9. because of the difficult  access to that community, his body wasn’t recovered until two days later. when i arrived in arauca city, the wake had  finished and the funeral procession was marching to the cemetery.    humberto echeverri  taught for 18 years in the community of los colonos and he was with his students  on june 11. the social pastorate  program of the catholic church has a nutrition and community garden program in  los colonos, and they were monitoring the weights of the children. farc guerrillas came into the school and told  humberto they needed to speak with him. they led him away, prevented the people from following, and then killed  him.   the wake for humberto  began shortly after i arrived at the union office. i heard a woman crying out and i followed her  cries into the auditorium. arelis, who  is eight-months pregnant, was leaning over the coffin of her spouse. she was accompanied by their two children -  jorge and andrea.   jorge told me that he  is six-and-a-half years old. “the farc  took him a long ways away,” he said. “there were three shots – one in the air and two at my papa. it’s sad.” andrea said that she will turn ten this month and i could see the tears  in her eyes.  humberto was another  victim of the war between the two guerrilla groups, farc and eln (“national army  of liberation”), in arauca. that war  began in late 2005 and it appears to be escalating once again. the farc and eln both profess to be fighting  for social justice but here in arauca they’re acting just like the paramilitary  death squads – threatening and killing civilians that they view as supporting  the other side. their war is solely  about the control of territory and resources in arauca.   more than 350  civilians have been killed as a result of that war and thousands of people have  fled from their homes. the farc and eln  have now caused more damage to the arauca social movement than the military and  their paramilitary allies were able to accomplish in two  decades.  teachers and other  community leaders in arauca are afraid for their lives. the farc has threatened various  teachers. the eln also threatened people  prior to the murders of pablo and humberto – stating that if the farc killed  anyone, the eln would respond by killing two or more people that they view as  supporting the farc.  the mid-year school  vacation began on june 12 and extends until july 5. several teachers are unsure about whether  they will return to their schools after vacation. twenty four teachers have been killed in  arauca during the past eight years.    the farc also  distributed a written death threat in late may in which they declared the arauca  state peasant association (aduc) and the regional student and youth association  (asojer) to be “military targets.” i  live in the social organizations building in saravena which houses the offices  of aduc and asojer.   my friend robinson  spent 18 months in prison for “rebellion” and he was the only person i talked  with at the wake that still exhibited some hope. he said, “we have to transform our  difficulties into something beautiful.”    in love and  solidarity,  scott

april speaking tour





dear friends,  in just a few hours,  i’ll be flying from bogota to los angeles to arrange the final details for nidia  castellanos’ northwest speaking tour: “women resisting war in  colombia” (see schedule at end of  message).  nidia is a single  mother of three children who is risking her life to defend human rights here in  colombia. she is the secretary general of the arauca  peasant association (aca), which promotes organic agriculture and defends the  rights of its members and their families. aca has been severely repressed by the colombian government and has also  been attacked by the guerrillas.  luz perly cordoba, the  founding president of aca, was imprisoned for “rebellion” in 2004 and now lives  in exile. jose caicedo, the following  president, went into hiding after an arrest order was issued against him for  rebellion in 2007. carlos cabrera, a  previous secretary general, was killed by the guerrillas in november  2008.  “defending the rights  of small farmers and their families in our state of arauca means facing a lot of risk,” said nidia. “i’m willing to suffer those consequences  because i want a better future for my children – melisa, camila and  brandon.”  “we hope that the obama  administration will represent a change in u.s.  policy towards our country,” continued nidia. “colombia doesn’t need any more guns  and bombs - there are already enough to kill all of us. we’re also aware of the serious economic  problems in the u.s. instead of spending your tax dollars on more weapons, that money could be  used to create jobs and support health care and education – in arauca, as well  as montana.”  the  u.s. government is providing  colombia with more than $1 million  per day in military aid. some of that  aid is used to protect occidental petroleum’s oilfield and pipeline in  arauca – which produce and transport 100,000  barrels per day. amnesty international  and human rights watch have repeatedly documented the human rights abuses  committed by the colombian military.  we hope you’re able to  join us for one of the presentations. please also help us spread the word about nidia’s speaking  tour.  in love and  solidarity,  scott   monday, april 6 – helena, montana 7 p.m. – wiegand  amphitheater,  simperman hall 101-202, carroll college tuesday, april 7 – billings 7 p.m. – st. andrew presbyterian church, 180 24th st.  west wednesday, april 8 – red  lodge 7 p.m. – regis cafe, 206 16th  st. thursday,  april 9 – bozeman 7 p.m. - strand union building 235, montana state university monday,  april 13 – hamilton 7 p.m. - hamilton library, 306 state  street tuesday, april 14 –  arlee 6:30 p.m. – the hangin’ art gallery, 11 hwy.  93 wednesday, april 15 –  kalispell 7 p.m. – blake hall board room 140, flathead valley community  college thursday, april 16 – missoula 7 p.m. – north underground lecture  hall monday,  april 20 – coeur d’alene, idaho and spokane,  washington noon – todd hall, molstead library, north idaho  college 7 p.m. – wolff auditorium, jepson center, gonzaga university tuesday,  april 21 – ellensburg 7 p.m. – room tba, central washington university wednesday, april 22 – bellingham noon – world issues forum, fairhaven college  auditorium 7 p.m. – whatcom human rights task force, 13 prospect  st. thursday,  april 23 – twisp 7 p.m. – confluence  gallery monday,  april 27 – portland,  oregon 7  p.m. – portland mennonite church, 1312  se 35th ave. tuesday, april 28 – corvallis time and room tba,  oregon state university wednesday, april 29 – eugene time  and location tba

free at last!





dear friends,  my friend flor diaz  was released from the arauca city prison last month and was finally able to  return to her home here in arauquita. we  went out on the arauca river with her youngest children, viviana and fernando,  on march 10 to watch the herons returning to roost for the evening. there were hundreds of herons in the trees  along the river and it was wonderful to enjoy that beauty and freedom with  her.  flor spent three years  and four days in prison for “rebellion.” she was the secretary general of the arauca peasant association and she  told me that she was imprisoned because of her work in support of human  rights. “i can’t ignore the suffering of  others,” she said.  marcela, her oldest  daughter, was 18 years old when flor was detained by the secret police on  february 14, 2006. marcela had to assume  the responsibility for her three siblings: viviana (who was just 8 years old),  fernando and edwin. “it was very hard  when they would call me and tell me there wasn’t any food in the house,” flor  said. “i would ask myself, ‘what can i  do?’”  flor worked for 14  years as a health practitioner in the rural communities of arauca and also  served as a catechist. she continued  with her vocations while she was in prison. she would care for the other prisoners when they were ill, and she also  helped organize prayer and mass.  “suffering makes you  strong,” flor said. “if you’ve never  suffered, you can’t be strong. i would  get very disappointed when i received bad news about my case. i would argue with god: ‘you abandoned  me! i don’t want anything more to do  with you!’ but then i would remember the  gift of my children.”  flor’s first  grandchild, camila, was born on december 20, 2006. “i saw her for the first time on january 21,  2007,” said flor. marcela would take  camila to visit flor in prison every three months. “for the first two years of her life,  ‘grandmother’s house’ was the largest mansion in arauca,” marcela said  jokingly.  being in prison for  three years was a very hard experience but it’s also an adjustment being outside  of prison after all that time. “i  couldn’t see long distance,” flor said, because there aren’t any open views in  the prison. “i also wasn’t used to the  noise in town. all i heard in my cell  was the sound of the fan.”  flor told me about a  conversation she had recently with a fellow prisoner who had also just been  released. they talked about the process  of adjustment. flor said to him, “i’m  not doing well either (she’s unemployed and in debt), but i am free.”    as we were alongside  the river, flor explained “oil and war are the cause of poverty here. what do we get from supplying the war  machine?: widows and poverty. we’re  going to stop supplying that machine. it  already has enough. let’s look at the  situation of poverty and invest that money to meet the needs of the people.”    in love and  solidarity,  scott

armed transportation stoppage





dear friends,    the “revolutionary armed forces of colombia – people’s army” (farc) declared an armed transportation stoppage here in the state of arauca that is causing hardship for the people they claim to be defending.  farc guerrillas called the transport companies on march 16 and threatened to burn their vehicles if they didn’t obey the order to halt transportation.     i’m currently in the town of arauquita – which lies along the highway that runs through the north of arauca.  the route to saravena (35 miles west) was the first to be suspended early on the morning of march 16.  the last taxi for arauca city (65 miles east) left town around 2:30 that afternoon.  two armed men on a motorcycle halted a bus on the highway that day and forced it to turn back.       there are no longer any taxis circulating in arauquita.  the motorized canoes that take people across the arauca river to la victoria in venezuela have also been suspended.  school bus service in the towns of la esmeralda and fortul was suspended this morning due to threats from the farc.  local stores are running out of fruit and vegetables, and the remaining food is increasing in price because of the scarcity.    defense minister juan santos flew to arauca city on march 16 for a public meeting about the security situation in arauca.  government authorities decided to fine the transport companies that are refusing to risk their drivers and vehicles during the stoppage.  the military and police also announced that they were launching “plan meteor” to prevent the guerrillas from paralyzing transportation.    farc guerrillas have burned a cargo truck and a tanker truck, halted a vehicle on the arauca-tame highway and placed it across the roadway blocking traffic, attacked a tractor-trailer, and also attacked a caravan of oilfield workers.    the military and police launched the “arauca moves” plan on march 17.  the plan consists of armed escort for transportation caravans.  one caravan of vehicles leaves arauca city every morning for arauquita, saravena, fortul and tame.  another caravan travels daily from tame to arauca city.  the caravans are accompanied by a large contingent of soldiers, police and secret police.  three of the caravans have been attacked by the farc.         the united nations’ world food program planned to deliver food supplements for pregnant women and nursing mothers, and children at risk of malnutrition, in arauquita on march 19.  the delivery was cancelled because the food packets couldn’t be brought here due to the transportation stoppage.    according to united nations’ reports, farc commanders ordered the “black march” campaign (which includes the stoppage in arauca) to commemorate the death of three of their top leaders in march 2008.  raul reyes, the second-in-command, was killed along with 25 other people when his camp inside ecuador was bombed by the colombian military on march 1.  ivan rios was killed on march 3 by his own bodyguard, who then cut off rios’ hand to present to the government as proof to collect the reward money.  manuel marulanda, the legendary leader of the farc, died of natural causes on march 26 – after fighting against the colombian government for more than 50 years.    the vast majority of people here in arauquita have no idea why the farc is imposing this transportation stoppage – they just want it to end soon.  according to those same un reports, the stoppage is going to continue until march 30.            in love and solidarity,scott

letter to montana congressional delegation--colombia





dear senators baucus, tester, and representative rehberg,as advocates for sensible, just and humane us foreign policies ,and residents of the great state of montana, we would like to draw your attention to the issue of u.s. involvement in colombia and ask that you consider the human rights impact of u.s. policy as you determine your position concerning  upcoming funding requests.colombia is caught in a complex web of violence resulting in the most severe humanitarian crisis in the hemisphere. approximately 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes in recent years, and human rights violations continue by all armed actors. (as documented by human rights watch). since the inception of plan colombia in 2000, the u.s. has supported a military solution to colombia’s armed conflict and illegal drug trade, which are in many cases interrelated. over 80 percent of nearly 5 billion in u.s. assistance has gone directly to colombian military and police forces but the war continues unabated and there has been no reduction of the availability of colombian drugs on u.s. streets. despite the many destructive consequences of u.s. policy in colombia and the drastic failure of the war on drugs, plan colombia has not changed. recently, members of the colombian government and the uribe administration’s cabinet have been implicated in secret support of death squads.we urge you, as our representative in congress, to shift the u.s. focus in colombia from funding the military, which has been implicated in human rights abuses, to assisting in negotiations for a lasting peace. we would ask that you support all legislative efforts to direct funding toward increased alternative development programs, judicial reform and  aid for internally displaced persons, including afro-colombian and indigenous populations. rather than the ineffective, often indiscriminate and inhumane aerial herbicide spraying, we must work to reduce demand at home and support programs to move colombian farmers away from illicit crop production.we further believe that in light of the colombian governments poor record regarding its close ties to those implicated in the persecution, harassment and even murder of union leaders, social justice activists, and community leaders, as well as their failure to improve investigations and prosecution of these crimes, the us must not sign the colombia fta. the us must demand accountability from its trading partners.as your constituents, we encourage you to help seek a new direction for u.s. policy in colombia, one which is based on respect for human rights and justice.thank you for your consideration of this important issue.  sincerely,
