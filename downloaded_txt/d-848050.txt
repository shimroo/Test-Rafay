greetings from the 
					commander

					we appreciate you stopping 
					by our website. if you are just “surfing”, we hope that you 
					find value in our information and the service we provide to 
					the veterans in our community. if you are a member, we wish 
					to remind you of the enormous amount of information provided 
					here to assist in keeping you abreast of the happenings at 
					“your” post. in any case, enjoy your “visit” with the 
					“friendliest post” in south texas. 

					our post has something for 
					everyone and our monthly calendar is full of activities. 
					each of these activities is a success because of a dedicated 
					and hardworking membership. volunteers are the backbone of 
					this type of organization and we never turn away the offer 
					of a helping hand. the work is rewarding and the sense of 
					family is strong and genuine. 

					speaking of family, this one 
					is rather large! we have over 1,300 members in the legion, 
					legion auxiliary, sons of the american legion and the legion 
					riders. we pride ourselves in taking care of and offering 
					something for everyone in our family. we provide 
					entertainment throughout the year for ages between 0 – 100. we have family picnics, halloween 
					parties for children and adults, christmas parties for those 
					who want to see santa and those who wish to dance the night 
					away. we celebrate the new year, look for easter eggs, and 
					celebrate the birthday of our country and many, many other 
					fun activities. our post has active dart leagues with 
					sponsored teams, shuffleboard tournaments, and karaoke at 
					the drop of a song note. if you like great foods try our 
					monthly steak nights and breakfasts. watch the calendar for 
					other cuisine from chili to lasagna, hamburgers to 
					bratwursts; i know you will not go away hungry. 
					

					we are proud to sponsor many 
					legion programs. boy’s and girl’s state, oratorical, boy 
					scouts, rotc awards and scholarships are just a few. we are 
					also active in holiday food baskets, visits to the local va 
					hospital and nursing home, donating time and resources to 
					the community and looking out for ways to promote patriotism 
					in this great land of ours. we have an active flag program 
					and support local patriot guard missions for fallen american 
					heroes! 

					if you are in the area, 
					please stop by and say hello. we are always looking to make 
					new friends. if you are a member and have not been to the 
					post in awhile stop in and see what is new. i promise either 
					way you will be delighted.

					for god and country,
