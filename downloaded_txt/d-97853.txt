preschool and elementary programs














communicative competence
communicative competence is considered an urgent, priority skill area for bridge school students because proficiency with aac/at tools and communication strategies creates access, participation, motivation, and achievement in all curricular areas. aac incorporates each student’s full communication abilities and may include any existing speech, vocalizations, or gestures, as well as the use of communication boards and voice output communication aids (voca). in this section, we describe how we address the full range of communication modes and technologies as our students participate in ongoing instructional activities and social interactions.

communication competence








self-determination
the bridge school self-determination program provides students with the necessary tools and supports to become causal agents in their own lives through informed decision-making, thoughtful planning and persistent action to achieve their goals.
