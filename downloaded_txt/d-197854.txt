mary poppendieck had a keynote session on star east ('the greatest software testing conference on earth) with an attention-drawing title: "your development and testing processes are defective"mary offered four suggestions (summerized here by the braidy tester who attended) for putting your software development process on a diet:eliminate waste. focus on what adds value for your customers and drop everything else. don't tolerate defects. inspect to prevent defects, not to find them. don't just log bugs but rather fix them as soon as you find them. don't batch and queue. don't leave bugs lying around; either fix them or won't fix them the moment they come in. if you have requirements churn then you are specifying too early, and if you have test-and-fix cycles you're testing too late. optimize the whole. optimize the whole product, which is not just software but a comprehensive solution that solves a customer problem. optimize your whole team: dev and test and program management, not just dev or test or pm. optimizing for point productivity drags down overall productivity. counterintuitive though it may be, letting one group go idle for awhile will often speed up overall throughput.mary poppendieck elaborated on similar points in publications on her site

i have a picture of john paul, the great above my computer. it shows  him on his first day as pope. he looks so young and healthy. there's no hint of how much he was later going to suffer. i love pope benedict but i really miss john paul ii.rest in peace, papa and pray for us.

i m sorting out thots in my mind.. there are some issues that i m going to have to address. like what i reallly want to do for the rest of my life. actually, the cosmetic industry is on the top of the list. 2nd and third would have to be a simple low paying lab job, and a high paying stressful and unhappy rat race. do not think i will want to be in the conflict filled sales and customer service sector.

and even if you're shopping for a special guy, heart-shaped jewelry need not be corny - in fact, your man may find it quirky and unique! cufflinks with a heart design, for example, could come in many colors, and go tastefully with your man's power suit. if you have a party guy in tow, bright red heart cufflinks would make him the envy of every casanova in the house! platinum jewelry resources
