a doorman is not security





we all want to live in a secure home. condominiums can offer more security, but don't be fooled by some obvious window dressing which has nothing to do with real security.we recently toured a wonderful condominium. a key selling point was security. and there it was, right in your face: a reception desk in the lobby, staffed 24 hours a day, with banks of surveillance monitors, and cameras everywhere. but is this really security?the obvious thing to point out is that cameras do nothing but records events as they happen. they are not a preventative tool, cannot provide help when needed. they require a minimum of 4 fulltime and one part time security staff, just to sit and watch the monitors, 24 - 7, and all without any active security. no patrols, no checking of "situations", no patrols. just one security officer sitting at a desk, probably eating donuts and reading the paper, while the monitors monitor.what happens when security spots an incident? if the officer leaves the desk to help, he or she has no backup in the event of trouble. if they call police and then leave, there may be no one to show the police where to go when they get there. if they call the police and wait, the people who need help also have to wait. the net effect is a lot of costs on your maintenance fees, and not much real security. studies have shown that security cameras are no real deterrent. just look at the effects, or lack of effects, of the massive surveillance system in london. and they have cops to follow up on what they see.and you can't depend on the police. it is not their job to patrol private property. they'll come when called to an incident, but response times vary. and your problems will be in the parking areas, little used basement corridors and stairwells, and specific units where trouble lives. all private property where the police will not patrol. in our condo, we tried for real security. in a complex of over 1400 units, we could afford it. we had a security staff of nine, with a minimum two people on at any one time. one person was always on patrol, another monitoring the surveillance cameras. they had radios and telephones. in the garages, we added an inexpensive way to get additional help: we added call boxes in a variety of locations, linked to the security office. we also put some of the cameras on the in-house closed circuit televisions system, for residents to watch. more eyes... once the word got around that we actually had security officers patrolling, vandalism rates, break and enters, and other incidents declined considerably. remember, real security is more than a greeter in the lobby. it is feet on the ground, back-up when needed, and the ability to really do preventative patrols.

buying a condo? here are some things to check.





buying a condobuying a condominium is much like buying a house and a neighbourhood in one. since you will be sharing your home with several hundred, even several thousand, people, you need to check not just the design and layout of the unit you want, but the neighbourhood in total.begin by taking stock of your lifestyle. do you like to have parties or do you cocoon? will noisy children bother you? can't stand dogs? do you travel a lot? will you be away from home for longer periods of time? do you need storage and parking?for condo owners, the problems can mostly be summed up as the "three 'p's", people, pets, and parking. let's start with people. noisy neighbours, cooking odours from foreign foods, rampaging children, all can be issues or just part of life. if these are potential nuisances to you, you need to check before you buy. for a start, remember that no condominium will be totally soundproof. some are quieter than others, but none stop the noisy stereo from next door, or the noise of someone's polka party three floors up. ideally, when visiting the condominium you ar interested in buying, have your agent take you to various floors of the building, and just wander the halls a bit. you might even drop in late one night to visit the complex and wander around. are there odours wafting the halls? are kids playing in the elevator lobby? is the garbage chute room dirty? are the grounds well maintained or are there dog droppings all over the lawns? are the lobbies a hangout for teens, or the elevastor interiors vandalized? all of these are bad signs. if they bother you somewhat now, they will bother you much more when you live there. best advice, walk away.parking is always an issue. when condominiums sell parking spaces, abuse of visitor parking becomes an issue. check how full the visitor parking gets overnight or on weekends. if there is no space to park, your visitors will have problems too. check the owners' parking areas too. if it is dark, gloomy, or dirty, this will bother you more and more over time. keep that in mind. if the parking spaces are numbered by unit, someone parking in the wrong space can start a whole chain reaction of people in someone else's space. if there are cars in the garage covered in an inch of grime, or partly disassembled, they could be abandoned, or someone is using the garage as a repair shop. another bad sign. look for a brighly lit, clean garage with numbered spaces, but not numbered by suite number. and make sure there are some spare spaces, for that inevitable time when someone does park in the wrong space.and that brings us to pets. there is nothing worse than running over a lawn and having dog droppings squelching up through your sandals. a close second is entering the elevator and stepping into a dog puddle. while most dog owners are responsible people, one or two bad owners make up for all the rest. if there are pet "calling cards" on the property, check your level of comfort with what you see. the annoyance level will grow over time. if it bothers you now, walk away. i've lived in a condo for over a decade, and been the president of a self-managed condominium of over 1400 units, really a small city. condo living can be great. you get a nice home and avoid a lot of maintenance hassles. you can travel and be away from your home for longer periods of time without worrying about burglars, break-ins or other issues. but living in close contact with other people requires some tolerance of that close contact, everything from cooking odors to chilling teens and barking dogs. check out the rest of the condo, not just the intended unit. it may save you a lot of issues later.
