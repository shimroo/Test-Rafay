                                â¢ aboutâ â¢ dinner menuâ â¢ wine listâ â¢ gift certificatesâ â¢ reservationsâ â¢ 



 












since 1960, chez napolã©on restaurant has been a favorite culinary destination in this neighborhood from when it was teeming with many classic french restaurants catering to voyagers disembarking from cross atlantic ships docked at the hudson river piers at the west end of 50th street. for many years to come, past the âwestiesâ and âhellâs kitchenâ periods, chez napolã©on remained steadfast as a small, yet tenacious restaurant, much like its namesake, that would stay true to its foundation of serving authentic and satisfying french cuisine, like from back home, on the outskirts of the theatre district.

                                      it was in 1982 that the bruno family â actually the third, yet longest, family to own chez napolã©on â came to stylize, craft, and perfect a menu that showcases and represents most regional specialties throughout franceâs broad culinary delights. this is largely thanks to chef âgrandmereâ marguerite brunoâs unique know-how of bringing home styled sunday night dinner, french comfort food from the home kitchen and into a small restaurant setting.











such classic favorites present on the menu include: garlicky escargots, savory onion soup with melted cheese, decadent duck foie gras, our signature steak au poivre, tasty frog legs, the ever popular beef bourguignon stew, the eventful bouillabaisse fish stew, our specialty dessert soufflã©s, and so much more! we also boast very unique, hard-to-find dishes such as: veal sweetbreads, veal kidneys, wild boar stew (when in season), and even calfâs brain served with black butter â reserved for the more adventurous and daring of foodies!

at chez napolã©on, we pride ourselves in offering a hyper-traditional french dining experience that will transport you to the small french restaurants by the banks of the seine in paris. diners who return to this landmark restaurant time after time seek not just to be fed in a hurry in time for a broadway show, but rather to take the time to relax and enjoy a well crafted meal that will please any taste and sophisticated palette.

this tiny humble restaurant is now run by elyane bruno and her son, william welles (yes...he looks scary. he is goth. he doesn't bite...as long as you behave...), who are very proud to continue this tradition of french culinary savoir-faire...especially within these very difficult and trying times for the restaurant industry.

the entire staff here are very grateful to our very loyal and local clientele in helping support us to be one of the oldest classic french restaurants in new york city throughout all of these many, many wonderful years. we couldn't have done it without you!!! 

bienvenue & bon appãtit!!!

thank you for understanding.

(we strictly do not take reservations for 6:30pm or 7:00pm during the middle of our pre-theatre seating)



- if your party will be attending the theatre, please tell us your show's curtain time when reserving -

* note: it is best to reserve at least 2 hours before your show to allow enough time to casually enjoy your hyper-traditional french meal, 
                                and have plenty time to get to the theatre
                              and through their security checkpoint line. we are not "fast-food," and rushing is neither enjoyable nor dignified.


 


(outdoor seating and carry-out service are not available.)
