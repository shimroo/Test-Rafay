hello... 
 the bridge tree is an internet treehouse for my little company and me, and friends. 
 established in november 1995, the site is on its third server and at least as many rebuilds. 
 over that time it has grown from a handful of pages to many many dozen, of various vintages. all are straight html with a sprinkling of javascript here and there, mostly in the blogs and galleries. 
 some sections are rather crufty, and will be getting some love. 
 the links in the footer describe the history of this site's development and production. 2015.02.20
