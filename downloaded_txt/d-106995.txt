tom and jana began corresponding in 1997 when jana, who was planning to move to knoxville, tennessee, stumbled upon an early version of this website and sent tom an email. in january 1998, jana's move was complete, and tom and jana met for the first time. 


shortly after we met, we began traveling together, and tom's website became our website. we got married in may of 2000 and later moved from knoxville to the much smaller nearby town of clinton. today, we are both (mostly) retired, and the travels continue...  


this collection of travelogues is meant as a way to share our travels with family and friends and to remind us of our many wonderful journeys, but everyone is welcome to peruse. we hope you enjoy!
