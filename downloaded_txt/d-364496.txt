sagadahoc preservation, inc. was founded in 1971 initially for the purpose of saving bath’s winter street congregational church building from destruction. our efforts also restored the chocolate church on washington street and supported ongoing preservation and restoration of bath’s 19th-century downtown area. spi played a major role in establishing two federally designated national register historic districts that encompass the central business district and residential areas of bath, maine, the city of ships. today, we run several initiatives celebrating and preserving our community’s architectural heritage.  we hope you will join us as a member or participant in any of our public programs.
