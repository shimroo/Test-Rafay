on april 10, 1997, young king ours magazine published the first chapter of a certain manga by an artist known mainly for his hentai. for the next ten years he would keep drawing, with lots of delays and stalling and begging for assistants - but even as he worked slowly, the idea was caught up by animators and merchandisers and translators and ever-increasing legions of fans, who took it and ran with it.

happy birthday, hellsing.
