““as a member of mercedes-benz owners it was well worth it for all the kind help, support and excellent customer service i received by the mbo team. i highly recommended this club/forum to new or old mercedes owners who may not be aware of the help and support available. thank you mbo.” 
amir chughtaimbo member““through my subscription of the mercedes club, i was introduced to various insurance companies that ultimately reduced by premium by £1200 per annum! i am thrilled. i still have years and years of no claims, and live in central london with fully comprehensive insurance. i am just about to benefit from my third year of value for money insurance cover through these good people. thank you mbo for the introduction.”
j. lloyd-daviesmbo member““many thanks for the clarification and for the information, i have contacted your mercedes specialist and placed an order. again many thanks for your help, mbo club is already proving worthwhile”.

all models from the dawn of motoring are fully covered, but greater emphasis is placed on those since the fifties, when mercedes-benz began exporting their cars to the uk in quantity.
our efforts are aimed at assisting owners with the provision of information and technical support. to this end we offer a variety of books and manuals relating to the marque together with a helpline, manned during office hours.
a full colour monthly magazine “mercedes owner” is circulated to members giving up to date information on new and old models, together with a fine cross-section of cars for sale and wanted, and very many services of value to mbo subscribers.
our travel offers provides superb offers across hundreds of hotels across the uk for a minimal fee . we also have great offers for trips across the channel and organises events both in this country and abroad.
