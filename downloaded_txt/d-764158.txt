radio dtb
i'm a huge fan of the derek trucks band (dtb) and host a podcast devoted
to their live music: radio dtb. radio
dtb is a weekly, thirty minute podcast fearturing live dtb music that is
available from the live music archive.
radio dtb also serves as a one-stop portal to the other great dtb resources
on the internet.
if you enjoy live music -- especially music that has its roots in jazz,
blues, rock, funk, and more -- you owe it to yourself to give the derek
trucks band a listen. head on over to radio
dtb and download the latest podcast and you'll see what i'm talking
about.

blog using the camera in my cell phone. the most recent three photos
from my mobile blog

sunday school
i teach the seekers sunday school
class at mount pisgah united medothist church in greensboro,
nc. i began teaching this class in july 2001 when the previous
teacher retired. this is a wonderful class whose goal is to study
the bible verse by verse. we typically cover a chapter or two
each week in class. on the website, i have links to
class notes and other
materials that will be of interest to class members.
sermons
on june 9, 2002, i was honored to preach a sermon entitled
"can i get a witness?" at
mount pisgah united methodist church. the text to it and any
other sermons i write and preach are available on my
sermons web page.
johnny cash
one of the more popular attractions on my site when i was in
college was the johnny cash
tribute pages. if you're a fan of the man in black (or even
if you aren't), feel free to check out the
tribute i've created
for him.
novelist





yes, i'm crazy. somehow, i decided that i could write a
novel. even crazier, i decided that i could do it in the span
of thirty days. it's all part of the fifth anual
national novel writing
month. i've considered participating before, but this
is the first year that i've taken the plunge. you can keep up
with my novel in progress at the journal i keep for it at
livejournal:

drmellow_novel.

at 5:30 pm on november 31, 2003, with a full six and a half
hours to spare i completed my novel, reluctant
preacher. it weighed in at 50,265 words and is in need
of a lot of editing. even so, i am now a novelist.
