for those who discuss performance before they discuss price.
we would never build something of lesser quality to meet a price point.
our no compromise designs offer excellent sonic performance and very
high rejection of electrical noise caused by earth loops. a general purpose
passive model for every day work and an active model with an extremely
high input impedance ideally suited to the needs of piezo and other high
impedance pickups. both dis feature an earth lift switch that really does
work.
 



a dual channel passive di is also available. 
same specs and size as the single channel passive di.


line isolation transformer

serious audio professional where sonic performance and freedom from earth
loops and ground noise is of utmost importance.
