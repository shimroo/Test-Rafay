office hours



we now have specified open door hours, 11-5p weekdays. during those hours you can set up appointments, pay deposits, and purchase gift certificates. the pandemic helped us make changes to many ways we do things at ultimate arts. for now, we have gone away from having a walk-in day and working primarily by appointment. we have adjusted our hours to be more beneficial to the artists and most importantly their families. artists are working a variety of different schedules from early morning, late evening, and weekends. our open door hours may have shrunk but hours available to tattoo have expanded.
