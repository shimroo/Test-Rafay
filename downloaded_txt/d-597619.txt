  poissantgallery cordially invites you
                           to the opening of “los amigos en el camino" (friends along the way) photography and artwork from cuba.  “los amigos en el camino” (the friends on the way) emerged as a collaborative
                           exhibition celebrating both the richness of cuban culture, and the spiritual unity of the cuban artists participating in the exhibition, whose
                           work is inspired by their directexperiences with the moment, or what some would call the direct experience of the
                           present, the here and now. each work represents an interpretation of the artist’s connection with limitlessness; a
                           sense that time exists in the here and now; the sense that we are never more alive than in the second we realize there are
                           no boundaries to existence.the artists’ common bond, reflected in the artwork in the exhibition, is their combined
                           confidence in the unified nature of the work, that each piece is connected to the other,not only through the creative processof the artists’
                           individual mind, but also through creating a space of openness to the creativity of all of the artists in the exhibition.this
                           concept, seemingly esoteric, is the common bond. whether conveyed through the organic forms of alain aspiolea in his masterful
                           large scale oil paintings, through theriveting black and white photographs of nelson jalil,which entice us with their
                           images of a forbidden and still unknown cuba, or through the compelling and serene work of laura carralero, each portrays the direct
                           experience of the present, as well as the realizationthat despite individual qualities, we are all connected.
