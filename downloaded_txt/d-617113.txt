good morning,

i had to send you this note: your hummus is the best commercially bought hummus i have found to date in toronto. the first time i bought it i ate the whole thing in one sitting, licking the last bit from the container. i love the ingredient list.- elena p.

i absolutely loved your garlic and onion hummusâ¦.the best i've ever had.- tasleem

just had to tell you that i bought your product in west vanc., b.c. last week and ate all of it in one go with a few friends last friday! it was good! in fact, i think it was the best hummus i've ever tasted. there is a citrus 'tweak' to it that makes it very light and tasty.- sybil c.

your hummus is the best!!!! it is far, far better than any other brand available in toronto.- julia t.

just wanted to tell you that your soups are delicious! i love them, especially your harira and tuscan ,they taste like they were made in mom's kitchen, not my mom's , ha ha, but someone's mom's, seriously, when i eat your soup i feel good knowing i have eaten healthy, and still enjoyed the flavour.- j.m., scarborough

my fridge always has some basic essentials; the sunflower kitchen basil  pesto in one of them.- rb, toronto

just want to let you know you guys make the best hummus and dips that i've ever had pre-packaged and ready to go! thank you for having the awareness to use good quality ingredients and not resorting to canola oil. you guys rock !!!!- kristine

it is a pleasure to enjoy the sunflower kitchen food because i trust they are made with first class ingredients. they complement my family meals in a natural and healthy way.

i love the pestos, potato and leek soup and all the different hummus./blockquote>- j.k.

your soups are outstanding, as good as my own!
after trying others, your brand is the best!- j.k., toronto.

 this delicious kale pesto dip is a must have at the cottage or summer bbq's. with high quality, fresh ingredients...you know you are serving something that is both healthy and appetizing!- dr. joey, toronto.
