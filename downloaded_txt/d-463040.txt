        the alverno difference


        we provide students with much more than just a single letter grade. our feedback identifies strengths and targets areas for growth. our learning approach is centered around the 8 abilities
        – what set our students and alums apart. these are the skills that will help you thrive both personally and professionally.




our abilities in action









 


























					- isabelle


					at alverno, i’ve been able to develop my communication skills and learned how to work well independently and on a team. with the support of my professors, i’ve been able to gain valuable career experience on and off campus. ultimately, i’m becoming a stronger leader.
				














        where all belong

        we believe education is enriched by the unique perspectives and experiences each student brings, and we are committed to fostering an environment that celebrates and values diversity in all
        its forms. it is central to our mission to embrace and encourage diversity, equity and inclusion (de&i).
