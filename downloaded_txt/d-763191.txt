matt barber shop that use queue management system ( qms )





when i get an inquiry from a wiring company in terengganu asking about particular order our queue management system ( qms ) for installing at a barber shop. i am curious why a barber shop required a queue management system ( qms ) to managed their queue?

however, i get no respond from them since i give them a quotation. this is normal as sometimes people just asking some info like price but might not respond if they feel price are too high or some other reason not meet their requirement. however, the question still in my mind as this is first time i get an inquiry from a barber shop.

when i went for a hair cut weeks later. i have a chat with my hair hairdresser. the hairdreser said it might be a "barber shop", with just one service......cutting only. not hair saloon with other services like washing and dyeing etc.this is common for barber shop in  bigger town like kuala lumpur but barber shop in town like ipoh rarely used a queue management system ( qms ).

with just one services. the boss can actually use the queue management system ( qms ) to monitor how many business per day even if he is not personally at the shop, said my hairdresser. slowly, i understand why a barber shop required a  qms.

i send an email to the wiring company mentioning i see the rational for their customer to installing a qms in their barber shop. within 24 hours, the wiring company reply that their company become interest again in ordering our qms after some follow up.


printer's touch screen with custom logo for matt barber shop, acutally, it can be design up to 4 services like cutting, washing etc.




display and ticket customization for matt barber shop before installing bell





keypad of qms for matt barber shop, can press "next" for next number or press sepcial number like 1234 and press "call". one keypad can send up to 8 counter/seat for barber shop
