understanding shakespeare





understanding shakespeare - the actors community   one of the difficulties faced when learning shakespeare is language accessibility. we simply have difficulty understanding the words, and so we miss the meaning of his plays and sonnets. lavita brooks will be taking on the responsibility of helping the actors community understand shakespeare's language in order to appreciate what the plays mean.     lavita trained with shakespeare & company in lenox, ma and has been teaching shakespeare for two years.  she has a bachelor of fine arts and has been acting professionally for four years.  during her first scene study, lavita will go over self awareness which allows the actor to block out the things around them with voice and body exercises.  this will be a lesson in acknowledgement of self.     the actors community helps adult actors who want training the chance to train without wondering about a lot of fees. it also helps in keeping the acting muscles warm so that when an opportunity for an audition approaches; the actor has been working on their craft that can be applied to the audition and possibly get them the job.    for more information, send inquiries to jenneanfarmer@gmail.com.   scene study group will meet tuesday, september 8th at caritas village from 6:30p-8:30p.  directions are below.     caritas village take poplar avenue westbound turn right on merton street turn left on harvard avenue caritas village will be to the left 2509 harvard avenue

bearden's 'one came home' wraps shooting





john beifuss writes in the commercial appeal about the willie bearden-directed film "one came home" that just finished shooting in the mid-south. here's an excerpt:scripted by bearden and memphis writer david tankersley, “one came home” is the story of a con artist who takes advantage of a proper mississippi family by pretending to be the wartime buddy of the family’s son, who was killed in combat in europe.“one came home” was produced with what bearden called a “core” crew of about 25 people. some scenes — including a church service and a traditional southern outdoor party — required 30 to 40 extras. a longtime filmmaker and event producer, bearden makes a living creating commercials, corporate and educational films (for the elvis presley birthplace museum in tupelo and the cotton museum in downtown memphis, among other clients), and by staging such productions as the annual blues music awards. “i’ve always said my job is to make sure i have a balance between art and technology. the craft of filmmaking is leading your viewers to exactly what you want them to see, and, hopefully, to what you want them to feel.”

indie memphis meets the challenge





indie memphis, the force behind an event one national magazine recently named one of the world’s “25 coolest film festivals,” has successfully met a $20,000 challenge from artsmemphis – an accomplishment that has allowed the non-profit organization to reach more than half its goal of raising $80,000 by december. the challenge grant from artsmemphis, made in may through an anonymous donor, stipulated that indie memphis raise $20,000 in new funding by the end of june to receive the $20,000 grant. indie memphis not only met the challenge, it exceeded it. thanks in part to the launch of its individual membership program, the non-profit organization surpassed its june 30th goal by $16,000 and, with that amount plus the $20,000 challenge grant from artsmemphis and $10,000 in additional funds raised in july, is now only $14,000 short of its december goal. “the generosity of artsmemphis and its anonymous donor served as an inspiration to the community at large, who stepped up to support indie memphis with donations as small as one dollar,” said erik jambor, executive director of indie memphis, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. “meeting our december goal will leave our organization well-positioned for the future and help ensure its long-term financial stability.” jambor said the accomplishment is even more gratifying because it comes during today’s difficult economic period and goes against the recent trend that has negatively impacted established film festivals and area arts organizations. “we are extremely happy to have a part in strengthening one of the most powerful artistic forces in our city: the memphis independent film industry,” said susan schadt, president and ceo of artsmemphis. “indie memphis masters the art of film by capturing the memphis vibe in a very unique way.” indie memphis, which connects and inspires though year-round programs of independent feature films, documentaries, short films, animation and student work, will hold its 12th annual indie memphis film festival this year from october 8 to 15. the current issue of moviemaker, a bimonthly magazine that covers “the art and business of making movies,” named the indie memphis film festival as one of the world’s “25 coolest film festivals.” the new york-based publication, which has a circulation of 165,000, cites indie memphis’ “unique creative landscape that is the home of the blues and the birthplace of rock ‘n roll.” earlier this year, film director craig brewer kicked off the fundraising campaign with the world premiere of his made-for-mtv film “$5 cover” at the malco paradiso. this benefit screening raised over $12,000 for indie memphis. jambor points out that memphians can support the organization and help it reach its december fundraising goal by becoming an indie memphis member for $50 per year ($30 for full-time students; $40 for filmmakers with at least two production credits). memberships provide year-round benefits including special discounts at the annual indie memphis film festival. corporate sponsorship opportunities for the october film festival are still available as well. those wanting more information about indie memphis can visit its web site at www.indiememphis.com.

reminder: book signing and film fundraiser





 ronald baldridge was a gang member in memphis in 1985 when he was shot twice while participating in a robbery at a frayser skating rink, leaving him wheelchair bound. he would be shot three more times in 1986, 1987 and 1988.  with the help of memphis police officer steve grisham, baldridge found god and renounced the gang life. he has since been a community activist, youth counselor and written "from gangs to god." a book signing will be held at java cabana, 2170 young ave., on saturday july 25th at 7 p.m. baldridge has been trying for years to get funding for his movie, "5 shots", so he and a few other people can get this story off the ground. the proceeds from the book sale will go to his organization called p.i.a.n.o. which stands for "people in alliance needing others," and toward funding production of the movie.  for more info, contact marguerite at daisyscreations57@yahoo.com
