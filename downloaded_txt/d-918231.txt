mefta is about hegemony





middle east wars are about hegemony





the neoliberals are still in power, because banking is the power behind our politicans.  it
                           just now wears a more humane face.  obama given our times is not a roosevelt, and he is continuing (as hoover did) with
                           the policies that brought about the great depression.  
 
http://www.freedocumentaries.org/film.php?id=214 on the federal reserve banking system, and their power.  one cannot understand
                           u.s. government’s
                           relationship with the business sectors, or u.s. foreign
                           policy without understanding the role of the federal reserve and foreignr national-banking systems.  they are the foundation of the 3-headed hydra, the imf, wto and world bank. 
                           
 








things to be skeptical about: 
                           all aspects concerning religion including "knowledge" about their gods, their historical "facts" about their origins,
                           miracles, theology, wisdom and morality.  all claims involving the incoporeal such as in spiritualism, parapsychology,
                           soul, & holistic   "medicine".  claims where personal gains are
                           in conflict with an accurate assessment and there is ineffective review, such research by the pharmaceutical industry,
                           product claims by corporations, public statements by attorneys and politicians, etc.  media information
                           where they serve a corporate or government master.  you put garbage in you get garbage out.  propaganda works. 
                           we are a plyable species.  
these areas are all analyzed in this website.  in addition there is a
                           fundamental concern for human well being, which includes topics on economic, utopia, rational skills, and scientific
                           psychology.

the skeptic
                           is one who judges all things according to the evidence.  many things are widely
                           affirmed by the common herd in a degree well beyond what the evidence supports.  the
                           humanistic skeptic applies a second measure, that of  harm resulting from such beliefs.  issues of economics and politics, of religion,
                           quackery, and of psychology and personal behavior top our list.   education and scientific psychology are gateways to the following the dictates of reason
