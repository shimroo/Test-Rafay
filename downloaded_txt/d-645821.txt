charity: the geoff thomas foundation
  
 in 2003, geoff thomas, the ex-england and crystal palace footballer was diagnosed with leukaemia.  a bone marrow transplant saved his life.  other blood cancer sufferers arenât so lucky. thatâs where the geoff thomas foundation is trying to help. 
 geoff is an inspiration across sport, charity, and cancer survival.  in 2005 geoff got on his bike and cycled the 3,500km of the tour de france route. he was recognised for his charity work with the bbc sports personality helen rollason award. raising money for the geoff thomas foundation will motivate vin on the toughest days of the great bike ride.  please click here to give generously.
