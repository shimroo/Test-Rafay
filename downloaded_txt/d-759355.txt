i've run faster times at every distance in my mid 30's than i ran during my college running career.
tim h, fort collins, co






jon doesn't just write schedules like most online coaches, he will spend countless hours giving you how, why and everything else you want to know about running.
ken c, san diego, ca






the coaching i receive through anaerobic management is truly exceptional in all aspects.  kimâs extensive experience as an elite runner and knowledge of the sport 
                                shines through and is directly applied to my training.  i know that great care is taken to plan workouts that are tailored specifically to me, based on my current 
                                fitness level and future goals.
donna w, denver, co








jon understands his clients' every need, from fitting the correct shoes to nutritional planning for those long days.
chris l, boise, id






jon and i joined forces 8 years ago and i now run 6 days a week for sustained health and middle distance races.  i couldn't be happier.
larry l, washington dc






being trained by kent for the past eleven years has been such a positive experience personally as he understands the priorities of work, family and unexpected challenges 
                                life can bring. he has helped to keep my running life in perspective when daily life gets âin the wayâ while continuing to push me to look for my next challenge to order 
                                keep my running experience fresh.
mary s, fort collins, co

kim jones' book






dandelion growing wild is a remarkable true story of resilience, perseverance and the power of hope. itâs a look into a large, loving, dysfunctional and oddly religious family 
                            thrust into horrific tragedy. the memoir captures the essence of innocence and the disturbing truth of poverty, mental illness, disappointment and deathâ¦ a powerful, humorous and 
                            uplifting story of a little girl who rose from those challenges to compete in the toughest competitions in the world, becoming a world-class athlete and a marathon champion.
