75 years of cavaliersin celebration of our 75 year anniversary, tom blair produced three video montages showcasing our rich history. these are not only a celebration of our organization, but a historic look at the formation of dci and the marching arts as we know them today. take a look below!

the cavaliers 1948 - 1973the cavaliers 1974 - 1998the cavaliers 1999 - 2023

these past 75 years have been incredible for cavaliers arts, performance & education. we are looking forward to some big things in year 76 and beyond- including more innovative and crowd-pleasing cavaliers shows, the expansion of the king cobras program to enrich the lives of more differently abled students than ever before, being disruptors in the indoor winds community with chromium winds, and creating world-class educational programing with gearworks. support from friends and fans like you help ensure our future! donations of any size help us fulfill our mission.

our mission:inspiring and developing young people of all backgrounds to achieve excellence in the marching arts and to become leaders and champions through education, camaraderie, and a life-changing culture of belonging.
