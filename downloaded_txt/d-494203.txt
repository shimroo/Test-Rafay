playground adventures

playcraft systems has teamed up with agents of discovery to create playground adventures, an innovative mission-based game that has children engage not only with the playground equipment, but the world around it. every child can now become an explorer embarking on a journey where every swing, slide and climber holds a secret waiting to be discovered. by completing education-based challenges throughout the site, explorers can earn rewards and compete with other players on the playground.
