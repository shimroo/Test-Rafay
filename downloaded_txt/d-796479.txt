welcome guest! would you like to log yourself in?
welcome to ronsound, home of ronsound effects and repairs. i've been in the pedal business since 1995 and i look forward to doing business with you. whether you're interested in a standard ronsound product, a custom unit, or just need an effect repaired, ronsound is here to help you out.ronsound effects are built to last with quality materials and with one goal in mind: your sound! no flashy graphics or paint jobs! ronsound effects are a treat for your ears, not the eyes. think of them as utility pedals for the guitarist who doesn't care what the pedal looks like, only that it gives the sound it should.all ronsound effects are standard equipped with true-bypass (unless noted otherwise) and a boss-style dc connector.
