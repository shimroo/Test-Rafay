chase conquerors (mi)
20th anniversary  

it's a special year for chase! this year marks 20 years for chase basketball. we started with 2 teams and maybe 20 kids to 9 teams with over 100 kids!! thank you to all the parents and coaches who waited hours on picture day to make this picture happen. it was so worth it!
                    we couldnât be more thankful for all these amazing kids! not only are they amazing athletes, they are great kids that represent their families and our organization well.  




carson hornback
hca falcons (tx)  

carson hornback made hca history by being the first  falcon to hit 1500 varsity career points. this was especially fun, because coach buren didn't tell carson where he stood in total points.  former  teammate and previous record holder, will "power" taylor, along with the falcon family,  were there to cheer him on.
