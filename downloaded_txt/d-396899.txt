“we went for an event but stayed the whole day. the exhibits were wonderful and there’s lots to do. the cafe food was exceptional as well! #disabledhiker: easy. flat paths & very accessible.” ~ jenny

 
“there is literally something here for everyone and every age group. our family takes a yearly trip to the adirondacks every year and this year on a rainy day we decided to look up a place within a moderate driving distance. we were not disappointed one bit.” ~ christian

 
“if you love the adirondacks, this is a must do!! it’s a wonderful museum (both indoor & outdoor).” ~ wendy

 
“adirondack experience is my favourite museum. i spent 3 hours and it still wasn’t enough time to see everything.” ~ ewa

 
“you definitely need a whole day to do this museum. there are both sheltered buildings and outdoor things. we were there on a rainy day, but it was still good. truly interactive! 6 and 8 year old had plenty to do to keep them engaged.” ~ cassie

 
“perfect for families. kept our kids busy and they were really into building/creating things.
a day is not enough (at least with our 3 kids) the best part js that we get to come in the next day as long as we had our sticker or reciept. it was good for 2 days.” ~ waty

 
“excellent museum for adults and kids alike! from games and art to interactive activities, such as a take home self made stamped ornament, and full sized rail cars to amazing and spectacular outdoor campus and views, this is not your average museum. set in the beautiful adirondack mountains, you’ll find friendly, thoughtful, passionate workers to help guide or educate you further on things you see, if you like. the admission price is a steal!” ~ cheryl

 
“i have to admit, the name kind of threw me off but i’m so glad i went! this is by far one of the coolest museums i’ve been to in a while. so many beautifully designed exhibits spread across an accessible campus, and a lot of really thoughtful interactive exhibits and sections. i can’t wait to come back with my kids sometime soon!” ~ ilyssa

 
“we went today. they’ve done a great job adding elements for kids. even my 3-year-old granddaughter enjoyed it and would be happy to go back. art exhibit is wonderful!”
~ n. rosborough barnett
