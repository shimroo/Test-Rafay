front yard landscaping to restore curb appeal adding new life to an existing front yard that has no curb appeal  is often worth a whole lot  more than the time and effort spent on it. if you have  plans to refurbish your own front yard landscape,  you should use the same  rules as designing and landscaping a new front yard. parking areas and  access areas should be figured so that the rest of the landscaping could  be a simple task of designing some border beds around them. still,  even with a basic plan like this, a little thought will help to make the  landscape look balanced and appealing.first thing is to assess any  problems areas. to get a whole different perspective of the  landscaping and entryway, take pictures from several different  angles. now take a look at how your property really looks and write down  the problem areas that need changing. make note of even the smallest  details. are any concrete walks broken or cracked? are any lawn areas  overgrown with weeds? is the front entryway no longer appealing and  inviting?get rid of any dead and unwanted shrubs. new ones can  be put in their place. or instead of shrubs, use ornamental grasses to  create an entirely different atmosphere in your front yard landscaping ideas.  pruning shrubs and trees will help keep their beauty. when these are  allowed to grow unchecked they can make your yard look unkempt and  uncared for.to add a little color and interest, place some  large planting containers on either side of your front steps or your  walkway. fill the pots with a combination of ornamentals plants, vines,  and colorful flowers. this will brighten your entryway and make it look  very welcoming. planters are also great for changing out different  plants at different times of the year.something to keep in  mind when planting your front landscape is that sometimes less can be  more. rather than using a large variety of plants in your front yard landscaping ideas,  create a simple planting plan. repeat two or three colors and maybe a  few evergreens throughout the landscaping and front entry. doing so will  add balance to the design.to make the entire yard look clean  and manicured, edge all walkways, driveways, and sidewalks. see that any  entry steps, driveways, or walks are clean and in good shape. fix any  breaks, stains or cracks. concrete or rock walkways that are cracked and  seriously damaged should be repaired or taken out and replaced.if landscaping styles  are too restricted and uninteresting, a few curved planting beds will  help add a softer tone.  an island bed is also a great addition to add  interest to a front yard.you may want to consider putting in  some accent walkway and foundation landscape lighting. installation is  generally easy enough to be a do it yourself job or you can hire a pro  do it. as well as the safety factor they provide, they also add elegance  to the house and landscaping at night.one final thought. take  a look at what shape the house is in. a new coat of paint and basic  needed repairs can make a hugely possitive change for the home and the  landscaping. it doesn't matter how beautiful the landscape is, people  won't be able to see it past a home that is in bad shape.

landscaping for changing weather patternsdesigning a landscape or garden that will look and function great for years to come will consider every possible factor before any plans are drawn. a very important and often overlooked factor  is climate and weather patterns. regardless of design style,  your landscaping should work with  the weather and climate that you live in. in parts of the world that experience the changes of all  four seasons, gardens and landscapes will also feel the effects of these  seasonal changes.  here are a few ideas that  may be helpful in any climate for designing landscapes or gardens.plant choices in any design in any area will be determined by what works  and what's available in your area. used quite common in desert and southwest  landscape design ideas, planting adaptive and native plants is a  good way to ensure that the plants thrive in any climate.  designing  natives into your landscaping will help make it more colorful and maintenance free all year long. native  plants are already adapted to local soils so there's no problem from  different soil. also, because they grow and propagate locally, natives  will already be climatized and adapted to your climate. regardless of  where you are, it's a good possibility that there are lots of native  plants in your area that you can use.another way to brighten  up your landscape, no matter what kind of climate you have, is by the  use of tropical or mediterranean  landscape design plants.  a lot of  tropical plant varieties will actually do well in colder  climates. do a little research on tropical plants and you may find a few  that will thrive in your area. some of the tropical plants that often  work well in non tropical climates are  bougainvillea, agapanthus, and  hibiscus. lantana, which blooms all the time and comes in several  different colors, from light lavender to vibrant shades of yellow, is  also a prime choice. mandevillas, which have beautiful trumpet shaped  flowers on long vines are also a great choice.  if you choose, there are  probably enough tropical plant varieties that will work in your area  and possibly give your landscaping some interest all year long. seasonal diversity is also an important element for landscaping or  gardens with different climates. for example,  you can use plants in the  landscaping  with different bloom times and patterns. in this way, when one type of  plant finishes its season, you'll still have something blooming in your landscaping or garden. the key here is a little research and  planning for the different bloom schedules of your different plant  choices. know which ones are at bloom for each season and choose one or  two for each season that you would like to include in your design. and of course, along with the plants, you can also use other decor and  ornaments in your landscape design to add even more visual interest.  ornaments and garden decor generally make good placements since they  aren't really effected by changes in the climate or weather. you can  also use elements like statues, stone pathways, and other hardscapes to  make your design more interesting.

creative front yard landscaping ideaslandscaping ideas for front yards generally follow an entirely different  set of needs than those for the back. the front yard design will almost  always have to address the need for accessibility and entry into the  home. also, being the first thing that folks see when they visit or pass  by your house, the front yard landscape usually gives them a first  impression of your home as well as your landscaping. not generaly an  area designed to spend a lot of time in, front yards basically serve as  the entry, access, and exit of the home.  basically, a front yard  landscape design can get a good start by designing the necessary  walkways or driveways and then the rest of the design can often be  created around that.planting ideas and schemes in front yards  often place a lot of focus on the house and how it sits on the property.  the same as the rest of the landscaping elements like fences, walkways,  and driveways, it's important that the plants placed around the home  also complement it. trees and shrubs have the ability to create unity  between the house and its surrounding by helping the building seem more a  natural part of the landscape and softening the hard lines. the corners of the house and the entryway door are two areas that need  special consideration when you're creating your landscaping  ideas and plans. basically, the door is the focal point of the house  and it often good practice to place short plantings on either side of  it. for the corners however, tall plants are a great choice since they  help soften the corners as well as lead the eye toward the front door  and the plants surrounding it.trees are a wonderful addition  to front  yard landscaping also because they can frame the home. they can be  used to place visual interest on the home making it the most outstanding  feature in the landscape. generally, you should grow trees that have a  mature size that is close to the same scale of the house. take care when  planting shade trees that they're tall enough to create shade and keep  the home cool but not so tall that they dwarf the house. on the other  side of the coin, planting shorter trees can make the house appear  taller and possibly out of proportion as well.consider the  different shapes of different trees and then select those with a shape  that will best fit the style of the home. a house with a steeply angled  roof line and dormer windows normally call for pyramidal trees, like  birch and spruces. for dwellings that have the low lines of the ranch  style,  the horizontal or round shape of maples and dogwoods works very  well.aside from the plants and trees, the open lawn is also  important in many landscape  design styles since it can provide an excellent setting for the  house. a front yard with a patch of lawn surrounded by clean flower  beds, shrubs, and ornamental plants can add the illusion of a bigger  space than there is. be mindful when planting shrubs as they can appear  to be out of place and floating on their own if not planted in  designated planting beds or groups.creating beautiful and  successful front yard landscaping ideas always starts with a complete  and finished plan. even if you plan to do the project in steps over  time, a complete plan is important to keep the project on track. without  it, you'll end up with a patch work landscape that was obviously pieced  together.take the time to consider all we've learned in this article  and create a finished plan first.front yard landscapes often  place the main focus on creating an inviting entry while also accenting  the view of the home. and coming up with a great design can really be as  simple as designating the necessary walkways and entries and then  designing around them.

outdoor christmas yard decorationscomputerized outdoor christmas yard decorations are taking on in a big way all over the country. with the help of electronic and computerized decorations and local communities, a lot of cities are becoming large tourist attractions just like  christmas on the pecos in carlsbad, new mexico. when decorating for christmas or any other holiday, having close access to plenty of electricity is a welcome convenience. at the same time, not having enough can also be a setback of not being able to decorate the way you want to. while most modern houses have plenty of outlets on the walls of the home, very few have electricity in the yard. some christmas yard decorations and displays can use a lot of electricity and outlets. having access right where you need it is so much better than having extension cords stretched out all over the yard. so having electrical outlets installed throughout the landscaping is a great idea. the amount of power you’ll need will obviously depend on the extent of your decorating displays. over planning for too much is always better than not enough. have your electricians create the right size power supply and network for your decorations. and then have them place outlets where you know you’ll have christmas yard decorations. nothing is worse to a landscaping project than the visibility of utilities. along with other utilities like transformers and meters, outlets can’t be avoided and so we have to find some creative ways of hiding them or blending them with the landscaping. one of the easiest ways to hide outlets is to place them in planting beds nearest to the areas where you’ll have outdoor christmas decorations. there are also weatherproof outlet boxes that can be set directly into lawns and flowerbeds as well as fake rocks. christmas lights and outdoor decorations have been around and used for quite a long time. it’s interesting and entertaining to see how far they’ve come. click here to read about the history and origin of using christmas lights and outdoor decorations.
