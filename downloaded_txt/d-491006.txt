a message from the comtra family:

it is with great sadness that we announce the closure of the comtra theatre, despite our best endeavors to preserve a space for artistic expression, community, engagement, and the performing arts.
unfortunately, we can no longer sustain the operational costs and demands required to maintain our operations. we extend our heartfelt gratitude to all who have supported us throughout the years, including loyal audiences, dedicated volunteers, talented actors, directors, musicians, costumers, set builders, choreographers, and many others who have contributed to our theatre.
we also acknowledge and appreciate the pioneering spirit of marie, whose vision led to the founding of the comtra theatre over 42 years ago. 
we wish you all the best in 2025.
