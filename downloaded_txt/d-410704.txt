beliefs my separation from the libertarian party 
december 18, 2024december 18, 2024 joe white 



since may of 2022 a group called the mises caucus has had control of the libertarian national committee and a number of state affiliates. their first order or business was to make the party welcoming to bigots by striking from our by-laws our anti-bigotry language. since that time the mc have actively recruited those whose words and actions i find reprehensible, and have used their positions to enrich themselves and to sell out the party.a large number of lp members left after the mc takeover: membership and donations have both plunged while they have held sway. many of us fought to retake the party at our national convention this past may, but the numbers of the faithful remaining were not enough to dislodge mc’s grip on power.unfortunately, i no longer have the time, will, or energy to fight.
i am resigning as treasurer of lpharris, and will be putting my lifetime memberships in both national and lptexas in abeyance while the mises caucus has power in the party. i cannot in good conscience continue to be associated with their vileness and self-serving abuse of the party i had been proud to call mine since 2013.
i hope i am able to return someday.

i am honored to be the newly-elected president of the gilbert & sullivan society of houston. i want to state my gratitude for the leadership of our immediate past president, steve mccary, who remains on the board and will chair the production committee.
members of the board thought i should introduce myself, so – if you want to know who i am – read on.
my love of gilbert & sullivan came about through my father, jerry, who bought a cassette of g&s “greatest hits” after watching the movie chariots of fire, in which the music of g&s figures quite prominently. we played that tape endlessly on family road trips and learned all the songs by heart. the next year, beaumont civic opera decided to perform h.m.s. pinafore and my entire family – my father, my mother norma, my brother david, and myself – all sang in the chorus. i’ve been hooked ever since.
i joined the society in 1990 when i became a chorister for yeoman of the guard. in the ensuing third of a century i have sung in the chorus, understudied, performed lead roles, created the society’s first website, worked in the box office, cleaned the warehouse, served on the board, organized sing-alongs, and bicycled from houston to chicago to fundraise for the society. through the society i have made life-long friends and met the love of my life, anne née curran…herself a lifetime houston g&s member, being the daughter of former society performer diana linder and step-daughter of our long-time conductor robert linder.
i have also performed g&s roles at the hot springs music festival and with the young artists program at the international gilbert & sullivan festival, and was the éminence grise of the rice light opera society, where i also was a performer, director (both stage and technical), and producer. i have appeared as a soloist and member of the ensemble with many churches, synagogues, and other groups in houston, including the bach society and cantare, and was executive director of opera vista, a recipient of the houston press’s mastermind award, where i staged world premiers of several operas.
when i’m not involved in a performance, you can find me working as a freelance it consultant, driving our daughter kate to rehearsals, or cycling on back roads around houston.
i look forward to continuing our mission of bringing first-rate productions of these wonderful operas to houston audiences, and i thank you all for your continued support as we build on the success of the past seventy-two years.

four years ago, i wrote up a list of dos and don’ts for my clients to help keep them safe on their computers. many found the list extremely helpful, and when i would visit they would proudly point out where they had taped it up by their computer or that they had shared it with their family and friends.
i’ve now started giving presentations based on the list, and have updated it a bit. here is the pdf version.
