clarissa ward, cnn chief international correspondent






“people often come to me asking for advice about finding an agent. i always urge them to meet steve and carol. they have represented me since 2007, guiding my career through some important and difficult transitions. they are tenacious and dedicated and smart and persistent. more importantly though, they listen- to what motivates me, what my strengths are, what my goals are- and they have supported me endlessly in trying to forge a path that feels true to who i am. they explain and advise but they don’t bully or force. i don’t know any other agents out there who devote as much time and as much thought to their clients and their work as steve and carol. they just get it. oh, and they’re smart and cool as well and i consider them to be friends, which makes working together all the more fun.”


























mireya villarreal, abc news national correspondent 






“i never thought i’d need an agent. i mean, agents are the guys (or girls) who help lebron james take his talents to miami. why would i need an agent for the news business? rookie presumption. i was at the point in my career where i wanted to be treated equally and compensated for the results i was producing in my market. but walking into a news director’s office and asking for that is scary and uncomfortable; yes, even for an investigative reporter. that’s where carol perry and if management come in. they were confident in my abilities and treated me like a person, not just another client. once i signed on with if i had meetings all over the country. they open doors. they set up meetings. they give you advice. they boost your confidence. they recognize your potential and sell your best qualities. carol perry fought hard to find the right home for me. she was aggressive and diligent. but more than anything, she listened to what i wanted for myself and for my family and made it happen. thank you to carol, steve and if management for all they do.”


























chris stewart, law & crime network host






i first met the if management team in 2013 as a young reporter in a small market just starting my career. over the last decade, steve and the if team have helped me navigate the world of tv news. i moved up to a larger tv market and then transitioned to an anchor position for a national news network available on tvs across the country. reid, steve, and carol have contacts at all the major networks and help you connect with major players in the industry.  not only has the if been in my corner during contract negotiations and job searches, but they’ve also helped me develop as a broadcaster. reid is always available for a phone call to listen to ideas or to provide feedback on a recent broadcast i’ve anchored. for as rewarding and exciting as the broadcast news industry is, it is also unpredictable and i’m happy if is with me on this journey.


























dr. john torres, nbc medical correspondent 






only one word describes carol and steve at if management....amazing! i first met them when i started off as a contributor in a small market. they saw something in me i didn't and took the huge gamble to bring me into the if family. over the years i could always rely on carol to tell me exactly what i needed to hear, exactly when i needed to hear it, no sugar coating needed! because of her hard work, experience in the field and belief in me as well as her innumerable contacts across the nation i was able to move to a much larger market and then to my surprise, nbc. and over the years, even though i was at times ready to throw in the towel, she kept me motivated and more importantly kept my dreams alive. simply put...they care!


























nichole berlie, newsnation anchor/host and correspondent 






“carol is amazing - she’s smart, she’s worked unbelievably hard on behalf of me and she's easy to talk to. great combination!”
