rauk wins a prize!
much to my surprise, this site was entered 
				  by someone unknown into the "pets at home"  reptile and 
				  amphibian section of the pawfection awards. i have since been 
				  advised that we have been selected as the section winner. 
				  below is the notification:-
"after much deliberation and sorting 
				  through best pet advice sites on the internet, we are happy to 
				  announce the winners of the pets at home pawfection award 
				  2012! 
				  we are pleased to announce that
				  
				  http://www.herpetofauna.co.uk/ has been selected as the 
				  winning site for the other reptile category! the judges made 
				  particular reference to your identification section. as a 
				  pawfection winner, you will receive â£100 of pets at home 
				  vouchers as well as a mention and link from the pets at home 
				  website."

this is obviously a great surprise and 
				  excellent news, particularly as it will help defer the costs 
				  of running the forum (not that pets at home sell anything for 
				  the forum, but they do sell supplies that we can use thus 
				  releasing money to pay for the website).
so, many thanks to whoever nominated 
				  us and, of course, to pets at home!

forum news
i am pleased to say that i have now managed 
				  to recover all of the missing authors and threads following on 
				  from the attack on, and collapse of the original website.
unfortunately, the database was so corrupted 
				  that it did not prove possible to import them into the new 
				  forum. as a result you will now see a new menu option 
				  "archived forums". this leads to a basic snapshot of the forum 
				  as it was at 29th march 2011. it is basic, there is no posting 
				  and navigation is somewhat simplified but hopefully fully 
				  usable. 
i am particularly pleased as the "lost" 
				  members, and their posts, included people like david bird and 
				  caleb - long time valued contributors to the forum.
in due course some of the older topics (i.e. 
				  those without posts for the last 3+ years) will also be 
				  transferred to the new archive thus saving precious and 
				  expensive space on the new server.
brief technical details 
				  (for the tech minded):-
the corruption of the old ms access database 
				  led to a loss of data integrity which in turn meant that the 
				  table relationships were completely ineffective. while it is
				  probably technically possible to restore the missing 
				  data to the new forum it was simply not practical. accordingly 
				  the data was exported to mysql and a new "read only" forum 
				  created reading that data using php.
