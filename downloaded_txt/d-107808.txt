what our customers are saying about us








countertrade has been nothing but professional in assisting me. it seems they work tirelessly on my behalf. (i know this because sometimes a sales rep is working online with email late at night or early morning). they gently explain to me how a different item might meet my needs better than what i am asking for, and the sales reps do this with patience and good humor.

i consider countertrade on my very short list of trusted partners. countertrade has earned this trust by consistently exceeding my expectations. in short, due to countertrade’s technical expertise, customer service skills, and business integrity, i highly recommend them to it shops looking to do more with less. i believe that you will be as satisfied as i have been. 
							mike porter, technology director, englewood schools

the sales team is the best. they work with you to find the best pricing. they will help you find what you need even if they haven’t sold it before at competitive prices. i’ve worked with them over four years and rarely use anyone else. they are that good. i can’t recommend them highly enough. 
							tom stokovaz, director of information technology, liberty common schools

i have been working with jessica eaton for about 2 years and she is an absolute joy to work with, wonderful customer service skills, always willing to help and fix any problem that i run into. she is the greatest asset to the company. i look forward to working with her more in the future.

frank clawson demonstrates exactly what a vendor should be. when called he has answers and doesn't need to reach back out to the core supplier,  he has helped engineer our post platform for over 10 years and is quick to explain the nuances that have driven change and what "bang for the buck" we the customer see in return,  the post hardware in located in out of the way countries and the deployment support in bar none.
