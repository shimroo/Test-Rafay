the chicago women’s liberation union

  

the cwlu (1969 to 1976) was the most significant of the socialist feminist women’s unions established during the “second wave” feminist movement. cwlu was formed in 1969 and played a leading role in the women’s liberation movement in chicago during the 1970s. cwlu recognized that the liberation of women was not possible unless it also fought against racism and capitalism, and for gay and lesbian liberation. questions? contact us.
