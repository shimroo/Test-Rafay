horse riding for children ny

if you are looking for horse riding for children ny, then you need to go to a place where they are well versed in teaching children how to ride as well as be able to communicate with the animals.

communication with horses is done through your body language and how you sit atop a horse. it is an important aspect to learn when riding a horse as riding a horse is comparable to driving a car. you need to know what you are doing before you can take off.


horse riding for children ny
those who have children who want to learn how to ride should make sure that they are taught in the correct manner with equine training ny.
when children take equine training ny, they not only learn how to ride, but why the horse will react in certain ways. this is vital to know if any child plans on going away from a trail ride on a horse. there are many children who love to ride horses because they are fortunate enough to have them where they live and maybe even own horses.

others learn because they want to be in competition, although a love of the animals is what often drives any child to want to ride a horse. children need to know safety issues when they plan on riding a horse, something that is taught at horse riding for children ny.

  horse riding was a way of life in the united states for centuries and in some areas of the country, even after cars came on the scene.

horses are still used for crowd control by law enforcement as well as for leisure rides. many people still have stables and keep horses so that they can enjoy the freedom of being able to go on trails and paths where they can ride and cars cannot go.

horse riding is an enjoyable way to view nature as well. you can cover more ground riding the horse than you can on foot. there is also the thrill aspect of the ride. the horse can move fast, thus taking you along. before a person can hope to gallop, though, they have to learn to walk. the lessons usually begin for children as a walk that teaches them to tell the horse, by their body movements, where to go, when to start and when to stop.

as a child progresses in lessons, they will have more control over the horse.

children who are a bit apprehensive at first about being atop these animals will lose their fear and be able to control the animal instead of allowing it to control them. then they are ready to move a little faster on the horse. some will learn jumping, an english style of riding while others may learn western style which is without helmets and jumping.

¬†there are various ways to ride a horse and enjoy the time spent with these animals. those who want to give their children horse riding lessons in sullivan county, ny can do so at a place that is expertly equipped in equine training.

selecting a good equestrian horse riding helmet

one of the essential pieces of equestrian equipment is a horse riding helmet. wearing protective gear while riding a pony is one of those things that some people take for granted until the day they need one. a fall from an animal not only involves the unknown elements on the ground such as rocks, but it also requires knowing what the horse is up to. as you are falling from your mount, a kick to the head can be more damaging than the fall itself. that is why a good horse riding helmet is essential.
another reason that a horse riding helmet is important is because you never know what will happen when you are riding. while you have some measure of control of your mount, you do not have control over the birds flying overhead or the things that can spook your animal into a trot. a low-flying bird that you do not see coming can be painful and so can a low-hanging tree branch that is just about head high as your animal breaks into an unexpected trot.
  the right riding gear is one that you purchase brand new and break in on your own. in order for head protection to work properly, it needs to fit right. a used unit has already been broken in by someone else and it could take twice as long for you to get it to fit right as it would a new one. the other issue with a used horse riding helmet is that there could be damage to the interior padding that you may not see until the day you need it. when that padding should be there but is not, then that could result in a devastating injury.
it is critical that your horse riding helmet fall comfortably no less than one inch above your brow. if your helmet sits too low, then there is a chance that it could fall over your eyes when you leap over an obstacle on the course. remember that the fit of your horse riding helmet should be so comfortable that the chin strap would almost not be necessary. the gear should only move when your head moves. if you look to your side quickly and the head gear does not make the turn with you, then you need to find a different product.
the chinstrap on your horse riding helmet is essential in holding your head gear in place as you experience the ups and downs of equestrian sport. make sure that the strap does not have sharp edges that could cut into your skin and cause unexpected damage. the snaps on your helmet need to be durable but also easy enough for you to remove when you need to.
the color of your equestrian head gear only becomes important in competition. but do not make the mistake of trying to have separate helmets for practice and competition. your competition head gear needs to be broken in and fit perfectly if it is going to give you the protection you need.

horseback riding yosemite national park






if you'd like to explore the splendor of the sierra mountains, try horseback riding in yosemite national park in california. regardless of your experience level, there is something for everyone with guided trail rides, multi-hour and multi-day camping trips and even pony rides for the kids. following are some of the great horseback riding options available to you at yosemite national park.
at the park's stables in yosemite valley, tuolumne meadows and wawona, you can choose from two-hour, four-hour and all-day very reasonably priced trail rides. rates start at $35 per person for a two-ride ride and cost about $70 for all-day rides. you should note that all day horseback rides require a three-person minimum. if you'd like to find out more and to make reservations for rides at one of these locations, call valley stables at 209-372-8326; tuolumne meadows stables at 209-372-8427; or wawona stables at 209-375-6502 
for a more of a back-country horseback riding experience, you can sign on for one of high sierra's camp and saddle trips. these four, five or six day excursions head out from the tuolumne stables and take place during the months of july through september, weather permitting. on one of these adventures, you'll be led by professional, experienced guides and packers who will entertain you with folklore and points of interest throughout the trip. they also take care of everything for you - they pack all the food, gear and feed for the animals. another engaging part of this journey is that your personal items will be carried through the trails on pack mules. prices start at around $550 and range up to about $875 depending on the length of the trip you choose and you can even request customized rides. contact yosemite stables by calling 209-372-8348.
with yosemite trails, you can take a one or two-hour long horseback ride through the awesome, scenic loop of the sierra national forest to get a really up close and personal experience with nature. if you'd like to spend a little more time in the saddle, you can opt to take a 5 1/2 hour trip that includes a ride though the mariposa grove within yosemite park. in addition to the rest of the park's splendor, you'll also get to see the incredible 2,000 year-old mariposa trees. it's recommended you bring a lunch on this one. prices for these three rides range from $30 to $80 - which ain't bad!
yosemite trails also offers lead horse rides for children under the age of 7. your child's horse will be led around the stables by one of the park's qualified wranglers for around $20 for 15 minutes. for more information, you can call yosemite trails at 559-683-7611.

some basic (but important) horseback riding tips





even if you are an experienced horseback rider, there might still be a few things you could learn to help make your ride safer and more enjoyable. especially for novice riders, there are definitely lots of things to keep in mind to not only enhance the pleasure of your experience, but also for safety reasons. following are some tips to help you prepare for your ride.
* always check your equipment thoroughly and make any necessary repairs before you head out. take along some string, a pocket knife and strips of leather because if your tack fails, you might be able to make at least some temporary repairs enabling you to ride home instead of walking. 
* avoid riding alone, especially for younger and beginner-level riders.  if you have even a minor accident and you're alone, you could end up in serious or possibly life threatening situation. also bring along a cell phone or walk-talkie.
* wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. if it's too warm for long-sleeves, bring along a lightweight jacket that will protect you from scrapes and sunburn. covering your arms and legs will also help to keep the bugs from biting you. 
* take some bug repellent with you. insects flying around your face and your horse can really be an annoyance. keep in mind that most animals don't like the sound of aerosol spray cans, especially close to their ears. purchase repellent in a small plastic pump bottle or in a lotion version. this way, you can apply some repellent to your face and hands and also on the horse's face and ears.
* wear hard-soled boots with a small heal. try to avoid wearing boots with deep arches or large treads because they can cause your feet to get caught in the stirrups.  
* wear protective head gear because not only can a riding helmet provide protection in the event of a fall, but you might also encounter tree branches or other hazards along the way. 
* wear sunglasses to help provide protection against ultraviolet rays and dust or dirt that can fly up and get in your eyes.
* bring one of those compact, waterproof ponchos with you. they are small enough to fit in your shirt pocket and are good to have in case of a sudden rain.
* fanny packs around your around your waist are okay for smaller items you want to take with you, but don't wear a back pack because they have a tendency to throw off your balance and can also get caught in tree limbs.
by following a few simple guidelines you'll have a much nicer ride and a happier horse too!

horseback riding in hawaii






there are lots of places to go horseback riding on the beautiful island of hawaii. you can choose from trails through its exotic, untouched mountains and valleys with fabulous waterfalls and scenery to privately-owned, horse ranches and stables with beautiful landscapes. following are two options where you'll no doubt experience the horseback adventure of a lifetime.
top of waipio
top of waipio is located on a ridge way above the waipio valley, where you will find some of the most breathtaking scenery on the island of hawaii. this area remains untouched as the sugar cane companies have restricted access to it. you can only get to the overlooks by horseback, foot, atvs or mountain bikes. helicopters are not even allowed to get close the rim of the base of the valley! 
on horseback, you will ride for two and a half hours through lush, open fields where you'll encounter cows, sugar cane, wild flowers and views of the magnificent haleakala volcano, twenty-five miles away. you can also opt for a fantastic five-hour hidden waterfall ride. this includes the same beautiful experience of the shorter ride, but continues back along the stream that feeds into the hi'ilawe falls. you will ride deep into the rainforest and encounter a series of smaller waterfalls and secret pools. you can tie up your horse and hike down to a very private waterfall which spills into a stunning, ginger-lined pool. then enjoy yourself as you picnic and swim in this hidden, magical place. for more information on this heavenly adventure, go to www.waipioridgestables.com and click on the horseback riding link at the bottom of the page.
dahana ranch
dahana ranch provides safe and fun horseback rides and activities and prides themselves on their 'aloha' spirit. they offer several different riding options and welcome families with children as young as three-years-old. you can take a one and half hour, open-range 'ranch ride' which covers about four miles of spectacular territory where you'll encounter cattle, sheep, horses and more including fantastic views of the mauna kea and waipi'o valley. they also offer a 'range station' ride for the more adventurous. you can get as loud as you want helping to move their herd of brahman crossbreds across the ranch. dahana ranch accommodates riders of all skill levels but does offer a two-hour advanced ride tailored for owners and competitors with lots of freedom on open land. they are open seven days a week with rides daily and by reservation. visit them at www.dahanaranch.com.
for a full list of locations where you can go horseback riding in hawaii, visit the alternative-hawaii website's sports and recreation / horseback riding page at http://www.alternative-hawaii.com/activity/bisrhb.htm.

horseback riding lessons







if you've invested in a horse of your own, want to take riding lessons so that you can visit the stables and go riding with some previous experience or even if you're planning a horseback riding vacation, horseback riding lessons are a definitely a good idea, especially for the beginner or novice rider. but even if you're experienced in certain areas, you might want to go further still and advance your skills by training for competition riding or racing.

there are several different kinds of horseback riding lessons you can take, depending on where your interests in the sport lie. there are clinics devoted to every age group and include training for ranchers, competition riding, lessons for the recreational rider and even classes on learning how to deal with problem horses. you can take one-on-one or group lessons or special classes taught by internationally renowned horseback riders. 

the length of the lessons will vary and but most are normally for around one hour or so. usually, when you arrive for your lesson, you will be given an initial assessment of your skills. then the you and your instructor can evaluate what goals you want to reach and set up the type of lessons you'll need based on that information. 

here are a few different categories of horseback riding lessons available, based on levels of experience, to help you determine which area you fall under.

beginner: a person who has limited experience, is unable to post the trot (set the pace) and does not canter (cantering is slower than a galloping pace, but faster than trotting). 

novice: a rider who is capable of mounting and dismounting the horse without assistance, can apply basic aids, is comfortable and in control at a walking pace and who can ride for a moderate length trot and short canters. 

intermediate: a rider who has a firm seat (balanced and comfortable in the saddle), is confident and in control at all paces including posting trots, two-point canters and gallops, but does not ride regularly. 

strong intermediate: an intermediate rider who is currently riding regularly and is comfortable being in the saddle for at least six hours a day. 

advanced: a rider who encompasses all of the above skills in addition to an independent seat, soft hands (light but commanding control of the reigns) and who is capable of handling a spirited horse in open country. 

there are numerous horse stables across the united states and internationally that offer lessons at various levels. browse around online to find one in your area, and be sure that you choose an instructor who you feel comfortable with so you can get the most out of your learning experience.related articles by zemantagood transitions- trot to canter (piaffedreams.blogspot.com)the equestrian's guide to reaching your goals (altitudebranding.com)stubborn as a ... dressage champ?; rider says her mules are like 'rideable border collies' (bendbulletin.com)writers and riders (piaffedreams.blogspot.com)steps to training a horse (slideshare.net)steps to training a horse - gentle horse training (slideshare.net)thirty-fourth annual hunter trials at hpa (guavabee.com)you: horse riding in the south of france (guardian.co.uk)noses take about 6 weeks to strengthen after rhinoplasty (realself.com)

horseback riding boots






the types of boots you choose to wear when horseback riding can play a big part in the level of enjoyment you'll get during your ride. boots come in a wide variety of styles and are designed in several different categories. one thing for sure is to always choose a boot with a smaller heal, lower arch and no deep treads so that you can avoid getting your feet stuck in the stirrups. here's some background on the types of boots that are available.

all terrain riding sneakers / barn boots

if you like to stop and hike a little during your day out riding horses, these are a good option to consider. this type of shoe is a cross between comfortable sneakers, paddock boots and hiking shoes. barn boots, as they're also called, are lightweight, breathable and very durable and will give you stability along with comfort. most are made with waterproof materials for both men and women, and are also ergonomically designed with special soles for improved cushioning and air circulation.

paddock boots

paddock boots are easier to deal with than the taller style of riding boots and they're also much safer than riding in your favorite pair of old sneakers although just as comfortable. they are available in zip-up, lace-up and pull on styles and also provide you stability while you're on the ground as well as in the stirrups.

tall riding boots

riding boots that are taller at either knee or a little over in length can not only protect your legs, but also come in dressier styles because they are common attire worn by sporting and competition horse riders such as jockeys, equestrians and polo players. they are usually designed with appearance, comfort and performance in mind and are available in an extensive variety.

field boots

when the weather isn't so nice outside, throwing on a pair of field boots can alleviate the work of having to clean and/or condition your regular riding boots. they are designed to be very durable in addition to comfortable and are a very popular choice for riding or taking care of your horse during nastier weather conditions.

western or 'cowboy' boots

the great thing about cowboy boots is that they are genderless and ageless, worn by men, women and children. this type of boot has been around for centuries and although they come in an enormous variety of styles and designs, are still made with the same basic working concepts in mind. the lower heel, smooth sole, height of the boot to protect your legs and convenient finger loops make them easy to pull on are still today, the most popular choice of boot for western-style horse riders.
