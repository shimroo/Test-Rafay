northeast drought status


some improvement, some degradation
several places including parts of west virginia saw an inch or more of precipitation, allowing drought and/or abnormal dryness to be trimmed. meanwhile, an ongoing lack of precipitation led to some drought expansion in parts of southern new england. much of the northeast remained status quo. timely precipitation was seen at some sites along the interstate 95 corridor in the mid-atlantic; although, notable deficits remain. for example, deficits for the september 1 and february 11 period include 5.80 below normal (6.72 inches last week) in washington, d.c., 9.24 inches below normal (9.44 inches last week) in baltimore, 10.81 inches below normal (10.93 inches last week) in wilmington, 10.44 inches below normal (10.58 inches last week) in philadelphia, and 9.76 inches below normal (10.19 inches last week) in newark.
          
extreme (d3) drought persisted in new jersey and delaware.
          severe (d2) drought was trimmed in a sliver of northeast new jersey and southwestern new york.
          moderate (d1) drought contracted in parts of west virginia, western maryland, and southwestern pennsylvania but expanded to include block island, ri, and nantucket, ma. 
          abnormal dryness (d0) coverage was reduced in the regionâs southwestern corner. 
		  record low streamflow persisted in the regionâs southeastern corner, while the salt front along the delaware river pushed nearly nine miles farther north than usual.
          record low groundwater levels were found in 10 out of the 12 northeast states. 
          reservoir levels in new jersey were generally level or declined slightly, remaining near or below average. 
          below- or near-normal precipitation is predicted for the northeast for the 8-14 day periods (february 20 to 26), which may keep conditions status quo.
          
          the nrccâs full weekly drought update can be found here.
