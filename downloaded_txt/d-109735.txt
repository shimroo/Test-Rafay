great used car lot. salesperson jordan was extremely nice and cool and knows his product. very professional with no rush and stress to buy a car now and right now.  good and fair prices on products. highly recommended for used cars.

dear demontrond owner,
it's been over two weeks now since your service department fixed my car and so far, it is running really well. in fact, on the day that i got it from the shop, i noticed immediately that it has more power whenever i step on the gas. the engine sounds more solid and i'm beginning to enjoy driving it.
i am writing to thank you and your service department for a job well done. thank you for honoring your promise to fix what is broken no matter the cost and however long it takes ( i'm still under warranty). for a long while now, i've had this love and hate relationship with your dealership simply because of the multiple times my car needing to be fixed. i am hoping that with this recent fix, i will have a change of heart - one that is of gratitude for all the earnest efforts you have done to make things right. thank you once again. merry christmas to you and all of your hard working staff!

hansen hobbs sold me a kia rio for my son’s first car. he was efficient and friendly and went above and beyond to ensure i knew everything about the car and was satisfied with my purchase.  he worked with his manager to get me a good deal and even shared some amazing homemade tamales with me.  when i had to leave before the car was ready to go to a wedding, he made sure to get it in top detailed condition and then delivered it to my house himself (40 min away!).  i have been through the car buying experience multiple times and this was hands down the best experience ever.  thank you mr. hobbs!
