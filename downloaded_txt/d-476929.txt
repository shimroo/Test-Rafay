cna travellers – customer reviews





“we had the holiday of a lifetime in canada.
thanks so much for your meticulous planning and perfect tour of this amazing part of canada – it was even better than i hoped! knight inlet was absolutely stunning and we were so lucky to see grizzly bears, a black bear close up, bald eagles, ospreys, deer and lots of amazing wildlife. the drive from jasper to banff with the green lakes and snow covered mountains was drop jaw beautiful! the whole trip was incredible and will remain a lifelong cherished memory for all the family.”
 
aitchison party (ultimate canadian rockies & coastal canada) 

we really want to say what a fantastic trip it was, and how much we appreciate and acknowledge the customer service offered to us by you and your team. 
everything was as expected, all bookings and information were correct.  we just want to say thank you to everyone at complete north america for helping us achieve one of our long awaited experiences.  we would certainly recommend (and already have!) complete north america to our friends and family. 
 
jones party 

we thought you might like some feedback on our recent trip organised by complete north america. overall the experience was excellent. 
all the admin arrangements in terms of vouchers, itinerary etc worked like clockwork. all the accommodation was of a very good standard considering our price range and very varied.  all the excursions included by you were excellent. you clearly listened carefully to the specification we gave you and met it fully. we have no hesitation in recommending your firm to friends. 
 
feedback on canada trip 

just a few lines to thank you and your team for our wonderful holiday. we have just returned from the san francisco to san diego fly/drive trip you organised for us.
it was truly fantastic. everything worked like clockwork. the travel pack you sent out was correct in every detail, the location and standard of each hotel was superb, and the route planner meticulously accurate. we cannot fault a single thing! we will definitely recommend you to our friends and family.
 
the warburton family 

thank you so much for helping to make our holiday to boston, rhode island and cape cod so successful. we came to you and within 24 hours you had put together a possible package. you found perfect hotels to suit our budget but with superb locations. you booked us flights via iceland to save us money and a welcome leg stretch but hardly any further travel time. and you organised the car with pick up five minutes from our hotel in boston.
throughout the planning and ‘waiting to go’ time you were always at the end of the phone for my questions and worries. a person always answered the phone straight away and emails and documents came quickly. i will definitely use you again when i return to america. thank you!
 
the humphrey party 

thanks to andy at cna for his genuine passion for the trip and also his vast knowledge and friendly personality. we should also note that we never actually met in person, due to us being based in the north of scotland, so this was all done in trust over phone and emails. the holiday was fantastically organised with no issues at any point. the flights, hotels and hire car were all there ready to go and no issues on checking in.it was an absolutely brilliant holiday that we will never forget and andy deserves a lot of credit for making it a very enjoyable process and more importantly for us â a very smooth, uneventful process as well.
we would highly recommend booking with complete north america.
 
daniel & sarah 

we just wanted to write and say thank you for organising such a fantastic holiday for us.
everything was made so easy for us and the attention to detail in the documentation was excellent. we really enjoyed all of the accommodation â there was a good variety but all were of a high standard.
thank you for all your help â we have been recommending your company to friends and family.
 
sue and derek collins 

back home after 3,100 miles on (and off)  route 66, i’m writing to thank you and meghan, and the rest of the team at complete north america, for your splendid organisation of our trip. 
apart from the initial problem at chicago with the hire car which i outlined to you by email and which, of course, was outside of your control, everything went very smoothly and more than lived up to our expectations.
