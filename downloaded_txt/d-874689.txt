welcome to montvale springs 







 







nestled in the foothills of the chilhowee mountains, montvale springs has long served as a gathering place for people of all ages seeking respite, healing, and restoration. throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, the mineral springs at montvale attracted guests from around the world to take the “healing waters” of montvale springs.  the first hotel was built on the property in 1832 and was aptly named the montvale springs hotel.  the original log hotel was destroyed by fire and rebuilt to a larger scale in 1853 by a new owner who named it the seven gables hotel.  in 1933, the seven gables hotel also fell prey to a fire that destroyed all but the stone foundation and center steps of the original structure, which remain intact at the historic seven gables pavilion. approximately 14 years later, the property was purchased by the ymca and captured the hearts of thousands of campers who enjoyed camp montvale for nearly 55 years until it closed in 2005.  











in 2008, former camp montvale counselor sam furrow purchased the property and gifted it to harmony family center in 2010. since then, montvale has been renovated and restored for a variety of uses including therapeutic camps serving individuals, children, and families, equine therapy services, fundraising events, weddings, and reunions. additionally, the property can be rented by outside organizations for camps, retreats, and community gatherings.today, invited guests will find a picturesque mountain retreat with cabins that can sleep a total of 145 people, a barn and stable, a beautifully renovated dining hall which can also be used for indoor meeting space, a 155,000-gallon pool, a 17-element challenge course, a climbing tower, numerous hiking trails, several covered open-air pavilions, basketball and sand volleyball courts, an athletic field, interactive playground and more. 







 












private events held at montvale springs allow harmony to continue to fund and expand our therapeutic work with children, adults, and families and ensures that montvale continues to be a place of healing for generations to come.
