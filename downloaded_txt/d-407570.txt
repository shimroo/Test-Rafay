welcome to
corvairkid enterprises. 
this web site has a detailed focus on a few particular corvair topics, rather 
than a broad survey of the entire corvair marque. (several other web sites do a 
great job of providing the broad story.)

	owners and their cars (from the september, 2008
	 
	corsa communique) 
	and learn about what 
	makes swiss corvairs different from those in north america (from the 
	october, 2008

	addendum (main
