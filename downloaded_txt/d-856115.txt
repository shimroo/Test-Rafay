	 projected standings
    


in the early 80's bill james in one of his baseball abstracts unveiled what is called the baseball's pythagorean winning percentage. baseball's pythagorean winning percentage is a model which attempts to estimate a teams winning percentage by using runs scored and runs allowed as the inputs.the formula is simple yet accurate:pythagorean winning percentage = runs scored^2 / (runs scored^2+runs allowed^2)using retrosheet data i have confirmed what many people speculated previously, that pythagorean winning percentage is a better estimator of a teams future winning percentage than actual winning percentage. to do this, i looked at all major league teams from 2000-2006:1. calculated wp% and pythagorean winning % as of july 1st of every year, as a proxy for first half of the year.2. from the above data i was able to derived the post july 1st wp% and pythagorean winning %. 3. i then calculated the correlation coefficients comparing 1st half winning % with second half winning percentage. 4. i then calculated the correlation coefficients comparing 1st pythagorean winning % with second half winning percentage. the data can be found here.the correlation between first half winning percentage and second half winning percentage was 0.47. the correlation between first half pythagorean winning % and second half winning percentage was 0.93.with that out of the way, you can predict final standings for the season:

	 more d-train...
    


anyway - i reran the same data except instead of looking at players who were better than dontrell, i looked at guys who were slightly worse.  the second selection of players won between 40-60 games by the end of their age 24 season and who prevented between 40-60 runs above above average.jim abbott    47    41dan petry    60    43steve carlton    47    43kevin millwood    40    43steve barber    57    47britt burns    48    47jim palmer    59    52ismael valdes    52    53scott erickson    41    53ferguson jenkins    48    59freddy garcia    44    59dontrelle willis    58    60how this list isn't nearly as impressive obviously but we have 3 hall of famers, two active pitchers, medical marvel and these guys:erickson - definition of an young peak pitcher. no injuries really, but a guy who was consistently better when young than when old. with the exception of 97-98 when he was pretty good.valdes - a guy who was only consistently healthy after two years after his age 24 season. though similar to erickson in that he was never as good as he was when he was young. who knows how much was due to an early peak and how much was due to injuries?burns - injury casualty.  looked like he was going to be a fantastic pitcher around 1981.steve barber - consistently very good through age 26, but then the injury bug.petry - similar to erikson, in that he peaked early except he never really was any good every again.garcia - this is probably more like what sam is thinking about... big early career then above average but rarely as good as when he was young.millwood - very similar to garcia.so to conclude... on this list of guys who through age 24 weren't as good as dontrell. we have 12 guys.3 hall of famers.1 medical/heart marvel, who i won't compare anyone to ever.3 injury flameouts.2 early peak guys who were lousy.2 active guys who been 7 runs better than average per year since.you couple this level of production, with willis's drive i think you have a chance to have a fantastic pitcher on your hands.  assuming he stays healthy.labels: marlins

	 mets zips projections
    


dan szymborski has posted his mets projections at bbtf.here are the outliers relative to chone projections:first last chone ops zips ops difference absmichael tucker* 0.67 0.732 0.062 0.062 moises alou 0.807 0.856 0.049 0.049 paul lo duca 0.75 0.707 -0.043 0.043 jose reyes# 0.763 0.802 0.039 0.039 ramon castro 0.724 0.686 -0.038 0.038 chris woodward 0.65 0.62 -0.03 0.03 edgardo alfonzo 0.686 0.659 -0.027 0.027 julio franco 0.7 0.721 0.021 0.021 anderson hernandez# 0.615 0.594 -0.021 0.021why is this important?  because it shrinks our sample size of players to be concerned with.  for example, both chone and zips project almost exactly the same results for beltran and wright so both think they will each be .860 and 900 ops players respectively.  if they turn out to be .800 and .970 ops players they both are missing the mark.  by focusing on just these guys it's easier to eyeball the accuracy.labels: mets, projections

	 tigers lock up bonderman
    


last night the tigers extended jeremy bonderman:one of baseball's most promising young pitchers, bonderman agreed to a $38 million, four-year contract on monday -- passing up a chance to become a free agent after the 2008 season...bonderman gets $4.5 million next year, $8.5 million in 2008 and $12.5 million in each of the following two seasons.this looks like a tremendous deal for the tigers as bonderman, 24 has dynamic stuff and a fantastic projection. tremendous deal for baseball america's executive of the year dave dombrowski.labels: tigers, transactions

	 reds off season
    


i got this link for baseball musings so with all this competent pitching floating around in big league baseball's trade market, where were the cincinnati reds? they were announcing the re-signing of 37-year-old david weathers.whoopee.often times when teams are on the fringe of the playoffs the previous year they are tempted to get ahead of themselves.  sometimes, that is the correct move when you teams improvement was real, or sustainable.  other times it isn't as wise.  i tend to think the reds would be getting ahead of themselves if they have up some young arms for a freddy garcia, or jason jennings. well done wayne krisky.labels: reds

	 lou piniella talks to baseball america
    


alan schwarz has a good interview with lou piniella up at baseball america.  if you don't subscribe you should.piniella... with kerry wood, i talked to kerry personally about the possibilities of moving into the bullpen. we felt he could stay healthier. we thought he could be more dominant. we told him we'd give him all the time in spring training he needed to make those adjustments. he was very pleased with that. so we're really not counting on kerry as a starting pitcher.so it looks like kerry wood will be a reliever, i can't imagine he is willing to step into a middle role.  that could be trouble, for ryan dempsters job security.schwarz: what about the kids who have come up through the system recently, the rich hills and sean marshalls? the tigers resurrected themselves largely by developing guys like justin verlander, jeremy bonderman and joel zumaya--that young injection.piniella: remember, detroit brought in rogers also. that experience. and they brought in the closer, todd jones, who had experience. they added some experience to their young mix. you can't just put it on young pitchers, the full load.that's an interesting quote, i think it's something we could study, but i'll need to think of the correct design.labels: cubs, link

	 andy sisco traded for ross gload
    


interesting trade yesterday as royals made an inter division move sending lefthanded giant (6'10") andy sisco to the white sox for bench player ross gload.  the reason the trade is interesting is because the royals organization is a very light  on upside arms, but relatively deep in terms of depth of corner types. alex gordon, mark teehan, mike sweeney, emil brown, billy butler, justin huber, ryan sheely, and reggie sanders - all are under control for next year.  now sweeney, sandersm and brown won't be part of the next good royals team, but will the 31 year old ross gload?  even if gload projects to be the third best hitter on the royals? which he does.gload makes a lot of sense for a lot of teams, but i'm not sure if the royals are one of them.  i guess, the royals may hope that by giving him his first shot at a full time job he will play well enough to be able to traded for a greater return than sisco?  or maybe they are tired of sisco 10 cent  head screwing up million dollar arm? or maybe they think the sisco we saw last year, with the 90 mph fastball and the rolling slider was the real andy sisco... and the sisco of 05, with the 95 mph heater and sharp slider is gone to parts unknown. one thing worth pointing out is that the royals have traded away two guys (sisco and ambriox burgos)with very live arms over the last week for two guys (gload and brian banister) without a ton of upside, who will likely help them more in the upcoming year or two but who won't ever be much more than what they currently are.  these are the deals where we get a handle of how good at talent evaluation drayton moore is.labels: royals, transactions, white sox

	 vernon wells signs 7 year $126m contract
    


yesterday, vernon wells signed a 7 year 126 million  dollar deal with the blue jays:the extension calls for a $25.5 million signing bonus, payable in three $8.5 million installments each march 1 in 2008, 2009 and 2010. he will receive a salary of just $500,000 in 2008 and $1.5 million in 2009, but his salary jumps to $12.5 million in 2010 and $23 million in 2011. wells receives $21 million in each of the final three seasons.in net present value terms that works out to be worth about $83 million., or $10 million cheaper than the npv of the daisuke matsuzaka deal for one more year.wells is a good player, according to pm-slwts, he was the 22nd best player in baseball last year, and third best centerfielder.  wells who will be 28 next year was far better with the bat last year 29 runs better than average, than he was in the previous two years.  however, he was a heck of a hitter in 2003 as well when he was 31 runs better than average.going forward, chone likes him, projecting him to hit .282/.340/.501 for a woba  of .364 or about 20 runs better than average.seems like a very good move,  as wells is the face of the jays franchise, and as the organization tries to rebuild and expand it's fan base this is the type of move they need to make.  they can't allow young star talent to walk away, and expect the fans to have an emotional attachment to the next guy at that level, if they just expect him to walk out that door as well.i'll say this, i don't think jp richardi is a very good gm - but he is very good at spending money.  brian cashman would be proud.labels: blue jays, transactions

	 red sox add relievers donnelly and romero
    


yesterday, the red sox added a couple of additional arms to their bullpen trading for veteran brenden donnelly  and signing jc romero.romero, signed a 1 year deal for $1.5m, and donnelly was acquired from the angels for minor league veteran phil siebel. siebel is actually a some what interesting arm.  one year off of tj surgery he locked very good in the minors, and his chone projections aren't bad.  he is an interesting guy to have stashed, and with the angels track record for finding arms out of no where he might end up as something.   donnelly is likely a better and safer bet though, for a team like the red sox who have major issues with their pen.here is the red sox projected bullpen and chone projections:k rate +bb rate +hr rate +hit rate +brendan donnelly107%92%104%96%jc romero113%131%80%94%mike timlin80%70%75%110%manny delcarmen118%119%77%101%julian taverez83%94%86%109%nick debarrrule 5  - no projectionhideki ojajimaimport - no projectiondevern hansack97%93%101%105%craig breslow113%108%80%96%craig hansen98%126%77%103%now, pitcher projections aren't great, and the fact that these all of these pitchers are relievers, and all of them have limited mlb experience so they are being translated, makes the error bars even larger.  but none the less that is an ugly set of projections, so it makes sense that the sox are adding pitchers.  though i'm not sure if romero is the right guy to add unless he is used strictly as a looguy.  donnelly is a good addition to this pen, but it makes sense for the angels to drop him for a guy with options who has some upside, since their pen is much better defined than the redsox pen.geeknote: the pitcher stats listed are k+, bb+, hr+, hit+, are projected stats based on chone smiths projection system called chone and adjusted and expressed as a percent of league average. so you want k+ numbers above 100% and bb+, hr+, and hit+ numbers below 100%. they are not park adjusted.labels: angels, redsox, transactions

	 rays sign akinori iwamura - 3 years $7.25m
    


yesterday the devil rays came to terms with 27 year old akinori iwamura, a gold gloving winning thirdbase man who looks to be the rays the starting starter for next season at the hot corner.  the dollars are reasonable, and iwamura projects according to chone to be around a league average thirdbaseman with the stick, which will be a nice addition to the devil rays.in japan, his typical line looks a lot like what garret atkins posted last season for colorado - .300/.390/.550, translated to the american league in 2007 that looks something like: .270/.330/.430, which by itself isn't great but if the glove is good, and it's a position of need (which it is) then its a good pickup.the only concern would be if this blocks evan longoria, at all.  longoria is a hard hitting thirdbaseman drafted out of long beach state who tore through the minors last year, and might be one of the 5-10 best hitting prospects in baseball.  i'm not too concerned with this potential conflict as longoria isn't likely going to be ready until opening day 2008, and because iwamura has positional flexibility, since he can supposedly play passable secondbase and centerfield.labels: devil rays
