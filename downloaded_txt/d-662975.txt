soloworks 2 anne lindsay (new!)
these tunes were composed and recorded during the global pandemic, 2020 - 2023. i like to think of them as chamber folk music for solo violin and nyckelharpa.

						this cd is dedicated to st anne’s anglican church in toronto where it was recorded in november 2021, during the global pandemic. st anne’s was built in 1907, and contained a byzantine dome with spectacular acoustics. murals by the group of seven and sculptures by frances loring and florence wyle were added in the 1920s. more
