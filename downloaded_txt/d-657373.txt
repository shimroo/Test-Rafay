timeless testimonials 















                        we have taken a few weeks to enjoy post-wedding bliss but we just want to send a big thank you to you for everything you did in preparation for our big day! we had truly the best day of our lives and some of that is thanks to you and the vibe you helped set up!

thank you for everything!
                    



                                alina and chris                             









                        you’ve definitely done this a time or two!!  we arrived on site last night at 6:01 and you had already been & gone.  the room looked absolutely beautiful.  they were so pleased and received soooo many compliments.  it was the perfect finishing touch.                    



                                shelli                            









                        virginia was fantastic to work with for our wedding day! she had so many ideas and recommendations when i really didn't know what exactly i was looking for. there were tons of photos from previous weddings that she brought with her and also did up a mock-table set up for me to see what it would look like ahead of time. she always made herself available whenever i had questions. she took care of everything the day of and made sure everything was to my liking before she left. they went above and beyond to make our day the most beautiful and stress-free day possible!

                        thank you once again for the great service on saturday april 7, 2018. the room looked great! your creativity, enthusiasm and professional attitude was much appreciated. we have heard several comments on how different and unique the room looked-which is exactly what i wanted!                    



                                queen's university                            









                        they have great communication and lots of options to help you get what you want for your special day! i've been to a few weddings with their decor at rideau acres and it was really beautiful!

                        we had the pleasure of working with virginia and her team last spring. we found timeless memories to be extremely professional throughout. they over delivered on all aspects while they transformed a drill hall into a garrison ball. great communication, woeful decoration and a pleasure to work with.                    



                                lesley lehman                            









                        great communication, her prices are reasonable and i found her very punctual with our meetings. wouldn't go to anyone else in town!                    



                                kisha holsgrove                            









                        fantastic, great to work with, very professional, resourceful and quite helpful too!

                        we worked with virginia to plan and organize our november 2019 wedding. she took our vague ideas
and spur of the moment decisions and skillfully knit them together into the best day of our lives. her large
network of vendors and her experienced eye overseeing our preparations took the stress out of planning
such a big event, and her suggestions along the way helped us to take our ceremony and reception far
beyond what we had expected.                    



                                brent & erica                            









                        thank you so much for the wonderful antique tables, they looked amazing with all of our decor. virginia was so easy to get in contact with and had very fast responses! delivery and pick up went very smoothly!                     



                                melissa richmond                            









                        i had the pleasure of being a first time vendor at this event’ virginia is amazing. the event ran smoothly. she was conscientious of our needs. she was always available, checking i on us regularly.
it was a very well ran event. virginia is professional yet very approachable. i will do this event again next year!                    



                                darlene kellar                            









                        we hired timeless memories to be a full service supplier (dishes, tables, linens, decorations, etc) for our prom and we could not be more thrilled with the outstanding service, the quality of their rental merchandise, and their attention to detail. in my opinion, they went above and beyond our expectations and allowed for a lovely night for our graduates. i would highly recommend virginia and her team!!                    



                                carrie gilmour                            









                        i just wanted to thank you very much for accommodating our last minute change of venue. everything went great!  the tent, tables, chairs and linens all made the shower look beautiful!  there were a lot of compliments on the white chairs! thanks again!                    



                                penny                            









                        i wanted to thank you for the wonderful décor at the event! you did an amazing job.                    



                                alex                            









                        i just wanted to say a big thank you for all the work you put into our reception. it was flawless and everyone loved the decorations. thank you for making our day perfect!                     



                                angeline                            









                        we wanted to share that everything looked so beautiful at our wedding reception and wanted to thank you for working with us to create our ideas and wants.
all the best,                    



                                jill & ric                            









                        virginia charboneau was the planner we chose to use for the odessa lions club 50th anniversary celebration this past september. the round tables were tastefully decorated in black with gold runners. each table was decorated with a centre piece.the backdrop was professionally hung and really provided an eye appealing background. everything came together as virginia provided all the dishes, cutlery, wine glasses and table napkins. the set up and take down went very quickly. virginia and her team were polite and very responsive to our every request including a number of phone calls from our planning committee as the final details were discussed. we had a lot of praise from our visiting lions and dignitaries when they arrived because the hall looked so grand. it was a very memorable event and it went perfectly. i would highly recommend virginia
charboneau for your banquet requirements.
