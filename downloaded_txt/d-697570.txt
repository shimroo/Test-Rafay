how important is a dual battery kit for your 4wd? 

certain situations make a dual battery kit an absolute necessity for many 4wd owners. battery issues may not be a concern during warm afternoon off-road trips. however, dealing with a cold ride on uneven terrain could bring on battery troubles.
in a nutshell, the smartest way to allow you to travel long distances on any type of road and weather without issues is to install your 4wd with a dual battery kit.
 
how important is a dual battery kit?
 
the importance of investing in a dual battery kit includes:
 

running your engine all the time while travelling or camping is reduced with the help of a dual battery kit. this action puts less pressure on the engine of your 4wd, allowing for its proper maintenance. an engine running at all times while on the road and serves to power your electricals when you set camp would need replacement down the road. the 4wd’s shelf life is vastly improved when a dual battery kit allows the engine to rest while camping.

 

starting your engine is instantaneous when the 4wd is installed with a dual battery kit. planning a week-long camping trip will be exciting and enjoyable when you don’t have to worry about your battery power. the backup battery provided by a dual battery kit allows you to keep the fridge and radio working for a long time.

 

using the winch during off-road trips is certain. crossing roaring rivers and pulling your vehicle from sand and mud requires using a winch backed by optimum battery power. running out of power is not a situation to be in when travelling off-road. investing in a dual battery kit offers the best way to avoid running out of power when you need it most.

 
 
is a dual battery kit worth the investment?
 
the reasons that could compel a 4wd owner to invest in a dual battery kit include:
 
frequent camper on the move or camping in one location
nomadic camping habits make the investment of a dual battery kit worthwhile. however, investing in a dual battery kit would not be particularly necessary if you only want to set up camp in one spot for a week or two.
investing in a dual battery kit depends on the preference and lifestyle of a 4wd owner. let’s just say that having dual batteries while exploring nature provides convenience like no other.
 
habitual remote area camper
deciding to install a dual battery system in your 4wd depends on your camping habits. investing in a dual battery system is not worth the money when your typical camping locations provide main power. however, investing in a dual battery kit proves its worth when you like off-the-grid camping.
 
own a 12v camping fridge
a dual battery system is a worthwhile investment if you jump from a cooler box owner to a camping fridge owner. powering your fridge for three days without losing power is achieved with the presence of an auxiliary battery.
however, some of the things that need consideration when it comes to maintaining optimum performance of the auxiliary battery include:

the battery’s location
the set temperature of the fridge
the battery’s technology
your expectations about the lifespan of the battery
the weather conditions
the battery’s capacity

 
all things said, investing in a dual battery system is recommended for adventure-seeking 4wd owners. contact us to explore dual battery kit options.

what are the advantages of investing in excavator rubber tracks? 

if you visit most construction sites, landscaping projects and agricultural sites, you will realize that they all use excavators in different operations. when you carefully examine the excavators, you will realize that almost each has a crucial component: the excavator tracks. another thing that you will notice is that these excavator tracks are made of different materials like rubber and steel. while steel tracks have existed for a long time, excavator rubber tracks have gained popularity over the years since they offer users many advantages over steel tracks. this article will explore the mini benefits of investing in excavator rubber tracks.
 
advantages of investing in excavator rubber tracks
excavator tracks are crucial in determining the excavator’s efficiency, versatility and performance. when you invest in excavator rubber tracks, you get the chance to enjoy the following advantages;
 

reduced ground pressure

this is one of the main advantages you will enjoy when investing in excavator rubber tracks. the rubber tracks can efficiently distribute the weight of a larger surface area by reducing the ground pressure. for these reasons, excavator tracks are most suitable for working on sensitive or soft surfaces like turf, asphalt, and mud, where steel tracks can leave a slight mark and cause damage to the ground.
 

enhances manoeuvrability

another benefit of investing in excavator rubber tracks is that it offers manoeuvrability and flexibility compared to steel tracks. the excavator rubber tracks are made of a rubber construction, allowing your excavator to turn smoothly and make more precise movements. for these reasons, the excavator operators can navigate tight spaces, work in confined areas and negotiate obstacles quickly. due to this increased agility when working on urban construction sites or landscaping projects, operators enjoy enhanced maneuverability due to investing in excavator rubber tracks.
 

improved stability and traction

investing in excavator rubber tracks also improves your stability and traction when using your excavator in different terrains, including gravel, uneven surfaces, and loose surfaces. this is because the excavator rubber tracks have a rubber compound and tread pattern that grip the ground securely. this minimizes the chances of slipping and enhances traction even when you are working in challenging conditions. due to the increased stability, operators can maintain equipment control and perform tasks efficiently and safely.
 

reduced noises and vibrations

one good thing about rubber trucks is that they produce less vibration and noise than steel tracks. therefore, excavator rubber tracks provide a more comfortable environment and quieter for your operators and bystanders. this is because the rubber material can absorb vibrations and dampen the noise during operation. as a result, the operators will experience less fatigue, and the overall productivity will be improved even when working long hours.
 

reduces ground damage and surface impact

unlike steel trucks, durable excavator rubber tracks are gentler and cause less damage to the ground or paved surfaces. the rubber compound is also soft, enabling the excavator rubber tracks to reduce their surface impact, thereby minimizing the risks of scratching, scuffing and rutting on concrete asphalt and delicate landscaping. therefore, this makes excavator rubber tracks ideal for sensitive projects where the integrity of surfaces must be maintained, including projects like site restoration and road maintenance.
 

improves fuel efficiency

excavator rubber tracks will also help you improve your energy efficiency when you invest in these tracks. this is because they have lighter weights and have less rolling resistance. also, since they have a lower ground pressure and impact, they require less energy to move, which helps you save on fuel expenses.
if you have yet to invest in excavator rubber tracks, you are missing out on the many benefits of these tracks. however, now that you already know how you could benefit from this investment, you should consider investing in rubber tracks for your excavator.
