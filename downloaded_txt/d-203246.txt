    creativity








[the need for educational systems is to] "create a new kind of human being who is comfortable with change, who enjoys change, who is able to improvise, who is able to face with confidence, strength, and courage a situation of which he has absolutely no forewarning."
—abraham maslow, the further reaches of human nature
soka offers a supportive environment for both individual and collaborative creative work.
