went here for the monthly dig in june. i'm a novice, so i wasn't sure what i was looking for. many of the experienced diggers are happy to help and explain. i ended up finding an array of specimens. i'd suggest the night dig because the whole ground glows with uv lights. i'd highly recommend coming here! it's so cool and great information. perfect for kids and adults who like rocks.
