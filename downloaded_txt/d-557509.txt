phage therapy is fully approved and used broadly in republic of georgia, which has been the global center of phage expertise for over 100 years.  
phage therapy centerâ„¢, located in tbilisi, georgia is the world's first, most successful clinic of its kind, 
providing phage therapy services to international patients. the clinic, staffed by both medical microbiologists and medical doctors, 
treats a broad range of bacterial infections -- from simple intestinal infections to complex conditions that require surgery. phage therapy is safe, effective and there are no side effects. 

we welcome patients with most types of acute and chronic bacterial infections -- without the red tape of regulatory restrictions encountered in countries where the therapy is not yet approved.  
simply register and we can help determine if phage therapy is an appropriate 
treatment for you. in most cases only a specimen is required to properly match phages with the infection, then you are ready for treatment.
patients registered: 5,355 from over 120 countries. more than 95% of our patients have had successful 
eradication of the pathogen(s) causing their infections -- without the use of antibiotics.
