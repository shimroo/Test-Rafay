xavier higgs
publisher and editor


 the jamaican cultural alliance(jca) has for several years provided a vital cultural link between native angelenos and their afro caribbean cousins. this is especially demonstrated in their programmed events such as the "high tea". jca's programs are informative gatherings that offer the benefits of a cultural seminar and the intimacy of a family reunion.

dr. juanita merrit
executive director - association of pan-african doctoral scholars


 i would like to highlight the work of the jamaica cultural alliance(jca) from a personal perspective. i was born in harlem, new york city in 1943 - my parents and the people who surrounded me as i encountered the world were called "west indians" - they were all immigrants born in jamaica and cuba. so i was immersed in the culture - the languages, the food, the music - of the islands.i am very grateful to dorothy mcleod and jca for the role that they play in promoting cultural.

 anyone that is there to promote jamaica, we are there to support them also and jca has been there especially with promoting the culture of jamaica.

 the task that you have set yourself as the jamaica cultural alliance in bringing different cultures together is an important one, building on that cultural heritage that we ourselves have been privileged to be a part of, ... a service of people from various differing ethnic origins but yet nevertheless one people, out of many we are one people.
