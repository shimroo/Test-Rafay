logistics: how to choose the best providers?
author  bbbadvancedposted on 



 
what are the elements to watch out for when choosing your logistics providers? here’s a guide to making the right choice and saving money.
·ensure you compare the offers of logistics providers
to craft a tailored and profitable outsourcing strategy, also look at growth plans. once the specifications have been drawn up, you will be able to determine which service provider best meets your needs and what the associated costs will be. in addition, this will allow you to plan the flow of goods upstream, as well as transit times.
evaluating your logistics network is also important, in order to be able to determine if there are warehousing centers available in your logistics network. the location of your storage space should depend on the characteristics of the products and their durability. your external distribution network must be positioned on strategic sites and guarantee a good establishment of the distribution network. 
·achieve economies of scale on pre-routing
in supply chains, the role of the goods distribution center occurs after production. your storage center offers the possibility of placing your buffer stocks, that is to say, your safety production kept for replenishment, near your distribution areas before delivery.
by focusing on a strategy of massification of your logistics organizations, you will be able to group your goods in order to ship them in batches, and thus achieve significant economies of scale. to rationalize distribution costs, the barycenter method should be used.
·the barycenter method in logistics
the barycenter method is a widely used calculation in the logistics sector. this method aims to choose the right geographical location, which will contribute to the success of your project. for this, the barycenter (also called the center of gravity) is a concept of physics that calculates an average of the coordinates.

·the transport plan and massification
sooner express 3pl los angeles helps you group your goods to optimize your transport plan. by using the massification strategy, goods from several producers can be delivered to a single logistics platform.
this method is also appreciated because it makes it possible to transport goods in cross-docking, that is to say from the arrival docks to the departure docks, without having to go through the storage phase of the products in the warehouse. as a general rule, the consolidation and massification of goods are managed by external service providers.
·location of distribution centers and choice of service providers
some logistics providers opt for a single distribution center, which links production sites with consumer markets with higher purchasing powers.
however, storage standards must be taken into account, as they vary between different states in america, especially for perishable foodstuffs and dangerous goods.
·traceability depends on the power of the logistician’s information system
once you have defined your scope of delivery, drawn up your specifications, and assessed your needs for optimal storage, other criteria must be taken into account in order to choose your logistics providers the power of the information system is essential because a powerful system will allow you to monitor the traceability of the goods.

what are the most important characteristics of a good negotiator?
author  bbbadvancedposted on 


 

negotiation is a situation where two or more people meet to achieve an arrangement of divergent interests or a mutual agreement, in which several alternatives are given and the most convenient one must be chosen, that is, the one that suits both parties. therefore, a good negotiator must have a series of skills that allows him to achieve his objectives in an effective way.
below we list a series of characteristics that every good negotiator must have:

organization and planning

before entering a negotiation meeting, the expert negotiator must prepare for it, determining the objectives to be achieved and the alternatives to the established goals. likewise, the negotiator must have knowledge of the history that exists between the parties in relation to the negotiations that they have carried out previously, in order to find areas of common agreement and objectives. it is important to remember that in most cases, the success of the negotiations will depend largely on how the expert negotiator has prepared to carry them out.

ability

a good negotiator must be skilled in identifying the issues to be negotiated, the importance of each of them, determining what his strategy and tactics will be in communication and, he must argue his position in the best possible way, being persuasive when it is considered necessary. effective negotiators must have the necessary skills for teamwork and foster a collaborative environment during negotiations.

stay calm

it is necessary for the negotiator to have the necessary capacity not to lose patience at certain moments of the negotiation. being calm and patient are not easy qualities to practice, especially at a time when something important is being negotiated and it is not possible to reach an agreement with the other party. it is important that the negotiator listens to the other party, that is, that he is a good listener and that he allows others to speak in this way. likewise, the negotiator must be a good communicator, expressing his point of view clearly so that fluid communication occurs and, thus, avoiding misunderstandings.

be flexible

a good negotiator must be flexible, that is, they must have the ability to change their negotiation strategies and tactics during the negotiation and must make concessions, if necessary, to reach an agreement with the other party. we must bear in mind that a negotiation is not a simple process and although the negotiator is prepared for it, issues that had not been planned can arise during the process. therefore, the negotiator must be prepared to adjust his course and must be able to deal with any new situations or demands that arise during the process.

treat others with respect

it is key that the negotiator always treats the people who are part of the negotiation process with respect. you must understand their positions and nothing should be taken personally since in a negotiation each party will try to express their points of view and their needs to achieve their objectives.

self-confidence

it is very important that the negotiator trust himself and the objectives that he has set out to achieve, he should not be impressed by the other party, nor should he feel intimidated if his opponent has a rude or aggressive attitude. you must keep the negotiation calm and confident throughout the process, which will help the other party to appreciate your professionalism when negotiating.
and you, what characteristics do you think a good negotiator should have?
