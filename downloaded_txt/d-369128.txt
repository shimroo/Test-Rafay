          how can you maintain professionalism when communicating remotely?
        



          authenticity should be embraced not shunned. the shift to work from anywhere has changed the way many people work. for example, for those that work at home it is not uncommon for children or pets to randomly appear during webconferences, and that's ok! while of course you want to minimize distributions, if they do occur, take it in stride. be supportive. be human.

          you have to give a presentation but your audience is disengaged. how can you make them care?
        



          one of the challenges that even the best presenters face, is that most of today's online presentation tools have a fundamental design flaw... they hide the presenter in favour of the content. we've all been there. an online meeting/webinar starts. everyone is having a great time connecting, but then when the presenter hits share, they disappear and the screen is replaced with their slides. in some cases the presenter becomes a little circle or cutout of themselves, but the full immersive nature of eye-contact, facial gestures, and body language is lost. that's why we designed airglass to seamlessly mix presenters and content together, giving the audience an unforgettable experience that allows them to learn and retain the information.
