our mission

to promote christ the lord, and love, unity, and service together in his name, in his kingdom;
to assist agreement;
to do and assist godly study of the scriptures;
to do and assist good discussion in areas where division is common;
to encourage prayer and communion with christ the lord as one;
to encourage action as one, in loving service and in presentation of the gospel to the world.

introduction


jesus, christ, the lord, asked his father for a major oneness.  he asked that his father take the eleven faithful disciples, and all others who come to believe in him through their message, into oneness with them.  we have this in the gospel of john, chapter 17, verses 20 through 23.

 and we have all of the oldest written words in this world, of that 
message, by the delivery of god.  it is utterly the most unique message.  
it is the only message by which, if believed, the holy spirit of god 
enters in and begins to drive the reader.  god, in the person (one 
cannot say the form!) of the holy spirit, enters in and dominates the 
believer, to her and his great good, and his or her path is changed. 

 but the change is, visibly, not entire and immediate.  habits and 
thoughts of the first life are gradually taken, and, gradually, either 
made dead, or taken captive and converted into myriad love and joy of 
the lord.  great troubles do come, when persons being brought to the 
lordâs thoughts, and also when wolves among them, paste words and 
symbols of christ the lord, upon that which is evil or unholy. 
 since that message entered this world, there has been an odd 
inversion of it, an inversion that appears good to the first life, but 
is known evil to the new.  its early manifestations were wars upon wars.  
today the quasichristian wars are not usually bloody, but they are 
profound and terrible evil, because those soldiers are giving a 
profoundly ugly false face, to the name of christ the lord. 
 a simple example, is todayâs quasichristian focus on cursing those 
that often choose not to love children.  millions are being led in this 
way.  the leaders curse everywhere they can, and demand that we all do 
the same. 
 why, we ask, do those leaders waste so much time cursing those who 
are already cursed? 
 why, we ask, donât those leaders use their time for good, 
simply encouraging all to love children? 
 why do they insist on cursing, when blessing is that which is the 
lordâs command? 
 there is something akin to an infinity of other examples.  
 some waste time cursing those who are sexually accursed...rather 
than encouraging people, by example and by word, to either the holy but 
temporary path of adam and eve, or that which is forever, the other holy 
path, of the angels in heaven.  
 some waste time cursing those living under curses of various false 
prophets.  they deliver thousands upon thousands of words of 
curses...but have almost nothing to say about the goodness and 
faithfulness that the lord is and is giving those that ask for his 
spirit. 
 and many have devoted themselves to cursing others for those many 
temporary cursednesses, which are the causes, of all of that which keeps 
the lordâs people from true communion with each other and himself.  they 
quote historical sinful man after historical sinful man, filling the air 
with words which are not from god, striving in vain to glorify 
themselves and others like them. 
 quasichristianity curses its neighbors.  its evildoers piles heavy 
burdens of guilt and obedience upon them, try in vain to force others to 
involuntary compliance, build fake righteousnesses doomed to 
destruction.  always this encourages lies, and foolish resentments, and 
hypocrisies.  it is christ the lord who sees that all of these things 
are vain foolishness.  it is he who encourages all to do the right 
things, the things he desires: love in truth, and kindness, and 
gentleness, and defense and protection of the innocent, and first and 
last and most of all, discipling of others in the word of god towards 
his kingdom.  it is christ the lord who speaks in encouragement to his 
ways and reminder to repentance of the others, knowing that many will 
not follow, and shall incur his father's consequences, consequences 
which shall not be avoided except by his path. 
 there are times that we, of christ, have to cut with our tongue.  
when the sheep are being openly deceived, when the innocent are accused 
falsely, the lord is unhappy if no one speaks up.  he has said so, in 
isaiah 5:23-25 among other places, and the son did so speak.  but we do 
not coerce anyone.  we desire the true, voluntary, loving, profound 
oneness that the lord has asked his father to produce.  
for this we shall live!

                it's a very long time in coming, and it will be painful for many.

                we will serve only one.

		god is a gentleman
		defining some terms ☺

		the nature of the churches
		what are these things? how can we rest, seeing what we see?

		the church and sin: split splat
		exposing the historical and present situation of sin in and near the churches, with discussion of how we might helpfully proceed.

		oneness as the lord lives
		the lord is building his church, himself, just as he promised. we just need to join in.

		footprints and a jagged rut in the sand
		there is something very important missing in the original ☺
some crucial words
		one writer's attempt to bring more clarity.

		the joy of the lord
		a bit on how we get it, why we don't have it, and how it's different.
