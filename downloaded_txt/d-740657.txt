issue 107 (february - april 2025) 











if you enjoy upbeat stories and are looking for memorable travel experiences that have an enduring positive impact, this issue will be right up your street. in a special feature, we ask if the kavango zambezi tfca might reshape landscape conservation — and the way we think about travel? the largest terrestrial conservation area in the world spans five southern african countries and offers a wealth of exciting travel opportunities which fuel some truly remarkable work. we also tour kenya’s coast, take an electric vehicle through the ngorongoro crater, enjoy a gentle getaway in the nyika plateau, get a resident’s tips on johannesburg, have a taste of morocco on a food tour and, excitingly, mike unwin embarks on a rare cruise down the legendary congo river. it’s an issue brimming with ideas and insights that will give you plenty to ponder as you plan your next safari!

what our readers say 





 












						“what a beautiful magazine. amazing photos and inspiring articles. whether you are a safari addict or a beginner on the african continent, travel africa offers you so much to be absorbed in. inspiration for new travels, new parks, new sights, but also to read about the people who work tirelessly for the benefit of nature and wildlife. thank you for a great magazine and for lovely newsletters.”					


finn jørgensendenmark 






						“i picked up my first copy in an airport newsagent and used it as inspiration for my next trip! the articles about a national park or area are most useful, and the adverts are often useful pointers to internet research. i look forward to each new issue to scratch my ‘africa itch’. articles about places i’ve been make me nostalgic, and articles about places i haven’t been are the trigger for planning the next trip!”					


richard hilesunited kingdom 






						“over the past two years of relentless lockdowns, it was an absolute delight to receive travel africa each quarter. we read each page and advert thoroughly so that we could use these tips for our future trips to africa. now, with the possibility of being able to travel again, we can put this much valued information into place. it’s a pleasure to read. we highly recommend subscribing to the magazine and won’t hesitate to renew when ours expires.”					


mandy and kevin bellaustralia 






						“this is the only publication devoted to the african travel-lover. it supplements guidebooks and travel agent’s advice by offering a unique perspective on activities, highlights to see and do. the articles are written by people who have done what they are writing about and cover a wide panoply of culture, activities, sightseeing, pitfalls and alternative itineraries. tasteful and strategically-placed advertisements support the articles so you can see organisations to help you plan an itinerary. i have subscribed since the very first issue and still refer to them.”					


carrie burhennusa 






						“a very high-quality magazine covering a great many and diverse range of topics, which are both highly informative and would satisfy a lot of questions readers would otherwise ask. magnificent photography, including opportunities for readers to submit some of their own photos. the magazine is extremely well presented. a great read for whatever you may be looking for about all parts of africa.”					


don matlockaustralia 






						“we have never missed an issue of the magazine since we read it for the first time in 2016. we immediately found it distinctive in form and content, not only due to highly aesthetic photographs, but also the numerous new ideas, tips and reliable information from travel experts. we think out of the box and look at all possibilities when we plan a new trip. in this regard, travel africa magazine is exactly what we need for our travels in africa.”					


nicole lannoygermany 






						“travel africa is by far my favourite magazine and i look forward to its arrival every few months. articles are well written and give loads of information. each edition brings back memories of my many travels in africa.”					


val edlinunited kingdom 






						“travel africa connects me to the amazing african continent from over in australia. the stunning photos of wildlife and safari lodges show me more of africa and things to see and do. i enjoy reading about places i have been lucky enough to visit, as well as places i hope to visit next, and about wildlife conservation and the programs helping locals, particularly with art and crafts. i always look forward to receiving the next issue.”					


jane alexanderaustralia 






						“i am a huge fan of travel africa and promote it and share my copies whenever i can. for me it is a nostalgic trip down memory lane, as i lived in zimbabwe and visited many of the countries you cover. i love revisiting so many familiar places, from egypt right down to cape town, and it is really good to get up-to-date information on each country.”
