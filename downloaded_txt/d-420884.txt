about 



 in 1929, lawrence “mac” maclin purchased land in ontario, california and became a successful dairyman. eventually, the dairy became an auction house for cattle, goats, pigs, sheep and horses. the auction proved to be so popular in the community that by 1936 people began to bring different products to mac’s “chino auction” to sell. the first items sold were farm tools and feed. then clothing and other miscellaneous items were offered for sale. before long, mac maclin was the proud owner of the first open air market and auction!
