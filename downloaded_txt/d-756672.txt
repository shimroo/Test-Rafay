   “we become what we love and who we love shapes what we become. if we love things, we become a thing. if we love nothing, we become nothing. imitation is not a literal mimicking of christ, rather it means becoming the image of the beloved, an image disclosed through transformation. this means we are to become vessels of god's compassionate love for others.”  ―
st. clare of assisi
 umbrian valley below the town of
assisi, italy
