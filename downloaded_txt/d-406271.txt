doublethink by takahiro komuro x tag painted by mutant vinyl hardcore 




several years ago, i saw this picture of this doublethink character in fiberglass with white hair by artist takahiro komuro . i think it was 3 or 4 foot tall. it was amazing and aside from wanting the original sculpture, i longed for a smaller vinyl version. luckily gino from toy art gallery helped make this possible produced the doublethink vinyl toy. a custom toy show was held at tag and i was lucky enough to score this version painted by a good friend and amazing artist and toy designer in his own right, mutant vinyl hardcore 






 here are pics of the original fiberglass sculptures back in 2013. the original post can be found here

paul kaiju domino jack...!!!





this toy absolutely is one of my all-time favorite toys. for me, this toy has it all. it's a robot with a nod to 70's popy design. i love the rocket fist and the giant robot-esque missile-tipped fingers. this particular version is from dcon 2014 and features clear vinyl painted in my favorite colors with plastic jacks and wires as guts and brains. it's perfection.

pushead x secret base skull hevi 





it had been several years since pushead came out with a new toy. when he busted this guy out a couple of years ago completely taking san diego comic con by surprise, i was floored and beyond excited. both the astro zombies skullwing and kaws vs pushead companion were two of the original toys that got me into this hobby. the details on this new sculpt are unreal and really show off the attention to detail represented in pushead's art work. this particular version is complete with the new hevi arms in a marbled translucent orange with turquoise vinyl. definitely one of my all time favorite toys.
