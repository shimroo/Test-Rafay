autodesk® autocad® civil 3d® 2017 v1 enhancements available for download





today, i was notified by my autodesk desktop app that an update to my autocad civil 3d 2017 was available.

there are a few ways to get this update, but for me updating via the autodesk desktop app is the easiest.

for those that wish to download, you must log in to accounts.autodesk.com.

this update includes new functionality and updated functionality and content.

some of the new functionality includes:

add property set data to labels
analyze gravity networks
swap pressure network parts


the updated functionality includes:


new subassemblies
autodesk civil data translator ( for 2017)
create 3d solids from pipe networks
rail turnouts and crossings
traverse editor
traverse adjustment


hopefully, you find this helpful.
