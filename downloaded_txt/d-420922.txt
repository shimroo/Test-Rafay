in
the hope of
making pushkin available to more readers, especially those who have
only a slight knowledge of russian, or none at all, this web site is
dedicated to providing a translation of some of his poems. the russian
text is set alongside the translation, to provide easy comparisons for
those who wish to make their own efforts. there is very little of
pushkin available on the internet in english, and this site was, at the
time of writing (2001), the only one that provided an english version
of
yevgeny (eugene) onegin. 

all of yevgeny onegin and a few other poems are
currently available, both in russian and english.  the gypsies
has been recently added (sept 2009).  

below is one of
pushkin's well known poems. the russian text is presented as a
photographic image, to obviate the possible difficulty of downloading
russian
script.   





from april 2010 some early
chekhov short stories have been added.  check the link above
to see what is available.  







 






 

 

by a. pushkin
 
if
i walk the noisy
streets, 
or enter a many thronged church, 
or sit among the wild young generation, 
i give way to my thoughts. 

i say to myself: the years are fleeting, 
and however many there seem to be, 
we must all go under the eternal vault, 
and someone's hour is already at hand. 

when i look at a solitary oak 
i think: the patriarch of the woods. 
it will outlive my forgotten age 
as it outlived that of my grandfathers'.
if i caress
a young child,

immediately i think: farewell! 
i will yield my place to you, 
for i must fade while your flower blooms.




 


each
day, every hour 
i habitually follow in my thoughts, 
trying to guess from their number 
the year which brings my death. 


and where will fate send death to me? 
in battle, in my travels, or on the seas? 
or will the neighbouring valley 
receive my chilled ashes?
 and
although to the senseless body

it is indifferent wherever it rots, 

yet close to my beloved countryside 

i still would prefer to rest. 



and let it be, beside the grave's vault 

that young life forever will be playing, 

and impartial, indifferent nature 

eternally be shining in beauty.

 translator's
note.
 
this
translation of yevgeny onegin was done between january 2000 and
february 2001 as a project for the internet. it is not intended to
supercede all other translations. the reality is that very little
pushkin in english was to be found on the internet at the time of
writing. even the two providers of free texts, project gutenberg and
the oxford text archive, offer nothing at all of pushkin's (jan 2001).
[now however i am glad to say that more is available.]  
the
intention of this web site is to make some of pushkin's work freely
available in
english to all who have access to a computer. the english translation
offered is provided for those who cannot read the russian, but who
still wish to read pushkin, and also as an aid to students. it has
tried to follow the original fairly closely, so that as far as possible
the english reader can see which line of the original the translation
derives from. nevertheless some freedom has been used, in particular by
abandoning pushkin's rhyme scheme. this is impossible to copy in
english with any accuracy or fidelity to the sense. many attempts have
been made, and one looks in wonder at the achievements of translators,
but i have often felt that the sheer cleverness of english translations
distracts from the original and leads one away from pushkin.  
this does not mean that
i eschew verse and rhyme completely. indeed i have been happy to pluck
rhymes from the air, and i have been happy also to use hidden and
oblique rhymes, wherever it improves the flow of language, or helps to
suggest the subtlety and vivacity of the original. i have used more
freedom in the translation of the closing couplets than elsewhere, as i
believe that doing so preserves more of the spirit of pushkin than
could be achieved by adhering to a more wooden and technically accurate
translation. the main aim has been to convey as much as possible of
pushkin's liveliness, the sheer abundance of his invention, and the
daring unexpectedness of his wit. there is nothing like it in english
literature, and non-russian readers are depriving themselves of a great
treasure by ignoring it. i hope this web site will go some way towards
remedying this lack.
it
is of course not possible to please everyone. that would be more than a
minor miracle, as no doubt even the original was and is disliked by a
few readers. i suspect my translation will appeal more to native
english speakers than to russians, since in some places it is slightly
irreverent, although i trust that pushkin's sense of humour would have
ensured that he himself would not have felt offended.
i am conscious of
inadequacies in the translation, some
of which might be remediable, but others which it will probably be
impossible to eradicate. apologies also for any errors in the russian
text. please keep me informed of these and i will do my best to correct
them.
the translation is
by g.
r. ledger. 


best wishes to all.
и да поможет господь всем бесприютным скитальцам.
