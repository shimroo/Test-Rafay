listen to zubo trust’s audio collection: bbindawuko banakazi fishing co-op

“the audio recordings of zubo trust’s women form a seizable online archive. based on audio documentation, even the exchange of experiences among women from both sides of the river (or kariba lake) could be revived: zubo women recordings featured in live broadcasts on the community radio station zongwe fm in sinazongwe zambia, just across the lake form binga zimbabwe. here, zubo women fishery project caused a small revolution of sorts; because apparently, women in rural zambia do not yet enjoy such opportunities for economic participation. relevant radio broadcasts of zongwe fm featuring recordings from binga are available in zubo’s online audio archive (…)”

					mulonga 2019 : a radio bridge across the waters and continents			

details

		created: wednesday, 09 october 2019 08:41		

since 2007 some independent radio initiatives in austria are supporting the set up and running of radio zongwe fm, the first community radio station at sinazongwe in the zambezi valley on the northern shore of lake kariba. last year the sinazongwe community joined efforts with the sinazongwe district council to erect a new building for the station on the hilltop overlooking the lake - still called the big river or mulonga in chitonga language and tradition. facilitated by a crowdfunding campaign on the austrian side the necessary financial resources were made available for the relocation of the radio station from rather cramped conditions at sinazongwe basic school in may. this move was organised by the zongwe fm team led by the station manager mr kennedy kein kambole and supported by two radio experts from austrian free radio b138 kirchdorf - mr mike schedlberger and mrs tanja landerl - and their zambian counterpart mr kayula faith mulenga.

					keith goddard obituary

dear all,
with deep sorrow we have been informed that our friend and director of kunzwana trust keith goddard passed away last night, friday 9 october at st anne's hospital in harare, where to he has been admitted two weeks ago with pneumonia.
it seems really impossible to believe that keith has gone. what a great loss to all of us, foremost to his mother pauline but also for the gay and lesbian community of zimbabwe, galz, for the promotion of cultural exchange by kunzwana trust and for the tonga.online project and the tonga community at large. keith has always been in the forefront in pushing for tolerance and appreciation of cultural and sexual differences in society but was also actively involved in broader human rights campaigning and in the fight for access to affordable treatment for all people living with hiv/aids. and he was a composer and promoter of cultural diversity and inter-cultural exchange for many years.

by dominic muntanga
 tonga is synonymous to "the people of the great river". mulonga is a term which summaries that concept. this is a term deeply rooted in the history that we as tonga people share, both zambian and zimbabwean. for the tonga people like me, there is something deeply biblical about the word mulonga, yet it is a modern story too. one of massive but unshared technology. one of plentiful water but perpetual drought.
