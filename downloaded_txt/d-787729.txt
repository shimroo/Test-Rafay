                                        these flowers were delivered as expected but the arrangement totally surpassed my expectations. the blossoms are so beautiful, fresh and full. the arrangement is the highlight of the room. thank you so much for putting care and thought into the work that you do. you can tell how much you love the work. it shows through the flowers and arrangements that you put together.
