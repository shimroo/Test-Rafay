world's safest whelping-box

puppy rails are important!
the job of a whelping-box is to keep puppies 
        clean, safe & contained. our patented design allows for 
        the rails to be completely suspended above the floor. 
        this eliminates the possibility of puppies getting crushed under 
        complicated rail supports/feet or stilts. puppy rails are included 
        with every whelping-box. 
if it doesn't 
          have rails, it's not a whelping-box. 

worlds cleanest whelping-box
 . .

made of easy to clean plastic
corrugated 
        plastic is somewhat flexible yet extremely durable and easy 
        to clean. our patented floor-to-wall design eliminates parts 
        with complicated slots, grooves and gaps for poop/urine 
          to get trapped in & leak out of. our flat and 
        open surface areas allow for easy cleaning! outdated wooden 
          boxes are not only heavy, and leak, but impossible to keep sanitary. 
        painting introduces diseases, skin lesions, etc. & the probability 
        of puppies eating the paint. the entire dura-whelp® whelping-box 
        can be easily cleaned with bleach, quatricide, other detergent 
        or disinfectant. 
keeping a sanitary environment has never 
        been easier!

the patented dura-whelp®
                        whelping-box stores in 
        its shipping carton
 
to disassemble 
        and store the dura-whelp® whelping-box, simply reverse steps 1-2-3, and 
  repack.
        it can easily be stored in a closet or under a bed.
 please
don't judge a box 
          by its cover
we understand that 
            the construction of corrugated plastic resembles corrugated 
            cardboard, however, corrugated plastic is not cardboard. 
            the dura-whelp® whelping-box is made of top quality, extruded, 100% 
            polypropylene plastic. the puppy rails are made out of vinyl with a wooden core. this plastic makes the dura-whelp® 
            lightweight, strong, flexible, ups shippable and easily cleanable. 
            when it comes to performance (and cost), there is very little 
            resemblance between corrugated plastic and corrugated cardboard.
