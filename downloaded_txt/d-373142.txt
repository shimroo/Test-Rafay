welcome to cwga

the connecticut women’s golf association was founded in 1919,  and the purpose of this non-profit association is to provide competitive golf opportunities for its members, to promote understanding of the rules of golf, and to encourage female golfers statewide. beginning each spring, members can enjoy several rounds of golf, meet new friends and experience many levels of competition during the season.
competitive events include individual stroke play and better/best ball tournaments. member championships and other competitions involving teams from surrounding states are held annually. each fall, teams from our member clubs are invited to take part in the cwga presidents' cup team matches, a highly competitive and exciting series played in match-play format.
