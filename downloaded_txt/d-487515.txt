mystery odor baffles officials in two counties





gloucester county emergency management officials said they are at a loss to explain the chemical odor that has blanketed their area and apparently drifted across to ocean county this morning."we definitely know there is an odor," said len clark, a gloucester emergency management official. "what's causing it, we can't say."clark said the odor was first detected at around 7 a.m. and hazardous material crews with chemical sniffers were sent out into the field at around 8:45 a.m. they were unable to identify the source of the odor or its chemical components, he said.initial reports said it was a discharge from the valero refinery in paulsboro, but a refinery spokeswoman denied they were the cause of the odor.meanwhile, emergency management officials in ocean county have also been trying to identify the source of the odor, without success, police agencies said.app [click here to read the rest of the story]

police seek help in identifying credit card suspect





bordentown police are asking for the public's help in their search for a woman who they say used stolen credit cards to make about $10,000 worth of purchases at several stores, including one in manalapan.police said the woman also gave a fake lakewood address to the clerk at the manalapan circuit city while he was processing her order, so they believe she could be from the monmouth or ocean county area.the credit cards belonged to two lebanon, pa. residents who stayed at a hotel in bordentown on dec. 1 and 2 because their teen-aged daughters were playing in a soccer tournament at the high school in pemberton, police said.when the parents returned to their homes, they were contacted by representatives of the credit card companies who inquired about numerous, suspicious transactions, police said.that's when the victims realized several of their cards and small amounts of cash were missing from their wallets.app [click here to read the rest of the story]

find a cheaper way





the lakewood board of education has solicited bids for about 20 security changes to the district's schools — at a total cost of about $500,000 — in response to a november melee at the high school. as important as school security is to the educational process, that's a price the debt-ridden district cannot afford to pay.school officials say they may not implement all the changes recommended by an outside security expert last month. contractors have until jan. 15 to submit bids for the work. "we'll determine at that point whether we want a super cadillac or a 1992 ford," board president chet galdo said.they should opt for the ford, if they must install expensive security devices at all. this is a district that has a $1 million deficit. it already has laid off 36 employees to start erasing the debt. it shouldn't throw money at a problem without seriously considering the financial consequences.app [click here to read the rest of the story]

singer begins 10th term on committee





committeeman robert singer started his 10th term in local office yesterday by setting goals for the township.singer, a republican who is also a state senator, defended his seat against miriam medina, a democrat, in november.first and foremost, singer said he will work toward preventing any municipal tax increase in 2008.another issue that must be addressed is housing inspections, he said.there are some landlords who are very honest and fair, but there are others who don't provide good living conditions for residents, he said. the township needs to identify the ones who have problems and hold them accountable, he added."the streets and schools need to be safer," he said.residents might be called on to help report situations, he said. additionally, security cameras might be a solution.the township might have to work with the county and state to make some roads safer, he said. particularly, the corner of new hampshire avenue and route 70 has been the site of many crashes.the number of homeless people must be addressed, he said.during yesterday's reorganization meeting, raymond coles was appointed mayor for the second year in a row. singer said this might be a record for the township, since there is usually a rotating mayor.app

school-funding plan: questions, answers offered





two legislative committees were scheduled to hold a joint hearing today to consider gov. corzine's proposed new formula for how the state would give money to local schools.the topic could be hot for the next few weeks. democratic lawmakers, who hold the majority in both houses in trenton, want the law passed by jan. 8.here are some questions and answers about what the new formula means for students, schools and taxpayers.question:what is different about the proposed formula?answer:there would be one formula for allocating money — simplified compared to the current one, but still complex — that would apply to each of the state's 618 school districts. currently, 31 districts in poor areas — known as the "abbott districts" — get a lot of extra help.other districts, especially in recent years, haven't seen much increase in their state aid. under the new formula, the number of low-income students in a district would be a major factor.app [click here to read the rest of the story]

lakewood sees lower demand than expected for affordable housing





despite a major advertising push, housing advocates received back less than a sixth of the applications they sent out for bids to live in the 72 units of the affordable housing going up, officials said."we thought there would be higher demand for affordable housing, than the return we got,'' ervin oross jr., lakewood's director of community development, said. "maybe people don't want to report their income and submit the paperwork. perhaps they have poor credit and can't obtain a mortgage. there's a whole range of reasons, actually.''the deadline for applications was nov. 30. for two years prior, township leaders said, they spread the word heavily through spanish-language, ocean and monmouth county newspapers, the state housing-mortgage web site and local churches. yet, of the 6,500 applications that went out, only 1,100 were returned, oross said.still, michael mcneil, chairman of steps -- one of three nonprofit groups trying to get about 400 units of affordable housing off the ground -- sees the effort to spread the word as having been worthwhile."overall, we're happy with all the folks and all the churches that did what they had to do,'' he said. "i'm proud of the whole community.''app

safety precautions urged at lakewood schools





a security expert has recommended several major changes to better protect and monitor schools and students, including adding turnstiles, metal detectors, barrier gates and door alarms.the proposed overhaul, while well received for its thoroughness, also prompted concerns from parents and educators that it was a possible overreaction by officials, especially because the costly endeavor comes when the school district is crippled with debt. the security analysis follows a melee involving 150 students and others at the high school nov. 14."we're overmedicating the baby, per say," rose carlo, whose daughter is a high school senior, said at a board of education meeting wednesday night. "we need to slow down and take a better look. we're sending a message that the kids might be of a criminal background."this is money we don't need to be spending right now."following the presentation by raymond mcgill, a senior consultant with care security systems, glenn bradford, pta president at the clark school, asked why the measures weren't being applied to the elementary schools.app [click here to read the rest of the story]

new system simplifies recycling





that weekly recycling ritual of bundling newspapers and baling cardboard will be history for ocean county residents in early 2008, with a new "all in one bin" collection system that will pick up all kinds of paper mixed together."everything but your phone book, essentially, will be able to go in a single container," county freeholder james f. lacey said monday in announcing a rollout of the new system. private trash carters will begin picking up comingled paper in january, and the municipal public works departments in the county can start feb. 4, lacey said in a press conference at the county's northern recycling center.glass bottles, cans and plastic containers have been collected together for years, and "statistics show that if you put it in one container, make it easy, people will do more of it," lacey said.a study of the county's waste stream completed last august concluded that the average ocean county household throws 20 percent of its waste paper in the garbage, said county solid waste coordinator john haas. for every additional ton of paper that towns collect with this new system, they will save local taxpayers about $87 — by avoiding the $69.70-per-ton fee at the ocean county landfill in manchester, and gaining the $17.28 per ton in revenue sharing from the county's sale of recycled materials, haas said.app [click here to read the rest of the story]

will gov. jon s. corzine's proposed new public school funding formula be the fiscal white knight to rescue lakewood public schools?under corzine's new funding formula, lakewood public schools stand to double their state funding allocation. such a financial boost in the arm could not come at a more critical time for the school district.a school district audit for last year reveals numerous budgetary mistakes and omissions, including unauthorized spending and lost receipts that have produced a $1 million deficit, employee pink slip cuts and closer scrutiny by state education officials.completed last month, lakewood's school audit details a range of oversights in the district's handling of its $112 million budget for 2006-07, including pension, payroll and purchasing discrepancies, untimely reports and unapproved budget increases.ocean county observer [click here to read the rest of the story]

toms river, lakewood in $6m accord





the township soon could receive nearly $6 million from toms river for affordable housing, pending a court decision, officials from both towns said. if approved, the municipalities will have navigated successfully through a crack in the barrier that has surrounded regional contribution agreements for nearly a year.since an appellate court ruling in january put a hold on the state council on affordable housing program, many towns have had to shelve their rca plans, which allow them to swap parts of their affordable housing obligations with other municipalities.lakewood has been waiting on $36 million in rcas from various towns in monmouth and ocean counties in order to build about 400 units of affordable housing. meanwhile, toms river has been trying to siphon off some of its obligation to avoid building more housing of its own.app [click here to read the rest of the story]

hospital expert advises about wintertime fire safety





three hundred lives are lost annually due to residential fires started by space heaters and fireplaces, according to neil bryant.the regional safety expert for community medical center here and kimball medical center in lakewood said more than 10,000 residential fires are started from portable or fixed space heaters annually and another 15,000 fires are associated with fireplaces and chimneys."because this is the season when deaths and injuries occur from heaters and fireplaces, every home must have working smoke and carbon-monoxide alarms," said bryant. "heaters that are placed too close to flammable materials such as curtains, furniture or bedding can cause fires. fireplaces with cracked, blocked or dirty chimneys are also a fire hazard, as are embers that escape and reach flammable materials."bryant said in addition to portable space heaters and fireplaces, residents should be careful when using ovens, ranges and water heaters, which can also produce fires and emit carbon monoxide.app [click here to read the rest of the story]

corzine explains his school aid plan





gov. jon s. corzine's new school aid plan will include roughly one-third of the spending increase needed to meet its own funding standards and prevent schools from losing money, the governor said in an interview tuesday.corzine said it would take a roughly $1.5 billion spending hike to fully fund schools the way the new formula envisions and prevent any districts from losing money, as he has promised. limited by the state's tight finances, however, corzine is expected to propose a $400 million to $500 million aid increase in a plan to help schools that have seen their state support stagnate over the past six years."i want to make headway in getting this into fairness for all of those people that are behind," corzine said.he pointed especially to middle-class districts that have needy students but are not among the 31 poor, urban "abbott" districts that receive enhanced state aid. schools outside the abbott districts are home to 49 percent of the students who receive free or reduced-price lunches, which is used as a measure of poverty, corzine said.ocean county observer [click here to read the rest of the story]

budget deficit a recurring problem





the lakewood school district is swimming in a sea of red ink — again.officials hoped the tide was turning on district finances. they thought there was a surplus of $250,000 for 2006-07. an audit report told a different story. it revealed a deficit of more than $1 million.this fiscal fiasco is just the latest one for the district. in 2001, a budget-busting $4 million deficit resulted in a state-township bailout, with the state forking over $3 million to the district on the condition that the township committee provide $1 million. two years later, another school district deficit surfaced, accompanied by another bailout by the committee.lakewood taxpayers are smart enough to know that the money is coming out their pockets. school officials, however, apparently have not figured that out.deficits, trouble with pension and social security payments to the state and frivolous purchases of office furniture are just a few of the controversies that have plagued the district.oc observer [click here to read the rest of the story]

as orthodox population grows, so do tensions





a fault line runs through dr. martin luther king drive in lakewood, dividing the black families that have lived here for years, many in run-down apartment complexes at one end of the street, from their new neighbors, the orthodox jewish families who mostly occupy a row of two-story houses on the other side. the black families are slowly leaving this street, and the orthodox jewish families are moving in. their lives barely intersect, though it is barely half a mile from one end of the drive to the other.motti schwartz, a 26-year-old student at a large yeshiva here, rents an apartment on king drive.“you come into a neighborhood that’s not really yours,” he said. “i think there’s probably a lot of animosity.”ronald daye, who is black, lived in one of the apartment complexes but recently moved to another town. “there’s jealousy because they stick together,” he said, referring to the orthodox jews. “we all want our own schools. this town has too many people, and there will be problems.”the problems, many people say, are already here. black residents charge that new housing is being built only for orthodox jews, who, they say, are pushing black residents out and taking over the town. members of the jewish community say such accusations sometimes cloak anti-semitic sentiments.the tension has played out in a series of violent episodes over the last two years that have laid bare the strains in this town of 73,000 near the jersey shore.ny times [click here to read the rest of the story]
