”we never give up”



fighting for your retirement pay for over 40 yearsara (american retirees association), marks its 45th year of political activism as the oldest and only organization in the united states totally focused on reclaiming and securing our hard-earned military retirement benefits. our presence in washington, d.c. ensures that congress continues to be made aware of inequities in federal laws that seek to reduce our benefits. this year also marks the first year of our assimilation of the usa  (uniformed services association) giving us an even greater voice in washington.the strength and longevity of our organization is primarily due to the efforts of our president…”we never give up”…dennis egge and his volunteer staff. dennis travels round the world spreading the word and is intimately involved in the latest goings-on in congress.  dennis is always available by phone  at (360) 909-0007 or email at contactara@rocketmail.com.with our new, updated website, we have introduced an electronic payment system to make it easier to pay dues, donate and purchase our book, “divorce and the military”.  among other things you will find, for the very first time, links that provide for paying dues securely…by simply clicking the appropriate button.  we accept all credit cards and urge you to click the “yearly” button which will allow us to securely receive $30 each year from your account securely and automatically. this will dramatically reduce the work for our staff by eliminating the effort involved in sending out notices. we wish for everyone a happy, healthy and prosperous 2025!

divorce and the militarya comprehensive guide for service members, spouses and attorneysthe uniformed services former spouses' protection act (usfspa) authorizes courts to award up to 50 percent of a uniformed service member's retired pay to an ex-spouse for life, and does not preclude the award of other support from retired pay.  • whether single, divorced, or contemplating divorce, the service member, spouse, and attorneys need to know the 20 factors that affect military divorces and how the divorce process and retired pay are influenced by the usfspa. • if you are an attorney, this book will provide information you need to better represent or advise clients in this specialized area of family law. the book includes a new full disclosure chapter on military benefits that you can use in discovery. this expanded version also contains a new chapter on how the usfspa and disability pay have been interpreted in the 50 states.  • a new chapter identifies financial planning considerations that both the service member and spouse must evaluate in a military divorce.  • learn about the 12 controversies cited in divorce case appeals, which have created problems through as many interpretations as there are courts.   • the usfspa applies to all active duty, reserve/guard, and retired military, u.s. coast guard, and members of the usphs and the noaa.

a short note to our donors and supporters:ara has a long track record of maximizing the impact of your donations in support of divorced u.s. military personnel active, retired and reserve. our organization was founded by veterans in 1984 and is presently managed and funded by that small group of retired founders. that's why we're proud to operate with exceptionally low administrative expenses, ensuring that every dollar raised goes directly towards our mission. our operation is essentially self-funded with no board member fees, no reimbursed travel expenses, no salaries and no allowances. we rely totally on donations, both yours and ours, to keep the ship afloat for the sole purpose of covering ongoing printing and mailing costs, website expenses and communications costs. we’ve done that every year since ara was founded and would be more than grateful if you could help us continue to serve by donating and becoming an ara member. please support us and help us grow. thank you!
