attention: bennett ave., n. pearl st. (between cary and forest ave.) and mill st. residents  you may be wondering what construction is going on in these areas. national fuel gas (subcontracting through power & construction group, inc.) is replacing the old gas main. at this point and for the next couple of months, they will be installing the main line.   when that section is completed, they will be returning to connect the service lines to your residences. they have assured the village that they will give each resident plenty of notice of the day and time the service line work will be done. this will interrupt your gas service for approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours on the day of the work.  the resident does not have to do anything.   the construction company cannot determine how long this project will take or when the service line work will begin. they are only guessing it may not be until mid to late january for the service line work, weather permitting.  thank you.

 
update contact information
we are in the process of updating contact information in our water billing software.  please provide your updated phone numbers and email addresses by sending us an email message at villageoffice@villageofoakfield.org

water quality report 
the 2023 water quality report is available for viewing.  please see the link to water quality reports on our website or feel free to pick up a copy in the village office.
 

memorial park
effective immediately, dogs and pets of any kind are no longer permitted in memorial park.  the village board of trustees voted at their december meeting to change the park rules due to the continual violation of the village's leash law and disregard of the request to clean up the pets mess.  please remember this park is a special place for residents to come and take a walk, remember loved ones at the memorial wall, and our kiddos use the sensory path.    
the park is under video surveillance and violators will be fined.
