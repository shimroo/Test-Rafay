what families say about us

















every child is treated as an individual and the staff and teachers guide them to become caring and independent children. the teachers and school director truly care about every child and make their learning environment a successful and safe one.





ana & lupe marin
















i cannot say enough good things about montessori. the cleanliness of the classrooms, the amazing teachers (especially ms. eunice, ms. angela, ms. maria and ms. teresa the director) and the education. i sent both of my girls through their program starting at 2 years old.  both were reading and doing 1st grade math when they finished. highly recommend!





tiffany h.
















this is such a great preschool! both my son and now my daughter is attending. director sarah does such a great job and is so professional and so are all the teachers. the curriculum, approach to encouraging kids to explore and learn on their individual path to self discovery is enlightening! both my kids have learned so much socially and academically. i highly recommend their program!





azin r.
















i've noticed that my three-year-old daughter has been thriving in your class, and i attribute that to your engaging teaching style and ability to make learning fun. we see significant improvements in her, especially now that she has started talking a lot and communicating well.





swapnil l.
















a big shoutout to ms. amela! she is an outstanding teacher and her experience in montessori methodology clearly shows. my oldest was able to read, write and do basic arithmetic before kinder thanks to her. and we are lucky to have her for our second child as well. she communicates well with parents and has an authentic concern for the child education and development.
