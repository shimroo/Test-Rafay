welcome to iotawear.com

(tm) by university apparel, inc. 
university apparel, which is distinguished to be recognized as iota's 
 first 
national vendor, has been creating new and exciting iota phi theta®
paraphernalia since 1988. many of the designs and symbols that you see 
across the country were originally designed by university apparel, inc., and 
they have now become the standard for iota phi 
theta® and iota sweethearts inc.
this website of paraphernalia, dedicated 
strictly to the iota family, originally debuted on
september 19, 1998, in conjunction with the fraternity's 35th
anniversary. as our offerings expanded, the site was given it's own 
domain name, iotawear.com (tm), which debuted 
august 14, 2001, shortly after the conclave in new orleans. 
as we have been for the past 27 years, 
university apparel continues to be dedicated to providing originally designed 
symbols and quality
paraphernalia items, for the men of iota and their sweethearts.
our iotawear.com (tm) website is but one extension of that
commitment.
throughout
these pages, you will find everything for the iota family -- 
from bags & caps to shirts to jackets to novelties.....
