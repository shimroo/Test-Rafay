welcome to suchu dance!

we foster experimentation and play, exploring movement and questioning forms within a structure of openness, risk-taking and humor. we have worked to enhance the presence and vitality of contemporary dance through performances, classes, touring and creating physical and virtual spaces for rehearsal and performance. since our founding in houston, texas, usa in 1998, by founder and artistic director jennifer wood, we have drawn attention for our forward thinking, inventiveness and comedic innovation.
