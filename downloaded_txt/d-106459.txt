do you remember - jennifer runyon? 
 
if you grew up in the 1980s & watched a lot of tv during the era you will probably remember the face - maybe even the name. jennifer runyon was a blonde bombshell from chicago illinois who came to california seeking acting gigs in the early 1980s. after landing a role on the tv series "another world" (1981-1983) she quickly snagged a  starring role alongside tim matheson in the teen college comedy "up the creek" (1984). she was soon rewarded with a memorable cameo appearance opposite funnyman bill murray in the blockbuster "ghostbusters" (1984).   however, it was the iconic role of gwendolyn pierce in the tv series "charles in charge" opposite happy days' scott baio for which she is most remembered. in this special feature article, tony pichaloff, takes a look back at the career of jennifer runyon, the actress which richard roeper of the chicago sun-times once described as "the marilyn monroe of the 1980s". for the complete article on jennifer runyon visit our feature page.
