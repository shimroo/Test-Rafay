urban devotions: images of faith in the city
receptionjanuary 23, 2025, 6–7:30pmexhibit infojanuary 21–february 17, 20259am–9pm dailylipani galleryfordham university lincoln center113 w. 60th streetnew york, ny 10023celebrate the opening and ongoing exhibition of urban devotions, a solo show of seis del sur member and veteran new york times writer and photojournalist david gonzález. david has provided a blurb about the exhibit below:“new york has been a city of faith, whether it’s small devotions in unexpected nooks or bold public declarations of belief. and with a global city reshaped every few generations, traditions offer a familiar and comforting touch, if not hope itself, in every corner of the city if you look. indeed, as the writer oscar hijuelos once said to me about new yorkers who go about their days oblivious to the nuances of faith: ‘they are like tone-deaf. they hear a piano being played and they only hear “thunka-thunk.” there is this wild jazz going on called religion and some people don't have the chops.’”cover: “father tom fenlon, communion visit,” morrisania, bronx, 2013, © david gonzález

black-owned land in the bronx in the early 1800s
thursday, feb. 20, 2025, 6:30pmmuseum of bronx history3266 bainbridge avenuethe bronx, ny 10467this talk will focus on a number of early properties in the bronx that were owned by free black people during and just after the era of gradual emancipation, when slavery was slowly being abolished (1799-1827). though several black-owned farms and other properties existed in the rural environs of the city in this era, the vast majority remain undocumented historically. by discussing a number of long-forgotten properties, this talk attempts to shed light on a chapter in our local history when black individuals—many of whom had been enslaved in their youth—rose to become property owners and prosperous businesspeople. in addition to being one of the only ways of gaining genuine financial independence, land ownership was critical as the sole means of acquiring suffrage, due to a racist mandate in the state constitution that required black men to possess at least $250 worth of property to vote.
