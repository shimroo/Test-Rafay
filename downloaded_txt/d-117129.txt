boletin de new york










we are the premier peru news, lifestyle and culture website for peruvians based in new york city in the united states. in fact, we aim to be the online home of peruvians based overseas. regardless of how long you’ve left lima, peru or any other parts of peru, this is your online home. we know for sure that you probably are homesick. you’d like to hear about news from peru in the english language. this is the place to be. we foster a warm, open and all-embracing online community for peruvians from all four corners of the globe who would like to communicate in the english language.





if you are a peruvian based in any state in the united states including hawaii and alaska, you know full well that there are lots of specific and special challenges involving our community. we get to the heart of the matter. we don’t beat around the bush, and most importantly, we let people speak up. we are of the firm conviction that the only way to resolve any kind of issue is to air it out completely. this doesn’t just mean talking to the same group of people who basically agree on a particular side of the issue. we really go out of our way to ensure that all angles are equally represented.





now, there are probably all sorts of unpopular views out there, especially when it comes to political and social issues that may seem like black and white affairs. a lot of people are under the impression that since the vast majority of people agree on a particular topic, this specific view is the absolutely correct side. well, we don’t believe in such things. we believe that the truth has many faces, and that’s why we have gone out of our way to provide an online platform where peruvians from all backgrounds and all walks of life can freely express themselves on what would otherwise be controversial topics without fear.

american migration









we believe that when ideas are fully explored in a healthy, spirited exchange, and we’re not even talking about debate here, everybody benefits. everybody sees that a particular issue actually has many different sides, and everybody’s better off. well, at least that’s the hope.
while we do reserve extensive moderator rights, we rarely use them. thankfully, we do not need to because people who join our forum usually know the limits. people usually are nice to each other and there is a general civil atmosphere that is present in all the discussions that take place here.
make no mistake about it, the peruvian immigration experience to the united states is not without controversy. one thing we’ve noticed is that the longer people have lived in the united states, the more conservative they become. on the other hand, when somebody’s a new arrival, they tend to be a little bit more progressive as far as their politics go.
we’re not playing any favorites, but we want to make sure that everybody who participates in the online open discourses available here at least go through the motions of listening to what the other side has to say. also, we insist that when people argue, that they use facts and evidence.

make no mistake about it, everybody has an opinion. in fact, opinions are like noses, everybody has one. but what makes one opinion worth listening to compared to another is when that particular opinion is backed up by solid evidence that can be tested, sliced and diced, and reduced to numbers.
at the very least, that is the kind of evidence we expect from all our participants because everybody can talk a good game. we know that people have all sorts of feelings and all sorts of emotions, and everybody’s entitled to these. but the problem is, when you try to impose your views on somebody else based solely on your emotional state, that doesn’t really serve anybody else.
in fact, it is often a one way ticket to ranting, raving, and otherwise unloading on other people. people aren’t really served, the discourse isn’t really taken to the level it needs to be, and somehow, some way, people are worse off. so, accordingly, we have this very strong commentary rule where people can share news and opinions provided the supply evidentiary support.
for example, if you were to say that housing policies in new york city are oppressive and needs to change, you should at least show some statistics as to how rents have skyrocketed over a relatively short period of time.

if you cannot provide that type of evidence, then you’re probably better off not expressing that opinion because you can bet that people will call you out on it and it can get quite ugly quickly. do yourself a big favor and focus on the fact. this is our main obsession here on this website, and that’s why we go out of our way to scour the world wide web for anything and everything related to the peruvian experience outside of peru, as long as it is in the english language. you may be outside of peru, but peru doesn’t necessarily have to leave your heart.



read more








using this treasure trove of evidentiary support, we encourage people from all over the us to step up and offer your point of view. just pick through these news materials and use them as evidentiary support for your conclusion. the bottom line is, there is no such thing as a bad conclusion, provided it has enough evidentiary support. that’s how you can tell a good opinion from a bad one. a bad opinion is simply just somebody unleashing their emotional rage and expecting others to somehow see eye to eye.



read more








we’re all rational people here, and that’s why require some sort of evidentiary support. thankfully, we have compiled a tremendous amount of resources here so you would never be at a loss to back up or justify whatever conclusion you have arrived at. other than that, we foster a vibrant, warm environment here. we are, after all, one large extended family. if you come from peru originally, whether as first generation or second generation, feel free to make this website your online home. you would hardly be alone because there are tremendous amounts of people.

should you make your own e-juice?
february 17, 2018june 7, 2021
 

 

i come across this question a lot. it’s easy to see why people start thinking about making their own e-juice. it really all boils down to control.
think about it this way, if you like doing something and you find yourself doing it regularly, chances are, you probably would want to experiment. it’s not unlikely for people to try to control as many different aspects of their vaping experience so it tastes just right or it feels perfect or they get the exact rush that they are looking for. this is not much different from brewing your own beer or making your own cheese because you’re a big fan of pilsners or gorgonzola respectively.
if you like a certain experience that impacts your senses on many different levels, and i am of course talking about the things that you see, smell, taste, hear and touch, you want to mix and match. you want to mix things up. you also want to experiment. all that is understandable, but the problem is pulling it off the right way.
now, assuming that money is no object and assuming that you have the time to do this, it might still be a bad idea to make your own e-juice. you might just be a lousy learner or you may not be all that sensitive and you keep making one bad batch after another.
now, i wish i could tell you that a bad batch is very easy to figure out, but you know and i know that often times, what separates a “bad” batch from an excellent one is a question of degree. it might seem slightly off, but the more you vape or use that e-juice, the more it becomes obvious to you that something is wrong with that batch. in fact, if you keep using that e-juice, you might even reach a point where you hate it.
this all seems crazy because the difference in quality may not be all that obvious. just by looking at the two formulations of e juice from eliquid depot they might look completely the same. you can’t tell them apart by smell, and you can’t tell them apart by appearance. you have to keep this in mind because you have to have a tremendous amount of attention to detail to pull this off.
this is not one of those things that comes easy. this is not one of those things that is second nature to most people. this is where time comes in. as you probably already know, to become an expert in everything, you have to invest your time.
you also have to be very curious. you can’t just take things on face value. you can’t just settle for the first version in everything that you do. you basically have to keep pushing the envelope and keep looking for small details. now, this sounds awesome on paper, but one practical problem that arises time and time again is what do you do with your “failed” formulations? somebody has to use them or you’re going to have to pour them into the toilet. talk about a waste.
again, i’m not talking about bad batches that are obviously bad. i’m not talking about stuff that turns your stomach or makes you want to throw up. i’m not talking about bad-smelling stuff that just basically clings to the insides of your nostrils that you wouldn’t want to smell again. i’m talking about e-juice formulations that are slightly off.make sure you are ready to invest the time and, yes, money, into this because making your own e-juice is not a light and easy commitment. it’s not just something that you stumble into. it is a serious undertaking and it can cost a pretty penny. it also can cost all sorts of problems down the road.
