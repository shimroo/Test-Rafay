why piranha propellers?







here’s the problem:



		propeller damage and repair is inevitable.			



aluminum and stainless steel propellers offer little protection to the lower unit, gears or prop shaft. a propeller strike can take weeks to repair and cost thousands of dollars.







don’t worry. piranha has you covered







here’s the solution:




		piranha's 1-2-3 prop replacement system	


no more welding and reshaping old out-of-balance propellers.
reduce cost and down time while protecting the lower unit.

lower repair cost
drivetrain protection
reduced maintenance cost
repair in just minutes
no special tools or skills required








#1 recommended fema boat propeller
piranha blades are designed to absorb shock during a propeller strike. this basically eliminates damage to the lower unit.
the blades will take the brunt of an impact; failing in order to protect the prop shaft, while the center hub absorbs any residual energy, preventing lower unit damage.
what you get is a hub so strong we guarantee it for life! if you damage it, we will replace it.

piranha hydrobites





equipped on every blade









 



 



 



 




our patented hydrobites are small flow fences on the high pressure side of the propeller.
the hydrobites improve hole shot, reduce vibration and control ventilation associated with tight turns and high trim angles.
