mission
georgetown health foundation generates and accelerates positive change in our community’s health.
mission philosophy
the foundation works collaboratively with its community to improve the health of georgetown residents through partnerships, experience, knowledge, and funding.
 
 
vision
we imagine our community as one in which all are empowered to build and sustain healthy, productive lives and we believe the health of georgetown residents is influenced by the environment in which they live.
vision philosophy
georgetown health foundation agrees with the world health organization’s definition of health as ‘a complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of infirmity.
we believe the social determinants of health (sdoh) are powerful influencers on this comprehensive definition of health.
“the social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. these forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems.”
 
priorities
due to the ongoing and prolonged impact of covid-19, our funding in 2022 will prioritize basic needs, as well as social determinants of health supporting such basic needs. 
ghf applies a health equity lens to our goals and strategies.  inequities in health are often socially determined.  health equity strategies seek to increase opportunities for everyone, regardless of their circumstances, to live the healthiest life possible.  ghf views the pursuit of health equity as a way to correct or challenge factors outside a person’s control that negatively impact their health, e.g., lack of resources, education, or income.   
our current funding priorities are:
priority 1. basic needs – food, shelter/housing
priority 2. basic needs/social determinants of health (direct) –personal security/mental health, healthcare, transportation, child/out-of-school/homebound adult care
priority 3. social determinants of health (supportive) – emergency financial assistance, job training
post-pandemic, ghf plans to continue to pursue strategic priorities informed by our community-based research.  to learn more about these community recommendations, please click here to explore the links.
