where in the world has brenda been?
							well hello!

6 family-friendly attractions to look forward to in palm springs

																	palm springs, california – situated at the base of the mount san jacinto mountains – is known for constant sunny weather, stunning terrain, palm trees lined along the streets, and remarkable mid-century style architecture. notable hollywood stars made palm springs even more popular when they made it their home, given its proximity to hollywood. it owes much of its prominence to the showbiz industry especially in the early days of hollywood. even today, clint eastwood and leonardo dicaprio admittedly have fallen under its spell. but nowadays, not only hollywood a-listers…

why sleep is essential for single parent travel

																	traveling together can be a fun bonding experience for you and your children. unfortunately, this can also be pretty difficult, especially if your kids are a handful. lack of sleep – either yours or your children – can add a different set of hurdles to an already challenging experience. that is why we previously advised here on single parent travel to get enough rest the night before your scheduled travel to reduce possible problems while you are in transit.
however, this is only a temporary solution, because the amount of…

“life as a single mom…oh my!”–dear tired overexerted single mom who feels like nothing she does is quite enough

																	oftentimes we exert so much energy trying to do it all that we forget how important even the smallest of gestures really mean in the grand parenting scheme. we stop studying to kiss boo-boos, we skip social outings to attend parent-teacher conferences (newsflash kids-we’re not crazy about them either)-generally our worlds tend to stop rotating when the people who rely on us, need us. we spend countless hours reassuring our children that there’s no monster in the closet, bloody mary is a myth, and poltergeist is just a movie. but,…

“life as a single mom… oh my!” — 3 amazing things no one tells you when you become a single mom

																	no one plans on becoming a single mom.
let me rephrase that: aside from the fiercely independent women that get tired of waiting on “mr. right” to arrive, and decide to find his face in a book at the nearest fertility clinic; no one plans on becoming a single mom.
if there’s one thing most single mothers have in common, it’s the fact that we truly believed that we’d have and hold onto a picturesque family unit. for me, becoming pregnant at 19 and actually marrying my son’s father was…

where in the world is brenda

																	my 2016 travels mostly focused on domestic destinations. in april a quick weekend trip to disneyland and in may we returned to northern california and this time successfully enjoyed yosemite national park, which we missed a few years back due to the government shut down of national parks. we rode on several historic narrow gauge railroads in colorado – great family fun! and stayed at a b& b where “indiana jones and the final crusade” was filmed. denver is really popping as a tourist destination, and we now have a…

oh no!  we were hacked!

																	we were hacked. while we are not sure who is responsible, we were hacked last week.  i suspect it is some nigerian prince, but my it guys tell me it is likely someone from russia.
anyhow, we gave them the boot; but there were some lingering issues. on the technology side, they have been handled, and i decided to take the opportunity to give the site a refresh.  but, all of the old content is still here and functional!
so for now, it is boring and bland. in the coming…
