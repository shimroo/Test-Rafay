due to health issues, i'm going to suspend the heathkit shop until summer of 2022.it has become more than one man can operate.all orders that have come in will be processed and shipped.



due to across the board price increases, i can no longer keep the price of the hp23rl or the ac4r at their price points.starting in may of 2022 the hp23 will increase to $80. the ac4r will also increase to $80this is the first price increase since 2004 for the ac4r and 2002 for the hp23rl.
