our promise 



at kelly construction, we will make it easy. don’t stress about window sizes, ceiling heights, or wood floor stain color. we’ve done the heavy lifting. simply choose one of our already-under-construction expertly designed homes with carefully curated designer finishes. it’s almost too easy. but don’t worry, we won’t tell your friends. go ahead and tell them you chose every finish yourself!home design inspiration shouldn’t be limited to a spot on a map. we might be based in the sioux city area, but our clients don’t have to be. we’ve expanded our presence into three regional markets: sioux city, sioux falls and omaha. so, no matter if you live in sioux city or a hundred miles north or south of it, our painless and stress-free home design and building process is just a call, click or tap away.

   

come home to the house of your dreams.
