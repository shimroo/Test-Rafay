	 the infinite library
	 
    

from the university of toronto magazine: within just a few months, google scholar has established itself as a rival to powerful multinational companies such as thomson and elsevier that offer huge (and, for libraries, hugely expensive) databases of scholarly material. some librarians say that google underperforms its rivals in the currency and quantity of its search results, while others declare that its simplicity is a huge advantage.

libraries search for better search enginesa lot of things are not relevant, current or unbiased when you just search online,' said martin kesselman, a life science librarian at chang science library on cook campus. 'in doing a regular google search you're not going to find scholarly journals.' in response to this growing concern, university librarians have come up with a compromise - google scholar.emphasis mine.

	 google scholar adds scholarly dimension to internet searches
	 
    

from the wilkes university student papergoogle--an internet destination so huge it has become a common verb in the english language (as in 'google it'). it can also be a librarian's worst nightmare.the internet search engine has made even obscure knowledge easily accessible from the comfort of one's own home, making it virtually unnecessary for students to venture out to the library.

	 search by scope
	 
    

brad writes in with news that under the advanced search page you can now limit to particular subject areas. the categories highlight one of scholar's lingering problems - being heavily dominated by the natural sciences. for example, "social sciences, arts and humanities" are all lumped under one category.

	 uc library staff use of google scholar
	 
    

the cdl put together this fine report (pdf) based on a survey of university of california libraries.on june 22, 2005, the cdl requested information from the campuses about librarian and library staff use of google scholar in their own work and at public service desks. eight of ten campuses responded with a wealth of information about the creative ways in which the libraries use google scholar, as well as with their objections to its use. immediately below is an overall summary of responses, followed by a document containing all the detailed responses received. at the end of the second section is a report from ucla detailing how the ucla library integrates and positions google scholar along with the rest of their electronic resources.

	 scholarly web searching: google scholar and scirus
	 
    

greg notess puts them head to head...despite all the limitations and problems, both offer some unique reasons to use them beyond just watching their future development. for a quick, broad, multidisciplinary search on a very narrow, specific topic, either scholar or scirus can give a good start. for citation verification, both can help find erroneous as well as correct citation information. the cited by links at google scholar can be a useful adjunct to the more comprehensive citation tracking from citation indexes via isi's web of science (or can function as a partial replacement for those without access).

	 good bye britney spears, hello academic journals
	 
    

one of the best stories about scholar from a college paper i've seen yet.google scholar is a different and more accurate way to find academically appropriate and peer-reviewed journal articles without getting all the rock star bios, sports results and blogs.
