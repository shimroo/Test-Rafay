were awesome. can’t begin to tell you how easy they made it or how quick they were too. no wasted time. they came prepared. and helped with some stuff i didn’t quite have the right moving packages for. i highly recommend them and the people that work for them. friendly and fastjackie hagan1737913179very efficient. contracted for loading service only and they did a great job packing the truck.nour bobbitt1737670883excellent service from start to finish! no hidden fees. the guys were efficient and took good care of my belongings. highly recommend and will use again.c

again. thank youms. johnson1735437877long over do , the move was back in september , so phenomenal the movers , the company , 100% professional and speedy -i will definitely refer , use again and again - happy holiday - happy 2025armando rodriguez1733428473i have used them three times. two out of the three times the movers i had were amazing, quick and really energetic.however the last experience i had the movers were slow, lethargic, on their phones constantly. there were multiple times when the movers were texting with one hand and dragging one of my items with their other hand. when i called to complain they said the movers were contacting the company that’s why they were on their phone. i could understand that being an excuse if i saw it seldomly, however it was constant. and they were not using it for work related issues from what i witnessed. i had broken furniture at the end and there was no compensation.the resolution was that there was no resolution and that i was just out of luck. i was very disappointed with my last and final experience with them.nicholas powell1731896764amazing movers. these guys pulled off the impossible and moved me in 3 hours from a second story floor house rental to a third story apartment. i was really impressed, and even the things i thought would take forever and have taken forever with other movers, went by way quicker. they brought special tools to make sure it could be done safely and quickly. i wish i had asked them the next move to a 1st floor in the same complex, as i ended up breaking some wheels on a cabinet, scratching furniture, getting a grease stain on a couch thanks to my trucks bed, and my friends dropped my bed frame and broke it.these guys are great and do everything perfectly. don't cut corners like i did. 😅stefanie marting1731810271giovanni’s team was friendly and efficient. this was the best moving experience i’ve ever had. they called 2 hours in advance when they only have to provide notice 30 minutes before arrival. they were completely prepared for our move as well. huge thanks for everything!justin czubas1731293839edit 11/10/24 - it’s been 2 months and we’re still finding items that were obviously mishandled and damaged by the movers we had. i had a large bin with music equipment, and i finally started setting everything back up and found that all my equipment was repositioned, despite how properly i packed. i had foam isolation pads for my studio monitors that were absolutely crushed, a sign of significant droppage. also the hdmi port on my computer is no longer functioning, which is a sign of internal damage, and again, significant droppage. this company is careless.beware of fake positive reviews - notice how all the ones below mine are within a very short time span and mention one specific employee and each account only has 1-2 reviews. they’re fake / paid and are not accurate representations of this company.horrible, my complex gave them 4 hours to move a 2 bedroom, they failed to do so in that timeframe when black tie took 3 hours when we moved into our original unit including wrapping and protecting our items, which ameritex didn’t even do. the main mover said they needed 5 hours. several times they brought one piece down and took 15-20 minutes to come back up. the one guy was disappeared for half the time. for reference, this was a unit transfer in the same complex about 2 buildings over.we called to complain and hopefully get some kind of understanding for the fact that the job would not be completed—this is where things could’ve been made right and we would’ve been okay. instead i was met with a rude logistics manager who cared more about his pride and saving face for his workers than actually taking our situation into consideration. instead of taking it as feedback and being professional, he laughed at me like i was an idiot, berated me for complaining just because the complex was paying, and had no interest in working towards any sort of resolution. that’s all i wanted. a resolution.he also apparently added a note to the job order that i was literally telling the movers to “hurry up” which is a complete lie, either from him or the movers. i stayed out of their way and only spoke to them if they needed something from us.update: we, joined by property staff, also talked to another representative of this company this morning who was also extremely argumentative and difficult to reason with. she also tried lying and telling us she had photos of our belongings wrapped up in the truck when they never were. the movers actually refused to do so because they said it takes 5 minutes per item to wrap, which takes too long. she was also very quick to ask how they could change this very 1 star review, and offered a discount of a whopping $10 off of every hour to finish the job, again showing that they care more about saving face than actually providing any kind of customer service.all in all, this company is filled with lying, argumentative, difficult people who refuse to even entertain the idea that the people they sent were not efficient. i invite corporate to pull the phone calls and assess.we were left with multiple heavy items in our old unit that cannot be moved ourselves. the property manager & maintenance team of the complex had to help us finish the job, and that is not any of their jobs.on top of everything else, ameritex also damaged our furniture. we had a shelving unit in which the screws were ripped out. update, we’re just now getting to hooking up our dryer. the dryer was extremely scuffed up in ways i don’t understand. this is a brand new unit purchased in may that was perfect until ameritex touched it. also, they somehow obliterated our dryer vent hose. how do you even do this kind of damage as a moving company?we might have not been paying for this move, but we never will in the future.reese nickleson1731273106came to leave a one star but noticed how theres a bunch of fake 5 star accounts below and thats super scummy for a business to do on an entirely new level. these guys are horrible in other aspects also. like damaging property. taking forever to get any work done. etc youre better off stopping by home depot with $50 and getting way more efficiant help there.jim rogers1729879787on time, efficient- great crew! thank you!mauntel harper1729105783ameritex movers has completed a total of three moves for me. i want to commend heather in the office who scheduled my moving request and dates. heather communicates clearly and provides information that helps with decisions about moving services that available.in addition, all of the on-site movers are polite, efficient, careful, and communicate well to understand what we need. none of our items have ever been damaged.the most recent move was to a second floor apartment while the elevator was broken. leo and jaylen, the movers, were extra careful and diligent with no complaining. thanks ameritx movers for hiring quality employees to work for us!satisfied customer,mauntel harpermelva jones1728668426ameritex movers did an outstanding job. very good experience. thanks jose, fernando and the sweet caribbean young man (don't want to misspell your name) lolthese guys really were good movers in timely manner. i will recommend you to others.mrs. m jonesmary lynch1728597186excellent movers! arrived early were fast and very professional and careful. i was amazed at how quickly they moved an entire house from one location to another. i am a senior citizen, so i am very little help, but the 3 men movers did everything including wrapping all the furniture for protection. the cost was very reasonable, and i am so happy with the service. highly recommend ameritex movers.alex c1728227916our mover guido was stood up by his coworker and was left by himself for our move, but that didn't discourage him a bit. he was very professional and he took care of almost all our items, and even took the couch by himself! hope he gets the recognition he deserves!facundo zapata1728153768guido el mejor trabajador muy bueno y muy recomendadofacundo

expectations! from the moment they arrived, the team was professional, courteous, and incredibly efficient. they handled every item with care, ensuring everything was securely packed and transported. their attention to detail and dedication to making my move stress-free truly stood out. not a single scratch or ding on my belongings!loni milner1726161897i won’t use anyone else. heather was the sweetest to work with and get me organized for my move, credit where it’s due!! this lady made our whole experience a breeze, absolutely awesome and well deserved five star experience if only for miss heather!! what an amazing lady!hailey peach1726158464we used ameritex movers to move our entire family home from houston to another city over an hour away, they helped pack , and loaded everything and unpacked everything for us into our storage units at two different locations! great company so glad heather peach was able to book us in last minute and get everything handled in one day!ali1726156809i love this company so much! they are always available when i need them. they are careful, efficient and the office staff is always so friendly. their rates are far more competitive than the other big name companies in the dfw area. they truly provide a stress-free move! i recommend them to all of my friends and family! 5 stars.⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️nina1725939681*be aware*horrible service deserves 0 stars, i discussed over the phone what all i had and what would be a decent estimate of my total and julisa for sured me it would be around $400 no more. i had around 40 boxes plus this is a 1 and a half bedroom. when the two movers arrived one was walking around lazy, stopping and socializing, taking long breaks and not working while the other guy was trying to get it done, sometimes both would stop and i wouldn’t see them come in to get boxes or bring them in till 10 min later or more. some of my items were scratched and broken it took them 7 hours to move me right down the street they didn’t drive straight to my other location after done loading it took them 15 min later to arrive when it’s a 2 min straight shot, i had to call them to see where are they located instead of them following me to go right down the street they left before me and said their lost also me and my daughter helped every now and then to help load the truck. overall all of this headache and stressful move and they tried to charge me $950 even though they brought it down to $872 that’s still too much. they pay for good reviews. this company is a scam and i will never get services from them again a total rip off.kitty1725036406very good and communicative movers, despite their first language! made sure the right stuff went to trash, and right stuff to storage. 💖 best prices that i could find, and had open availability to where i was able to book for next day. wonderful!! and, they got it done in a timely manner. very satisfied :) thank you so much!!!! 💞elizabeth h1723748591complete disaster of an experience. movers failed to properly wrap and transport my expensive furniture causing significant damage to thousand dollar pieces. chipping, scratches, dents...i cannot even fathom how furniture can be damaged to the extent it was without them having thrown it around on purpose. they either intentionally destroyed my property or acted recklessly, with a complete and utter lack of regard for my belongings.these people should not be in business much less let anywhere near your personal and sacred belongings.to top things off, i went back to check on the apartment they had packed up in and found it trashed. they left their packing tape, large pieces of plastic wrap and other supplies everywhere...even shoving it down my sinks. i spent an hour cleaning up after them.oh and keep in mind...they only had to transport my items 10 miles away.i never leave reviews but this experience was horrifying and frankly traumatizing. stay away.elizabeth st. pierre1723563674five stars for sure - i wish i could give more! every interaction i have had with ameritex movers has been professional, courteous, and thorough. i had to reschedule my move three times and each time was seamless and without any hassle.the three men that arrived to move me were communicative regarding their arrival time and came prepared to work. they worked diligently and efficiently and miraculously they fit all of my belongings and furniture into the container i rented for moving. they were friendly and polite.i have moved dozens of times and have never had such an overall easy experience. i highly recommend ameritex movers and am grateful that i responded to their postcard mailing.abby hopkins1723417245the ameritex movers crew was amazing, they took great care of my items and went above and beyond to ensure the move went smooth!j m1723319111fantastic job by jimmy and rasheed. i was thoroughly impressed with their organizational skills and speed. i highly recommend using them. ty againkhan qurashi1719596647i used this garbage company 3 years ago when i first moved. they were so amazing! super fast, dismantled and reassembled items very efficiently. very kind and very problem-solving mindset. but now, they are breathtakingly disappointing. i told them how many boxes and the amount of stuff i have before the actual move and yet they sent 2 boys and a trailer. they know my new place will be on the 3rd floor, i verified with them, we emailed back and forth too. but yet, they were completely ill-prepared. it took 7 hours to go from mckinney to addison, with loading and unloading. at one point i asked them to let me talk to their boss and i told this boss that it's so hot outside and i have been giving these 2 boys water and popsicles because no one wants anyone to pass out due to heat exhaustion, and whyyyy did they not send a proper crew to get things done. the boss told me, no joke, if i want to make this process quicker, to help them with moving. if i was gonna do this myself, then why would i hire movers? i needed help. the other option was for all of my clothes, bathroom items, furniture, everything, to be left in the trailer and they will try to send a 3 or 4 man crew maybe the next day or so to unload. just the sheer audacity of it all is so mind boggling, absolutely wicked. and then on top of that, my $1800 plateform motorized bed is broken. my $430 tv stand is damaged. my $385 vanity is cracked. my $54 dishes are broken. and what's truly crazy, is that i showed the boys my broken, busted motor in my plateform motorized bed. and they argued with me. like dude, you can see it's broken, its not supposed to move when not powered on. its not moving. anyways. i am not ashamed to admit that i revoked my $40 tip for each guy once one of them got lippy with me. do not hire these guys. i am heartbroken that the standard has been lowered in 3 years. please, find someone else to respect your time, money, and your home. this company is not worth it.ashley rome1719316434wyatt t1718486639moved 20 minutes away but it took 6 hours for a crew of 3 to load one truck and make one trip. over a thousand dollars cost. crew did not reassemble any desks bed frames or furniture that they disassembled when loading, and many screws were lost during transit.would not recommend these movers.barbara dement1718040606i was overseeing a move for a family member when a flyer for ameritech movers came in the mail. turned out to be serendipity -- i couldn't have asked for a better moving company. moving out of family home of 25 yrs to a 2- bedroom apartment was already at peak stress and you hope not to add to the chaos and disorganization. we were literally amazed at the quality of service from ameritech: understanding the job, organizing the job, being careful, fast, strong!, and cheerful. if there was a hiccup, they care-fully solved the problem. add on-time and great value for the job. tim and david were so trustworthy and kind, wish i had a tim and david for all my jobs! ameritex staff were efficient at setting up the job, communicating during the job, and making things clear and easy. i will always remember this move as how things go right ! barbara katy, tx,daffne valeria alvarez1716499116mycon fueron muy rápidos y muy cuidadosos muy eficaces. muy excelente en su trabajosiddhesh

setting the appointment to receiving the emailed receipt when the job was done. highly recommend!rahul menon1709836176tyrone wright1709306568please make sure you ask the movers to remove their shoes or wear shoe covers. i only utilized ameritex to move a few items that i couldn't do on my own, and the team that helped me were nice, but one of them had shoes that looked like they were falling apart because there now black marks on my newly installed floor and carpets. also whomever answers the phone is hot trash. they acted like i made the details of my move up after receiving a call confirming the exact details of the move. my move was scheduled from 8-11, with an expected arrival time between 7-8. i called a little after 9 to see where the movers were after receiving confirmation that they'd arrive by 835, and i was told that the 8-11 scheduled move, was the estimated arrival window like they were at&t. not a huge fan, and won't be a returning customer. i also believe that they didn't accurately record the time by stating that they arrived about 15 minutes earlier than they did.     scroll to top       join our community     stay connected, stay informed.
