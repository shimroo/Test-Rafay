make the wine first
pretty, oregon, real. forty acres of steep farming and 24 years of winemaking have suggested no shortcuts, just a singular path to a better bottle: acquire great sites, know them intimately, farm them naturally, and craft them thoughtfully, to show them beautifully in glass to you. world class, substantial, acid-centric pinot noir, bubbles, rosé and chardonnay from our lovely st. dolores estate hilltop, since 1999.

“we like our wines, like our friends and our dinner guests, to be vibrant in character, generous in spirit, acidic in wit, balanced in consideration of opposing tastes, and above all else, real.”

— jim prosser, owner/winemaker
