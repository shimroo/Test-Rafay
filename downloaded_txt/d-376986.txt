latest news









the international opera awards
in 2012 opera was the co-founder of the international opera awards, and we have continued as a partner ever since. each year the magazine assembles an impressive international jury spanning several continents, chaired by the editor, to select the shortlists and vote on the winners, who are announced at a ceremony in london.
winners of the readers’ award, voted for by you, have included sonya yoncheva, pretty yende, juan diego flórez, ermonela jaho, jonas kaufmann and joseph calleja. as well as fulfilling the initial aims of raising the art form’s profile worldwide and recognizing achievement in all opera’s many disciplines, the awards have also supported hundreds of singers and opera creators through the opera awards foundation bursaries.




















the opera awards foundation
the opera awards foundation was created in 2012 by harry hyman, who recognized that there were many artistically talented individuals whose potential was not being nurtured to development.
the foundation awards annual bursaries to aspiring operatic talent. there are no restrictions on age or nationality, nor is support limited to singers: applications are encouraged from any artist working toward a career in opera, who needs financial support to achieve their career goals.
the foundation invites applications annually. find out more here.




















a truly international magazine
opera is the leading magazine in the operatic world. we are based in london, but around half of our readership is outside the uk, and we aim to provide the most widespread coverage of the opera world that we can. at our last count we had readers in at least 65 countries. our team of correspondents reflects this, being located across six continents. in 2019 we carried reviews from well over 200 different cities and towns, in 46 countries. we don’t believe any other magazine comes close.




















“obviously, i am going to be a very big fan of any magazine so in love with opera, and i am proud to say that i have read opera magazine for many years. this small and beautiful magazine is one of the true authorities of the opera world.”
– the late luciano pavarotti
