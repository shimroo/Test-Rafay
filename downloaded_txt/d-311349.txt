										  who do you know that 
										wants to become a 
										best selling children's author?
what if you had the secret recipe 
										that would help you  transform 
										your book into a bestseller?   

										my friend laura duksta broke 
										self-publishing history when her book 
										sold 179,000 copies! 
										she has since picked up a top agent and 
										publisher and her book has gone on to 
										sell over 250,000 copies!  
if this is a good fit for your 
										personal journey and goals...

 join her for a 6-week childrens author 
										academy tele-class
