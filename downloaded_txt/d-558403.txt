hear what our customershave to say 










						i cannot rate this company highly enough.  from the moment we called to get a quote to the time our fence project was complete, metro fence demonstrated the highest level of professionalism and customer service.  we received multiple bids for our fence replacement project; metro fence came in the lowest. 					


steve vaughan 






						metro fence did an excellent job replacing our fence that was wrecked by the highlands ranch tornado last year. their crew was very courteous and incredibly fast. we didn’t realize how bad our old fence was until they replaced it with high quality materials and great workmanship.					


j. shanley 






						the metro fence crew, moose and braylon, just finished a beautiful job on my replacement fence. both the quality of the material and the workmanship were great. and the guys were a delight to work with - cheerful, informative, and efficient.
