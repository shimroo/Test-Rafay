what our students say













elsie & bertie
nursery
the forest school and the outdoor education is just fantastic. it’s really nice that they get to spend so much time outside playing and learning about the weather.

lucy

i like playing with my friends and working with my table partners in maths. maths is my favourite. we move around the table and get to work with everybody.

 back













josh
p6
everyone is very kind and the teachers are caring and you get a variety of subjects and afterschool activities. i’m looking forward to playing rugby in the senior school.

roseanna

i really like drama. we’re doing the twits this year and it’s going to be really fun. it’s amazing because the children learn to do the lighting, the sound…it’s just incredible.

caroline

there are so many things that you can do. i do quite a lot of music and sports. i’m in the chamber choir, the pipe band, the orchestra and i also play hockey.

james
6th
if you have a query in any subject, the teacher will take you through it so there is a lot of one-on-one time that you can get, which is really nice and useful.
