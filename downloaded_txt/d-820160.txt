there are many gyros, but only one gyro wrap®.we created our award-winning, original gyro wrap recipe over 40 years ago, and have become an athens, ga legend ever since. that’s because our gyro wrap has bold flavor combinations that people crave. it features our proprietary, seasoned gyro sliced directly from the cone, topped with our signature tzatziki sauce and crisp veggies, all wrapped in our fresh, grilled pita bread. but our menu doesn’t stop there. our hot-off-the-grill cheesesteak is so good, it makes true philadelphians proud. and our kurly fries remind you why you love fries so much. at gyro wrap, you’ll find freshly grilled food, bold flavors, and a great vibe. you work hard - now it’s time to eat good!
