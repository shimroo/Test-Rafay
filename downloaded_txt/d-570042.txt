our faith journeys

welcome! i’m happy you found my blog site (or one of my social media sites) where i share what i have learned in my faith journey, and where i hope i can encourage you on your faith journey. this main page will announce my most recent scripture devotions, will feature sets of seasonal devotions (particularly around holy week and advent), and will have links to pages describing the foundations of my faith.
thank you for walking with me! jm



most recent devotions
god is love
going to nowhere
love does not insist
waiting
so what?


the foundations of my faith — what i believe

god is love.
god is much bigger than we think.
god is crafting each of us to be unique works of art.
god still speaks to us today.
the bible tells the story of real people seeking to know god better.
