mepkin abbey is a community of roman catholic monks established in 1949 on the site of the historic mepkin plantation located on the cooper river, north of charleston, south carolina. founded by the monks of gethsemani in kentucky, the brothers of mepkin belong to the worldwide order of cistercians of the strict observance popularly known as trappist. following the rule of st. benedict, the monks at mepkin abbey devote their lives to prayer, spiritual study, work and hospitality.  living by the work of their hands, the monks provide a livelihood for themselves and the poor.
