dear readers,if you may have realized that this blog was once deleted and now re-opened. there is a reason for that i know! i deleted all my posts from the original blog i started that way i could focus what is ahead for me in my life between now and this fall! it's all a preparation for me, with the best intentions to help me better serve our lord. it's all a spiritual growth for me now and tons of sacrifices are being made in my life on the internet, at home, at work and in everything else i do in my life.i started a new blog, but instead of writting anything down as if it was a journal, i posted pictures instead. as they as pictures are worth a thousand words. and every picture tells a certain story without any words. so here is the link to my blog, picture perfect . please leave comments if you wish and if you find a interesting picture feel free to send it for me to post on the new site!!god bless and take care!!in him,sixtina nicolette
