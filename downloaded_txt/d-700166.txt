careera few milestones

 

kathy’s career has been the result of hard work, luck, and smart decisions across a wide variety of consumer-driven industries.

   





a childhood unlike most
kathy was born in wickliffe, ohio. when she was young, kathy's family chalked up communication challenges to her being "slow." kathy was in second grade when school administrators and audiologists diagnosed hearing loss as the cause of her challenges with speech development. throughout her childhood, she was sexually molested and contemplated suicide in her adolescence.
          






post-graduation confusion

            at age 20, kathy hung out on the shores of lake erie, trying to figure out what to do with the rest of her life, when she was run over by a 3,500-pound lifeguard jeep while sunbathing. she was pronounced dead by attending paramedics and saw life after death. (at least she believed she did.) kathy was in and out of a wheelchair for two years because of intermittent paralysis in her legs. it took almost five years to completely recover.
          






just when you think it can't get worse

            one year after recovering from the jeep accident, kathy received more heartbreaking news: a cervical cancer diagnosis. she endured two more years of hospital visits to defeat cancer. and she hadn't turned 30 yet!
          






this is not a joke

            kathy started working as a massage exercise therapist, and she found that laughter became effective medicine for her clients' healing. a patient of hers, actress geri jewell, had cerebral palsy and encouraged kathy to have a go at a cerebral palsy fundraiser event called "stand-up comics take a stand." kathy thought the contest was an amateur night, but instead there were professional comedians with decades of experience competing. kathy ended up winning the first night and placing 4th in the finals out of 80 comediennes who were in the business for 3 to 10 years. and she's been doing comedy ever since.
          






the power of comedy
one comedy routine led to another, and soon kathy became a big name on the us comedy circuit. she made appearances on the tonight show, the today show, good morning america, cbs this morning, entertainment tonight, extra, inside edition, turner entertainment report, cnn's show biz today, real life, and geraldo. soon, kathy got the acting bug and guest starred on touched by an angel, and played herself in a one-woman off-broadway show called now hear this! which was a spin-off of her award-winning show “don’t buck with me!” which earned the ovation award for best writer in a broadway musical and several other awards and critical praise. soon after, kathy wrote and produced the award-winning no labels, no limits! for pbs, which received the cine golden eagle award and media access award for outstandng television special. 
          






motivating by accident
kathy accidentally discovered her gift for motivational speaking when she was hired to do a workshop for people with disabilities. instead of referring to complicated instruction books, kathy shared her understanding of having no self-esteem because of the labels society has placed on her. since then, kathy has traveled across the nation, speaking to teens, adults, and seniors to spread a message of positivity. in 2003, she wrote and published an autobiography, if you could hear what i see, which became a bestseller. 
          






advocating for love, compassion, and forgiveness
today, kathy inspires audiences as a motivational speaker. by sharing her story of overcoming adversity, she inspires thousands of people annually in corporations, schools, non-profits, and more. she's a key motivational speaker for tony robbins' life mastery classes, a recurring guest speaker at paul mitchell schools, and works with the government on behalf of the americans with disabilities act (ada). kathy is also a national spokesperson for no limits, a non-profit organization that provides after-school education and theater programs to children with hearing impairments.

keynotesmy message

 

just as kathy recognizes that every individual is different, she prepares a unique keynote for every speaking engagement. below are a few examples of kathy’s previous talks for corporate audiences.

   

no labels, no limits

 

unlock your potential by removing labels

  

kathy talks about the labels that society puts on us and the labels we also put on ourselves. she addresses the fact that we subscribe to these labels, which can even modify our own self-awareness. kathy inspires her audiences to remove the labels and empowers audiences to make a change, become self-confident, self-aware, and experience self-growth. kathy’s message will free you and awaken the unlimited potential inside each of us. 

   

the gift of choice

 

your life is your decision

  

by opening your eyes to the opportunities presented in your life, you become empowered to make decisions. in this inspiring talk, kathy uses personal examples to show that negativity in our lives is directly created by the negative choices we make. when kathy was 20 years old, she was run over by a lifeguard jeep at the beach and pronounced dead by paramedics. instead of viewing that moment as a tragedy, kathy saw the event as an opportunity of choice. that day, kathy made the choice to fight for her life and vowed to live her life to the fullest. by learning from kathy’s story, audiences will be inspired to make choices that better the lives of themselves, their coworkers, and the world.

   

forgive yourself to free yourself

 

finding strength through unconditional love

  

 to the external eye, kathy has been wronged most of her life. she was wronged when she developed a hearing impairment. she was wronged when she was transferred to a school for mentally impaired children, despite having no mental impairments herself. she was wronged to have been molested as a child. she was wronged to have been run over by a jeep. and she was wronged to have cervical cancer. but instead of holding on to the wrongs, kathy forgives. forgiveness is a gift you give yourself. it frees you of the burden that comes with holding on to pain. through examples from her life experiences and the people she’s met along the way, kathy will open audience’s eyes to the power of forgiveness.
