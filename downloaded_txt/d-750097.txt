grants for kingdom impact



est. 1927
















welcome to the henry parsons crowelland susan coleman crowell trust



founded in 1927, the crowell trust is dedicated to the teaching and active extension of the doctrines of evangelical christianity through approved grants to qualified organizations.




    our story
  














henry parsons crowell was one of the most successful entrepreneurs in american history who after hearing a sermon from dwight moody, decided to live his life with absolute faith and obedience to god. 









































“oh, for a deeper, clearer view of him who is the creator and inspirer of all.” henry parsons crowell
















the crowell trust legacy






















in the early 1900s, henry parsons crowell made a commitment as a young man after hearing a sermon by dwight l. moody, to glorify god with the skills and strengths he had been given. 






















as he became a successful entrepreneur, founding the quaker oats company and numerous other companies, he remained faithful in stewarding his resources to expand the kingdom of god.






















 in 1927, as he established the crowell trust, he wrote an indenture that continues to be followed to this day.






















today — the crowell trust celebrates the commitment of mr. crowell and the faithfulness of god resulting in almost a century of grantmaking to ministries with kingdom impact.
