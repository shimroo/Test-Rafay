what is jmri?







the jmri project is building tools for model railroad computer control.
                we want it to be usable to as many people as possible,
                so we're building it in java to run anywhere,
                and we're trying to make it independent of specific hardware systems.
jmri is intended as a jumping-off point for hobbyists
                who want to control their layouts with a computer
                without having to create an entire system from scratch.


you can manage your locomotive rosters and easily program your decoders using
                decoderpro®.
you can build control panels and control your layout using
                panelpro™ to set up signaling and other functions.
                operationspro™
                lets you create manifests that route cars across your railroad from shipper to receiver,
                and provide train crews with operating instructions.
going beyond the basics, you can use logix to
                automate your layout's behavior, interface with x10 and insteon systems to control your
                layout room's lights
                and write
                scripts to extend the capabilities
                of the system.








            as an open source project, jmri is evolving in many directions at once. you can get
            involved at as many levels:

                jmri is celebrating its 25th birthday!  it first started to come together in october of 1999. it's come a long way since!
                
                we're also celebrating the 10,000 
                contributed update 
                to the jmri source code. thanks to 
                all the people who've worked on jmri over the years.
                
                for more information, see 
                    here.
            

mr slam formatter: another "jmri connections" application





                tim mann has created "model railroad switch list and manifest formatter (mr slam formatter)"
                as an additional way to create custom railroad paperwork from jmri information.
                for more info, see our community connections page
                or go directly to
                the program's website


new "how to" explanations for operations





            there's a new series of introductory "how to" explanations for jmri operations.
            these provide step-by-step instructions for doing the first things needed to get started with operations.
		   

check out the "jmri clinics" page





            several users have contributed their clinics for our
			clinics page.  there are both conventional handout
			and slides clinics, and also some neat interactive clinics for decoderpro®
			and panelpro™.
			
			some jmri clinics from past nmra national and other conventions are also included.
		   

additional applications with jmri connections





           hobbyists have created applications that work with jmri
           to provide extra capabilities. in addition, some commercial vendors have
           created applications that work with, add data to, or take data from jmri.
           see the 
           community/connections directory for a list and links.
           new applications can be added at any time!
           

your smart phone as a
                throttle







                    you can use your iphone, ipad or android phone as a throttle with jmri.
                    
                    after you download
                    and install a program onto your phone, you can connect it
                    wirelessly to your computer running jmri, which in turn will run your layout.
                    imagine friends visiting your layout and running trains from their mobile device,
                    without having to bring throttles.
                    
                    for more information, see the
                    feature page.
                

run locos in a
                browser







                    you can control your layout directly from your computer, smartphone or tablet, without the need
                    to download and install any application.
                    the current web browsers running on these devices are able to manage the resources and features needed to replace physical throttles.
                    just start the jmri web server on your jmri computer, open http://<your jmri server>/web/webthrottle.html and enjoy it.
                    for more information, please visit the
                    webthrottle - web control for locos, panels, turnouts and routes page.
                

jmri on raspberry pi





                    the raspberry pi is becoming increasingly popular as a small and cheap computer.
                    jmri will operate under the raspbian operating system (debian version of linux).
                    follow the installation instructions..
                

online help





                    the jmri applications have a built-in help system. it has lots of information, including
                    overviews and window-specific information.  the pages are simple html, and users are
                    encouraged to
                    add missing information.
                    the help information is available online via either the
                    index or
                    table of contents.
                

decoder id pages



                    our "decoder id" pages provide easy access to all sorts of information
                    about decoders.
                    they are automatically created from the current decoderpro definitions.
                    
                    contribute more information to our decoder definitions, and help these pages become even more useful!


kam dispute ends!





                    jmri is an informal open-source software group.
                    we do this for the joy of model railroading, and don't produce anything for profit.
                    
                    one of our members has spent four years in the federal courts
                    defending our right to continue
                    against an individual who has attacked us with
                    bogus patent threats, cybersquatting, copyright infringement and other illegal acts.

                    
                    we are extremely pleased to announce that this case has been
                    settled.
                    the agreement ends the dispute, and gives everybody involved a way to move forward.
                    this is a victory for jmri and open-source software in general.
