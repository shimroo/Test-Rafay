dog 
                    collars all dogs should 
                    have a collar and dog tags! the thought of a loved dog being stolen or 
                    lost is not pleasant for anyone, although statistics clearly 
                    show that there is a far greater chance of seeing your dog 
                    again if they are wearing a dog collar and pet id tag. although dog collars 
                    do not only useful for returning and re-claiming lost dogs. 
                    dogs collars are very useful for walking and exercising 
                    dogs and go a long way to showing you are a responsible 
                    pet owner. it is important for all dogs to have a correctly 
                    fitting and comfortable collar and pet tag, no matter whether you have 
                    a chihuahua or a great dane. dog collars are even useful 
                    for giving your dog a certain appearance. for example, many 
                    owners of male dogs, especially breeds such as bulldogs, 
                    bull mastiffs and rottweilers, like to purchase dog collars 
                    that are thick, dark and feature accessories such as silver 
                    studs. or alternatively, owners of female dogs, and breeds 
                    such as poodles, pomeranians and mexican hairless prefer 
                    to use lighter, summery coloured ribbon dog collars to promote 
                    their dogs femininity and delicateness. no matter what breed 
                    of dog you own, a dog collar is a responsible and necessary 
                    item for your beloved pet
