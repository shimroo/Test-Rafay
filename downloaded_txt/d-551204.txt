        the adventure of cycling

who has ever tried mountain biking has 
                    been thrilled by it's sheer excitement the moment they sat 
                    down on the saddle and started pedaling. then came the obsession 
                    of the sport. we now purchase mountain bikes for thousands 
                    of dollars to keep our drive alive. but many of us are oblivious 
                    of the fact that our bikes must be nurtured as we are. cracked 
                    frames, bent chains, rusty hubs, un-true wheels must always 
                    be fixed. but it is true that sending our bikes to the shop 
                    is an answer to many of these problems. but wouldn't it be 
                    nice if we could make all the repairs ourselves? well... at 
                    this site you will find all the repair tips 'n tricks that 
                    you will ever need. enjoy! and if you have any questions or 
                    problems, e-mail me and i will reply as soon as i can.
