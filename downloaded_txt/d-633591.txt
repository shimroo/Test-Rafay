dear itn subscriber:
sadly, due to circumstances beyond our control, international
                      travel news has ceased publication.
we had hoped to outlast the effects of covid on the travel
                  industry, but it has taken such a toll that it has become
                  financially impossible for itn to
                  continue. the april 2022 issue is our last, and the
                  more-than-difficult decision to stop publishing was reached
                  after that issue was sent to the printer — the reason
                  this farewell was not included within it.
march 1976 was when the first issue of itn
                  was printed and mailed, the brain-child of the original
                  publisher, the late armond noble, who noticed something about
                  travel publications: they were filled with glowing accounts
                  written by people who had been paid to travel. what was needed
                  was a place where consumer travelers could share what they
                  really experienced while traveling, both the good and the bad.
the concept armond came up with was a magazine written by its
                  subscribers, and he was not afraid to print their criticisms
                  of airlines, tours, cruises, etc. — something unheard of
                  at that time. the result was decades of exciting travel
                  accounts, helpful warnings, numerous travel tips, interesting
                  exchanges and just plain fun. a legacy to be proud of!
itn's publisher, helen noble,
                  itn's staff and i thank our
                  contributing editors and all of you who have supported this
                  magazine these 46 years. whether you subscribed, submitted
                  travel reports or photos or spread the word about this
                  publication — the original travelers' forum —
                  your contributions were what made it possible. we also thank
                  the many companies who advertised in itn,
                  without whom we would not have made it this far.
should you know of anyone interested in purchasing itn
                  to carry on what armond started, please email helen at hlnoble1@gmail.com.
our wonderful adventure is completed, but we hope you will
                  continue to use the information that was presented in the
                  magazine, appreciating the spirit with which it was shared, to
                  enhance your future explorations of the globe.
thank you, again, from all of us at itn.
