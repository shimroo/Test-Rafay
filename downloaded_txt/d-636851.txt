we have some exciting news at blue moon glassworks. after 23+ years rose & i are retiring and turning the reigns over to kris colby and lindsay foxx. our lease ends in hyde park at the end of the year and they have secured a lease on a larger space on burnet rd at anderson lane.

we have been so blessed with wonderful customers all these years. we have taught thousands of students the arts of stained glass, fusing, and flame working. we’ve built hundreds of stained glass windows all around central texas. we just can’t thank you enough!

we’re excited to see how kris and lindsay expand the business with new classes and products. most of the staff is staying on in some capacity so we hope to see you at the new location in january. more information soon.

our best,
jim & rose berry
