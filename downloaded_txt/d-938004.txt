dungeons & dwagons!
giant of the glocca morra
 
a demon has taken over a neighborhood of a post-apocalyptic new york city, and it's up to you to save the townsfolk, and maybe even the demon himself.
 
dungeons & dwagons: giant of the glocca morra is  completely written & illustrated by me, cheese hasselberger. this 100% playable role-playing game is based on my misadventures while attending the school of visual arts, with some artistic liberties. yes, it's an autobiographical role-playing game module.
 
available now in the new store!












alas, after 17 years, the nyc comic jam is no more. but we have a large archive of comics from these historic meet ups, as well as a few featured classics. they're weird, gross, and dated! too many trigger warnings to be listed here.












the latest comicbook from cheese hasselberger, richard sharver and the hollow earth. a science fiction tale like many others and not like any other all at the same time.













heavy metal parody comic! new in the webcomic section! it's pretty funny! check it out to the big dog!
