eden salon is an aveda concept salon and we pride ourselves on providing a look you love that looks great on you! we promise to listen and provide a high level of care and service at every visit and we do it with an approach that’s a little bit playful and a whole lot smart.





sometimes
it’s good to give in to temptation…



a wise man once said, “i can resist anything but temptation.” (it was oscar wilde, if we remember correctly.) that’s how eden feels about you. we are committed to helping you look and feel your best!
take time to relax and recharge,  life can be such a bore if we don’t play!
if you feel the need for a refresh, we promise to listen to you and then collaborate with you. visit an artist who listens to what you want and knows how to give it to you! come share your thoughts about your look.
whether you visit eden for our expert salon services, need a stunning look for a special occasion or event, or are simply in the mood for a little self-care, plan a relaxing visit to our spa.
