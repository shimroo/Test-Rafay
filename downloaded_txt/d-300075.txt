precision weighing & dispensing equipmentowned by xigent automation systems, fillpro proprietary technology is used to develop custom high-precision weighing and dispensing equipment. by converting manual processes with automated fillpro solutions we can improve packing accuracy, eliminate product loss, and avoiding product contamination. all needs require a different level of customization and scale, which is why our products range from semi-automated table-top units to fully automated, recipe-driven batching systems.  the fillpro technology behind our equipment provides precise and flexible solutions that give day to day reliability. our custom equipment can be designed for most flowable dry or liquid materials. one of the first things we do is to talk with you about your material characteristics and request samples for evaluation. we will pretest your material in-house, generate performance data, then discuss how our equipment can be designed to meet your process requirements.

materials we work withwe work with a wide array of materials and understand the complexities they can present. we have delivered equipment to handle both small and large scale dispensing of not only powders, but granular materials, explosive materials, abrasives, casting grains, toxicology compounds, pellets, tablets, and seeds. our range within the liquid categories is just as varied.  whatever material you bring to us - sticky, runny, corrosive, viscous, combustible - we can work with you to design the right equipment solution.






































project planningwe enjoy talking about what we do. when you are ready to add new equipment or upgrade your existing systems, we can talk you through options to meet your goals and share our process for concept design and quotations.

the fillpro legacyit all began with harris design & manufacturing, established in 1982.  in 2001, harris design acquired weigh-fill technology from hierath automated systems. several key employees from hierath migrated to harris design and brought with them 15 years of design and production experience specific to precision weighing and filling.  with these advancements in talent and technology, harris design adopted the fillpro name and began to make its mark in the industry. pretty quickly, the company decided to focus exclusively on industrial automation within the weigh-fill and dispensing segment. through innovation and delivering uncompromising quality, fillpro became one of the premier suppliers of commercial equipment in the market. in 2007, fillpro (then located in golden, colorado) began supplying custom equipment to industrial automation builder, xigent automation systems. after several years of working closely on design concepts and equipment integrations, the two companies had built a solid, collaborative partnership. in 2013, xigent acquired fillpro and moved operations to the lewis center, ohio facility.
