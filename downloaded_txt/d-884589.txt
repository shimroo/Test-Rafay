fillets updated to 1.0.1-6

 august 25, 2018august 27, 2018  admin 


i’ve updated fillets to use sdl 2 to fix some problems with the old one not working on recent versions of macos.
this new version is also code-signed and sandboxed to make it play nice with gatekeeper.
go get it!

toppler updated to 1.1.6-3

 december 20, 2017december 21, 2017  admin 



toppler was updated to 1.1.6-3. this update was mainly for compatibility with newer versions of macos. this version is 64-bit only, and should run on machines from 10.9 onward. if your version of toppler had sound that didn’t work, broken fullscreen, etc., this should take care of that. additionally, this removes reading/writing to the unix-style hidden directory $home/.toppler and puts high score files and settings in a more mac-friendly and sandbox-aware location. as a result, your high scores and settings might not carry over. you can manually move these files if you so desire.
go get it!

freedroid updated to 1.0.2-2

 december 19, 2017december 21, 2017  admin 


freedroid has been updated to 1.0.2-2. this is basically to make it run on more recent versions of macos where sound and other features were broken. in the process i updated the code to support sdl 2.0, fixed some problems that prevented it from building for 64-bit, and added a code signature so it plays nice with gatekeeper.

toppler updated to 1.1.6

 march 22, 2013  admin 


i’ve updated toppler to the official 1.1.6 software. the binary is now an intel-only version since i no longer have tools for ppc builds.
go get it!
(note: there was a bad link to 1.1.3 posted for a bit on the actual toppler page. if you’re getting crashes on os x 10.11, please make sure you’ve got the 1.1.6 from the corrected link.)

go get it
