charitymania sweepstakes

incentives to help you sell

when you sell charitystudio subscription access codes, you have the option to use charitymania’s unique sweepstakes to provide an extra incentive for donors to buy the music subscriptions and support your organization. this service is entirely optional and additional fees may apply.
if you use charitymania’s sweepstakes as an incentive, donors to your fundraiser will receive a complimentary, no-purchase necessary, sweepstakes game card along with every music access code they purchase.  each sweepstakes game card gives the holder a chance to win cash prizes. there is no skill involved and the sweepstakes do not require any purchase for entry. the purchase incentive works similarly to the way mcdonald’s monopoly sweepstakes provides incentives for their customers to purchase additional fries and burgers.
if you are interested, please call us and we can help you decide if this type of program is right for your organization.

neil quinn, phd
software engineering


neil has a broad background in computer science, education, and entrepreneurship. with his ph.d. in electrical engineering from university of southern california, neil spent the first 30 years of his professional life working as an engineer, eventually founding his own business, quad-q systems.
specializing in computerized process control systems, neil’s company created marine mammal life-support systems for sea world and zoos; medical instrumentation control systems; and air conditioning, heating, and ventilation control systems, among others.
it came as a bit of a surprise to neil’s friends and family when he decided to return to school and pursue a lifelong passion in the field of ethics and theology. he earned a graduate degree in theology (specializing in business ethics) from the university of notre dame and then accepted a job as a professor at santa clara university in silicon valley. while there, neil taught graduate electrical engineering classes, business ethics classes, helped found the santa clara center for science, technology and society, and was a presidential fellow with the markkula center for applied ethics.
at about this same time, neil began working with his son, chris, on a fundraising idea he had to help out their local parish in san diego. the fundraisers were so successful that neil and chris eventually decided to work on them full time… and charitymania was born. neil has served as the founder and managing partner of charitymania since its inception over 25 years ago and is thrilled to be working full time with his son and daughter.
neil has a bs in physics from loyola university, a phd in electrical engineering from usc, and a masters degree in theology from notre dame university. in his spare time, neil loves the outdoors and traveling. his latest adventures include walking the camino de santiago, and trips to antarctica, the galapagos islands, and the grand canyon.

charitymania company history

it all started about 25 years ago when neil quinn ran a fundraiser for his local parish and youth group at st. james catholic church in san diego, ca. that fundraiser was essentially what we call footballmania today. the fundraiser was unique, fun, and raised a lot of money for the parish. parishioners were excited and sold the tickets to friends and family across southern california.
some of the footballmania tickets were sold to members of a catholic parish located in the los angeles area. that parish loved the fundraiser and called st. james to ask how they too could run it. they were told, “you gotta talk to neil quinn.” instead of trying to document and explain all that needed to be done to run footballmania, neil offered to donate his time to run it for the parish in los angeles as well. they sold thousands of tickets and it was a huge success.
over the next few years a variety of churches and nonprofit organizations from across the country learned about footballmania through word-of-mouth and contacted neil to ask if they could use the fundraiser as well. neil was completely surprised by the growing interest in his fundraiser, but was also extremely proud that he could help so many organizations raise money and do great things. he didn’t know if he had the time to help every organization that wanted to run footballmania, but he also felt that he had an obligation to help them if he could. neil started spending more and more of his time helping run the fundraisers for organizations across the us. he charged a small fee to cover his expenses and time and ran the operations completely out of his home as a small side business. charitymania was born!
as the business continued to grow rapidly, it was clear neil could no longer handle the workload by himself. so he brought on his son, chris, and his daughter, michele, to work part time. fast forward to today and now neil, chris, michele, and michele’s husband, jeff, are all full time partners at charitymania and the business continues to grow from the word-of-mouth of happy customers.
we are truly blessed to work for the business we created and are extremely proud that we’ve helped so many great organizations raise so much money for such worthy causes. we pride ourselves on helping organizations do great things, and on providing exceptional personal customer service. we look forward to many more fundraising years in the future!

music downloads and sweepstakes game cards… a winning combination!
to raise money, you sell charitymania tickets (prices between $5 and $25 per ticket) and keep 70% of the money you collect. the charitymania ticket (i.e. the stub at the top) contains an access code that allows the buyer to download a fantastic set of digital music from our charitystudio site. beneath this ticket, a promotional sweepstakes game card gives the recipient a chance to win $1000s in prize money!


why sell music downloads? why not just use the sweepstakes game cards?
there is a legal difference between a sweepstakes and raffle. with a raffle, people pay money for a ticket that gives them a chance to win prizes. only specific types of organizations can conduct a raffle and most states regulate how the raffles can operate. a sweepstakes is not a raffle. a sweepstakes is a promotion that provides extra incentive for people to buy a product that you are selling. the sweepstakes must have a ‘no purchase necessary’ method of entry. in a charitymania fundraiser, the sweepstakes game cards are promotion only and are not sold directly. every time someone buys a charitymania ticket, they purchase over $5 to $25 worth of premium music downloads (depending on the price of the charitymania ticket) from our charitystudio. the sweepstakes game card is a promotion that provides a great extra incentive for a person to support your cause.

legally, our sweepstakes game cards work much like the game pieces in the monopoly sweepstakes® at mcdonald’s®. you cannot buy a monopoly game piece directly. instead, you purchase things like hamburgers and drinks and receive the game pieces for free. the monopoly game pieces are promotion.



no purchase necessary sweepstakes tst
all charitymania sweepstakes are “no purchase necessary”. if someone wants a free sweepstakes game card, they can come to your organization and fill out a request form (provided by charitymania) to get a free game card. they mail their completed request to charitymania along with a self-addressed stamped envelope and then we will mail the person a game card. we do not mail them the music download access code (because they are not paying). this process is very standard for all companies that conduct sweepstakes.




















what does an example game card look like?
participants can win $1000s in prizes based on the points scored by teams pre-printed on the back of their sweepstakes game cards. you do not pick any of the teams or need to predict who will win. there is no skill needed to win prizes.
