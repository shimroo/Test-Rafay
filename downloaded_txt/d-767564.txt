a heartfelt thank you to the marian center                                                      on wednesday, february 12, we had the honor of picking up 20 beautifully crafted hope boxes created by the incredible students of the marian center school and services in miami gardens.                                    for over 61 years, the marian center, a part of the archdiocese of miami, has been dedicated to serving students and adults with diverse abilities, empowering them through education, faith, and community support.                                    each year, during catholic schools week, they select a service project that reflects their belief in the power of giving. this year, we were truly grateful that they chose to partner with joshua’s heart foundation to spread hope and kindness through their thoughtful donations.                                    “the mission of the marian center is to educate and empower persons with diverse abilities and nurture them to wholeness, following the gospel and the church’s call to love, charity, and justice.”                                    we extend our deepest appreciation to the students, faculty, and staff for their generosity and dedication to making a difference. your kindness is inspiring, and we are honored to be a part of this meaningful initiative!                                    to learn more about the marian center, visit www.mariancenterschool.org or find them on facebook.                                    #hopeinaction #mariancenter #jhfgivingback #makingadifference                                                                                     claudia mclean                                                      vice president                                                      joshua’s heart foundation
