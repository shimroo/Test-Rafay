happy birthday ellen!




be sure to tune in to today's ellen for her big birthday show! pink, julia roberts, colin farrell and jaden smith help her celebrate. the best, portia sings her happy birthday- dressed as marilyn monroe. shexy!

ellen has no idea who is coming to visit, the show was kept secret. pink joins ellen when delivering the opening monologue and even serenades the birthday girl.

roberts will bring a beautiful gift and farrell supplies the cake. one of her favorite bands- one eskimo will perform "given up." plan on lots of gifts for the audience too! what did ellen's staff get her? "a well-rehearsed performance of double dream hands led by the original choreographer, john jacobson!"

reese: women mature, sexual confidence follows





 
on how getting older makes her feel sexier…
"i think as a woman, you get older, you feel more confident in your sexuality. you’re not as intimidated by it, not as embarrassed by it. sexuality and femininity is an accumulation of age and wisdom and comfort in your own skin. i feel better—so much better now than i ever did in my twenties. i am calmer; i know who i am. and as a result, i feel much sexier."
 
on women in hollywood…
"there’s always going to be somebody younger or sexier. that’s why i like to say, and it's become my famous line, 'funny doesn't sag.'"
 
on having more kids…
"i would love to have more kids. kids are the best part of my day. i don't wake up to make movies. i wake up to hang out with my family."
 
on how her goals have changed since making legally blonde…
"my ambition has sort of broadened. i’m more interested in literature, art, public policy. and i’m really interested in doing more philanthropic endeavors."

on her life…
"i'm really, really lucky. i've got a lot of love in my life. i've got great friends. i have two great kids whom i make pancakes for every sunday. i’m very blessed."
 
on making romantic comedies…
"i love romantic comedies. i watch them all the time. i love all my fellow female romantic comedy queens, like jennifer aniston, jennifer garner and katie heigl. i also think that the questions romantic comedies ask about men and women are universal."

glamour's women of the year



 

fergie has been named in glamour's women of the year 2010. her fragrance, the peas, the grammys. she is a bold musical force. she has also shown a real "social conscience," working for causes from aids to cancer. so what does ferg have to say? 

on self-esteem:
"if you start making the right choices for yourself, all of a sudden you start feeling better and better. you’d be surprised how addicting high self-esteem is."

on her relationship with husband josh duhamel being featured in the tabloids:
"just knowing that our relationship was stronger than that. we live in a voyeuristic world, and it’s part of our business. but i like to focus on all the perks that i get in this business."

her advice to young women:
"there were periods of my life when a lot of people didn’t believe in me. [but] i still had faith in myself. i really had to ask myself life questions. where do i see myself in five years? create a ladder for yourself, and walk up the steps. climb that ladder."

on watching other women flock after her husband:
"for me, i’m not a jealous person. that’s just not my thing. you have to have trust in your relationship."

her advice to teenage girls:
"i think a lot of you teenagers try to get esteem from accolades from other people, or boys, and what you learn as you get older is that you have to create that within yourself."

the issue is available digitally and on newsstands nationwide november 9. check out the full interview here!
