frequently asked questions









how much time do candidates typically spend on the postal exam?

while their most common online tests are not timed, most applicants complete them in 30-45 minutes.














what happens after passing the postal exam?

a job offer is sent to one applicant, the one with the highest exam score. test preparation is essential for success.














what if i don’t pass the usps exam?

failing results in an ineligible status, and you must wait one year to retake that test.














is 72 hours sufficient time to prepare?

absolutely! and you must take the exam within 72 hours of applying, so that is all the time you have. a fully up-to-date and proven successful test prep guide is a definite requirement.














how can i trust the authenticity of your preparation material?

pathfinder has been leading postal job applicants to success since 1981.  t.w. parnell, author of our guides, routinely takes the postal exams to assure his materials are always fully up-to-date.  his publications are known for detailed exam info, for ultra-realistic practice tests with actual questions from the real exams, and for providing the exact answers needed to ace the exams.  his test prep guides consistently receive enthusiastic reviews.  in addition, mr. parnell participated with the u.s. senate sub-committee on federal services in a campaign to rid the postal test prep field of scam operators.  this campaign led to his consumer alerts being published.














what is the usps exam, and why is it required?

the postal service uses their specialized online employment exams as tools for identifying the best job applicants. 














what are the main types of usps exams?

the most popular tests - exams 474, 475, 476, and 477 - are used to fill over 95% of all jobs. each exam is used to fill a particular category of jobs. see our exams page for details on the jobs filled by different exams.














are usps exams timed?

exams 474, 475, 476, and 477 are not timed. you can work at your own pace. 














how do i register for the usps exam?

you do not apply or register for an exam. you apply for a job and are scheduled for an exam as part of the application process. 














is there a fee to take the usps exam?

no, there is never a fee to apply for or take an exam. beware of scammers who claim that - for a fee - they will register you for a job or an exam.














what is a passing score for the usps exam?

a score of 70 or above is required to pass.














what happens if i fail the usps exam?

you receive an ineligible status and you will not be considered for a job. if you fail and want to retake that exam, you must wait one year.














can i retake the exam to improve my score?

if you passed but did not score high enough to get a job, you must wait two years before retaking that exam.














how are candidates prioritized for jobs?

job offers are made exclusively based upon exam scores. after collecting sufficient applications and exam scores for a job posting, a job offer is sent to one candidate, the one with the highest score.














when will i receive my exam results?

results are usually available immediately in your usps ecareers account.














what study materials should i use to prepare?

your answers on exams 474, 475, 476, and 477 are used to create a profile of you that is compared to their theoretical profile for an ideal employee. the closer you match their ideal profile, the higher your score. our guide has the actual questions from the real exams and - most importantly - provides the exact answers proven to ace the exam. using these answers, your profile will match their ideal profile.














how long should i prepare for the exam?

even a few hours with the right material can yield success. the more time you spend, the better you will perform.














what is the format of the usps exam?

exams 474, 475, 476, and 477 include sections entitled work scenarios, tell us your story, describe your approach, check for errors, and work your register.














are there practice tests available?

yes, our guide has ultra-realistic practice tests with actual questions from the real exams, and it provides the exact answers proven to ace the exams. 














how can i reduce stress while preparing?

the only way to reduce stress and test taking anxiety is to become intimately familiar with odd content and format of the exams. that is one of the primary purposes of our test prep materials.














can i use notes or resources during the test?

they do not want you to, but you can. our customers often refer to our guide - which provides the exact answers needed to ace the exam - while taking their exams to assure they choose the best answers.














how long do i have to complete the exam once invited?

you must complete the online exam with 72 hours of applying.














what happens after i pass the exam?

the top scoring applicant for that particular job is sent a job offer. if that person does not meet the usps employment requirements, an offer is sent to the applicant with the second highest score. and so on. so, if you have a really good score, even if it is not the highest, you may eventually receive a job offer.














can i apply for multiple usps positions with one exam?

yes, but each exam is used to fill only one category of jobs. for instance, exam 474 is used to fill all mail delivery jobs, so you can use your exam 474 score to apply for as many delivery jobs as you like. but you cannot use your exam 474 score to apply for jobs in other categories.














will they hold my score and use it to consider me for other jobs filled from that exam?

no. they do not automatically consider for any jobs other that the one(s) you specifically apply for. to be considered for additional jobs, you must apply for each one of them individually. if the additional jobs fall under a different category, you must first take the exam used to fill jobs in that category.














what if i need special accommodations for the exam?

email the usps at examadmin@usps.gov before taking the test.
