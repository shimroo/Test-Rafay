we belong together
[23 jun 2016|12:02pm]





on a day full of so much political divisiveness in so many countries, i find the news this morning that my picture book wij horen bij elkaar (we belong together) illustrated by ann de bode, will be published in china to be heartening news. not just because it's another rights sale, but because it shows people still believing in the power of literature to create empathy and unity among us. i hope the uk votes today to #remain. we belong together!

latvia
[08 jun 2016|11:20am]





i've hardly used this journal, as anyone who still has it on their feeds will know. not sure it makes sense to try and summarize what's happened in the interim, so will just jump in as if i've been using it all this time.for more up-to-the-minute news, my twitter in english is @lawrenceschimel and in spanish is @1barbax2###have already checked-in for tomorrow's flights to riga! will be my first time in latvia. giving a seminar for children's publishers on friday, a poetry reading on monday (with translations into latvian by kārlis vērdiņš and into russian by dmitry kuzmin) at the lgbt center mozaika, and then taking part in a visit of english-language poetry publishers to meet latvian poets, translators, and poetry publishers for the rest of the week. it will be a wonderful time (despite predicted rain this weekend)!¡ya tengo las tarjetas de embarque para los vuelos mañana a riga! va ser mi primera vez en letonia. el viernes doy un taller para editoriales infantiles, el lunes doy un recital de mi poesía (con traducciones al letón y al ruso) en el colectivo lgbt, y después participo en una visita de editoriales anglosajones de poesía para conocer a poetas, traductores, y editores letones. ¡va ser maravilloso (a pesar de la lluvia prevista para éste finde)!

this was a very busy year for me, although a lot of the projects i finished writing or translating have been pushed back to 2016 or 2017. publishing can be like that--sometimes things happen in the blink of an eye and at others there is a lengthy gestation period. the good news is: lots of books and projects in the pipeline... including my return to adult prose (since 2000!), with a new collection of 100 erotic micro-fiction written in spanish, una barba para dos, forthcoming early in 2016 from editorial dos bigotes. what i published in 2015:my own writing:books:the books i published this year were all children's books:wij horen bij elkaar ("we belong together)", illustrated by ann de bode and translated by edward van de vendel, was published in belgium by de eenhoorn. a spanish edition, somos iguales, was published in colombia by panamericana.quer ler um livro comigo?

2014 recap

2014 was a pretty good year for me, although in some ways it was a year of transition, as i try and put into practice some reflections on my own life following the death of my grandmother last december; this will hopefully lead to my moving away from the more-commercial translations, which pay much better than literary ones (alas!) but which i am not essential for (whereas my translation of a poem, say, is unique to me and different from another translator's), and also (ideally) doing more of my own writing.writingbooks:although there is a lot of new stuff in the works (and i even got to see galleys already for some of them!), i published only one new book of my own this year:the picture book ¿como se dice? illustrated by romina pernigotte, from amanuense in guatemala.shorter pieces:a handful of my poems (mostly self-translations from the spanish) were published in the anthology joy exhaustible, edited by bryan borland and seth pennington (also published as issue 10 of assaracus).my poem "deleted names" was reprinted in the anthology obsession: sestinas in the twenty-first century, edited by carolyn beard whitlow and marilyn krysl (dartmouth university press).my villanelle "aubade" was reprinted in mein schwules auge 11 edited by axel schock (verlag claudia gehrke).i wrote and published a new short story, "statistics," which appeared in spanish in the anthology lo que no se dice published by dos bigotes in spain.my short story "pity fuck" was reprinted in the mammoth book of best new erotca 13 edited by maxim jakubowski (along with my translation into english of anna lidia vega serova's story "cancer").i also wrote the prologue for the spanish edition of passion by brane mozetic. (i find writing prologues and blurbs and that sort of writing to be so difficult! it's like having teeth pulled, for me, so i do it so very little...)my own writing in other languages:my children's book the boy and the spy, illustrated by jaime martínez, appeared in a bilingual hungarian-english edition, translated by anna t. szabo, published by csimota.my children's book ¡vamos a ver a papá!, illustrated by alba marina rivera, was published in japan by iwanami shoten, translated by kazumi uno.some of my poems appeared in galician translation by isaac xubin in the anthology eno mar cabe quanti quer cabi, the result of the poetry translation workshop organized by yolanda castaño on san simón island, which i took part in (in october 2013) together with gökçenur ç, samira negrouche, xuan bello, kätlin kaldmaa, anna t szabó, and of course isaac, who translated all of us.and 6 poems of mine, translated into slovenian by brane mozetic, appeared in the journal apokalipsa 177-178.translationthis was a very busy year for me, translation-wise, although the vast majority of what i translated this year is still in production and will be published next year. but here is what was published in 2014:books:art/nonfiction:camouflages by joan fontcuberta (gustavo gili)puig: 100 years of a family business by eugenia de la torriente (assouline)in the spirit of seville by antonio del junco (assouline)graphic novel:euronightmare by aleix salò (penguin random house)poetry collection:dissection by care santos (a midsummer night's press)children's books:into english:meet the artist: matisse by patricia geis (princeton architectural press)into spanish:la ballena negra by fatemeh sarmashghi (amanuense)shorter pieces:i published three translations at words without borders this year:excerpts from two mexican ya novels:for nina by javier malpica in june& the book of denial by ricardo chávez castañeda in decemberand also an essay by orlando luis pardo lazo in september i also translated an essay by gisela kozak for literal magazine.a few poems i translated were published this year (i must try to be better in 2015 about submitting some of the many poems i've translated into english to journals or websites!):"somewhere" by jordi doce for structo 12untitled by anna lidia vega serova in issue 7 of 1110"beauty" by ángel erro in cutbanktraveli visited estonia for the first time to talk about children's books with edward van de vendel and áslaug jónsdóttir, and also went back to germany, italy, and mexico for the frankfurt, bologna, and guadalajara book fairs, respectively, as well as trips to the us (for awp in seattle and the brooklyn book fair) and the uk (for the free verse poetry book fair in london).as i said above: a pretty good year, with lots of exciting things in store for 2015!

wiping away some dust
[19 oct 2014|06:18pm]





it's been forever and then some since last i posted anything. i can't seem to post pictures directly from flickr any longer, which is mostly how i did in the past. will see if this works...last week i turned 43!here's a pic of me blowing out the candles on a gluten-free birthday cake my husband baked for me:just before that i was at the frankfurt bookfair, where i got a "dummy" for my forthcoming picture book, we belong together, illustrated by ann de bode, which will be published by de eenhoorn in belgium in spring 2015. very exciting!let's see if these pictures post properly...meanwhile, it's probably easiest to keep up with me on twitter, which i update much more regularly than this (even though i do still swing through and read lj from time to time): twitter.com/lawrenceschimel

very sad to learn mary stewart has passed away. i never read her arthurians but adored her gothic novels, like airs above the ground, the moonspinners, touch not the cat, and thunder on the right. riphttp://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article4089900.ece?cmp=oth-gnws-standard-2014_05_14

i've fallen out of the habit of tallying what i've done for the year. i've also gotten lax about keeping notes of what i've read this year (in part because i've abandoned so many books partway through--sigh).but here goes a quick summary of 2013:new books:poetry collections for adults:deleted names from a midsummer night's press.kidzbooks written in spanish:la casa de los espejos, illustrated by rocío parra, was published in colombia by panamericana.volando cometas, illustrated by nuria fortuny, was published in spain in spanish and catalan by edicions bellaterra.

rip john hollander, poet and professor: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/books/john-hollander-poet-known-for-his-range-dies-at-83.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&i studied with him in the early 90s when i was an undergraduate at yale and even before that his book rhyme's reason was one of my early primers on poetic forms.here is a clerihew about him by another of my yale professors and his colleague marie borroff, which i think embodies both his love of wordplay and of form: john hollanderwrote a poem shaped like a collander,with holes composed of rowsand rows of capital o's.
