spotlight on inner loop press happy final days of aquarius season to those who celebrate! we thought it would be fitting to showcase the radical and scientific zines we received from inner loop press , operated by tanya brassie in philadelphia, pa. each issue is lovingly risographed with die-cut pages and filled with impressive research, and we can hardly keep these informational zines on our shelves. take a peek at all the titles we have in stock right now.
all zines mentioned below are written and produced by tanya brassie.
space trash

trash in space, it's more common than you think. the latest publication from inner loop press' society's wonders series is all about the debris humans disperse into earth's orbit during space missions. learn how trash accumulates from chipped aircraft paint, defunct satellites, and missiles used to destroy said satellites. due to the increase in commercialization and militarization of space missions, the amount of space waste is quickly multiplying. fortunately, there are initiatives in place for private companies to develop technology to remove debris and abandoned satellites in the atmosphere.
toxic lagoons: midwest edition, southern edition, and northeastern edition 

the environmental disasters described in toxic lagoons shine a light on the myriad of ways corporations and business owners pollute the earth with toxic chemicals and mismanaged waste, resulting in superfund sites that affect wildlife, surrounding communities, and the health and wellbeing of the ecosystems in our american cities. i learned new jersey has the highest volume of superfund sites in the us (224), with north dakota being the environmental winner with zero. my personal favorite in the series is the southern edition, where i learned about the rhinehart tire fire dump in frederick county, virginia.
data centers

going digital seems like a simple solution to the ever growing problem of pollution and waste we've accumulated in our lifetimes. unfortunately, the amount of energy it takes to fire off a single g**gle search is similar to turning on a 60-watt light bulb for 17 seconds. data centers also use an insane amount of water to prevent the servers from overheating. with the popularity of ai, these issues are only increasing while using more of the planet's resources.
thank you tanya brassie and inner loop press for bringing awareness to environmental injustice and how our man-made waste affects our beautiful home planet. i love that there is a quiz in each zine so you can make sure you're paying attention to these important issues. come into the shop to flip through these gorgeous and thoughtful zines!
<3 angel
