“a classical education is a pearl of great price and worthy of the highest efforts of our teachers and students because it aspires to give not only knowledge, but wisdom.”







cheryl lowe – hls founder      















our method








 




classical




in the tradition of western civilization, education and classical education have always been synonymous. classical education can be distinguished from modern education, in that it does not neglect the important first step of giving students the classical tools for both intellectual development and for understanding their classical, christian heritage.













 




christian




our faith statement is the apostles’ creed, the most ancient and widely accepted expression of the essential beliefs of the christian faith. highlands latin teaches and upholds traditional christian morality, and the holy scriptures as the divinely inspired word of god.
 
















 




traditional




in the traditional classroom, a knowledgeable, enthusiastic teacher carefully leads students into an understanding of each subject. the traditional classroom is consistent with human nature and the experience of many decades has demonstrated its superiority over the modern child-centered classroom.





































“amazing traditional private school! great education provided for children. hard to find nowadays.”





d. stewart









“graduated from this place. i’ll always be grateful that hls was my high school alma mater.”





e. petrie









“it exceeds every expectation i had for my child’s education. such a great community to be a part of!”





m. montgomery
