 welcome to mukilteo yacht club  




we are a very active cruising club; we socialize; we cook; we play. 
we like to cruise together so we can look out for each other. we have experienced mariners who know their way around a boat and regularly feature health and safety topics at our general meetings. 
no blue blazers here - and dues are reasonable.
 
to find more about who we are, click on about myc and membership information.
