first,
  don't make the mistake of thinking vista is an all or nothing
  proposition.   it is a very large collection of software, and
  only
  a portion of it may be relevant to your needs.  remember that
  there are many non-medical enterprises that use portions of the vista
  software infrastructure.
one of the easiest ways to begin learning about vista
  and its potential for you, is to explore this web site. be
  sure to check out our catalogue of vista adopters,
  left, where you will find some links to information about various kinds
  of
  enterprises around the world that use vista.    don't
  overlook the little google "search" bar at the left, to help you in
  browsing hardhats.org.   another source
  of
  information about vista (and its software cousin, rpms) is vistapedia.net.
   and our links
  page at the left gives you other paths to investigate. 
when you are ready to start running some software on
  your own machine, go online
  to get every bit of vista that can be released to the public via the
  freedom of information act (foia). 
once you have a handle on what vista is and how you
  might benefit from it, feel free to ask questions on the hardhats mailing list.
  hardhats is a user community that we hope you will find surprisingly
  friendly and helpful.
now start browsing....
