who we are
get to know about kelly ryan
kelly ryan equipment company was founded in 1945. reflecting on those early days, kelly ryan once said, "after the war, you could sell almost anything because farmers were in such need." with material shortages, the first kelly ryan portable farm elevators were constructed from a variety of materials, some of which came from scrap yards. but they filled the need, were priced right and performed well. some can still be seen in service today.
