openai is "trying" to uncensor chatgpt.  (tech crunch)

			oh, this is going to be comedy gold.for example, the company says chatgpt should assert that "black lives matter," but also that "all lives matter."worse than literally hitler.instead of refusing to answer or picking a side on political issues, openai says it wants chatgpt to affirm its "love for humanity" generally, then offer context about each movement.worse than chamberlain.

			astoundingly, they almost admit it:while it's impossible to say whether openai was truly suppressing certain points of view, it's a sheer fact that ai chatbots lean left across the board.the whole article is tech crunch waking up from a coma.

			don't worry, though.  the verge is still batshit insane.





tech news


the lenovo yoga slim 9 14 gen 10 is...  almost great, but probably an interesting failure.  (notebook check)

			it's 14" laptop as one of the numbers in there suggests.  it has a 120hz 3840x2400 oled display, which is phenomenal.  it has an intel 258v lunar lake cpu, which means 32gb of soldered ram, which is adequate.  and it has an m.2 2242 ssd, which is meh.

			in terms of ports, it has two thunderbolt 4 ports, and that's it.

			it doesn't have the four essential keys, but it does have four keys where the four essential keys would go, so a quick trip into microsoft powertoys can remap those for you.

			and it weighs in at a light 1.2kg.

			problem is that it also weighs in at a hefty $1900.



you know what else has a limited port selection but a great screen?  the lenovo (sometimes legion) tab.

			it's the only good small android tablet on the market, which is annoying because it's expensive, lacks either a headphone jack or a microsd slot, and wasn't even sold in australia.

			wasn't.  is now.

			it's about triple the price of an adequate large tablet, but i don't want a large tablet, i want a small one.



karol herbst has stepped down as the maintainer of the open-source nvidia driver for linux due to - apparently - being an insufferable leftist prick.  (phoronix)

			he didn't phrase it that way, of course.  he said:the moment i made up my mind about this was reading the following words written by a maintainer within the kernel community:

			"we are the thin blue line"

			this isn't okay.  this isn't creating an inclusive environment.  this isn't okay with the current political situation especially in the us.  a maintainer speaking those words can't be kept.  no matter how important or critical or relevant they are. they need to be removed until they learn.  learn what those words mean for a lot of marginalized people.  learn about what horrors it evokes in their minds.

			i can't in good faith remain to be part of a project and its community where those words are tolerated.  those words are not technical, they are a political statement.  even if unintentionally, such words carry power, they carry meanings one needs to be aware of.  they do cause an immense amount of harm.well...  bye.



there is no 1875 epoch.  (iter.ca)

			this requires a little unpacking.

			elon musk and the doge team recently noted that social security benefits were being paid out to a number of people who are - according to the system - 150 years old.

			a smug woke asshole on twitter asserted that the epoch - the start of time - for cobol systems was 1875, which could make people with no birth date show up as 150 years old.  now, the claimed epoch start date was in may of 1875 (i don't know why)* which is only 149 years ago, but maybe musk was rounding up, so that's not dispositive.

			the smug wokeness is irrelevant if the claim is true.

			the big problem is that the core of social security system first went live in 1962, when people born prior to 1875 were still around, and 26 years before the 1875 date became standardised in iso 8601.

			oh, and iso 8601 records dates and times as readable text, not as numbers.  it does - or did - standardise on 20 may 1875 as a reference date but that was never an epoch.  it doesn't store dates numerically, so it doesn't even use an epoch.

			also, the ssa released an anonymised sample dataset in 2007, and there was no spike in dates of birth in 1875.

			so no, 150 year olds were just getting paid social security.

			and nobody questioned it.

			* found out why.



firefly aerospace's new lunar orbiter has, uh, arrived in lunar orbit.  (spaceflight now)

			the blue ghost orbiter launched on a falcon 9 last month, and carries multiple experimental payloads, including ten from nasa.

burn all the things edition


top story


the launch prices of amd's 9070 xt and 9070 have been revealed - probably - at $750 and $650 respectively.  (tom's hardware)

			they won't sell at those prices, not against nvidia's $550 5070 and $750 5070 ti.  amd is done in graphics.  the 9070 xt needs to be at least $150 cheaper than the 5070 ti to compete at all, even if it is faster.



the actual retail price of nvidia's $750 5070 ti looks to be $900.  (hot hardware)

			oh.

			nvidia is toast too.




tech news


could amd's announcement that there would be no 32gb model of the 9070 xt have been a modified limited hangout?  (wccftech)

			alleged leaks from alleged graphics card partners are that there is indeed at 32gb model on the way, just that it may have a different model number.



the khadas mind 2s is a very expensive mini-pc.  (notebook check)

			its 16 core intel 255h has good single-threaded performance but is well behind amd's 12 core ryzen 370 on multi-threaded tests.

			that's coupled with soldered ram (bad) but 64gb of it (good), and a single m.2 2230 slot for storage (meh).

			that costs you $1599.

			then you need to buy a dock (a more reasonable $179) and probably a graphics module ($999 for and 8gb 4060 ti, or $1099 for 16gb).

			and an m.2 2230 ssd.

			it's not badly designed, as such.  it would be quite interesting at one third the price.

soap box edition


top story


nvidia has delayed the launch of its rtx 5070 card - a $549 high-end model - until after amd's announcement on the 28th.  (ars technica)

			the article points out something i hadn't noticed before: the 5070 is likely to be markedly slower than the 4070 super, since it cuts the number of shaders from 7168 to 6144.  the 5070 ti is pretty much a wash; it increases the core count slightly but decreases clock speeds a little.

			the 5090 and 5080 meanwhile are overpriced, irrelevant, and not available for purchase anywhere.  the $750 5070 ti will launch next week, and is expected to be more of the same.

			the mainstream market is now amd's race to lose, and they probably will.





tech news


feel-good story of the day: the technical staff of elizabeth warren's unconstitutional plaything the cfpb has been "gutted".  (the verge)  (archive site)

			cue the utterly predictable wailing that all the information collected by the cfpb is no longer in the hands of incompetents and thieves.



nintendo's legal pursuit of palworld, which has been described as "pokemon with guns" and has sold tens of millions of copies on the basis of simply not being lazy garbage, has hit a snag after the us patent office denied 22 of the 23 patent claims that nintendo wanted to use against palworld developer pocketpair.  (hot hardware)

			oops.

			with only one patent in dispute the case is likely to end up with a minor settlement from pocketpair to nintendo and some small changes to the game.  given that pocketpair is a small company and swimming in cash, this isn't going to slow them down.

			recent sales numbers haven't been published but palworld sold 25 million copies in the first month after release last year, netting the company hundreds of millions of dollars off a budget around $7 million.



we were wrong about gpus.  (fly.io)

			minor but interesting point: nobody is looking to deploy their own llms on cloud servers.  they either use their own hardware or apis from one of the big players.

			fly.io is a small cloud provider with a gpu offering.  they're not canceling the product, but they're not planning major upgrades or expansions either.



there are now five makers promising ryzen 370 mini-pcs with upgradeable memory.  (liliputing)

			minisforum, gmk, geekom, acemagic, and aoostar, making beelink the only chinese player in this space without an announcement.

			the articles (this one links to the others) note the similarities between the models, with the author also suspecting that there are rather fewer than five distinct motherboard models.

amd will not be releasing a 32gb model of the upcoming radeon 9070xt.  (tom's hardware)

			but they will be holding a launch event on february 28, with cards expected at retail in the first week of march.



if 32gb of memory on your graphics card isn't enough how about 4tb?  (tom's hardware)

			sandisk has announced high-bandwidth flash.

			similar to high-bandwidth memory (hmb) it uses a stack of flash dies connected to a very wide bus to deliver hundreds of gigabytes per second of bandwidth.

			and then, in sandisk's plan, you put it on a video card so you have terabytes of local memory - since flash is much cheaper and smaller than dram.

			problem is of course that it's also a lot slower, at least for writes.  but if your entire dataset can live semi-permanently on your video card, is that a problem anymore?

the msxbook is an msx laptop.  (hackster)

			msx was a microsoft-led home computer standard from the 1980s, with sound and graphics and rom cartridges and joysticks.

			this laptop uses an fpga to emulate the original hardware - up to 20x faster than the original hardware - and includes compatible ports for the joysticks and cartridges, along with 2mb of ram - very rare at the time, a 1024x768 display, also rare, and 4gb of flash storage, which was totally unheard of.

protobugs edition


top story


oracle chairman larry ellison says governments should unify all their data into a single feed for training ai. (msn)fragmented sets of data about a population’s health, agriculture, infrastructure, procurement and borders should be unified into a single, secure database that can be accessed by ai models.this is not unreasonable for already-public broad-scale data. getting it all into a standard format so that ai - and non-ai computer tools - can analyse it could be valuable. if all of usaid's funding had been out there so that anyone could plug it into a spreadsheet and look for fraud...

			actually, people have been doing that for years and hardly anyone cared.

			anyway. he also wants your dna. (the register)

			so that's a no.



tech news


intel's new core ultra 9 285h - the top of the line of the middle-of-the-line arrow lake h series - is here. is it any good? (hot hardware)

			actually, yes. intel's lunar lake laptop chips are a bit limiting, since memory is soldered directly onto the cpu and there are just four fast cores and four slow ones. now you can have memory soldered onto the motherboard and six fast cores and ten slow ones.

			which is better.

			and it performs very well in tests, including - on this specific laptop - battery life. a big part of that is the msi prestige 16's 99wh battery, but it lasts just shy of 24 hours playing video constantly, and weighs 3.3lbs which is pretty light for a 16" laptop.



emojis and other unicode characters can be hacked to smuggle data invisibly. (tom's hardware)

			i've said before that unicode is a semantic superfund site.

			now i think that ascii was a mistake and we should all go back to sixbit.



why firing programmers and replacing them with ai is a mistake. (defrag zone)

			because ai is shit.

			all the points made are obvious, but they are also correct.



ai is shit. (the register)

			at summarising news headlines, but at many other things too.



a neutrino moving with the energy of a ping pong ball has been detected by a deep sea telescope. (phys.org)

			ping pong balls don't have that much energy by macroscopic standards, but neutrinos are about as far from macroscopic as you can get without ceasing to exist entirely. the single particle was so energetic that it triggered a third of the detectors in the telescope all by itself.




minecraft modpack mischiefall the overlapping recipe issues have been resolved, thanks to the polymorph mod, which resolves overlapping recipe issues.

	i had one crash, which looks to have been memory size related.  i increased the cap from the default 4gb to 6gb and haven't had an issue since.

	remaining bugs:


turkeys lay chicken eggs.  this was fixed last year, but since then the developers of the let's do series of mods have rearranged things and it seems to have become unfixed.


pressing b for my backpack when it's in the curios slot on my back doesn't let me access the inventory.  the backpack works, you just have to access it from your main inventory, or put it down and access it that way.  not sure why; i fiddle with my key mappings but got nowhere.  (this was with a traveler's backpacks backpack; i haven't tried yet with a backpacks from let's do camping.)

update: if you equip the backpack via the backpack's own ui, the b key works - and leaves the curios slot on your back free so you can also carry a quiver for your arrows.  not sure why it doesn't work otherwise, but this way is better so i'm not going to worry about it.  and it all renders properly, so you are running around wearing exactly the customised backpack you created.

my new worst enemy is marsh blocks from another of the let's do mods.  for the player, it holds you in place and does slow damage until you dig yourself free, which is easy enough even empty-handed.

		if you have a mod that generates swamp villages though, they can become ghost towns very quickly because villagers can't dig.


i also need to go through and adjust the spawning probabilities for artifacts and relics.  if you're playing on your own server and can just loot every village you come across, it's too easy to find subtly game-changing items at the default settings.  (how many inexhaustible food supplies do you need?)

top story


average cpu speed actually went down in 2024, for the first time in twenty years.  (twitter)

			there's a lot of speculation as to why, but no clear answers.  the fastest available desktop cpus are two years old, with no replacement models in sight.  meanwhile intel has dropped its hyper-threading support - multiple threads per cpu core - which meant multi-threaded scores declined for newer chips.

			but this average includes amd chips which still have hyper-threading, and apple chips which never had hyper-threading, so who knows?





tech news


a new attack on google's gemini ai lets users permanently plant false memories into the system, so that they are shared with unsuspecting users on the same account.  (ars technica)

			as far as i can tell, this doesn't affect the core gemini training data; that's fixed irrevocably.  so it doesn't persist across google accounts, limiting the damage it can do.

			but llms are fundamentally insecure to this kind of attack, like kindly grandmothers with confidence tricksters, and every patch is just a band-aid atop a growing heap of band-aids.



how elon musk's bid for openai could gum up sam altman's for-profit conversion.  (tech crunch)

			openai is still, in theory, a non-profit operation with a secondary for-profit company commercialising the product.  the bid was made for the non-profit group which owns all the intellectual property.

			the state attorneys general in california and delaware have already filed inquiries with openai over its plans and the valuation of the nonprofit entity, so sam altman and the commercial side of openai cannot underbid in their attempt to wrest control."musk is throwing a spanner into the works," said stephen diamond, a lawyer who represented musk's opponents in corporate governance battles at tesla, in an interview with techcrunch. "he's exploiting the fiduciary obligation of the nonprofit board to not undersell the asset. [musk's bid] is something openai has to pay attention to."which is the last thing altman wants right now.



while tech crunch has a sane article mentioning elon musk, other sites have gone as insane as the verge.  (the register)

			the writer feebly attempts to liken elon musk's team rooting out waste and fraud to a cpu microcode exploit, ignoring the fact that in such an analogy the cpu would be on fire to begin with.



speaking of ai google is considering using it to make chrome change compromised passwords for you automatically.  (ars technica)

			i assume they mean in navigating the password change process for each compromised website; this is not otherwise complicated.



smol gpu is an open-source gpu for risc-v designs.  (github)

			meant more as a learning tool than a real product, but if you are synthesizing a small risc-v core on an fpga - and who isn't, these days - and need a gpu to go with it, it might be worth a look.

tech news


meanwhile microsoft asked the question "is ai making us dumber?" and found that the answer is yes.  no.  what was the question again?  (404 media)so, does this mean ai is making us dumb, is inherently bad, and should be abolished to save humanity's collective intelligence from being atrophied? that's an understandable response to evidence suggesting that ai tools are reducing critical thinking among nurses, teachers, and commodity traders, but the researchers' perspective is not that simple.  as they correctly point out, humanity has a long history of "offloading" cognitive tasks to new technologies as they emerge and that people are always worried these technologies will destroy human intelligence.in other words, yes.




the yao conjecture on the time taken to fill the last empty slot in a nearly full hash table turns out to be false.  (quanta)

				don't you feel much better knowing that?




if you need a single-board computer with more memory and i/o than the raspberry pi, the rock 5t from radxa is one.  (liliputing)

				it's not a lot faster than the raspberry pi - it has the same four a76 cores, but also has four slower a55 cores that the pi lacks.  but it has up to 32gb of ram, dual 2.5gb ethernet ports, and two m.2 slots for storage as standard.

				it does start to get expensive though.

akshully, musk does have a way to deliver a nuclear weapon without people at a stealth bomber, an ssbn, or silo.  one, he could obtain the capability without the assistance of the us federal government.  two, stealth bomber is not the only nuclear capable bomber in us inventory.  

my sense of humor on this is a little bit too dark, and inappropriate.  

musk, trump, vance and perhaps even sideshow bob are saner and more fit to have involvement with us military aviation capabilities than democrats like biden or swalwell.  both of whom made comments that are wildly inappropriate, and concerning.  swalwell the bit about 'nuking oklahoma'.  biden the comments suggesting that air strikes might be an appropriate and effective tactic in a us civil war.  

in theory, air strikes might be a powerful force multiplier in a us civil war, if we had not built the supply chains, infrastructure, and organizations the way we have.  but we have built things that way, so the extra target discrimination that rifles allow might be pretty important.

the full interview transcript is here.

			now, the claim is the information related to bioweapons, and "can't be found on google or can’t be easily found in textbooks", which means that this is public information, not military secrets, and the entire complaint is that deepseek works.

			this is on top of the previously reported logging servers at deepseek that were open to the entire internet.

			so basically not only can deepseek and its chinese partners see everything you do, but so can everyone else.



a massive brute force attack against insecure commercial vpn devices is under way, using insecure consumer routers in an enormous botnet.  (bleeping computer)

			2.8 million devices have been compromised - notably 1.1 million in brazil where mikrotik routers are popular, but extending to many other countries and devices from cisco, zte, huawei, and others.

			all trying to guess the passwords to corporate vpn devices that are also insecure, though not quite as much.  the software is smart enough to block repeated failed logins from a single source, but can't figure things out when it's under attack from 2.8 million directions at once.



vscode's remote development agent is an unsecured remote access tool.  (fly.io)

			this is usually considered a bad thing.



if you need a not too expensive docking station with a ton of ports, this is one.  (notebook check)

			it has two displayport ports, hdmi, and vga, ethernet - though only gigabit, eight usb ports at various speeds, sd and microsd slots, three audio jacks, and a volume knob.

			you can't run all four video ports at 4k, but that's true of pretty much all docks.  usb4 and thunderbolt can only deliver two 4k streams in, so a dock without its own graphics hardware can only deliver two 4k streams out.

			the lack of at least 2.5gb ethernet made me curious how cheap docks with that feature are these days, and you can find them for less than $50 on amazon us.

			on amazon au, somehow, you can get one for $16.  i just ordered two.  it's a basic model with only one video output, but that's ridiculously cheap.

 i would really be surprised if deepseek mentioned that wuhan fever was probably a prc weapons project.  but, basically, we cannot afford for the mother fuckers to be censoring anything about biological warfare, and also there are probably zero details about that which can be a real safety issue.  if you want to make bioweapons you go to graduate school in certain fields, the end.  none of america's tertiary schools has any real sort of controls in place for access to dangerous information by unstable people, so they can go frustrate themselves when it comes to imposing weapons access or information access restrictions on the public.

if you press it, it will start to discuss tiananmen square, and then abruptly crash.

they just have different priorities for what is not permitted.

daily news stuff 8 february 2025


nimitable edition


top story


how one of the doge team, who are all too young to know what they are doing in taking a wrecking ball to decades of government waste, incompetence, and fraud, solved the puzzle of how to read the vitrified scrolls of vesuvius.  (tech crunch)farritor had studied latin and was fascinated by ancient civilizations. "i always read about archaeology growing up, and it’s like, wow, now i get to actually be involved in a project with richard janko," he recalled, referring to the classics scholar who was a judge for the vesuvius challenge.luke farritor and his friends won a $700,000 prize by using advanced scanners and 3d reconstruction to read scrolls from herculaneum that were burned almost beyond recognition but otherwise physically intact.

			watching the media tie itself into knots trying to tar these young geniuses as fascists is at least briefly amusing.





tech news


the uk government has secretly ordered apple to hand over encryption keys that would allow it to read any information from any apple user anywhere in the world.  (macrumors)  (archive site)

				and speaking of fascists...

				apple may simply stop providing icloud in the uk in response.



nothing in this article is true.  (the verge)  (archive site)

				the twenty minute hate, screaming at the sky about the unwinding of decades of government waste, incompetence, and fraud.



whatever happened to the xeon e?  (serve the home)

				the xeon e was intel's low-end server cpu range, based on desktop chips but with support for ecc memory.

				intel still sells them, but they've been utterly demolished by amd.  the fastest xeon e, the eight-core e-2488, is slower than amd's six-core 9600x.  and uses more power.  and is a lot more expensive.



intel is however reportedly preparing 52 core desktop processor.  (tom's hardware)

				that's 16 performance cores, 32 efficiency cores, and 4 low-power cores.

				which is a lot.



minisforum makes motherboards.  (amazon)

				you wouldn't know it from their website, but they make both mini-itx and micro-atx boards with laptop chips embedded on them.  and not any old laptop chip either, but the 16 core 7945hx, which is as fast as a 12 core desktop 9900x )on multi-threaded tasks) while using half the power.

				which is interesting because at least in australia, the board including that cpu is cheaper than the 9900x alone.
