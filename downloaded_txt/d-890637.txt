  "great atmosphere and friendly wait staff. a good place weather with the family (kids) or out for a night on the town. in the summer we love to sit outside and watch the boats on the river. in the winter it's a good place to stop while snowmobiling on the river. the burgers are high quality."

  "great restaurant with spectacular view of the water! you can cruise here by car, bike or boat. casual dining and small menu. there is your choice of sitting inside or outside. i think it might be called the snuggery because of the server's outfits. the service was pleasant and prompt. i'd definitely go back!"

  "we eat here about once every 3 month when visiting mchenry. always a pleasure! lots of beer on tap, great outdoor seating, and some good grub! and the view of the river is great!"

  "delighted to see that a food chain had enough decency to not ruin a great thing like the snuggery and only polish up a few things here and there and only add a few more options instead of taking the heartbeat out of a great place."

  "friendly staff, great food, and some pretty sweet deals. spent a decent amount of time up at the bar, but the best place to be where you're here is the riverside patio."
