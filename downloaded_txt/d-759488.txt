five of the most popular succulent varieties in the u.s.




everywhere you look these days, it seems that adorable little succulents are taking over. they can be seen on tv, in your favorite grocery store, and in nurseries around the country. trendy as can be and cute as a button, everyone wants to get their hands on these low-maintenance beauties.
they are incredibly well-suited to life indoors as decorative plants, centerpieces, even as bridal bouquets, but can also be hardy enough to accent any outdoor garden. these succulents come in so many varieties. it can be hard to know which type is right for you.
which ones should you choose? below are five of the most popular succulents in america today.
1. echeveria
echeveria comes in many different colors, sizes, shapes, and textures, making them perfectly versatile to suit your needs. they can thrive in containers on a window sill or add interest to a rock garden. many varieties boast vibrant shades of pink or red, while others keep a low profile with their gray-blues or greens.
they are among the easiest succulents to grow, are highly decorative, and attract hummingbirds.
a few of the most well-loved types include:

echeveria elegens
echeveria peacockii
echeveria prolifica

2. zebra plant
haworthia attenuata, commonly called zebra plant, is a low-growing, striped, spiky succulent. according to www.succulents.net, its thick- and surprisingly soft- green foliage only reaches about six inches in height, making it suitable for indoors.
these plants don’t care for much water, and they love the bright sun, so a south-facing window is an ideal home for them.

3. moonstones
this quirky plant gets its name from the smooth, oval, fleshy leaves it produces. they range in color from a pale, almost dusty blue-green to a bluish purple. some describe them as otherworldly, given that they almost seem illuminated.
this succulent produces flowers in the winter, with red centers surrounded by petals the same color as the foliage.

4. string of buttons
if you’re looking for a sprawling, speedy grower, string of buttons is a good choice. the dusty green leaves have a red or pink tinge to their edges, which creates a striking display as they grow into stacked rosettes.
native to south africa, this hardy plant likes full sun and well-drained soil. it’s perfect for hanging baskets, rock gardens, or as a ground cover. bonus- it’s deer resistant!

5. baby toes
the smooth, tubular-shape of this succulent’s leaves, paired with its large white flowers, make it reminiscent of a sea anemone. the bold, unique foliage of this plant make it a show-stopper for any room in your house- which is convenient because these plants are picky about temperature and prefer to stay above 65 degrees.
caring for baby toes plants
with so much color and personality contained in such tiny packages, it’s no wonder these succulents are the hottest choice for plants. just keep in mind that ‘low maintenance’ doesn’t mean ‘no maintenance,’ and you’ll be enjoying these lovelies for years to come.
