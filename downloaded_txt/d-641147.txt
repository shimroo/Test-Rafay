medical qigong - qigong energy healing

medical qigong comes from the ancient wisdom, culture, and practices of daoism, confucianism, and buddhism. the 3 treasures  are the basic virtues in daoism of compassion, moderation and humility.

hello, welcome to my site  with information on the barbara brennan school of healing and medical qigong and qigong energy healing. my name is lisa vanostrand.   i have been highly involved many years in the barbara brennan school of healing as well as the world of chinese medicine and medical qigong.
let me tell you about both:
barbara brennan school of healing
barbara brennan was one of my most influential teachers.  her work and vision continue to inspire me. the barbara brennan school of healing is one of the world's premier institute for hands-on healing and personal transformation.
the barbara brennan school of healing is dedicated to the evolution of the human spirit. it is a highly respected educational and global healing institution, with thousands of graduates in over 50 countries throughout the world.

medical qigong
i was a senior instructor at the international institute of medical qigong, founded by jerry alan johnson.  while it was operating as a school that authorized branches, i held the title of dean of psychology. i teach qigong and qigong energy healing in various places in the united states, mainly florida and new york. i have studied extensively with jerry alan johnson. in fact, i was one of the early students of jerry alan johnson and was the first person in florida to receive my doctorate. as an iimq teacher, i have the longest history of teaching medical qigong in both florida and new york. i have long been an avid pursuer of spirituality, starting my path with meditation and yoga.
the nei jing advises us, that all diseases are rooted in spirit. i invite anyone who is suffering from chronic disease to look at what lesson they may need to learn. it may be simply that we need to slow down, do what we really love, change our life styles or even to surrender what is. throughout my years as a healing practitioner, i have been blessed with studying with many great teachers and great traditions. each one has added something special to who i am.

i am a licensed acupuncture physician working with both acupuncture and chinese herbs and of course, medical qigong.
  i am with the barbara brennan school of healing for over 17 years.  currently i am in the a&p director.  i  am the editor of barbara brennan's new book core light healing i have also held the title of >dean of advanced studies, where i trained future teachers of the school.
i have also finished a program at the university of miami miller school of medicine on clinical nutrition.
currently, i love the meditation style taught by samuel sagan and the clairvision school.
i have been a faculty member at the academy of five elements in gainesville, florida teaching some of the medical qigong classes.
i have also studied and completed the donna eden certification program. i enjoyed the way donna eden was able to blend different energy systems using chinese medicine as a backdrop but with a more contemporary approach.
jeffrey yuen, an 88th generation daoist priest, who i have also studied extensively with, reminds us that chinese medicine is and must be in order to meet the changing times, evolutionary. i believe the inherent wisdom of chinese medicine as a preventive and holistic medicine will be necessary for us as we move into the future.

thank you for looking at my website.
on a recent oprah show, dr. mehmet oz, a noted ny surgeon and health care advocate, sited energy medicine as the medicine of the future. quoting from dr. oz, "the reason i'm so excited and passionate about alternative medicine is (because it is) the globalization of medicine," alternative medicines, dr. oz noted, deal with the body's energy, something that traditional western medicine generally does not recognize. "we're beginning now to understand things that we know in our hearts are true but we could never measure. as we get better at understanding how little we know about the body, we begin to realize that the next big frontier in medicine is energy medicine. it's not the mechanistic part of the joints moving. it's not the chemistry of our body. it is understanding for the first time how energy influences how we feel".

qigong

qigong is a combination of two ideas: qi" (pronounced chee), means air, breath of life, or vital energy that flows through all things in the universe and gong" (pronounced gung, as in lung) means the skill of working with, or cultivating, self-discipline and achievement. together, qigong means the skill of cultivating vital energy, or the ability to work with the electromagnetic energy of the body. the body is enveloped by qi or electromagnetic currents, affecting both internal and external organ functions. as qi is the fundamental energy that sustains life, it is present in every cell of the body.

medical qigong

medical qigong, is one of the four main branches of chinese medicine along with acupuncture, herbal medicine, and medical massage. medical qigong is the study of the energetic map of the body based on classical and alchemical chinese medicine as well as more traditional chinese medicine. medical qigong techniques can be practiced on oneself for self-cultivation or on others as healing protocols. prescription exercises, meditations and healing protocols, enhance body, mind and spirit and can also address the energetics of specific disease patterns.
medical qigong, healing occurs through balancing qi or electromagnetic energy which surrounds and pervades all living creatures. chinese medicine is a complete system of medicine that recognizes the root causes of symptoms or disease, and treats the client as a whole system. in the future, diseases will be seen and worked with before they reach the physical body. this is true preventive medicine and a return to the ancient chinese way where the doctor was paid only when the client was well.
generally and simply speaking, some 80% of disease is caused by stagnation or blockage while the remaining 20% can be said to be caused by deficiency. the bottom line is that the client must remove the stagnation and take steps in order to ensure the stagnation does not return. stagnation can occur in the physical body or any of the subtle bodies. blockages occur in the physical or subtle bodies where there are inherent weaknesses. it takes time to remove blockages depending on how deep the pattern is. this is particularly true if any form of disease has infiltrated the physical body and more so if the condition has existed for any length of time. the same line of reasoning would apply to deficiency, although in this case, any areas of deficiency must be strengthened. often a deficiency and blockage occur at the same time. the goal of all healing is not to just treat symptoms but rather to determine each client's particular imbalances with a goal on finding the root causes.
following is a simplified list of the important things a medical qigong practitioner can do to help their client facilitate the healing process. the list consists of the client's own self-practices and support from medical qigong and/or outside practitioners. self-practice is an important part of a client taking responsibility for their own healing process and it also speeds up the work performed by outside sources. assistance from outside sources is equally important, having an experienced ally in the healing journey makes the road smoother and faster!

clients self-practice








meditation and spiritual practices
 in whatever spiritual path the client feels most inspired by. this assists the client in connecting to something larger than themselves and understanding their condition from a greater perspective of wholeness. it also opens one to the possibility of tremendous healing forces that are available from the spiritual realms.


dietary changes
 are important to assist in the removal of stagnation and to give support to any deficiencies.



medical qigong exercises
 are simple movements and/or meditations that the client performs daily that will benefit their particular condition. medical qigong exercises combine the use of breath with individual physical movements, creative visualization and intention. the primary goal is to purge toxic emotions from within the body's tissues, eliminate energetic stagnation, as well as strengthen and balance the internal organs and energetic fields. medical qigong exercises empower the client to realize that they are an integral part of their own healing process.





working with outside sources








medical qigong healing
 works to balance the physical and subtle bodies and create new imprints. healing can initiate changes at all the different levels: physical, energetic, emotional/mental and spiritual. the experienced healer understands the relationship between the physical body and the subtle bodies as well as the interrelationship between elements, organs, meridians, chakras and disease patterns.



personal process therapy to work with psychological issues
 is necessary to clear the emotional/mental bodies. physical illness can be the result of long-standing emotional suppression. it is equally important to challenge limited or false belief systems and to have support for necessary life-style changes. current body, mind and spirit paradigms recognize the inherent connection between these realms of experience. body, mind and spirit can be separated only in theory, for in experience they are different dimensions of the same human consciousness. medical qigong exercises such as dry crying and beating the bag are just two of the many ways medical qigong practitioners work to resolve emotional issues.




miracles can and do happen. however, for the most part healing and transformation are hard work. when disease is present, major changes are usually required at all levels: physical, energetic, emotional/mental and spiritual. each of these levels, other than the physical, can be considered as a subtle body or field that surrounds and inner penetrates the physical body. these subtle bodies and their effects have been duly noted by chinese medicine for thousands of years. chinese medicine considers man to be a bridge between heaven and earth. as such, for each one of us to reach our full potential requires us to be at ease and free-flowing at all of these levels. medical qigong is an excellent energetic healing modality regardless of whether you are a client or a practitioner.

				  3 treasures school of medical qigong is now a private, post  secondary degree-granting institution recognized by the florida department of  education and florida commission on independent education under the authority  of florida state statutes, section 1005.06. unfortunately, because of the new  york state laws, the doctoral program will only be  offered in florida. the first class will be on detoxification. the healing of all  chronic diseases must begin with detoxification. this class will include all  new material including: medical qigong exercises, healing protocols, as well as  dietary/nutritional suggestions to support this process.
