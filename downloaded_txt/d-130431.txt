chase hill outfitters is a full service outfitting business in one of the most famed mule deer, whitetail deer, big horn sheep and antelope hunting areas in the world, area 680, the montana missouri river breaks.
we offer fully guided hunts on about 100,000 acres of private ranch land and have permits on over a million acres of federal land.
at chase hill outfitters we begin our season with varmint safaris.  we not only hunt prairie dogs and richardson ground squirrels, but also coyotes, raccoons and badgers.  these hunts book up quickly with many of our repeat clients and friends.
as fall rolls around, we move into bird hunting.  you will have opportunities for sharptail grouse, sage grouse, hungarian partridge or ring neck pheasant with plenty to choose from.
the fall is highlighted with our main hunts: mule deer, whitetail, big horn sheep and antelope.

hunting at it’s finest!
