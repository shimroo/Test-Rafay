cumberland’s programsat cumberland youth and family services, we work hard to provide care and support that improves the quality of life for youth in foster care, young adults aging out of care and resilient single-parent families. each program is designed to address residents’ specific needs based on the circumstances that brought them to us, the level of care and support that serves them best, their goals and progress. one of the great things about cumberland is that residents may transition between programs without moving. that ability to shift placement options based on needs or progress is an important stabilizing force not often found in programs like ours. cumberland’s shelter services and treatment services programs are often referred to as our children’s residential program. cumberland is licensed to serve children and youth ages 5-18, but focus primarily on meeting the needs of middle and high school age students. all residents are placed with us by the texas department of family protective services or ocok. our supervised independent living program offers an extended foster care option to help young adults, ages 18-22. the program is designed to ease the transition into adulthood for those aging out of care. our family residential program supports resilient working families who need support to move toward greater self-sufficiency.

our impactcumberland serves texas’ children, youth, young adults and families. as a key player in child welfare and family stability, we bring resources, skills and compassion together to empower residents to find healthy ways to cope with their past experiences and thrive.  our program and services are trauma-informed and relationship-focused because our highest priority is our residents. cumberland aims to meet the vast and complex needs of those impacted by the child welfare system or experiencing hardships that impact family stability. through residential care, counseling and other supportive services, we aim to help those we serve learn how to identify and build healthy relationships and empower them with coping strategies that help them move beyond their experiences as survivors of abuse, neglect, family violence or other trauma. the work we do is important and much needed in our community.

a single mother’s storya single mother of four joined our family residential program to get support for herself and her children. through our program, she received the support she needed to earn her high school diploma with honors this spring. she worked hard to complete the program with four children, all while working full-time in the middle of a pandemic. since graduation, she has started classes in a medical instrument sterilization program, which will guarantee that she never has to work a minimum wage job again. we are so proud of how far she has come.
