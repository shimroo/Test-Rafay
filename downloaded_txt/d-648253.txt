a dedication to all those who have been involved in making the
journey possible, those who have shared and who still are. particularly
friend fred (barney) van asbeck (1957-1995) and brother paul bunting (1955-2005)
who are journeying elsewhere and who along with mother nature, and the people we
met along the way, had a big impact on our emotional growth.
