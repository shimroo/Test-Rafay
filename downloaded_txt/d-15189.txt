testimonials





"a group of five friends met at the martha for a saturday night during the january jam at the barter theater. we had a wonderful stay. we spent the afternoon outdoors in the hot tub and in the indoor pool. we enjoyed dinner at sister's american grill. the sunday breakfast was a favorite. all the staff were friendly, courteous, helpful. the room was sumptuous and very comfortable. i am looking forward to a return trip."

"from reservations to check-in to departure, this was a fabulous stay. my wife and i loved the history of this classic boutique inn. the staff was outstanding and very service oriented in every aspect of our stay. the room was spotless, we loved the history throughout the hotel. the library was one of our favorite rooms, warm, and had so much knowledge of who stayed during the last 100+years. each staff member was gracious, kind, and caring."

"i am so happy that historic properties like this exist! staying at the martha it was like going back in time and yet we enjoyed modern amenities. we absolutely loved the swimming pool and the mini golf. we unfortunately didn't have time for tennis or pickle ball but will definitely do that next time. we biked the length of the creeper trail and having a night to rest at the martha was magical! the staff are all so welcoming and kind. the beds were absolutely delightful to sink into after a long day of biking. we also celebrated our anniversary and enjoyed drinking coffee on the front porch together. it was a lovely experience!"
