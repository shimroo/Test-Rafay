a special message from al and anne hartley, owners of four seasons electric boats: as of october 1, 2008 we elected to suspend our duffy dealership and close our lake gaston operation. however we remain enthusiastic about electric boating and duffy boats and plan to continue to maintain our website to promote electric boating in general with the spotlight on selected manufacturers.
