how do hovercraft compare to airboats?

unlike airboats, hovercraft are flying machines that travel above the surface on a bubble of air so they donât create a wake on water. airboats are flat-bottomed boats with a large propeller and their entire weight rests on the surface, creating a wake.  airboats usually require a boat dock for launching; hovercraft do not.
airboats are limited to relatively smooth water because their hulls have low gunwales which can be easily swamped. airboats have minimum positive flotation, where hovercraft have quite a lot - up to 1 1/2 times their weight. this enables hovercraft to operate safely on swiftwater.




 the airboatâs tall propeller also limits its use in areas with overhead obstructions, which are often found in flood rescue operations. an airboatâs propeller usually runs close to the speed of sound and generates far more noise than a hovercraft. airboats can consume up to three times more energy than hovercraft, so they use more fuel.
hovercraft are safer than airboats in ice rescue operations. as stated in a news article about a dive team preparing for ice rescues, âemergency personnel practiced rescuing victims who have fallen through ice by getting as close as they can with airboats - too close and the boat will push the ice and crush the victim - and then, with insulated, waterproof suits on and an attached rope, swimming out and bringing the victim back."

hovercraft can fly on top of thin or broken ice while airboats cannot, and hovercraft often break the ice into small pieces that are of no danger to the victim. hovercraft can also approach the victim directly, keeping rescuers out of the water. and the airboat's high center of gravity makes them prone to flipping over.
