does a pro-life stand matter?



buster brown and the babydoes a pro-life stand matter, or will more modern approaches reduce the number of abortions more?  apart from the moral issues raised by the government's condoning of child murder, consider this quote from an interesting article by michael j. new:as election day approaches, the mainstream media is, as usual, showcasing self-identified ''pro-lifers'' who are supporting the democratic party's pro-abortion presidential nominee. in 2004, a number of media outlets cited an analysis by ethicist glen harold stassen which claimed--wrongly--that the number of abortions had increased slightly since president bush's inauguration in 2001. the new york times published an op-ed by dean mark roche of notre dame encouraging pro-life catholics to vote for john kerry. this year the story is similar. former reagan administration assistant attorney general doug kmiec and duquesne university law professor nicholas cafardi, both of whom claim to be opponents of abortion, have received plenty of  media attention for their support of barack obama.their arguments are the same ones put forward in 2004. they have not improved with age. most of these authors attempt to make one of two points: either a) that there is little that elected officials can do to curb abortion through legislation, or b) that the pro-life movement has not reaped any real benefits from supporting candidates who oppose abortion. voters should, therefore, they argue, place greater emphasis on other issues. however, an examination of the history of the pro-life movement and a careful analysis of abortion trends demonstrate that these arguments are deeply flawed. in fact, the success of pro-life political candidates has resulted in substantial reductions in the abortion rate.for instance, the 1990s decline in the abortion rate--a decline that is eagerly touted by these obama and kerry supporters--had virtually nothing to do with policies enacted by president clinton, and much to do with the dramatic increase in the number of states that were enacting pro-life laws. the information below comes from naral's who decides, an annual publication which provides information about abortion legislation:- in 1992, virtually no states were enforcing informed-consent laws; by 2000, 27 states had informed-consent laws in effect.- in 1992, no states had banned or restricted partial-birth abortion; by 2000, twelve states had bans or restrictions in effect.- in 1992, only 20 states were enforcing parental-involvement statutes; by 2000, 32 states were enforcing these laws.furthermore, there is plenty of evidence which suggests that these and other types of pro-life legislation have been effective at reducing the incidence of abortion. read the whole thing here.

choose life - and vote life!



we're not catholic but i thought this video from catholicvote.com was outstanding.  please see also the quotes on abortion below attributed to mother teresa."america needs no words from me to see how your decision in roe v. wade has deformed a great nation. the so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men. it has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships. it has aggravated the derogation of the father's role in an increasingly fatherless society. it has portrayed the greatest of gifts -- a child -- as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience. it has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters.and, in granting this unconscionable power, it has exposed many women to unjust and selfish demands from their husbands or other sexual partners. human rights are not a privilege conferred by government. they are every human being's entitlement by virtue of his humanity. the right to life does not depend, and must not be declared to be contingent, on the pleasure of anyone else, not even a parent or a sovereign."(mother theresa -- "notable and quotable," wall street journal, 2/25/94, p. a14)"but i feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child - a direct killing of the innocent child - murder by the mother herself. and if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another? how do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? as always, we must persuade her with love, and we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts. jesus gave even his life to love us. so the mother who is thinking of abortion, should be helped to love - that is, to give until it hurts her plans, or her free time, to respect the life of her child. the father of that child, whoever he is, must also give until it hurts. by abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems. and by abortion, the father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. that father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. so abortion just leads to more abortion. any country that accepts abortion is not teaching the people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. that is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.""please don't kill the child. i want the child. please give me the child. i am willing to accept any child who would be aborted, and to give that child to a married couple who will love the child, and be loved by the child. from our children's home in calcutta alone, we have saved over 3,000 children from abortions. these children have brought such love and joy to their adopting parents, and have grown up so full of love and joy!""what is taking place in america is a war against the child. and if we accept that the mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another.""any country that accepts abortion, is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what it wants.""it is a poverty to decide that a child must die so that you may live as you wish."

dr. dobson weighs in on connecticut gay marriage



connecticut has captured what little market there is in the news for anything other than the global economic meltdown.  dr. james dobson is chiming in:“today’s ruling by the connecticut supreme court to impose same-sex 'marriage' adds another tragic example of runaway judges trampling on citizens’ right to decide public policy for themselves. in doing so, the court has placed the desires of adults over the needs of children, who, social science research proves, do best when they are raised by their married mom and dad living in the same home.   “we decry this decision by justices unelected and unaccountable to the people, and will do whatever is necessary to oppose it. not only have these judges knowingly deprived connecticut children of a mother or a father, but they have usurped the role of the legislators to create law. short of a federal marriage-protection amendment, marriage can only be truly protected by defining it in state constitutions. i pray the citizens of california, arizona and florida will seize the opportunity next month to settle this marriage crisis in their states once and for all.”

gay marriage comes to connecticut



it has happened.  the supreme court of connecticut has issued its long-awaited decision in the kerrigan case, and has effectively legalized homosexual marriage by judicial decree.i haven't read the decision yet, but you can download a copy here (large pdf file).as a recovering lawyer i will give you my analysis at some point fwiw.there are several dissenting opinions:justices borden and vertefeuille (who always did right by me when i appeared in front of her)justice vertefeuille separatelyjustice zarella.kudos to justice zarella, who bravely stated:the ancient definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman has its basis in biology, not bigotry. if the state no longer has an interest in the regulation of procreation, then that is a decision for the legislature or the people of the state and not this court. therefore, i conclude that the equal protection provisions of the state constitution are not triggered. i further conclude that there is no fundamental right to same sex marriage. accordingly, i dissent.

was jesus a palestinian?



umm, no.  but some textbooks seem to think so: this is one of hundreds of distortions, misrepresentations and outright lies found about judaism and jewish history by a comprehensive study of the 28 most widely used social studies textbooks in the united states. in a landmark book called “the trouble with textbooks,”  dr. gary a. tobin and dennis r. ybarra show how millions of american schoolchildren are taught anti-semitic versions of jewish history and faith, particularly in relation to christianity and islam, in passages that often amount to sheer libel.there is an incredible lack of critical thinking already.  this kind of thing certainly won't help.

columnists starting to sound like preachers...



and, who can blame them?ultimately, however, we must address the deeper roots of this financial crisis. there is a moral crisis that infects every aspect of our society. since the 1960s, american popular culture has waged a relentless war against ethical absolutes and judeo-christian morality. this has been replaced with a shallow secular humanism, which champions materialism, consumerism and individual gratification. in short, our culture has done everything to destroy what used to be called "character." what happened to individual restraint, thrift and personal responsibility? these are the virtues that built the most impressive capitalist economy the world has ever created.we are now facing more than just a financial mess; almost every other major institution is under threat. the political system is adrift; public schools are failing; the borders are porous; the intelligence agencies are dysfunctional; the inner cities are infested with drugs and gangs; the family is broken; and millions are fleeing their churches. and they say i'm dour sometimes!  more here from jeffery kuhner at the washington times.

what happens when same-sex marriage is permitted?



think it can't affect you or affect many different spheres in society?  think again!  watch this video which is being used to rally people to the pro-family cause in california.  you will be alarmed at what happened in massachusetts when same-sex "marriage" was legalized there.  as we await the connecticut's supreme court decision in the kerrigan case, please keep praying earnestly for our state.be sure to use the video menu to email it to others who care about our state and our children.
