we are delighted you have come to share in our worship of god. we trust you will experience the presence of christ and the love of his people in this place. visitors please let us know who you are and where you are from by filling in a “welcome visitor” card available in the pews and by signing the guest register in the narthex.
encouragement cards (pink cards) are located in the pew and are to be used to lift a members’ spirits or to thank someone in the congregation for a kind act of service. please place these in the offering plate. prayer requests may be submitted by using the prayer cards (yellow) located in the pew and placing in the offering plate.
a nursery for small children, three years of age and younger, is available in the education building adjacent to the sanctuary. activity bags are available for children in the narthex.
holy trinity celebrates the sacrament of holy communion on the first and third sundays of the month and on all major festivals of the church.
our lutheran liturgy:
 the liturgy used in our worship is founded on the holy scriptures. liturgy means “work of the people.” our tradition recognizes that the presiding minister is not the only leader in worship. the emphasis is on shared leadership. a liturgical worship is not something that the pastor does while the people watch but is an action shared by all who assemble for worship.
