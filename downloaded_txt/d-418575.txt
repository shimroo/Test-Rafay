reviewsbest hotel on the beach. rating: 5 out of 5 stars"this is the best hotel on the beach in the north beach area of miami beach. it is always clean and the staff are exceptional. you are always treated like you are special. the restaurants in the area are great. the people who work there go out their way to make sure your stay is the best."reviewed by  passenger47590874659  on  october 2019

público, restaurantes, bares. el personal es super amable y tiene todas las comodidades para hospedarse: cocina totalmente equipada, lavadero, piscina, gimnasio."reviewed by  irefeu  on  january 2020  via  tripadvisorgreat value for money rating: 5 out of 5 stars"since i stayed here for the first time after i had found the hotel at booking.com it became my first choice if i need to stay in miami beach. these apartment-style rooms have absolutely everything i need, a fully equipped kitchenette helps if you prefer not to eat out. the suits are spacious, it's actually like a 1-bedroom apartment, so if you come with a family or friends it's both a comfortable and an economic option. but i felt great there on my own as well. there is a gym in the hotel and a swimming pool if the ocean is too stormy or too cold (if this is possible in miami).  the beach is just a few steps away from the hotel. it's a public beach, so if you need an umbrella or a chaise-long you can either rent or bring your own, but the hotel staff will eagerly give you the towels.  the hotel is pretty far away from downtown, there is a city bus that goes all the way down and it's free (there are regular busses as well), but it's a long trip. so, this hotel is more for staying at the spot or driving on your own car. there are lots of tours that the hotel can help to arrange, but i haven't taken any myself. the last but not the least: the hotel staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. guillermo is my favorite, but they are all invariably nice and attentive. i stayed in a couple of other hotels that were more expensive and had own beach, "but decided that there's no better than this one. and a really good value for the money you pay.reviewed by  viikaa  on  january 2020  via  tripadvisorfantã¡stico lugar frente a la playa rating: 5 out of 5 stars"fuimos varias veces al complejo, los departamentos son impecables. tiene tv en la habitación y en el estar. también tiene lava vajillas ahí que no hay que lavar los platos. el hotel tiene una pileta muy linda con reposeras y mesas donde se puede tomar algo fresco no mate. abrís una puerta desde el área de la pileta y estás en la playa."reviewed by

restaurantes, pizzaria, farmácias, mercado, padaria do lado, o hotel oferece um ótimo atendimento, quartos limpos com cozinha, wi-fi gratuito, piscina, hotel de frente para o mar, enfim um ótimo lugar para quem vai à miami sozinho ou com a família, gosto muito e sempre que vou à miami fico no crystal beach, com certeza uma ótima opção!"reviewed by  saionara b  on  january 2018  via  tripadvisornos sentimos como en casa rating: 5 out of 5 stars"el hotel tiene todas las comodidades necesarias para una perfecta estadía en miami. habitaciones limpias, cómodas, cocina bien equipada con microondas, anafe, vajilla y lavavajillas, cafetera y tostadora. sala y cuartos separados, baño muy completo. la atencion es inmejorable. el personal es bilingüe, muy amable y en especial el sr. guillermo arroyo, encargado del front desk, que fue muy atento tanto durante la reserva online como personalmente una vez que llegamos al hotel. la zona es tranquila pero con muchos restaurantes y opciones para comprar lo que sea necesario. les gradecemos haber hecho comfortable nuestra estancia. sin dudas volveremos."reviewed by  nelly  on  december 2019  via  tripadvisorawesome place to stay. rating: 5 out of 5 stars"we have been going to this hotel for years and have never been disappointed. the rooms are very clean and comfortable. the staff is excellent and accommodating. guillermo has always made sure we felt special and were satisfied with the hotel. we have been traveling to miami for 35 years. since we found this place we have not stayed anywhere else. it is like home away from home. we love it and highly recommend it. it is right on the beach, close to restaurants shopping and entertainment."reviewed by  passenger47590874659  on  january 2019  via  tripadvisorottima scelta rating: 5 out of 5 stars“abbiamo scelto due suites...eravamo 4 coppie. la suites era composta da cucina e sala con divano letto,camera da letto e bagno con doppia entrata. cucina con fornelli frigo e bollitore...a noi è piaciuto sia hotel che camera. poi la doppia entrata del bagno l abbiamo trovata un ottima idea. la zona tranquilla fronte mare. diversi bar e locali. assolutamente consigliato. l unica nota stonata e che il divano letto abbiamo dovuto prepararlo noi...dopo aver chiamato la reception ci hanno detto dove trovare le lenzuola. che in un hotel dovessimo fare noi il letto l abbiamo trovato alquanto bizzarro. per il resto ottimo hotel.”reviewed by  danyc83  on  march 2019  via  tripadvisorgood value rating: 5 out of 5 stars"we stayed in this north beach “all suites” hotel a couple of months ago. this is not the ritz but it is not bad for the price. the rooms are good-sized and contained a couch and kitchenette with a fridge, microwave and utensils which is great for a family vacation. it is next to the beach and guests get a 50 percent discount when you rent chairs/umbrellas on the beach. though there is no restaurant in the hotel, there are scores of eateries right around the corner on collins avenue. the lobby was inviting and the staff, service was wonderful and the prices were moderate. recommended!"reviewed by  george s  on  august 2019  via  tripadvisorhyper bien situã©, chaleureux et tranquille rating: 5 out of 5 stars"je suis une habituée du crystal beach depuis 15 ans maintenant et pour avoir essayé d'autres hôtels équivalents à miami, je peux dire qu'il m'est impossible d'aller ailleurs qu'au crystal beach. on y est formidablement bien : chambres agréables et nettoyées chaque jour, personnel au top et très à l'écoute. si un problème se pose, le personnel fait tout pour y remédier immédiatement. certes, ce n'est pas un hôtel de luxe mais c'est aussi pour cela que je l'apprécie. on s'y sent tellement bien, on a toujours un sourire et les chambres sont propres ainsi que les sanitaires et cela est très important. j'y suis allée en famille, entre amis, en groupe, en couple et à chaque fois j'y reviens. le directeur est adorable tout comme le personnel. de plus l'hôtel offre une salle de sport, une piscine avec accès direct à la plage et il est parfaitement situé avec tout ce qu'il faut aux alentours. c'est mon hôtel préféré à miami et je pense qu'il le restera tant que les choses resteront ainsi."reviewed by  estelle i  on  december 2018  via  tripadvisoramaaaazingâ¼ï¸â¼ï¸ rating: 5 out of 5 stars"this was my third visit to miami

shavon96  on  august 2019  via  tripadvisoreight nights in perfect hotel on the beach rating: 5 out of 5 stars"i stay in this hotel with my wife for more than 15 years. it has perfect accommodation, like at home, with a kitchen, dishes, refrigerator, electric stove, etc. very clean, good service, good and friendly people. the front desk supervisor guillermo arroyo is a perfect personality, polite and always helpful. really nice place to stay."reviewed by  sam  on  june 2019  via  tripadvisoraffordable, clean hotel with excellent beach rating: 5 out of 5 stars"our stay at crystal beach suites was wonderful. first of all, the hotel is very affordable. it may not have all the bells and whistles of more expensive hotels (some fixtures are dated), but it was clean, had great service, and offered a great beach experience. the staff was very friendly and accommodating. it is within walking distance of shops and dining. my family got two suites. one ocean front and one ocean view. both offered great views. both had small kitchens equipped with pots, pans, and dinning items. beds were comfy and pull out sofas were available."reviewed by  aj89  on  june 2019  via  tripadvisorperfection in service, location and full relaxation rating: 5 out of 5 stars"first, i want to highlight an amazing service from front desk supervisor guillermo arroyo who solved every request i had with a smile and superb customer service from changing my non-refundable reservation date to granting my family access to the pool before and after checking and thus extending an amazing experience. second, the crystal clean lobby, room and facilities are definitely a huge highlight esp for beach front property with customers going from the beach. we had a regular room which was a perfect accommodation to a family of four with giving my husband privacy of a bedroom and my girls shared sleeper sofa in the living room. convenient kitchenette with dishwasher, microwave and fridge can be handy especially with publix two blocks away.  location, location and location all restaurants in collins avenue are seconds away so you don’t have to worry about anything just relax and enjoy. definitely got sooooo much more on the budget then i expected and enjoyed every second of it so highly recommend."reviewed by  daytrip247337  on  april 2019  via  tripadvisorgreat family suite!

was amazing and the location is extremely close to the beach."reviewed by  haze rossi  on  april 2019  via  tripadvisortercer aã±o consecutivo en el hotel rating: 5 out of 5 stars"nos encanta este hotel es por esto que es nuestro tercer año consecutivo en el. su ubicación es perfecta con salida a la playa y cerca de muchos supermercados y restoranes.  sus trabajadores son todos amables. no es
