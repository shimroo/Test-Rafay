high-quality limerock (limestone)
since starting operation in 1986, white rock has become well-known for its production of high-quality limerock (also known as limestone) for valued customers throughout the east coast of florida.
located in miami, florida, white rock is managed by a team of quarry professionals who bring a wealth of in-depth experience to the market.
high-volume production



white rock’s entire operation was designed from the ground up for high-volume production. in a continuous cycle, limerock is carefully drilled and blasted, then excavated by a marion 8200 walking dragline hoisting a 105-cy bucket.
the material is loaded into high-capacity cat off-highway rear-dump trucks and hauled to the crushing plant, where dot-certified aggregates and a range of fine screenings are processed.
excellent customer service
finally, white rock’s fleet of high-capacity cat loaders quickly and efficient load customers’ trucks, which are weighed out on six outbound scales featuring remote ticket printers.
with its mining operation located near the florida east coast railroad, white rock can deliver aggregates and screenings by rail from miami to jacksonville.
