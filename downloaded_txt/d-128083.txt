food for thought...

the important thing is not 
								to think much, 
     but to love much; 
        and so, do that which best stirs you 
								to love.
saint teresa of avila

									if you are seeking closeness 
								to the beloved,
      love everyone.
								whether in their presence or absence,
        see only their good.
								if you want to be as clear and refreshing as
								
         the breath of the morning breeze,
								like the sun have nothing but warmth and light
									
           for everyone.


shaikh abu-said abil-khair

you do not have to struggle 
								to reach god,
    but you do have to struggle to tear away
       the self-created veil that hides him from you.
									
paramahansa yogananda

o, friend! nobody veils you, 
								but yourself.
    in your path there is no thorn or weed, but yourself.
								you asked:  shall i reach the beloved or not?
    between you and the beloved there is nobody, but yourself.


awhadoddin kermani



									all those who are unhappy in 
								the world
      are so as a result of 
          their desire for their own 
								happiness.
								all those who are happy in the world
       are so as a result of 
           their desire for the 
								happiness of others.

shantideva


									before you ask god for what 
								you want, 
          first thank god for what you have. 

author unknown



									how long will you keep pounding 
								on an open door
     begging for someone to open it?    

rabi'a  al-'adawiyya
								


									i do not desire suffering;
								
     yet fool i am, 
								i desire the cause of suffering!

shantideva


									wisdom tells me i am nothing. 
								
    love tells me i am everything.  
        between the two my life flows.

nisargadatta maharaj
								


									in the morning, the one who 
								does not understand will
     consider what he will do,
								while the one who understands will
     consider what the one will do with him.

ibn 'ata 'illah


									until you become an unbeliever 
								in your own self,
    you cannot become a believer in god.

shaikh abu-said abil-khair


									student:  
								sir, if one gave up the i, nothing whatsoever would 
								remain. 

								ramakrishna:  
								i am not asking you to give up all of the i. you 
								should give up only the "unripe i."  
									the "unripe 
								i" makes one feel: "i am the doer. these are my 
								wife and children. i am a teacher." 

								renounce this "unripe i" and keep the "ripe 
								i" which 
								will make you feel that you are god's servant, 
									his 
								devotee, and that god is the doer and you are his 
								instrument.

sri ramakrishna


									worn-out garments are shed 
								by the body,
								worn-out bodies are shed by the dweller within the 
								body,
								new bodies are donned by the dweller, like garments.

								not wounded by weapons, not burned by fire,
								not dried by the wind, not wetted by water,
								
								such is the one.

								not dried, not wetted, not burned, not wounded,
								innermost essence, everywhere, always,
								being of beings, changeless, eternal, for ever and 
								ever.

bhagavad-gita 2:22


									where are you hurrying to?
     you will see
  the same moon tonight
       wherever you go!


izumi shikibu
								


									there is no difference in the 
								destination,
     the only difference is in the journey.

inayat khan


									all the violence, fear and 
								suffering
    that exists in this world
       comes from grasping at "self".
								what use is this great monster to you?
    if you do not let go of the "self", 
       there will never be an end to your suffering.

shantideva


																		in the pursuit of learning, 
									
     every day something is acquired. 
								in the pursuit of tao, 
      every day something is dropped.
								

lao tzu


									correct behavior 
   means that you are 
      occupied with commendable activity.

ibn 'ata'


									there is only one virtue      
									
          and only one sin 
                for a soul on the path: 
								virtue when he is conscious of god           
									
                  and sin when he is not.

abu hashim madani
								


there is only one truth,       but there are many ways of misunderstanding it.

abraham joshua heschel


									satyameva jayate     
									
    truth alone is victorious

mundaka upanishad 3.1.6

i see now  that all creatures     
									have perfect enlightenment        
									- but they do not know it

buddha (zen 
								tradition, shobogenzo)
