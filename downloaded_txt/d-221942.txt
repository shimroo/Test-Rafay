the journey

		learn about the comprehensive program at prep for prep





admissions
top students of color from 750 new york city public schools apply for admission to prep for prep each year. 

preparation
admitted students undergo a rigorous 14-month course of study spanning two summer sessions as well as after school wednesdays and saturdays. 

placement
all students who successfully complete the preparatory component are placed in day schools (as seventh-graders) or boarding schools (as ninth-graders). 

student support
prep counselors support the academic and personal progress of each student in grades 7–12 through monthly meetings with them and their school administrators. counselors also plan year-round social and cultural activities. 

paid internships, travel abroad & more
a considerable array of leadership development opportunities broadens our students' aspirations, increases their awareness of life's possibilities, and builds a stronger sense of self. 

college guidance
our students are often the first in their family to attend college. prep advises them on application and financial aid processes, advocates with colleges on behalf of students, arranges college trips, and offers sat prep. 

undergraduate support
undergraduate affairs supports students with individual advising, transition-to-college workshops, and social gatherings to foster their academic and personal success. 

alumni affairs
networking, reunions, and professional workshops help alums stay connected to prep and each other. alums volunteer with prep, secure internships for current students, and fundraise for the alumni giving campaign.
