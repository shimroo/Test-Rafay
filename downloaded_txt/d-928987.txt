   the protection of your accounts is our top priority.
due to recent changes in the world, the potential for increased online fraud is higher. some reminders to help protect your account:
never share your passwords, security questions or pin with anyone. use a
strong password and change it periodically. valley central bank or our fraud department will never contact you for your pin, passwords, or security codes/questions. we at valley central bank suggest setting up
account alerts to assist you in monitoring your accounts. if you need further assistance please contact us at 513-821-3335.
