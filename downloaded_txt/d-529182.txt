huskie spotlight


we are very hands-on when we are in the clinic, from the very beginning. i've had external preceptors comment on how well-prepared niu students are for clinic. we have the opportunity to explore our interests in our field through external rotations, conferences, guest speakers and humanitarian trips. it is really a well-rounded experience that has exceeded all of my expectations.
