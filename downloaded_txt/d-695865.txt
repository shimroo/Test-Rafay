a history of aibi








					american indian bible institute was established in los angeles ca in 1966
					by a group of individuals from first american indian church who saw a
					need for a bible training organization
					"where we can be trained to reach our own people for christ." the bible
					institute chose the key verse 2 timothy 2:2,
					"and the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
					bible institute classes were held in the local american indian churches
					as well as in the homes of individuals.
over the years, in addition to offering regular bible institute classes
					in the los angeles metropolitan area, the lord led the board to develop a
					number of other ministries to assist in the training of leaders on
					reservations and in urban areas in several states. some of those
					included: a tape ministry, an extension training program, leadership
					training seminars in various locations of the united states and canada,
					and a variety of written bible and leadership training manuals. in 1999,
					many of those bible and leadership training materials were put on-line
					for easier access by former staff and students. the lord took the media
					of the internet and expanded the ministry to individuals in over 140
					different countries. free computer cds containing the materials
					available on the website have been sent to over 70 different countries.
					in 2013, the aibi board requested the organization of what is now known
					as "serve and equip" to provide the opportunity for this aspect of the
					aibi outreach to continue to expand as the lord allows.

serve and equip
at the request of the aibi board, and in response to the growing
					opportunity through aibi resources, serve and equip was formed to continue
					the expansion of these resources in a global context. in may of 2014, the
					board of serve and equip
					(s&e) met for the first time to establish its purpose statement which is:
					"...to proclaim the gospel of jesus christ and glorify god by helping develop and equip godly reproducing christians and churches through the teaching of god's word, providing of bible training resources and serving and assisting christians to become effective disciple makers in accordance with the teachings in god's word, the bible".
this purpose will be fulfilled by equipping christians, churches and
					bible schools around the world with free bible training resources. this
					process of equipping christians lines up with the original goal of aibi to
					develop a second, third and fourth generation of spiritual leaders who are
					equipped to reach out and develop other leaders (taken from their key verse
					- 2 timothy 2:2).
in 2022, due to a variety of circumstances, aibi began the process of
					dissolution. although aibi has ceased to exist as an organization, ministry
					continues through the ongoing teaching and outreach of the former staff and
					students around north america, as well as through the use of the resources
					now provided through serve and
						equip - https://www.sveq.org
					praise the lord for what he has done and continues to do through each of
					these individuals and churches in the los angeles area and beyond.
