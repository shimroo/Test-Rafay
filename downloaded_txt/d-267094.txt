offensive genius



to paraphrase roddy piper, just when you think you know all the answers, paul johnson changes the questions.mickey andrews has 75 minutes during the lightning delay to go over everyone's assignments, what they've seen, and how it can be covered.  first play for the gt offense after the delay, down 14-7.- 1st and 10, ball on the right hash mark.- trips formation - left side.  roddy jones at left a-back. anthony allen in the slot and starts in motion to the right- the florida state safety, #20, lets him go because he's instructed that he'll either come back to him or block for the mid-line option with josh nesbitt.  he stays on the left side of the field.- the only problem is that anthony allen isn't coming back to him or blocking for the mid-line option.  anthony allen is in full speed on the right side.- 3 blockers on one defender equals a 60 yard run for anthony allen.as bob davie said after the play.  wow.
