while far from being the world's culinary zenith, the mile high city sits at the base of the rocky mountains boasting dining excellence far eclipsing beginnings as a gold mining camp and cowtown. restaurants spearheaded by young guns inclined toward globe-trotting menus now compete against chains and long-established favorites, while seasoned chefs are also riding in to open their own outposts. such a diverse, groundbreaking dining scene virtually assures patrons of a culinary rocky mountain high, from lower downtown denver (sometimes called lodo) to eclectic venues near coors field and beyond. menus themselves pack wallop: traditional steaks and chops remain prime options, yet it's also possible to order marbled steak tartare or double-cut pork chops festooned with blue cheese fondue. grilled venison may well arrive with a red curried coconut sauce atop oyster mushrooms sautéed in ginger ale. the 
vesta dipping grill wows patrons with some 30 signature dipping sauces, while tamayo (on trendy larimer square in lodo) touts pan-roasted salmon enchiladas. luca d'italia serves white-truffled fusilli and rabbit three ways  confit, grilled and braised, while parisi, in the highlands north of downtown, turns out pizza with perfect charred crusts topped with asparagus, anchovies, soppressata salame and smoked salmon. in a class by itself, restaurant kevin taylor in the hotel teatro next to the colorado convention center, pampers with white-gloved service and dishes like roasted squab breast, duck confit ravioli and pork chops in foie gras. all in all, denver allows feasting with both attitude and altitude.
