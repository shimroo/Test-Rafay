rick palacios back making $20,000 a month





dinburg has opted for new legal representation, the contract of which will be released this week, according to city officials.at the city council meeting on oct. 6, mayor richard garcia was the first to recommend that the city enter into negotiations with the law firm of gonzalez and palacios llp and the law office of cynthia contreras gutierrez for legal representation for the city of edinburg. the decision now ends current city attorney ric gonzalez’s tenure representing the city, but garcia hinted at employing gonzalez later for legal issues regarding property and closings.how can the city attorney prosecute people in the muncipal court when the judge and the city attorney are uncle and nephew?another conflice would be richard garcia hiring then city manager wendy sturgis. wendy's former husband is a federal prosecutor and had richard garcia as opposing council many times. lots of rats in edinburg. i just hope the feds and the judicial committee in austin can come down and raise hell!

we have a new superintendent





on a vote of 4 to 3, ecisd has a new superintendent. and that person is rene gutierrez out of the la joya school dist. i wonder what carmen promised ciro? how about naming the first built fine arts building being named after ciro's son? i'm sure this doesn't sit well with the da. carmen is nothing but a woman out to make money. and that money comes from selling school material to the dist. for the people that have been out of the loop. carmen is employed by nes (national education systems out of san antonio) she sells to the ecisd and also to la joya. this is where our new superintendent is coming from. eventually she will have to explain her actions to the feds. you see, several letters have been sent to the office on mccoll rd. stay tune! i hope they throw the book at her. couldn't happen to a finer woman. transportationlook for rudy zamora to get re assigned. carmen does have to take care of her own. it's amazing what some people can get away with! or have they? only time will tell.richard garciacongrats goes out to richard garcia on becoming a dad at the age of 85. way to go richard!

fraud





what a texas town can teach us about health care.mcallen has another distinction, too: it is one of the most expensive health-care markets in the country. only miami—which has much higher labor and living costs—spends more per person on health care. in 2006, medicare spent fifteen thousand dollars per enrollee here, almost twice the national average. the income per capita is twelve thousand dollars. in other words, medicare spends three thousand dollars more per person here than the average person earns.mcallen, texas, the most expensive town in the most expensive country for health care in the world, seemed a good place to look for some answers.from the moment i arrived, i asked almost everyone i encountered about mcallen’s health costs—a businessman i met at the five-gate mcallen-miller international airport, the desk clerks at the embassy suites hotel, a police-academy cadet at mcdonald’s. most weren’t surprised to hear that mcallen was an outlier. “just look around,” the cadet said. “people are not healthy here.” mcallen, with its high poverty rate, has an incidence of heavy drinking sixty per cent higher than the national average. and the tex-mex diet has contributed to a thirty-eight-per-cent obesity rate.one day, i went on rounds with lester dyke, a weather-beaten, ranch-owning fifty-three-year-old cardiac surgeon who grew up in austin, did his surgical training with the army all over the country, and settled into practice in hidalgo county. he has not lacked for business: in the past twenty years, he has done some eight thousand heart operations, which exhausts me just thinking about it.i walked around with him as he checked in on ten or so of his patients who were recuperating at the three hospitals where he operates. it was easy to see what had landed them under his knife. they were nearly all obese or diabetic or both. many had a family history of heart disease. few were taking preventive measures, such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, which, studies indicate, would have obviated surgery for up to half of them.i took a walk through doctors hospital at renaissance, in edinburg, one of the towns in the mcallen metropolitan area, with robert alleyn, a houston-trained general surgeon who had grown up here and returned home to practice. the hospital campus sprawled across two city blocks, with a series of three- and four-story stucco buildings separated by golfing-green lawns and black asphalt parking lots. he pointed out the sights—the cancer center is over here, the heart center is over there, now we’re coming to the imaging center. we went inside the surgery building. it was sleek and modern, with recessed lighting, classical music piped into the waiting areas, and nurses moving from patient to patient behind rolling black computer pods. we changed into scrubs and alleyn took me through the sixteen operating rooms to show me the laparoscopy suite, with its flat-screen video monitors, the hybrid operating room with built-in imaging equipment, the surgical robot for minimally invasive robotic surgery.i was impressed. the place had virtually all the technology that you’d find at harvard and stanford and the mayo clinic, and, as i walked through that hospital on a dusty road in south texas, this struck me as a remarkable thing. rich towns get the new school buildings, fire trucks, and roads, not to mention the better teachers and police officers and civil engineers. poor towns don’t. but that rule doesn’t hold for health care.the surgeon came to mcallen in the mid-nineties, and since then, he said, “the way to practice medicine has changed completely. before, it was about how to do a good job. now it is about ‘how much will you benefit?’ ”

what's cooking?





joseph palacios will challenge oscar garza for county commissioner. watch this one very closely. this may be a ploy and right at the very end oscar might just pull out and let jospeh palacios come right in. as you can see, i don't trust either candidate.jd salinas sees the writing on the wall and will give up his post to our new county judge ramon garcia. watch jd make a run for congress.laura hinojosa is not showing up for work. she also has her sights on running for congress. joe ochoa was seen politicking in the delta area. what does that tell you?carmen and co are running around saying they have the four votes for her boy rene gutierrez. why does she want this guy so bad? la joya purchased $75,000 from carmen's employer last year. that went to $85,000 this year. richard garcia was ready to throughout rick gonzalez this past city council meeting. we all know he wants to bring back daniel rios. seems like richard did not have the votes.juan partida will get challenged by terry canales. watch for partida to win and win pretty easily. two new county courts were created by the legislature this past session. look for eddie trevino to run for one spot and kelly rivera for the other.and that is what's cooking!

carmen & ciro have meeting with new superintendent at local restaurant





carmen gonzalez and ciro trevino were having a meeting with rene gutierrez at a local restaurant. rene gutierrez is the person who carmen gonzalez wants as our new ecisd superintendent. she is worried how ciro trevino is going to vote, knowing how ciro's candidate didn't even make it to second base.one way to get the position of superintendent is to talk bad about the other candidates vying for the same position. you see, at last night's school board meeting, jacques trevino was passing out flyer's from the internet. on these flyer's were a lot of negative publicity on the other candidates who applied for the superintendent position. he decided to looked up these people and see what negative stuff he can distribute at yesterday's meeting. way to go jac! your my hero!also, at yesterday's school board meeting. jacques trevino's contract got renewed for one more year. but what else did you expect?working on a story where two ecisd teachers were charged with dui and possession of cocaine. the district decided to put these people on administrative leave with pay, pending the on going investigation. i have learned that these two teachers are back at work teaching your kids.
