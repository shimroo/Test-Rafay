				zero-leak gold guarantee
			




				zero-leak gold® hydraulic plugs and banjo fittings are the most reliable and cost-effective hydraulic fluid sealing options in existence today.

available in sae j514 and metric iso 6149 configurations, zero-leak gold utilizes dual-seal technology to provide a primary metal-to-metal seal with an independent secondary o-ring back-up seal. that means no leaks—guaranteed.
