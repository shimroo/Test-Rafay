welcome to the fire safety engineering 
		  group (fseg), pioneer of computational fire engineering, and a 
		  world-leader in fire safety science and engineering. our fire and 
		  evacuation research, consultancy, and modelling tools help to solve 
		  some of the world's toughest fire, safety and security engineering 
		  challenges in the built and urban-scale environments, transportation, 
		  and pedestrian environment. based in london, we have been ranked by 
		  the ref as one of the top research groups in the uk for the past 15 
		  years, with 4* (world leading) scores for our two impact case studies 
		  in both ref2014 and ref2021. our contribution to public safety has 
		  also been recognised through prestigious awards, including the queen's 
		  anniversary prize, the guardian research impact award, and the sfpe 
		  award for the best research project.
