welcome
i used to be 
offended, but now i'm just amused.... ...
  based on a line from the elvis costello song red shoes (1977) - thanks 
to prof. arthur w. kelley for the source.
q: how many vice-presidents 
does it take to change a light bulb on a college campus these days?
a: one more than they already have.

  						the purpose of these pages is to provide intelligent 
						commentary on the successes, failures, and foibles of 
						the american education establishment.  we hope to 
						do this with a modicum of wit, and without the rancor 
						and mean-spiritedness that characterizes so much 
						commentary today.  the 
  						primary author
   						and web master has had more than 37 years experience in 
						american public higher education.  he holds a ph.d. 
						in physics from a reasonably reputable
                             ivy league 
						university.  he taught at a second rate 
						tier "comprehensive" university in southern california 
						for more than 37 years before retiring.  in 
						addition, he has held a number of petty administrative 
						posts within the education establishment.  he is 
						well known among his colleagues as a person who is 
						fearlessly irascible.  neither his alma mater, nor 
						his   current 
						institution
   						(where he now holds emeritus status) should be held 
						accountable for the comments that he makes, no matter 
						how temperate and reasonable they may be. 

  						[i wrote the first version of the following paragraph 
						shortly after i started this site almost 15 years ago.  
						sadly, it's now commonplace to find this on many, if not 
						most, college campuses.] 
  						speaking of my current institution, it makes up for 
						whatever it may lack in intellectual prestige with a 
						healthy dose of kitsch.  it probably is the only 
						university in the world that hosts several starbuck's 
						coffee outlets, a carl's 
						junior
   						hamburger stand, and a 
						marriott hotel
 						on its campus.
dear readers,
owing to a dearth of 
quality submissions relating to education issues, i have placed the irascible 
professorsm in a state of suspended animation.  if we receive 
enough high-quality articles, we will resume publication.  meanwhile, we 
encourage you to search through both our recent articles and our archives to 
find articles of interest. -- dr. mark h. shapiro, editor and publisher 
(1/17/2014).  we recently received the following article from sandy pinsker, 
which we deemed worth of publication.
