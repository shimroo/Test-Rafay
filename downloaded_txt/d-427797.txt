jobs that aren't dumb - now recruiting





here's a few scenarios. see if any of them describe you. you got laid off. you're tired of getting people coffee and answering phones. you'd rather your work was a little more meaningful than price-fixing cantaloupe. you love nyc and would like to do something for it. 
if any of these describe you, you may want to at least check out nyc civic corps. the nyc civic corps is a diverse group of individuals - from recent graduates to experienced professionals - who dedicate one year of service to new york city.  corps members are dispatched in small teams to local non-profit organizations and city agencies with the charge of developing sustainable volunteer programs and expanding organizational capacity.  in return for their service, members of the nyc civic corps earn a monthly living stipend, health and commuting benefits, and an end-of-service education award.  corps members also receive monthly professional development and support from nyc service. 
in astoria & lic, the nyccc has done at least two awesome projects that i know of - one with computers for youth, a nonprofit organization located in long island city that empowers low income children to perform better in school by improving their home learning environment. and another with materials for the arts, an initiative of the nyc department of cultural affairs, solicits art supplies for use by non-profit groups and schools.
applications are available at www.nyc.gov/service.  only online applications will be accepted, and the application deadline is june 30, 2010.
good luck!

all the fresh veggies, none of the commitment





astoria welcomes a new, exciting csa to town! holton farms, from southeastern vt, has lots of tasty produce and other farmy items. but they also have some innovation going on. i hear it all the time... "i'd love to do a csa, but it's too much commitment!" yeah, it really can be for a big city gal. off the the hampties or a film festival, or even brunch (!) and then it's "oh crap, my veggies!". not so with holton farms who will let you buy "what you want, when you want". (you can do a more traditional csa plan with them, too.)catch their truck at steinway & 35th ave from 9 to 10am on sundays. and check out their website, for more info and sign ups. plus, jia readers can use the discount code hfastoria for 5% off csa memberships!
