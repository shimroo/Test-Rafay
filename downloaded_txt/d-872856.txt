          through the cliff appreciates program, uh ceo cliff a. megerian, md, facs, jane and henry meyer chief executive officer distinguished chair, likes to recognize our non-physician caregivers who stand out for living the uh values with the bravo awards. today‚Äôs caregiver spotlight focuses on jason pirtz, rn, who is being recognized as a bravo award winner for providing service excellence and demonstrating an outstanding commitment to patient care and engagement as chief operating officer (coo) for uh cleveland medical center. 

amidst a hectic schedule, jason noticed a patient looking lost and took the time to personally escort him to his appointment at uh harrington heart & vascular institute. this thoughtful action made a significant impression on the patient, who was so moved by the experience that he wrote to our ceo to express his gratitude.

the patient's note highlighted the exceptional level of care and concern demonstrated by jason, which he has shared with many others. by leading with such compassion and dedication, jason not only provided excellent service but also positively represented the ethos of patient engagement at uh. 

we decided to chat with jason to learn more about him and how he lives the uh values:

as coo, how do you live the uh values?

working for a large healthcare organization brings amazing opportunities, but i don‚Äôt believe that we can provide the best care possible for the patients we serve without first focusing on teamwork and a consistent drive toward service excellence. ultimately, i feel that it is my responsibility to create an environment of teamwork that sets our caregivers up for success.

how do you support the needs of the various caregiver teams? 

this is one of my favorite questions to answer as i feel the ultimate commitment to all of uh cleveland medical center‚Äôs caregivers. whether it‚Äôs advocating for new technology, creating a safe environment, streamlining workflows or upgrading our facility, everything we do is important to our mission. i live by the motto that ‚Äúif you are not serving a patient then you better be serving someone who is.‚Äù 

what do you like best about working at uh?

i have a great appreciation for the relationships that i have built within the organization over the past seven years. the caregivers who i work with are not just employees -- they are my friends and colleagues. i trust them, and these relationships are the reason why we are able to do the very challenging work that we do. 

what‚Äôs been your most memorable experience at uh?

i think my most memorable moment was uh‚Äôs response to the covid-19 pandemic. when i was very new in my role at uh cleveland medical center, i had the opportunity to serve as chief operations officer within the hospital incident command structure. i was so proud of our caregivers and their unwavering commitment to our community during that time. it was absolutely amazing!

          sharing key takeaways on the cms hospital inpatient quality reporting program for fy2025. 
- seven new measures are added (which are welcome, with the caveat of let's see how they work out)
       -> patient safety structural measure beginning cy 2025 with payment determination in fy 2027
       -> age friendly hospital cy 2025/fy 2027
       -> catheter-associated urinary tract infection standardized infection ratio stratified for oncology locations (cauti- onc) cy 2026/fy 2028
       -> central line-associated bloodstream infection standardized infection ratio stratified for oncology locations (clabsi-onc) cy 2026/fy 2028
       -> hospital harm ‚Äì falls with injury (ecqm) cy 2026/fy 2028
       -> hospital harm ‚Äì postoperative respiratory failure (ecqm) cy 2026/fy 2028
       -> thirty-day risk-standardized death rate among surgical inpatients with complications july 1, 2023‚Äìjune 30, 2025/ fy 2027
 - five existing measures are removed (which is a breath of fresh air) - the unpopular psi-04, and measures related to 30-day episode payments for acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, total hip/ knee arthroplasty, heart failure
 - two existing measures are modified (global malnutrition composite score expanded from seniors over 65 to anyone older than 18 - this is very positive; and refined hcahps measure - will post details on this next week.)

          sharing key takeaways on the refined hcahps measure per the cms quality reporting center: 

-> the number of questions in the hcahps survey is increased from 29 to 32, with 8 questions added and 5 deleted. 
-> the new survey will be administered beginning with january 1, 2025, patient discharges
-> the crosswalk between current survey and new survey is available here: https://lnkd.in/ej9rub_s
-> there are pronounced differences in response rates by mode of survey administration for some patient characteristics.
o black, hispanic, spanish language-preferring, younger, and maternity patients are
more likely to respond to a telephone survey.
o older patients are more likely to respond to a mail survey

my editorial comment: if we don't get feedback from all or at least the majority of our patients, we are only going to hear from the very upset or the very happy patients, with the very upset ones more likely to fill out the survey. efforts to mobilize response rates are key to improving hcahps score.

          recent regulatory changes provide hospitals a unique opportunity to reassess their reimbursement practices and strategy, showing the value of completing three reporting types in tandem rather than one at a time. by understanding how reimbursement programs like medicare dsh, worksheet s-10 uncompensated care, and medicare bad debts are related, hospitals can save time, alleviate strain on their it departments, free up staff to focus on high-priority work, and potentially improve their financial health. learn more in this moss adams article by heather keser, jonathan mason, jesse vo and josh stewart.

          during the recent ama annual meeting, beau raymond, md mmm facp, chief medical officer of ochsner health network, shared compelling data on the impact of ochsner connected health's digital medicine program for managing cardiometabolic diseases. his presentation highlighted the strategic use of digital tools to enhance patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs.

dr. raymond detailed how the program's success is underscored by its impressive impact on healthcare costs and member outcomes. annually, enrolled members experience an average savings of $2,200 per person. within just six months, four out of five members achieve hypertension and diabetes control, including a reduction in emergency department visits and hospital admissions. leveraging data from connected bluetooth devices and medication management from licensed clinicians, the program‚Äôs data-driven patient management extends beyond mere monitoring, embodying a transformative shift in cardiometabolic healthcare delivery.

          purchased services are vital to healthcare, but they can also become financial drains if not managed properly.

a mature purchased services strategy includes insight into all expenses, reduction in unnecessary variation, and prioritized patient care, outcomes, and experience. by focusing on these areas, health systems can lower costs, improve clinical care, and enhance patient experiences.

          super-utilization frequent use of acute hospital care is an expanding concern within academic literature. efforts to reduce frequent and multi-dimensional acute presentations using current care models appear ineffective. the predominant focus on utilization, which is wedded to a care management model, has diverted attention from taking both a more needs-centred and a broader complex systems perspective on super-utilization. greater resourcing of general practice to address the boundaries between medical and social care with greater integrated funding should be extended to meet the needs of vulnerable super-utilization patients.
