michael burks and phillip anderson of the answp testify against bill white





neo-nazi’s trial wraps upby natasha korecki federal courts reporter/nkorecki@suntimes.com jan 4, 2011 06:59pmin  closing remarks at the trial of white supremacist william white  tuesday, the lead prosecutor in the case conjured the murders of a  chicago judge’s family, then called white a “ghoul.”the defense accused prosecutors of trying to inject emotion into the trial.assistant  u.s. attorney william hogan detailed how white reacted in 2005 when he  heard u.s. district judge joan lefkow found her husband and mother  murdered.“good for them! was my first thought,” white wrote in an online posting to his hate website overthrow.com.“everyone involved in the (white supremacist matthew) hale trial has deserved assassination for a long time.”after reading the entry, hogan pointed at white in disgust.“this ghoul sitting over here is washing his hands in lefkow family blood,” hogan said.white,  of roanoke, va., is on trial for posting personal information in 2008  on the same website about the foreperson who deliberated in hale’s  trial.hale was convicted of ordering the head of his security to  kill lefkow. that man was an fbi informant. hale is now serving a  40-year sentence. a disgruntled litigant not tied to a hate group  carried out the lefkow slayings.prosecutors said white posted  the juror’s information targeting “the susceptible ones, the stupid  ones, the crazy ones” hoping someone would do harm to the juror.“you don’t get to solicit murder and have it protected by the first amendment,” hogan said.defense  lawyer nishay shanan said white has every right to post the  information, that it was all public information and that white never  asked anyone to harm the juror.shanan said it amounted to nothing more than harassment.“like it or not, the first amendment protects that speech,” shanan said.“you can’t take protected free speech and suddenly make it a crime.”white once posted similar information about the miami herald’s syndicated columnist leonard pitts, an fbi agent testified.white ripped one of pitts’ columns, called him a racial slur, then posted his personal information online.the pulitzer-prize winning columnist testified in a separate trial involving white in 2009.white was eventually convicted on four counts. he was acquitted of three other counts in that trial, including the pitts count.prosecutors  called two former members of white’s group to testify about their  involvement in white’s group, the american national socialist workers  party.each allegedly received letters from white after he was  arrested with instructions on how they should testify before a grand  jury, asserting that the website did not encourage criminal activity.michael  burks of louisville, ky., disagreed. he testified he interpreted some  of white’s postings as invitations to do harm to others.“i don’t know any other definition of ‘kill,’” burks said, referring to one of white’s postings.“when you give out his address and tell ‘em: ‘kill this bastard,’ i don’t know what else it could mean.”

bill white found guilty again, thanks to phillip anderson cooperating





phil anderson, a former answp member, turned over letters bill white wrote him from prison urging him and others not to harm a federal judge. the prosecution used the letters to help convict him. could be facing 3 more years in prison.http://www2.wsls.com/news/2011/jan/05/5/roanoke-neo-nazi-could-be-looking-3-more-years-pri-ar-754759/a federal jury in chicago took only a few hours to convict roanoke  neo-nazi bill white on a charge related to threatening the former jury  foreman. no sentencing date has been set. white's attorney, nishay sanan, said his next move will be to  petition a judge to have a bond hearing on either january 18th or a few  days afterward. white will have served all the prison time required after his roanoke convictions in late december 2009. with the exception of a few days when white was released on bond in  the late summer of 2009, white has been in prison since october 2008. while white could receive a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison,  sanan expects federal prosecutors to ask for at least three years. sanan said he will argue at sentencing that white's time served should count toward his chicago punishment. federal prosecutors said they believe white is exactly where he belongs--- in prison, and they intend to keep him there. prosecutors said two letters white wrote from roanoke city jail a few  days after his initial incarceration helped prove their case. white wrote to members of his american national socialist workers'  party, or answp, urging them to reach out to the group's chicago  connections to make sure no one hurt the former jury foreman. prosecutors said the letters were proof white knew someone could act  out on a post he wrote on his former website, overthrow.com, which  prosecutors said essentially encouraged readers to harm the juror, the  victim in this case.

bill white moved from berekley prison to okc transfer center





in the middle of the night, and with no notice, answp leader bill white was dragged out of his prison cell, probably screaming, and put right on a plane to the oklahoma city federal inmate transfer facility. they never do give an inmate notice when they do this.he will then be transferred to illinois to stand trial on multiple felonies of threatening juries and judges and facing years more of prison time.

and bill white loses again in court, tried to argues his mental illness was discriminated against.





thanks to meghan for sending me this via another email account.from the public records: william a. white v. secor inc., et alcase 7:2010-cv-00428document 20memorandum opinion by hon. james c. turk“… plaintiff complains that rita parker, the director of the lccc [lebanon community correction center], will not accept him from the bureau of prisons (“bop”). the lccc provides a half-way house programming for the bop. plaintiff argues that the defendants will not accept him into the half-way house program because of his alleged narcissistic personality disorder and on-going violent behaviors. plaintiff argues that the defendants are discriminating against him, in violation of the ada [americans with disabilities act], by not allowing him to participate in the half-way house program because of “the perception” of his personality disorder. plaintiff filed a substantially similar action in white v. secor, inc., no. 7:10-cv-00345 (w.d. va.), and plaintiff requests that the court take judicial notice of it. plaintiff filed in that action a copy of a letter to establish his attempts to exhaust administrative remedies. plaintiff also acknowledged in his prior complaint that he “does not actually suffer from narcissistic personality disorder.” plaintiff states that the diagnosing physician used improper methodology, and it was subsequently determined that the physician could not substantiate his diagnosis. plaintiff requests as relief in the instant action an injunction compelling the defendants to accept his transfer from the bureau of prisons and damages of $1,000 per day after september 27, 2010 that the plaintiff is not transferred to the lccc.…to state a claim under title iii of the ada, a person alleging discrimination must show, inter alia, that he is disabled within the meaning of the ada and the defendant is a private entity that owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation…([including] an inn, … restaurant, a motion picture house,… an auditorium, … or other place of public gathering;”). however, by plaintiff’s own admission, plaintiff is not disabled within the meaning of the ada. plaintiff alleged that he does not, in fact, suffer from narcisstic personality disorder. thus, plaintiff does not qualify for relief under the ada. moreover, plaintiff fails to establish that the private correctional facility is a place of public accommodation… [deleted - previous cases which found that a prison is not a place of public accommodation under the law / places of public accommodation do not include prisons]. accordingly, the court dismisses the action without prejudice as frivolous because plaintiff readily admitted he is not disabled and seeks a prison transfer under ada. iii.for the foregoing reasons, the court dismisses the complaint without prejudice as frivolous, pursuant to 42 u.s.c. …1997e(c), and denies the remaining motions as moot…”enter: this 5th day of november, 2010. james c. turk senior united states district judge

news reports linking tea party to white supremacist groups.





you know something. i don't buy into it. sure, there are tea party types who are racist. but it's more that white supremacist are linking themselves to tea party types, then the other way around. white supremacist groups are parasites that will try to attach themselves to anything.i do think these tea party types are full of shit. like i have said many types, beware of any group that cries "freedom", "1st amendment", "patriot", etc.  they are the first ones who want to remove those things from anyone who disagrees with them.
