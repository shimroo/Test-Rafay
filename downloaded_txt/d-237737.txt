about techteach
the college of education is transforming the way educators will impact our future.
                                 our nationally recognized teacher preparation program features coursework that translates
                                 to practical classroom skills, a yearlong residency in a school district co-teaching
                                 alongside a skilled mentor teacher, and the use of state-of-the-art digital technology
                                 to record, review and improve instruction.
our line of sister programs - techteach across texas and techteach across rural texas
                                 - brings the innovative training model around the state, allowing aspiring educators
                                 to be prepared in their communities and in the classrooms where they will teach after
                                 graduation.
