testimonials
this is our first time to try this restaurant, and we like it so much!

first, i have to say that i don't eat pork, and their menu is pork free! 👍🏻 which is so almost impossible to find!

in addition, the place is clean, smells good, with good lighting, and cozy ambiance! 💫

also, the staff are friendly, welcoming, and helpful. 👌🏻

finally, which is the most important, the food is fresh, tastes good, and looks good too! 🥗

as first timers, we ordered chicken soft tacos, mexican pizza, and curly fries. 🌮🍟🍕

the food came in a good time.⏱

after trying the food, now we want to experience more items on the menu! 😋

one more thing, the prices are reasonable. i took photos of the menu for you to see and judge yourself.💸💰

i recommend this mexican restaurant for those who look for good mexican flavors with reasonable prices, and pork free! 👍🏻
