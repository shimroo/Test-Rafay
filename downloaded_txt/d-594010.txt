abductionradiation:richmond, va – earlier this year, jane migraine released her single “7 hours” via ny-based label totally real records. if you haven’t turned your ears onto her, this is the perfect song to be introduced into her dreamy world. upon my initial listen, “7 hours” immediately reminded me of fazerdaze with reverb on the guitars and her lo-fi vocals. jane migraine perfectly balances bedroom pop with catchy indie rock elements to give the song a shimmery gleam.  from the steady, upbeat drums to the droning nature of song, “7 hours” has a hypnotic draw to it that’ll have listeners hooked.
