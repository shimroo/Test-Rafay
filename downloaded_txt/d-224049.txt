featured land protection project:
the ridge




in east bay township, a forested ridge rises prominently above the surrounding landscape, the centerpiece of a unique property that could soon join the area’s growing network of protected lands. known as “the ridge,” this roughly 312-acre property is among the region’s most critical landscapes identified for protection, featuring tremendous ecological significance, water quality benefits, and potential for passive recreation opportunities.
