14th-feb-2006 04:37 am - hp: sirius/remusdo wizards dream of magical sheep by keelywolfedead is dead, unless you're a wizard. then things can get...complicated. keelywolfe's story is dark-ish, and there's a thread of claustrophobia in there that worked very nicely. i'm a sucker for well-done desperation, and that comes across wonderfully. the vast majority of sirius/remus doesn't work for me, because either they're too happypuppyjoypuppy, or they're way too angsty. this story has not the overblown emo angst that is sadly too common in fanfic, but just the right amount of darkness to work very well. (damn you, keelywolfe, for making me want to read more sirius/remus, even tho i know most stories will make me headdesk. *goes to dig out previously rec'd sirius/remus story for rereading*)

30th-jan-2006 05:10 am - sga: humordepending on how long you've been online, you might have seen the list of the 213 things skippy is no longer allowed to do in the us army before (if not, read it, because it's damn funny). there are 2 sga versions of this list: a general one: 104 things skippy is no longer allowed to do in the pegasus galaxy, by 3jane. a zelenka-focussed one: 100 things zippy is not allowed to do in the pegasus galaxy, by spubbawarning: remove all drinks/cats/other easily scared creatures from your vincinity before reading these. (also, if you want to know what the goatse is that is references in the zelenka list: click here. very very nsfw. also, i'm not responsible for any mental trauma you suffer for clicking this link. i mean it. and you know i'm not easily squicked, and *that*? *ick*).

23rd-jan-2006 02:53 am - hp: harry, sirius, remus; also snape, tonks, draco, neville, padma (epic au)stealing harry (plus sequels: tales from the riverhouse, laocoon's children - just read down the page, or keep hitting 'previous entry' on the individual entries)this is a really epic au, and - in my opinion, at least *g* - one of the best aus out there, in terms of changing one little detail in the past, and then creating a whole new storyline, but still following the canon storyline of the books. in stealing harry, sirius took a wrong turn in 1981, and instead of sirius, it's lucius malfoy who was sentenced to azkaban. 8 years later, young harry comes into the bookstore that sirius own (and remus runs). it probably won't surprise you when i say that yes, he ends up living with them. the laocoon's children stories are about harry's years at hogwarts, and his adventures with his 3 best friends: neville, draco and padma. the re-writings are very well done, keeping the basic plot of the books, but fitting them to the new circumstances. despite the fact that there's slash in the story, i'd really recommend this to any gen fan as well, as the pairings are not really the focus of this story, although there is a heavy sirius/remus plot running through them all - but they are not the only pairing. i spent half of this weekend rereading all 3 stories, and it's a really great au to get lost in. i really hope there will be more stories, (the last 2 parts of laocoon's children ii aren't linked properly, but as of right now, they're the 2 latest entries in the sam_storyteller lj, so they're easy to find.tags:hp

10th-jan-2006 07:20 pm - admini've added some backdated recs that i had posted in my main lj. also, all entries are now tagged by fandom. this doesn't work for hp - tags only show the last 100 entries, and there's 200+ hp recs - but for all other fandoms, that should be helpful. for hp (and for those who find the fandom abbrevations confusing), you can use the memories to find what you want. i've changed the layout so that all tags are listed on the left: 60 fandoms. wow. hp is no longer my main fandom, so there'll be more recs in other fandoms. i make no guarantee for daily recs, but you'll get a few each week at least. checking out whether all links still work still needs to be done. i don't know when i'll have the time, but it'll happen eventually.

10th-jan-2006 07:13 pm - hng: akira/hikaruweird by insaneidiotakira is acting weird, and hikaru is on a quest to figure out why. waya is generally obnoxious and unhelpful. the rumour mill by harukamihikaru discovers that rumours about possible relationships between go rivals are common - and that there are such rumours about him and akira. wonderful clueless hikaru. also, kinda hot. *g*(assume spoilers for the whole manga for all stories)tags:hng

26th-dec-2005 09:49 am - yuletide recs iiitwin peaksblue velvet to moon river: this manages to capture the feeling and mood of the show brilliantly, and cooper and audrey are very in character. there's also a very well-done comparison between audrey and laura. highly recommended. sandmanthe ties that bind: utterly wonderful story featuring all of the endless, but especially destruction (and spun around orpheus). has some brilliant scenes. [delirium] gave despair a hug, too, since she was right there anyway. despair looked down shyly, not used to being touched or welcomed, but knowing again, for a brief moment, what delight was, and how its existence made her realm that much worse to those mired in it.petshop of horrors follow: what happened after the end of the manga: leon is looking for ddistant: goes au at the beginning of manga 10: leon and d exchange lettersi love both of them, and honestly can't decide which of them i prefer. both bring leon and d together, but in different ways. ***here's the quicksearch link that'll list all stories posted for 2005, sorted by fandom. now go read!tags:psoh, sandman, tp

26th-dec-2005 09:49 am - more yuletide recs iok, i spent all of today reading my way through the new yuletide stories (i'd guesstimate that i read about a third of the stories, possibly slightly more). there were *many* good ones, but the following are the ones that made me squee out loud: brimstonenot by bread alone: after zeke has completed his mission. so very nice, with a tiny crossover touch that's just the icing on the cake. the world needs more brimstone stories. calvin and hobbestransmogrification: because this is a brilliant version of growingup!calvin. and because the end is *bwha*.  biblethe night: because it's eve/lilith femmeslash, and because it's gorgeous, and *wow*. i love the way this is written around/twists the story that is in the bible. dogma questioning: very well-done 10-years-after story, with dead-on character voices. i think i'm pretty much going to consider this my own personal canon on what-happens-later. the priest that tastes the world: another story that made me *squee* madly - i adore metatron, and i've always wanted to read god/metatron, and here it is. it's brilliant, and funny, and it made me go a little bit "aww", too. the lion in winteron warm earth and cold stone: richard and phillip - in 1183, 1188 and 1180. anyone who hasn't seen the movie has to run and watch it now, btw.tags:bible, brimstone, calvin&hobbes, dogma, the lion in winter

25th-dec-2005 11:49 am - hp: merry smutmas recs (ss/hp, ss/filch, ron/draco)inspired by a hp story that totally sucked me in, i decided to give the merry_smutmas community a try, and found that yep, i'm still mostly fallen out of hp - i skimmed nearly every story, because i just couldn't get into them enough to feel a connection to the characters. that's always the problem once i've fallen out of a fandom that used to be a main fandom: only really really exceptionally stories will make me care about the characters. anyway... i found 4 stories that *did* pull me in: bound and determined: snape/harry. wasn't quite sure whether to rec this or not, because while enjoyable, it felt too rushed to me. i'd have liked this at about double the size - things just went too fast and too smoothly. still, it kept me sucked in enough that i read all of it without skimming, so i figure i'll rec it as well. nothing he ever wanted: snape/filch. very nicely done, and bonus-plus points for the pairing - i love snape/filch, but there are way too few stories for them. the story left me with a wide smile on my face.the fourth year: very entertaining, nicely long snape/harry. has some great quotes, wonderful details, very good characterization, great snapesnark. if you're a fan of this pairing at all, this should go on your 'must-read' list. sea change: draco/ron, set after hbp. works amazingly well. i've never been overly fond of ron (mostly, he bores me), but the author managed to make me like him a lot, and the setup makes the pairing believable. also, the sex scene is *hot*. i'd have liked for the story to go on a bit longer - i wanna know what happens next - but even so, it's a very very good read. i can't decide whether i like the fourth year or sea change better. so everyone should read both!tags:hp

24th-dec-2005 05:49 am - hp: snape/harryi more or less accidentally started reading hp again - accidentally because i saw someone's icon, and it looked very interesting: so i checked out her userinfo, and found that yes, it's an icon for a story of hers. the person in question is acid, and the story is 'price of magic', found in her memories. it's snape/harry, and it's *gorgeous*. when harry potter died, twin wands’ explosion wiped europe clean of magic. enchantment-free, gringotts collapsed into a mass grave for goblin bodies. pixie corpses covered the meadows. romanians buried their last dragon.wizards remained.thousands filled muggle streets with useless chanting, unable to return home through the wards.they had nothing left but pride.remember that when watching an elderly redheaded waitress trying to make a living, or her daughter taunted by uni lads for her strange ways of speaking. remember when passing your sallow-faced, somber neighbor who prefers candles to electricity or when finding an unexpected sky-blue twinkle under the matted hair of a homeless man.pride was the only reason they survived. i've always been a sucker for futurefic where magic has disappeared or at least been severely limited, and to find such a story, and have it be snape/harry, *and* have it be wonderfully in character... well, it was a very very nice christmas find. "look, all i know is, i have to bring magic back. i broke it and i have to fix it. you will have to help me, snape, one way or another.""i am not being needlessly contrary, potter, you just happen to be incorrect, irrelevant, and deceased. there isn’t a way."the only drawback is that it's still a wip. 8 of 20 parts are posted, and they're over 450k, so that's quite a bit of story to get your teeth into. i'm *so* looking forward to when the story is finished (it's going to be hell to stay away, because i want to wait 'til then i read any more of it). still, if you want something ss/hp, long, good, in-character, with a very interesting plot... *read this*.tags:hp

6th-aug-2004 08:47 pm - rk: kenshin/kaoruthe bridal discussion by riikitikitaviwhy is kaoru more nervous than the average bride?let's just say that megumi and stack full of shunga prints have something to do with it. poor kenshin. *snicker* it was a bit predictable, but otherwise, it's one of the very few k/k stories that i've found that was both in character, and well written - and not to mention fun. if you're never seen shunga before, here's some examplestags:rk

5th-aug-2004 04:34 pm - hp: harry/dracoleft my heart by emma grantpost-hogwarts. auror draco malfoy has disappeared, and harry potter has been sent to find him.this draco doesn't have any close resemblance to canon!draco, but what i did like about the story were all the details about various us law enforcement agencies (magical and muggle). and i really enjoyed harry's love for women. this is a good story, it's just... a bit further away from canon than i usually like. 22 parts, but they're all interlinked. i *hate* having to save fic from lj. either you copy into a textfile and lose all formatting, or you save the .html and end up with all the lj layout and all the comments. grrr.tags:hp

[*]spent the rest of the day looking at death-photography on thanatos.net. creepy day all around...tags:ats, the stand, xo

24th-jul-2004 02:31 pm - hp: crabbe/goyletea and crumpet by ellensmithee*grabs readers* no, no, don't run away. this isn't icky at all. really. promise. er. well, ok, it might be, but i just found it to be incredibly funny, and wonderfully in character. and it *works*.goyle's scowl slowly turned ferocious as he contemplated his problem. crabbe had been acting strangely around him recently. the biscuit in bed thing was just a further symptom of crabbe's mysterious ailment. sometimes he would watch goyle with an almost euphoric look on his face, astonishingly like the one he usually wore right before he dug into his favourite pudding.tags:hp
