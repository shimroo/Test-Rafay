 the image, video and multimedia systems lab (ivml) of the iccs in the ntua
 was established in 1989 - since then it has been gradually equipped with
 the necessary computer and general software and hardware for the analysis,
 processing and synthesis of images and video.
 

 in 1997, the greek secretariat of research and technology (gsrt) selected
 ivml, as a service providing lab in its field, to be funded in order to
 acquire and install professional audiovisual equipment and to implement
 its iso 9001 quality management plans.


 ivml became the first lab in the ece department and only the third
 in the ntua to obtain the iso 9001 certificate for the services it provides
 in the areas of digital image, video and multimedia processing.
