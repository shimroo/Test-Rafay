privacy - introduction
in this tou when we use the term "personal information", it means any information from which your identity is apparent or can be reasonably ascertained.  for most users, wētā does not collect any personal information.  we collect personal information only in connection with the recruitment part of our site (“recruitment information”).  the use of that information is described below. in all cases, we collect personal information only by explicitly asking for it on a web form.  (the exception is for "session cookies", which are used to track a visitor only during a single visit to this site.)

we are authorised, required or permitted by law to disclose the information.

recruitment information
we collect visitors recruitment information, such as their professional experience, etc., in order to assist us in finding and evaluating people who are interested in working at wētā.  this information is collected only via web form on pages where we explicitly ask for information.this information is used by wētā to consider expressions of interest, evaluate potential candidates, and more generally for personnel recruitment purposes.  this information is routinely circulated within wētā to people involved in our recruiting process, management, and to others who may be able to assist us in evaluating an applicant.
disclosure of recruitment information
