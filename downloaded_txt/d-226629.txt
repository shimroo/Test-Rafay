when it comes to nurse, we've been there, done that, now serving 252 tips in 16 categories ranging from best nursing schools to women´s health tips.











top 5 apps for nurses
there are more apps for nurses than we can count, so we've compiled a list of the top five apps that all nurses should have on their smartphones.
1. medscape on android or iphone
this app has thousands of results on drugs, diseases and images. the application has been highly anticipated in the medical world for its renowned use as a reference guide.
2. epocrates on android or iphone
the medical world changes fast. new findings are constantly being published, and new drugs pop up almost daily. this application compiles them all and is consistently updated to account for any new and useful information on drugs and disease.
3. evernote on android or iphone
despite not being specifically designed for the medical world, evernote is the best note taking app currently available. this app will be quite useful to any nurse who wants to take precise notes on the job.
4. eponyms on android or iphone
just as the name suggests, the app helps the user make references on medical eponyms. the understanding (and remembering!) of eponyms is vital in the medical realm. even the best nurse has a forgetful moment now and then.
5. pals advisor on iphone
this app offers medical advice that is clinically acceptable in certain situations. it is most useful during resuscitation, pediatric drug dosage and basic life support. this app will equip a nurse with trustworthy advice when it comes to assisting patients.

how to get the most out of a nurse's conference
 when you arrive at the conference, make sure you have dozens of copies of your business card ready to present. conferences are all about networking. 
things to do
 read and understand the conference agenda and pay attention to all that takes place during the conference. talk with other attendants. network your way through the conference, meeting as many people as possible. stay for the whole event. don't miss any interesting information that might be presented. take accommodation at the venue of the meeting /conference if possible to allow you to interact with other attendants of the conference. present as many business cards as possible during and after the conference. collect many cards as you possibly can, for future use or referencing. get any tape or video recordings of the conference. be active by asking questions and participating in any task required.

deciding on a practical nurse course?
in this day and age of economic hardship, the practical nurse remains a high demand job. finding the right practical nurse course only takes a little research as well as deciding what your schedule is able or willing to accommodate. 
 practical nurse courses are usually taught at technical schools and will last anywhere from nine months to perhaps a year and a half if you are going part time. most programs now offer evening classes and even part time classes for the working adult wanting to change fields to one with more job security.practical nurse courses generally require you to take an entrance exam and score a certain level in mathematics and english to get accepted into the program, technical schools do accept pell grants which, if qualified, will pay the entire cost of your tuition.
 you should enjoy working with people and have also an eye for detail because the practical nurse is often the only one seeing the patient, depending on the type of facility, and should be able to notice changes that may require she/he contact the dr or possibly the rn above them.
 practical nurses work in a variety of places, including hospitals, nursing homes, private duty cases, and through agencies visiting clients at home. they are also qualified in certain fields as telephone nurses, such as for large companies that offer employment assistance programs which include answers to basic health care question.
 no matter the practical nurse course one chooses, upon completion they will be eligible to take the lpn nclex to become licensed to practice and enter a high demand job field that offers job security.

operating room technique
all nurses have a general operating room technique whether you are a scrub nurse, theatre nurse or a circulating nurse. a scrub nurse scrubs into surgery, is positioned near the surgeon and hands needed instruments and surgical supplies during the procedure to the surgeon. this is a very important position during a surgery. the scrub nurse must work well with the surgeon and other operating staff and assist the surgeon in keeping the flow and rhythm of the procedure. a circulating nurse ensures that the surgical room, equipment and supplies and prepared, ready and available to the surgical staff. the circulating nurse is also responsible to represent the patient whom is unable to speak for him/herself if anything were to go in a manner that is not optimum for the patient. this position is also a very important position. without a circulating nurse, the surgical staff may run out of supplies, have an equipment failure, and use unsterilized instruments or other such situations. the circulating nurse is a little like a musical composer, they ensure things go as best as possible and the staff have everything they need to be successful. the theatre nurse is very well educated, trained and experience and is prepared to take the position and role of either the surgical or circulating nurse. this nurse is very versatile and may be placed in either position needing filled. to find free career advice on which nurse you would like to be, contact your local college for a free career placement assessment.

building a trusting nurse-patient relationship
the key to building a trusting nurse-patient relationship is based upon communication. the patient must see the nurse as someone that he or she can open up to with their concerns, and not feel judged. if the nurse portrays an uncaring or humorless demeanor, the patient may feel put off. frequently, the patient is under stress and by encountering a nurse who seems distant and uncaring can exacerbate their stress level. when first meeting the patient, the nurse should make sure to make eye contact and smile, while reaching out a hand to offer a warm handshake. by doing so, the patient will feel more inclined to discuss their feelings. in addition, the nurses's response to the patient's concerns should never be condescending, nor should the patient be made to feel "talked down to." nurses should address the patient's concerns as soon as possible. for example, if in a hospital setting, and the patient calls for the nurse, the nurse should respond as quickly as possible. this will build upon the trusting relationship, as the patient will be aware of the responsiveness of the nurse. also, the nurse should never hesitate to tell the patient that whatever they discuss, will be kept in strict confidence. by instilling trust and confidence, the nurse is able to reduce patient anxiety and create a more pleasant environment for both patient and caregiver, as this plays a significant role in the health of the patient.
