dot pk blog



this group blog is aggregating supposedly insightful comments on pakistani internet and it issues. authors are human (so do expect errors) and are mostly based in pakistan (which means that the comments and reporting is done from the 'battle-field'). it is only incidental that a good number of contributors to this blog also happened to contribute for the magazine spider which brought them together in the first place.

how i blog





for me, blogging began as a leisure and casual pursuit and now it has become part of my job, creative activity and part of my socialisation. we are still a less connected country of 165,803,560 people (according to the june 2006 estimates) with only a few bloggers, even though the users’ base is exponentially growing. read how i blog here.  the article originally appeared in dawn sci tech world.
