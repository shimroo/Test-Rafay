essential reading: from
chivalry to terrorism: war and the changing
nature of masculinity, by leo braudy in
this new book, braudy shows how the needs and technology of waging war
throughout history have been the prime determinants of social conventions,
specifically honor and masculinity.  it is an indispensable book for
anyone interested in understanding the current state of political conflict in
the united states today.  near the end, braudy quotes from an interview
with osama bin laden where he explains that even worse than having saudi arabia
defended by western soldiers, is the fact that some of those soldier/defenders
are women.  this is an impossible insult to saudi men in general and
moslem men in particular.(april
1, 2004) (not an april fools joke.)

what
is the institute of election analysis? the institute is devoted to the
scientific analysis of election results, as opposed to polling results. the
difference between ballots cast by voters and opinions given to pollsters is
that ballots are cast in secret and only by the people who really make the
political decisions, the actual voters.
since
1981, joshua leinsdorf has been doing systematic analyses of election results.
as a result of his research, he has discovered that many elections are, in
fact, rigged by the professional politicians. by just understanding a few
simple rules of election analysis, voters can interpret election results for
themselves and have a better understanding of both politics and governmental
policy.
