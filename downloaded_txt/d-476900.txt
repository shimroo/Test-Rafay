  “my wife and i think there is no better place to live in the west than in arrowcreek.  its’ beautiful setting in the hills of the carson range and the wonderful amenities we all enjoy make life in arrowcreek something special... oh, as a matter of fact, our oldest daughter and family live in arrowcreek only 2 blocks away from us.  what a great place to raise two young boys.”
