	 oblivion
	 
    


book #7 on my reading list this year was the short-story collection oblivion by david foster wallace.very good throughout and sometimes spectacular.  "the soul is not a smithy", "oblivion", "incarnations of burned children" and "good old neon" stood out to me as the best of the bunch.  the first story is both long and my least favorite, so if you're stymied by that one keep chugging.why i read this one?after thoroughly enjoying consider the lobster, i've resolved to work my way through all of dfw's catalog.labels: books, david foster wallace

	 and the hippos were boiled in their tanks
	 
    


book #6 on my reading list this year was and the hippos were boiled in their tanks, the so-called 'lost novel' from jack kerouac & william s. burroughs.the back-story on this one is unfortunately more interesting than the book itself.  kerouac and burroughs alternate chapters, taking a thinly fictionalized spin on lucien carr's stabbing of david kammerer.  a very early work for both authors, the writing is definitely not matured to the styles they would later become known for.  i actually found burroughs chapters to be pretty painful reading, not that kerouac's were much better.  this one is really only for hard-core beat fans.  gotta dig that title though.why i read this one?do you really need to ask?excerpt labels: books, kerouac

	 the best american non-required reading 2008
	 
    


book #5 on my reading list was the best american non-required reading 2008.last year's banrr was a big hit for me, so i came into this year with pretty high expectations.  unfortunately i didn't find this one nearly as compelling as last year.  there are still some winners sprinkled throughout, but the overall quality just isn't what i was hoping for.  i guess all those non-required authors had a down year last year.  the big winner for me by far was george saunders' excellent, excellent, excellent "bill clinton, public citizen".  laura van den berg's "where we must be" also stood out.why i read this onei'm a big fan of the series so picking this one up was a no-brainer.george saunders interviews bill clintonlabels: best american, books, george saunders

	 pimp
	 
    


i have fallen woefully behind on my book blogging again. will attempt to remedy that with some quickfire reviews of what i've been reading.book #4 on my reading list this year was iceberg slim's pimp: the story of my life. this is not surprisingly the "true" story of iceberg's life as a pimp. interesting factoid: did you know that iceberg slim has sold more books than any other african-american author except alex haley? look it up.why i read this one clearly because i'm big pimpin' spendin' g's. actually picked this one up because it's often referenced as one of the classics of underground-lit.iceberg on wikipedialabels: books
