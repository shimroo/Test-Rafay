what is the j.p. morgan corporate challenge?


the j.p. morgan corporate challenge is the world’s largest corporate running event. each year, events take place in 16 locations across eight countries and six continents with one mission: to serve as a catalyst between work and wellness. the series offers companies opportunities to bond over a shared experience powered by fitness, friendly competition, food and fun. one part run and one part party, each 3.5-mile / 5.6-kilometer road race connects participants with their colleagues as they celebrate teamwork, camaraderie and the corporate challenge community worldwide. from walkers to runners, from entry-level workers to seasoned employees, and from start-ups to large corporations – everyone is welcome.

how does it work?
the corporate challenge offers teams the opportunity to gather outside of work and enjoy the benefits of fitness, friendly competition and team celebration.
given the business-to-business nature of the event, companies participate by creating company teams. individuals cannot participate on their own. they must join their company team. each company designates at least one team captain to serve as a primary point of contact, responsible for communicating with their colleagues, encouraging registration, managing budgets (when applicable) and planning post-race hospitality experiences (when applicable).
