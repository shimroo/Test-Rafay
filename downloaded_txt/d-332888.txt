dietrich college faculty spotlight: john conlon



sds's cleotilde gonzalez and kevin jarbo, alongside hci’s geoff kaufman, developed moments@work, an innovative diversity training game. this game uses ai-powered "personality" bots to simulate workplace interactions, showing how unconscious bias can spread and influence behavior in social dynamics.



a new paper published in the journal science advances by assistant professor simon cullen and professor danny oppenheimer suggests that the key to boosting college students’ attendance and performance isn’t stricter rules, but more freedom.



camille chandler, a junior in psychology and decision science, was awarded the prestigious beinecke scholarship! she is only the third cmu student to receive this highly competitive honor since the scholarship began in 1975.
