about 



semisonic is a rock band from minneapolis, minnesota, consisting of dan wilson (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), john munson (bass, keyboards, backing vocals, guitar), and jacob slichter (drums, percussion, keyboards, backing vocals).born from the ashes of the influential twin cities band trip shakespeare in 1995, semisonic’s first commercial breakthrough arrived with the 1998 release of their sophomore album, ‘feeling strangely fine,’ which went platinum on the strength of its chart-topping lead single, “closing time.” nominated for a grammy, the track was a radio juggernaut that landed in countless film and television soundtracks and would come to define the sound of an entire decade of rock and roll.though the band never officially broke up, they parted ways in the early 2000s, remaining close and periodically reuniting for one-offs and charity performances over the years. in 2020, semisonic reunited to release their first music in 20 years – an ep entitled you’re not alone with a single of the same name.
