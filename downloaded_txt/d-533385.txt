research projects






















developing and deploying genomics technologies in support of cancer and life sciences research.
canada's michael smith genome sciences centre (gsc) at bc cancer is an international leader in genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics for precision medicine. by developing and deploying cutting-edge genome sequencing, computational and analytical technology, we are creating novel strategies to prevent and diagnose cancers and other diseases, uncovering new therapeutic targets and helping the world realize the social and economic benefits of genome science. 


technology platform




the gsc is available to support your research. we guide experimental design, facilitate the processing of complex biological samples and provide numerous sequencing and bioinformatic services with the aim of making genomics accessible to the international scientific community. explore our technology platforms and services, and if you have questions or would like to collaborate please fill out our contact form or speak directly with one of our platform leaders.
the gsc is iso27001 certified for information security management.




scientific research




the 16 faculty members at the gsc have a diverse range of expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, proteomics, epigenomics, immunogenetics, cancer biology, computer science and software development. together, we apply our knowledge to advance the global understanding of cancer and other diseases with an ultimate aim toward improving human health through disease prevention, the development of novel diagnostic strategies and by uncovering new therapeutic approaches, all the while helping the world to realize the social and economic benefits of genome research.




clinical programs




the gsc is unique in that it fosters close collaborations between scientists and clinicians, allowing for an unencumbered focus on direct translational research. through the personalized oncogenomics (pog) program, the gsc deploys whole genome and transcriptome sequencing to inform therapeutic and management strategies for late-stage cancer patients in real time. the gsc is also certified by the college of american pathologists (cap) and the diagnostic accreditation program (dap) to perform clinical genomic panel testing.
