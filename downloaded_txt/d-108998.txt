welcome to morro bay



























morro bay is a seaside getaway located right off scenic highway 1 on the central coast of california. more than that, it’s a backdrop for the perfect coastal adventure.
the centerpiece of this coastal haven? morro rock— a volcanic monolith rising from the depths of the sea. this rock has guided generations of fish captains home, their holds brimming with the freshest california catch. it peels off perfect central coast waves, delighting surfers and young whitewash adventurers alike. it’s a salt-rimmed beacon, the guardian of fresh oyster beds, home to seals and sea birds.
through all that chatter, one thing is certain: if morro rock could talk, it would tell you to come get salty in morro bay.
