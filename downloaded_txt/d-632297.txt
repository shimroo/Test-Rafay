water and stone






so i've knitted something again. and finished it. this time it's not my own design, but the genious water & stone by veera välimäki. so we went somewhere with both water and stones to photograph it. too bad the evening was a bit far along and it was difficult to catch the light just right...

as per usual, you may click the photos to see a bigger version.

this is the most luxurious thing i ever knitted. the yarn is the fabulous scrumptious high twist dk from fyberspates. a silk merino blend with a heavy drape. it actually feels like water on your skin wearing it.

the design is phenomenal. knitted from the top down in one piece, with the same cable repeated in three different ways along one front edge, in one side and slightly to the left down the back. simple but pretty and well thought out.

i might have to take some daylight photos of it some other day.

please notice my new necklace. a find from etsy that arrived just today. cute huh?

well... that's it really. i'm quite proud of it, so please only say nice things in the comments! ;)

i knitted a rainbow





i present: the rainbow.

when you need something colorful (i have four grey projects going on), you can always turn to easyknits.

loosley based on the pattern ripples, but i ran out of pattern in the purple section so i improvised enlarging it. approximately when the pattern called for a red stripe... i switched colors. 
the yarn is easyknits, deeply wicked little guys spectrum. ten mini skeins that together form a spectrum.

i got some leftovers from the first three mini-skeins, but i think i've used about 170 grams of the 200 i had. so. very. colorful.







like always when trying to take photos... all the pets come running to join in the fun!

another offe







i knitted another one of my own offe. i totally wore out the old one, and one needs a colorful short cardi in one's wardrobe! 

i used 1 (one!) zauberball stärke and 125 grams of black visjögarn.

unravel





again... i go abroad and i realise how much i love my international network of old and new friends! that means i should try and keep this english blog updated too, but it has fallen behind.

in a slideshow at google, i have tried to sum up some impressions from the weekend past at unravel, in farnham surrey.

rotor 





it is done. rotor is released. 
this is a cog in my design machinery.




it started with machines. cogs, metal, hard, mechanic. 

this hard inspiration met my love of yarn and the construction, the mechanics, the maths of knitting.
as per usual, i landed in the knit stitch. our cog in the machinery.
knit and purl being the same thing, but yet so different. it’s all about what side you turn outwards.



the shawl is reversible and beautiful however you wrap it around you. from the inside out. all the way out to the lace. the cogs.

rotor is knit from the middle and outwards. it features details like “reversible middle stitches”, i-cord tab cast on and i-cord edges. the panels of stockinette stitch alter, adding purlsides and knitsides to both sides.
if you choose to use another yarn, i would recommend solids to semisolids and variegated, but i would stay away from the self striping for this one…



i am immensly proud of this shawl. not only of its very architectural design process and the details i've worked so hard on, but of the collaborations it has generated. easyknits has dyed the spectacular deeply wicked yarn in metallic inspired colors just for rotor. the prototype is knit in "copper petina". 

the pictures were taken at bäreberg junk yard. one of my favorite places on earth - filled with metallic scraps.

bjomal






this blog is embarrassing... i keep updating in swedish, while this blog is left hopelessly behind.
however - big knitting news! a new pattern is out! i designed a cable to teach basic cabling techniques and it turned out well, so i put it on a toque.
the cable in itself would look good added to almost whatever, and i can't wait to see some modded projects with it! but here's a link to the toque pattern on ravelry! say hello to bjomal!


cable away!
