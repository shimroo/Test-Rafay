about usthe mission of the border collie society of america (bcsa) is to preserve and enhance the integrity of the border collie through promoting responsible breeding and ownership, to preserve the working attributes and intelligence of the breed, to prevent exploitation and abuse of the breed, and promote a spirit of encouragement and learning for the membership in all border collie activities, including but not limited to: herding, obedience, agility, conformation, tracking, companion dogs, flyball, and therapy dogs.

herding



border collies herd because their bodies and minds have been specifically crafted for the task. these dogs are amazing herding machines who are naturally drawn to chasing and controlling movements of animals. many dog owners bring border collies into their homes without realizing what these dogs were bred for and why they behave in certain ways.






































agility



border collies are perfect for agility courses and love the physical and mental challenge. agility courses involve a large variety of obstacles which challenge the dog’s fitness, athleticism, courage, and obedience… but above all, it is meant to be fun.


























rally



(or ‘rally o’ in the usa) is a great sport for your border collie. this sport comes from the heelwork elements of competitive obedience. it differs from obedience mostly in that competitors and dogs attempt a pre-set course in which signs are placed at up to 15 stations (level 1) along the course. this is a mentally challenging but moderate sport to enjoy you’re your border collie with maybe a jog step or two, really great for the border collies mind!


























disc dog



disc dog challenges are a great way to burn excess energy and keep your dog excited to play games. in disc dog, you and your border collie will work as team with you throwing the disc and your dog catching it.
















welcome to the new border collie society of america website!
