pasco scientific has been an innovator in science education and science lab equipment for over 60 years.

			what began as a science fair project has become a trusted source for 
			high quality school laboratory equipment in the united states and around the globe.
			we carry lab supplies for your physics classroom and chemistry lab, as well as supplies for biology, life science, engineering, and environmental science. request a catalog!
		

			for the educational physics lab we invented carts and tracks, which are now standard teaching tools used worldwide. our technology leadership continues with the award-winning 
			smart cart, which removes the wires while providing new ways to study kinematics on and off the track. we also carry just about all laboratory supplies, from rods, clamps, and 
			ohaus balances to mass and hanger sets and laboratory glassware. see our full offering of lab supplies.
		

			for the chemistry lab we have the equipment you need: test tubes, ring stands, ph meters, digital microscopes, and much more. we also have test kits for environmental sciences and science 
			kits for electricity, waves, machines, and more.
