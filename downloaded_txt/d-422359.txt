you can't heal it,
if you don't reveal it.
i've been a storyteller all my life, and i believe sharing where we been,  where we're going and how we feel about the journey is essential to making it through .  it's  common thread of  humanity that allows us to find the strength in vulnerability.  healing only  happens when we give voice to our hurts and fears and when we can dare to say them out loud. at a certain point in my life i knew it was time for me to "stop achieving and start receiving".  part of that includes revealing my truth and receiving input and support from others.  how  'bout you? does that resonate with you?





empowering you to live life with happiness
"older is the new brave".   i don't want to be part of the aging invisibility syndrome that grips our culture and neither do you!  i'm a happy, powerful woman in her third act of life. i'm counting my blessings and not my stretch marks.   let's own our current part of the path and stop comparing where others are in the journey.
