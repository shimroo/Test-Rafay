about us





 



we are the uk’s only down’s syndrome research charity. our vision is a long, healthy, happy life for people with down’s syndrome (ds) and their families. the foundation is a charity born out of a parent’s love and a passion for the very best evidence-based interventions.

i’m thrilled that there is a non-biased, independent research group available providing clear & up to date info to our community. thank you dsrf for being there for our families!






…they continually aim to improve the quality of lives of our children. they have an unparalleled wealth of knowledge and experience coupled with a determination to see children and adults with ds live their lives to the fullest! highly recommend these guys and the amazing work they do!








we understand
we understand the challenges that people with ds can face with their health, life expectancy and quality of life. however, we believe people with ds are part of a diverse and exciting group and we are yet to discover the true depths of their potential.
