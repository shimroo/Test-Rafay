five reasons you should still hire movers when moving locally 

moving from one home to another, whether cross country or locally, is no easy task. there is a ton of paperwork to sign, lots of boxes to pack, and many hours of cleaning to do. and then there is all the heavy furniture that must be hauled off. usually, most people attempt to do the work themselves though, especially if they are moving to a location that is near the same city in which they currently reside. but there are five great reasons to hire a moving company to handle the process instead.
reliable moving help
trying to convince your friends and family members to give up their leisure time to help you move is often difficult since it isn’t something that most people enjoy doing. so they may attempt to get out of the work at the last minute. this experience is both frustrating and extremely inconvenient, especially if you were counting on them to help you with your largest pieces of furniture. when you hire a moving company, they will show up right at the scheduled time that they are supposed to be there though.
no need to lift heavy furniture
a moving company will transport all of your furniture and possessions to your new home for you, so you don’t have to worry about how you are going to carry your couches, beds, and other large items. having someone else to do the heavy lifting is especially convenient for those who live alone or have a health condition that makes lifting more than a few pounds very difficult.
less moving time
when you are trying to use friends and family members to help you move, the process is often drug out over several weeks because they can only get so much work done at a time. on top of this, they often have to borrow trucks and trailers that have a minimal amount of space in them. so it takes many trips back and forth to be able to take everything. moving companies have large, spacious trucks and a whole crew of employees that speed the process up significantly though. they can often get everything transported in just one day for people who are moving locally.
less risk of damage to your possessions
professional movers are trained in moving techniques that prevent furniture and other household items from being damaged. according to cheap denver movers, they also carry special blankets, pads, boxes, and other shipping products that can be used to protect all your valuables until you’re ready to unpack them. but just in case anything does happen to be broken, many of them offer insurance to help cover the cost of replacing or repairing the item.
safer moving process
if you have friends and family members with a limited amount of experience carrying heavy items, injury is a risk during the moving process. and they may expect you to cover the cost of any medical care that they may require as a result of them helping you. so, it is much safer and cheaper if you hire an experienced moving company instead.

7 ways to involve kids when organizing and packing for a move 

moving can be stressful at the best of times, and kids aren’t exempt from feeling that anxiety. it’s easy to park a child in front of the television or leave their room until last to keep them occupied. however, involving your kids in as many aspects of the move as possible can help not only their worries about it, but it might even provide a bonding activity for the entire family. here are seven tips on how to involve your children in the moving process from professional denver movers.
1. looking for home
kids can participate right from the outset. give them the opportunity for a voice in where they might spend many years of their lives. when searching for a house or apartment, allow your children to peruse the listings. set up a list of places that are acceptable to the adults in the family and sit down with the kids. listening to their opinions can go a long way toward how they feel about their changing environment, as well as provide them with pride in their new home.
2. kitchen duty
once the grown-ups have packed up everything breakable or sharp, let the kids handle the rest of the kitchen. give them boxes and packing materials and let them tackle it. dealing with the fridge and pantry doesn’t have to be a big job. show your children how to find expiration dates, give them a garbage bin for expired goods, and let them place unopened and in-date food in a box for donation to your local food bank.
3. donate instead of trashing
one of the best things about moving is getting to weed out what you don’t want to take. involving kids in this not only helps to separate the keep pile from the toss pile, but it can provide them with a lesson in giving. have them spend some time choosing which toys and clothing they treasure and want to take along and put the rest in boxes for donation. just be careful not to force separation from any belongings at this point. it’s a good idea, as well, for an adult to have a look in these donation boxes before they go off to their new owners.
4. labeling boxes
for children who can read and write, labeling the moving boxes is an ideal task. provide them with markers and sticker packs and have them label which rooms boxes belong to at your destination, giving carte blanche to draw and sticker to their heart’s content. delegating this task might not be a huge time-saver, but it’s excellent for keeping the kids out of your hair if you need it.
5. cleaning
you can give even smaller tots the tasks of picking up paper and bits of trash that inevitably end up scattered in the course of packing. tweens can easily wipe down surfaces and walls, as well as sweep up debris left behind. older kids can vacuum, mop, or clean leftover grime out of appliances that don’t require cleaning chemicals. leave anything potentially toxic to the grown-ups.
6. thinking about the future
when nerves start to get a little jangled in the more immediate face of leaving what used to be home, it’s important to direct kids toward where you’re going. let them know it’s okay to be sad to leave the old place and friends behind, but also nudge them toward thinking of the good things ahead. one way to get children excited is letting them draw out plans for their new rooms. this activity encourages them to think of their old things in new ways, helping to get them excited about where they’re going instead of being anxious.
7. unpacking
kids are wonderful unpackers. once you have the furniture and boxes in their respective rooms, let the children open some up and put things away. their rooms are the perfect starting place. if they finish, give them a bathroom to set up or provide a safe kitchen box to unpack. it doesn’t matter if the spoons are in the correct drawer right away. what’s important is turning your new house or apartment into a home, and letting your kids help set things to rights can help to accomplish that.
