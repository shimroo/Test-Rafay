thursday, august 31, 2006>i know i haven't blogged for almost 2 months but today, i must blog bcs .. it's teachers' day eve. though this year is the most boring bcs mr chow only allowed so little groups to perform, it's still the best. izzah & i came to school, rush to get ready bcs performance started half an hour earlier. then we ran here & there to help my mum & dad. so many things to do all in a day & i wasn't even sure of the schedule. that was what made it fun. every song that was played, we either sang or shaked to it. it would have been much more fun if nadya & shasha joined us but they did support us so much so.. thanks darlings !! love ya ! hehe. my dad sang 2 songs & i'm glad that he wasn't that nervous. i shouted like hell & now i got this sore throat feeling. now i have to drink lots of water. haiyoo. my hand's so tired due to carrying the flower thingy too. but u know what, all this kecoh-ness was fun. extremely fun. even the finale wasn't planned. we just came out from backstage & joined shahidah, afiq & the teachers.well, i have to go now. take care everyone !`nadia___# posted by nadia at
