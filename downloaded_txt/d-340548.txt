											what's a recipe for homemade dry shampoo?
									 	

homemade dry shampoo
when regular shampooing is impossible, dry shampoo can work just as well as cleaning hair and absorbing the oil. make your own dry shampoo by mixing together 1 tablespoon salt and 1/2 cup cornmeal. mix the ingredients together in a large bowl and then transfer into a large holed salt shaker. lightly sprinkle it on dirty, oily hair and brush out the dirt and grime! baby power or cornstarch can also be used as dry shampoos.

											what is an inexpensive and natural way to remove calluses on feet?
									 	

vinegar and baking soda foot bath
tired of having dry, calloused feet? a simple foot bath of vinegar and baking soda can help! fill a large container or foot spa with warm water. add three cups white vinegar to the water. place your feet in the mixture and immediately add one cup of baking soda to the mix. allow your feet to soak for thirty minutes or until the skin starts to soften. finish removing the dead skin and callouses with a pumice stone or other pedicure tools. (these are usually available at your local drug store for only a few dollars.) if desired, add essential oils in your favorite scents to create a soothing experience. (lavender, citrus, and other aromas work great!) when finished, dry your feet with a warmed towel.
