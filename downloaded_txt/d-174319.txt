recent press“jeremy o. harris and maia novi are invading downtown theatre”, paper magazine, jeremy o. harris “i just want to shout out the tank right now, because every major incubator for new writers in new york city is gone. the cherry lane theater got bought by a24. who knows what they're gonna do with it. there was another amazing writers group that would meet weekly, that no longer exists. but the tank is still existing and making sure that young writers and directors can have a place to practice their work. and that's really, really affirming”jeryl brunner, “for 17 years this nonprofit theater company has helped launch careers of oscar and pulitzer prize nominees” forbes“enter the tank. for the past 17 years this nonprofit arts center has been a go to spot for emerging artists to experiment and share their work.” karen thorla, “building an invisible theater” brooklyn rail“right now artists are coming together to try to support us because they know what this means, but i also think we’re trying to come together to support them.”
