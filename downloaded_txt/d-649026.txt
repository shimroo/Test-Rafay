our missionin 1993 local volunteers began building trails on land that is part of the cross florida greenways. consisting of 85,000 acres stretching from the atlantic coast to the gulf of mexico, the greenways is the state of florida's crown jewel for outdoor recreation. today there are over 85 miles of trails with riding levels for everyone, from children to seniors. from flat and smooth, to challenging climbs through the rocky quarries, to 20' drops for the adrenaline junkies. santos trails have been known for years by all that have ridden there as having something for everyone!
the ocala mountain bike association has strived to not only provide an enjoyable and challenging riding experience, they have also dedicated themselves to offering social and educational activities that give everyone the opportunity to participate, make new friends and, advance your riding abilities.
