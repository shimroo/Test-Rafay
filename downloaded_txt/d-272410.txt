rediscovered
        shooting treasures

antique and contempary

reproductions
        of classic original factory firearm manuals, instructions, boxes and 
       hang tags

in business since 1999

       dress up that collection with reprints of the original factory 
       instruction manuals and hang tags for enhanced display quality and 
       much needed information as the factory wanted it presented to the 
       owner. many have hard to find parts diagrams and parts lists as well 
       as disassembly / reassembly instruction and proper cleaning 
       information along with safety and operation instructions.





 

 

 

 

 

 



 























 

 


 

all of my items are done from 
       never copyrighted originals. i only do pre-1978 items as that is the 
       year that automatic copyrights went into affect. thus all my items 
       are legally made from public domain originals under the law.

if you have specific 
       informational needs from a manual please email me and i will let you 
       know if it is covered in my item(s).

thank you!
