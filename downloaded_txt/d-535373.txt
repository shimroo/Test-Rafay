enjoy a wonderful day in new england’s wine country.our family’s vineyard is located in coastal westport massachusetts where we have been growing vinifera grapes since 1986. the atlantic northeast’s cool maritime climate and our farm’s rich soils layered with granite over glacial outwash consistently provide us with a balance of luscious fruit and bright acidity at harvest.

 










taste & tourvisit our tasting bar, take a tour, or simply sit on the lawn and enjoy the view.














vineyard eventsthough out the season the vineyard hosts many events including our annual sunset music festival series.
















our storyfor four generations we have been passionate about our farm, soil and sunlight that join together in our ripening grapes. our great unexplored territory, massachusetts’ grown wine, is a blank canvas begging for exploration and creativity.

“between the landscape and the wines, we were convinced we were in europe”

— new york times













at the heart of our mission is the russell family’s belief that we are stewards of both land and possessions; that these are not truly owned, but rather are temporarily gifted and to be used in a fashion honoring those who came before and those who follow afterward. 


















supporting small farmers is one of the best ways to help our environment and our economy.
