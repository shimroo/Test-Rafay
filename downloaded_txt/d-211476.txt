from april 1, 2019 ascas activity is temporarily suspended  and no new membership is accepted
           about us and membership
        this is a free association between collectors and lovers of antique silver.        
        we have two aims: to promote friendship between our members and to 
        spread knowledge of antique silver items, their hallmarks and their 
        workmanship techniques.
        the association carries out its activity on the internet within this 
        website http://www.ascasonline.org . its objectives are to host articles 
        supplied by members on matters of common interest, to report links to 
        websites related to silver and its hallmarks and to devote some pages to 
        illustrate the most interesting pieces owned by our members (photos and 
        a brief description will be sufficient. the page will be created by our 
        staff: 
        click here to see a sample page supplied by our secretary). 
        our invitation is addressed to all private collectors and keen lovers of 
        antique silver. professional dealers may join the ascas as collectors or 
        for private interest on antique silver, but our website has no link with 
        commercial firms or advertising objectives.
        membership is absolutely free, but the association reserves the right to 
        evaluate the requests for admission of its members. the request may be 
        submitted by addressing an e-mail to
                
        silverassociation@yahoo.it  with the following information:
        - given name and family name (name and surname)
        - city/town and country (not full address)
        - email address (you will receive only non commercial 
        communications strictly related to your membership)
