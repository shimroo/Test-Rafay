what people are saying



great day-cation spot“… hilltop orchards made sure me and my friends had the best new year’s eve day! we enjoyed waking the beautiful trails, and ended up browsing their amazing wine and cider selection by the fire. the area indoors is spacious and great for social distancing. i cannot wait to come back and enjoy all they have to offer!— tripadvisor.com (december 2020)



great cider & great people!“hilltop was an amazing, quaint place to spend nye. fresh cider donuts, great hiking trails through the orchard and even better wine/cider. sara was more than helpful with helping us plan our whole day and was extremely welcoming! i will be back to enjoy this beautiful place!”— tripadvisor.com (december 2020)



enjoying the berkshires“i've been coming to furnace brook winery for 10 years and i always enjoy my time there between the wine tastings excellent service and peace and quiet enjoying the views i can't ask for more. sara and david are so nice and they are accommodating and very suggestive on what kind of wine they have and will always leave with a smile. coming from massachusetts so it's an hour drive worth every moment driving up there just to get a cider donut some warm fresh pies and a great wine…”— tripadvisor.com (november 2020)
