epsilon systems wins two rtx premier awards for 2023 performance
san diego, ca (may 22, 2024) – epsilon systems is pleased to announce that rtx has recognized epsilon
                  systems’ advanced products-west (ap-west) and epsilon c5i each with a premier award for performance
                  in 2023 and overall excellence in business management and collaboration & customer service. epsilon
                  systems and epsilon c5i are suppliers of rtx’s raytheon and collins aerospace. rtx is a leading
                  aerospace and defense company.
the premier award is an annual recognition platform under the rtx performance+ program to recognize
                  suppliers with superior performance and that have provided exceptional value to rtx in one of the four
                  key categories: cost competitiveness, technology & innovation, business management, and collaboration
                  & customer service.
“we are truly honored to receive this prestigious award and look forward to continuing our successful
                  partnership with rtx in the future,” said ron klein, vice president of epsilon systems advanced productswest (ap-west), which supplies rugged flat panel displays (rfpd) to raytheon. “receiving the rtx
                  premier award is not just a testament to our team's hard work, but also a reflection of our commitment to
                  delivering excellence in every aspect of our business. this recognition underscores our dedication to
                  pushing the boundaries of service and collaboration, ultimately enhancing the value we bring to rtx and
                  its customers.”
“we're proud to have consistently delivered outstanding performance, not only in 2023, but also in the
                  previous year, when we first won the premier award,” said steve martin, vice president of epsilon c5i.
                  “our success is a result of the contributions of every member of our team, especially those involved in the
                  collins aerospace cooperative engagement capability (cec) program in largo, florida. this award speaks
                  volumes about our team’s resolve to continue exceeding expectations in our partnership with rtx."
