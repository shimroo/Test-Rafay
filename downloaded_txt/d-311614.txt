biospheric sciences








biospheric sciences laboratory studies terrestrial ecosystems and their interactions with the atmosphere using multiscale remote sensing, modeling, and advanced analytical techniques. specifically:

develops and utilizes satellite remote sensing, aircraft and ground instruments to measure variables that describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of natural ecosystems as well as human impacts on these systems, especially the vegetation condition (e.g., land cover, height, biomass, photosynthetic capacity), soils (e.g., soil condition and type), and links to atmospheric constituents (e.g., aerosols, co2;
develops mathematical models that use space-borne, airborne and ground observations to predict land surface conditions and processes related to rates of vegetation, soil, and atmosphere exchanges (e.g., radiation, heat, water, greenhouse gases, net primary productivity);
acquires, produces, and distributes comprehensive, integrated land data sets incorporating ground, airborne, and/or satellite observations to facilitate model development and validation;
ensures the scientific integrity of new earth remote sensing systems to improve space-based earth observation; and
performs research which leads to the definition and development of new technologies, sensors, and missions. through the above activities, assesses and predicts environmental changes due to natural and anthropogenic processes at local to global scales.

instruments









ecosar


ecosar is an advanced airborne polarimetric and interferometric p-band (435 mhz) sar instrument in development at nasa/goddard space flight center through the 2010 esto instrument incubator program (iip). the aim of ecosar is to provide two- and three dimensional fine scale measurements of terrestrial ecosystem structure and biomass.
