why study molecules?
just as the 20th century was marked by the development of electricity, telephones, aviation, computing, and private motor vehicles, the 21st century will be marked by significant progress in a broad spectrum of technologies, among them: molecular computing, genomics, rational drug design, and alternative energy. what will be common to all these new technologies?
they will all be possible because of a greater understanding of the world of molecules.

fentanyl molecule -- one of the most dangerous drugs 
the high potency of fentanyl greatly increases risk of overdose, especially if a person who uses drugs is unaware that a powder or pill contains it. they can underestimate the dose of opioids they are taking, resulting in overdose. two milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal depending on a personâs body size, tolerance and past usage.  dea analysis has found counterfeit pills ranging from .02 to 5.1 milligrams (more than twice the lethal dose) of fentanyl per tablet.     42% of pills tested for fentanyl contained at least 2 mg of fentanyl, considered a potentially lethal dose. read more-- see molecule in 3d
 












naloxone  molecule -- -(narcan) -- saves lives
naloxone (narcan) is a medicine that can be given to a person to reverse a fentanyl overdose. naloxone is a lipophilic compound that acts as a non-selective and competitive opioid receptor antagonist. naloxone knocks opioids off their receptors in the brainstem. naloxone can restore the drive to breathe, and save a life. but even if naloxone is successful, opioids are still floating around, so expert medical care should be sought as soon as possible.--note: naloxone works for 30-90 minutes before the opioids return to their receptors. read more - see molecule in 3d.
