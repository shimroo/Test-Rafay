hawaii is the melting pot of cuisines 

hawaii is home to many different type of restaurants.  while rest of the country is being taken over by franchises and chain restaurants, hawaii is home to many mom and pop restaurants including many hole in the wall restaurants – they call it puka (hole) here.
if you are looking to try various cuisines, hawaii is a perfect place for it, because this is where various cultures melt here in the middle of the pacific.  a lot of asian cultures settle here and mix.  also, historically european influences have been introduced to the food and you will see unique combination of food here. 
with many foodies all over the island, you won’t be disappointed with the food here.  with so many places to travel and visit with wonderful views, food will definitely be a great additional to your trip to hawaii.
