what better personifies a wedding in paradise than a barefoot wedding on the beach at sunset?get married with your toes in the white sand of florida's subtropical beaches. 







(941)952-1440sarasota and manatee counties are located on the west coast of florida, just south of tampa. our suncoast islands include anna maria island, longboat key, lido key, siesta key, casey key, and manasota key.  we specialize in florida beach weddings, offering beautifully customized wedding ceremonies at area locations including bradenton beach, holmes beach, coquina beach, crescent beach, and venice beach.  if you'd rather a different venue, you can exchange your vows in a garden, park, resort, hotel, country club, museum, restaurant, on a boat, or even your backyard.  i look forward to making your wedding dreams come true.   whether you're planning an elopement, a large wedding, or a vow renewal, i customize each ceremony to the couple. if either of you have children, they can be mentioned by name and (if present) participate in a family unity ceremony -- small children especially like this. you can have a ceremony that is totally nonreligious or as religious as you like. you may write your own vows -- or even the whole ceremony -- i'm flexible. i'll just make sure it meets state of florida requirements to be legal.my fee includes prep time; a couple of tip sheets for planning your ceremony; a decorative certificate; a keepsake copy of your customized ceremony (the booklet from which i'd read); and the unity sand celebration (you get to keep the container of your blended sand). because the fee also includes my travel time, it varies by location. a rehearsal would be additional because not everyone requires one. "a marriage license and an officiant are the only things the two of you must have. but, if you want more --  i can help you with selecting venues and other vendors.  having been in the business locally for many years, i have all the connections you could need."nancy j taussig, civil wedding officiant
