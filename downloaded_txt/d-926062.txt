chocolate sauce, take a dip


george hirsch
february 13, 2025





this is one of those sauces that must be in every chef's repertoire. it's a classic. in a matter of minutes, you can turn a simple sweet into chocolate decadence. so set aside the guilt and go ahead - dip, drizzle, and dunk your way through fresh strawberries, ice cream, and cake. 













one study has shown that the smell of chocolate may relax you by increasing theta waves in the brain. yes, we all have them.does chocolate contain any nutrients? yes, it does, in small amounts. a 1.5-ounce milk chocolate bar contains recommended daily values of the following vitamins and minerals: • 3 grams of protein • 15% of the daily value of riboflavin • 9% of the daily value of calcium • 7% of the daily value of ironwhen choosing chocolate, look for a shiny finish, which is a sign that the chocolate was heated at the right temperature for the right amount of time. also, look for a crispy snap when chocolate is broken into pieces. choose a good chocolate for a sauce like lindt, callebaut, or scharffen berger. in a pinch, chocolate chips will do. this very decadent sauce is ideally served with fresh strawberries. note: this chocolate sauce recipe is not ideal for coating dipped strawberries. chocolate sauce recipe below

deviled eggs


georgehirsch
february  8, 2025





they have a long history, dating back to ancient rome, and were called ovis apalis. these dressed eggs or stuffed eggs were seasoned eggs flavored with spicy sauces and served as a meal starter. hard-cooked eggs were so popular with the romans that they would say “ab ova usque ad mala,” meaning “eggs to apples,” from the beginning of the meal to finish with the apples at the end.













the name deviled implies hot but need not be. it is simply hard-boiled eggs chilled and halved with the yolk whipped into a flavorful filling of various flavors such as mayonnaise, sour cream, yogurt, dijon mustard, etc. spice it up with cayenne, hot sauce, or wasabi. add fresh herbs like dill, cilantro, or chives; it's a nice touch. 













make special occasion up-end garnishes such as chopped prosciutto, crisp chopped pancetta, or with a sliver of smoked salmon, sour cream, and caviar. the name deviled implies hot but need not be.

chicken chipotle tostada


george hirsch
february  7, 2025





much like an open-faced sandwich or pizza, tostadas usually have a base of corn, sometimes flour tortillas that are toasted, usually by frying in oil, but can also be toasted on a grill or griddle, resulting in easier preparation and a much healthier version without sacrificing taste. what makes for great-tasting tostadas is the toppings with a variety of flavorful condiments such as beans, cheese, crema fresca (somewhat like crème fraîche), sour cream, chopped cabbage, or lettuce, sweet onions, jalapeños, guacamole, and salsa.

george’s double chocolate brownies


george hirsch
february  4, 2025





know your cookie:a brownie is a sheet cookie, as its soft batter spreads across a sheet-like pan to bake. other types of sheet cookies include blondies and rainbow cookies. after sheet cookies are baked, they can be cut into squares, rectangles, or any other shape when cool. this is an often requested recipe from george hirsch lifestyle. it is ideal for every occasion. enjoy it as is, or upgrade it by topping it with your favorite ice cream. the brownie derives its character from a deep, rich cocoa base for the chocolate flavor.















did you know chocolate is a winter mood booster?  dark chocolate contains the amino acid tryptophan, a well-recognized serotonin producer. it’s also one of the best food sources of magnesium, an essential mineral that allows the body to relax. a one-ounce serving of dark chocolate contains 64 mg of magnesium. that’s 16% of the recommended daily intake. add to that an abundance of other essential minerals, antioxidants, flavanols, and prebiotic fiber—all of which make us feel better in more ways than one.chefgeorgehirsch.com | george hirsch lifestyle makes 12-18 brownies2 cups all-purpose flour1/2 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon salt1/2 pound (2 sticks) of sweet butter, softened at room temperature2 cups granulated sugar4 eggs, beaten1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 1/2 cups chopped pecans or walnuts1 1/2 cups semisweet chopped chocolate pieces; or chocolate, or butterscotch chipspreheat the oven to 350 degrees. grease and flour an 8 x 12 x 2-inch baking pan and line it with a parchment paper baking sheet. in a small bowl, mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt well. set aside.cream butter in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. add granulated sugar and cream on high speed for 2 minutes, until light and fluffy. on a low speed, add vanilla and eggs, one at a time, stopping the machine from scraping down the bowl well after each addition. on a low speed, add flour and cocoa powder to the butter mixture and mix just until flour is absorbed. do not over-mix. by hand, fold the pecans and chocolate in with a rubber spatula.optional: if using coconut, mix 3/4 of coconut with pecans and chocolate. using a spatula, spread the batter into a baking pan, making sure the batter is spread evenly and smooth. bake for 25-30 minutes. caution to not overbake. brownies are baked when pressed. the cake springs back when pressed lightly with your finger, or a toothpick comes out clean. cool in the pan for 2 hours, and cut the brownies into rectangle or square pieces.
