welcome to burpham primary school









welcome to our website. alongside day-to-day information, you will find examples of children’s work and photographs of what we do.
burpham primary school is a primary school for children between the ages of four and eleven with a specialist centre for children with communication and interaction needs (coin).  our school opened in 1908 and we are a two form entry school. we joined the learning partners multi academy trust on 1st september 2023.
we aspire to help every child in our care to develop as a whole person, becoming confident, happy, independent, creative and adaptable; to love learning and achieve more than they ever thought possible.  our experienced and well-established teaching team have high expectations and aspirations for all our pupils and we never stop trying to find new ways of promoting learning and making improvements to our school.
we firmly believe that knowing every child as an individual is vital to success.  we believe that everybody should feel safe and that every child has individual strengths which should be recognised and celebrated.   when considering burpham primary, you are very welcome to visit the school and to see us at work and play.  please contact us to arrange a visit or to find out any other information.
