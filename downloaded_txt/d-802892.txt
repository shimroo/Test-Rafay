about the company
incorporated in 1994, thumb-print's philosophy to what is practised is as suggested by the name. as no two thumb prints are identical, every design executed is to be unique & identifiable only with the individual client.
thumb-print studio specializes in the graphic arts field and offers a refreshingly transparent and open-minded range of communication and marketing services.
about the principals
with more than 20 years of experience in graphic design, servicing and print solutions, the principals are able to provide clients with well-defined solutions tailored to their specific needs.
