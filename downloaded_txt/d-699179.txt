“there are three places on this planet that both of my kids like: grandma’s house, disney world, and dismals canyon. the sleeping water campsite is probably the best individual site in the state, the staff is awesome, the general store is fantastic, the food at the soda fountain is delicious (try the slugburger!) and you won’t see anything like the dismalites anywhere else in the region.”~ brad barnett























national natural landmarkdismals canyon - located in northwest alabama - is an 85 acre (34 ha) nature conservatory privately owned and operated. it is not a state park or national park. however, it was designated a "national natural landmark" in 1975 by the national natural landmarks program. nnls are administered by the national park service, u.s. department of the interior. note: this is a natural terrain trail with limited bridges & many fallen trees!















cozy cabinstemporarily unavailabledismals canyon offers two cozy cabins; "bringing up the moon" and "bringing down the sun". constructed inside and out of western red cedar, with vaulted ceilings, stone fireplaces, hardwood floors, stainless steel / limestone countertops. available by reservation march through november.















dismalites (glowworms)past twilight the canyon lights up with tiny bioluminescent creatures we call dismalites. these "glowworms" require a select habitat to survive and are unique to only a few places on earth. they are “close cousins” of the rare glowworms found in australia and new zealand.guided night tours allow visitors to see these unique insects.








take a hike!take a couple of hours to hike the canyon floor and experience this beautiful sunken forest. explore the strange and beautiful labyrinth of caverns and grottos. a 1.5 mile hiking trail on the canyon floor follows dismals branch through sky-reaching boulders, past thundering waterfalls, into a secret world of mossy-green and pearl-gray filled with ferns and giant trees.
