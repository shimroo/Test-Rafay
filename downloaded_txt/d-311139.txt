in acute hypercalcemia
efficacy profile











reduction in serum calcium was evident within 1 to 2 hours of administration.1
the peak effect occurred within 24 to 48 hours.1
administration every 12 hours maintained a hypocalcemic state for ~5 to 8 days (the time period evaluated for most patients in the clinical trials).1

















indication
miacalcin injection is indicated for the early treatment of hypercalcemic emergencies, along with other appropriate agents, when a rapid decrease in serum calcium is required, until more specific treatment of the underlying disease can be accomplished. it may also be added to existing therapeutic regimens for hypercalcemia such as intravenous fluids and furosemide, oral phosphate or corticosteroids, or other agents.


important limitations of use: due to the possible association between malignancy and calcitonin salmon use, the need for continued therapy should be re-evaluated on a periodic basis.
important safety information
 contraindications: hypersensitivity to calcitonin salmon or any of the excipients. reactions have included anaphylaxis with death, bronchospasm, and swelling of the tongue or throat.
warnings and precautions:
hypersensitivity reactions: serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving miacalcin injection, e.g., bronchospasm, swelling of the tongue or throat, anaphylactic shock, and death due to anaphylaxis. appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available when miacalcin injection is administered. if anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions occur, initiate appropriate treatment. for patients with suspected hypersensitivity to calcitonin salmon, skin testing should be considered prior to treatment utilizing a dilute, sterile solution of miacalcin injection. healthcare providers may wish to refer patients who require skin testing to an allergist. a detailed skin testing protocol is available from the mylan pharmaceuticals inc. product safety department.
hypocalcemia: hypocalcemia associated with tetany (i.e., muscle cramps, twitching) and seizure activity has been reported with miacalcin injection therapy. hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy. other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin d deficiency) should also be effectively treated. in patients at risk for hypocalcemia, provisions for parenteral calcium administration should be available during the first several administrations of calcitonin salmon and serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored.
malignancy: in a meta-analysis of 21 randomized, controlled clinical trials with calcitonin salmon (nasal spray or investigational oral formulations), the overall incidence of malignancies reported was higher among calcitonin salmon-treated patients (4.1%) compared with placebo-treated patients (2.9%). this suggests an increased risk of malignancies in calcitonin salmon-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. the benefits for the individual patient should be carefully considered against possible risks.
antibody formation: circulating antibodies to calcitonin salmon have been reported with miacalcin injection. the possibility of antibody formation should be considered in any patient with an initial response to miacalcin injection who later stops responding to treatment.
adverse reactions: the most common adverse reactions are nausea with or without vomiting (10%), injection site inflammation (10%), and flushing of the face or hands (2% to 5%).
drug interactions: concomitant use of calcitonin salmon and lithium may lead to a reduction in plasma lithium concentrations due to increased urinary clearance of lithium. the dose of lithium may require adjustment.
