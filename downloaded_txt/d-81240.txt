villa la palme, air-con, sea views, walk to village and restaurantswe had a very nice week. the house matches the description perfectly. a little haven of peacethe pictures don't lie about it...you get what you see and it's awesome!highly recommended if you want to completely relax in a very quiet and beautiful location in a very quiet village.our family and the family of our friends who were with us had a great time.we really appreciated the calm and the view of the water. the house is fully equipped and the swimming pool is very pleasant. the bedding is comfortable.the village of la palme has a small grocery store/butcher and a bakery within walking distance of the house. easy access to visit the surrounding areas.very good times spent in this house in la palme.  owner is always available for any questions, and proactive about places and restaurants to discover.the house is very well equipped (28 degree swimming pool and barbecue are real pluses)the only downside was that the vacation didn't last long enough. don't hesitate, go for it! comments from owners previous bookings.

maison cerise, provencale villa near gordes, air conditioning, private heated pool and walking distance to villagewe've now stayed in 6 different houses in goult and this is our favourite.  it is stylish and light, with a fabulous drawing room overlooking the garden, a well stocked kitchen which has a great table for convivial eating, and the bedrooms are all elegant, with comfortable beds and attractive bedding.  outside, there are various terraces for dining, or sharing a glass of wine, including one which is under cover (very useful during the one storm!).  the pool is well maintained and we used it daily.  it's a fabulous house and we've already booked it again for 2 weeks next year.  mrs c - south france villas client may 2021 and 2024
