i cannot recommend mary lou highly enough.  



“i have worked closely with mary lou for over ten years, and she has helped me immensely in so many ways. she is so intuitive and such a good listener that she is able to help you get to the heart of issues and figure out solutions. she is an incredible coach and has helped me as i have progressed in my career to increase my executive presence, promote my brand and find my true and authentic path. mary lou is full of energy, passion and ideas, and i love brainstorming with her.”— alexandra t. 








 






 







my confidence has soared and i’ve unlocked my true style. and i love it! 



“i can’t begin to tell you how appreciative i am of your expert guidance today. you have a wonderful eye for style. thanks for making today’s experience fun and enjoyable. thanks for the helpful photos you took of the many outfit combinations. i can’t wait for summer to explore bold bright options.”— earle a. 








 






 







i love the weekly facebook lives on wednesday nights! 



“mary lou’s weekly beyond dressing well series on fb live is essential to helping me keep my style up-to-date and on brand. as a busy working mom of 3, i need to be able to pull together outfits that will take me from zoom meetings to the sidelines. her insightful tips are effortless to implement, allowing me to look and feel my best every day. and connecting with a group of like-minded women on a regular basis is a special bonus!”— liz d. 








 






 







shopping with your team was just what i needed. 



“thank you for an amazing shopping trip. i have loved every single piece we purchased and looked (and felt!) fabulous at my conference this week. sarah was absolutely incredible and the best partner in the process.”— kiran m. 








 






 







i'm so glad i got off the fence! 



“the 90 day program was awesome! i thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. i learned so much about fit, fabric and my own style. i said goodbye to(& thanked them for their service! ) a good chunk of my wardrobe and acquired some great new pieces. i have a new perspective on shopping. as you know, i was on the fence about doing the program. i’m so glad i got off the fence!”— mary ann c. 








 






 







one of the best gifts i give myself year in and year out... 



“working with sarah zengo on your team has been one of the best investments i have made in myself and career. she has completely transformed my wardrobe and it’s been such a fun and highly rewarding partnership and evolution. she intuitively understands my individualistic style and finds the most nuanced yet powerful ways to make an outfit – and thereby me – standout in a way that exudes confidence, sophistication and fun. time with sarah is one of the best gifts i give myself year in and year out. i consider her a true asset to my personal and professional brand.”— paula g.
