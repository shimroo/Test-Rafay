source: sun journalearlier today mj and i were both so struck by a story that we each ended up posting on it here and here. the short version is that a student at a maine school tossed a ham steak onto a table populated by somali muslims, who immediately turned into shreiking ninnies and ultimately the police were called and are currently investigating a pork based "hate crime."i crap you negative good buddy!i just stumbled across this article that picks up where the other left off, we introduce the character of stephen wessler a pre-op lobotomy patient, it's titled...“hate incident’ in city”i crap you negative! one student has been suspended and more disciplinary action could follow a possible hate crime at lewiston middle school, superintendent leon levesque said wednesday. on april 11, a white student placed a ham steak in a bag on a lunch table where somali students were eating. muslims consider pork unclean and offensive.    the act reminded students of a man who threw a pig’s head into a lewiston mosque last summer. the school incident is being treated seriously as “a hate incident,” levesque said. lewiston police are investigating, and the center for the prevention of hate violence is working with the school to create a response plan.    “we’ve got some work to do to turn this around and bring the school community back together again,” levesque said. placing ham where muslim students were eating was “an awful thing,” said stephen wessler, executive director of the center for prevention of hate violence. “it’s extraordinarily hurtful and degrading” to muslims, whose religion prohibits them from being around ham. it’s important to respond swiftly, wessler said. “incidents like this that involve degrading language or conduct are often said by the perpetrator as a joke. i know that conduct is never static,” he said. “it’s part of a process of escalation.”yes, i understand that delicious baby back ribs are next on the agenda, shudder, the humanity people, the humanity!how exactly does a civilization survive when shrieking ninnies like mr. wessler aren't immediately taken behind a building and introduced repeatedly to mr. fist? how does a civilization survive when you have individuals who actually think the throwing of a ham steak, by children, is the beginning of a pogram?i'm sorry to have to use hitler kitty twice in one day, but mrs. wessler leaves me no choice...hitler kitty sez: ham steaks do not a pogram make herr wessler, in your case though i could make an exception!h/t protein wisdomtechnorati tags: maine, somali, ham steak pogram, hate crime, you're kidding right?

	 adding to the golden hoard!
	 
    


once upon a time 'the derb' at nro compiled a most useful list.to wit..."legalization" ——- amnesty"guest worker plan" ——- amnesty"temporary worker plan" ——- amnesty"path to citizenship" ——- amnesty"out of the shadows" ——- amnesty"comprehensive reform" ——- amnestytoday we have the pleasure of adding to this list a new term making the rounds in washington.  mark krikorian reports...congress daily reports today that "a core group of senators that has been meeting almost daily for the last several weeks is close to announcing the outlines of a comprehensive immigration bill that could be the basis for senate debate in late may." a part of the possible deal would be "a 'trigger' mechanism that would delay implementation of a guestworker program until enforcement mechanisms are in place." there's been talk of this phony "trigger" idea for a while now, but until i spoke with some congressional staffers last night i didn't realize how phony it really is. the idea is that there would be certain enforcement benchmarks that would have to be met before a guestworker/amnesty program kicked in. it sounds plausible enough, but it isn't.the first problem is one that mickey kaus has written about — that having a promise of amnesty in a bill, regardless of conditions, just serves as a magnet for illegals to enter (or stay) and keep their heads down until the amnesty kicks in. but even worse is what the staffers explained to me: any deal including a trigger would actually give illegal aliens legal status (amnesty) immediately, while enforcement efforts were improved — so all that would be "triggered" is the illegals' opportunity to get a green card, not their ability to keep living and working here under some other status, which would continue indefinitely if the trigger conditions were not met.so, if you will allow me to work the tote board?trigger = amnesty!technorati tags: illegal immigration, amnesty, triggers,

	 asian commenter: respect us or we'll come out shooting!
	 
    


source: new york times blogi understand why the the student turned into a gunman. i knew that something like this was going to happen, and this may be the beginning, unless americans become more respectful to non-white people (both verbal and nonverbal). racism is constant, mostly nonverbal. i came from a similar background, although not exactly the same. during the junior high school, i was one of the few asians at the school. many students are racists and people called me many names. i also spoke constantly about killing people. i started lifting weights, and at the end of that year, i was the strongest in my school. i played with lots of bb guns and paintball guns. i started playing various sports (fball, wrestling, etc). my parents were also poor. many immigrants either join gangs or some people play sports to release their anger. fortunately, i was able to overcome the environmental factors, became very popular in high school, and overcame the adversity. it is a special challenge for immigrants and non-caucasians in america. i have an incredibly strong will power and through the help of god, i overcame adversities and constant racism. now, i am very successful. many people will not overcome racial adversities and this shooting could just be the beginning… my advice to all americans:1. be respectful to all people (both verbal and nonverbal), all the time.2. i don’t understand the gunlaw(biggest problem)3. american media is full of junk (violence(wwf), sex(oc), drugs, and violent music. get rid of them, now.4. understand that many people from other countries that have poor english accents are better educated than many americans here, with masters and phds. be respectful to people in all places, but most americans will never know what it feels like to be non-white, because white people are nice to white people.5. the gunman had personal problems, but it is the media, and the americans that influenced the gunman. again, the gunlaw is also incomprehensible.what the hell, let's just state the obvious here. kids will always be dicks to kids who are different. the only way to change that would be to eliminate children. does our deluded commenter here really think a white child would fare much differently in a non-white society?you know, mj and i used to go to chinatown here in chicago, we were treated poorly because we were white. should we go down there and threaten them with violence for treating us poorly and with suspicion? or is it okay because mj and i are white?because to state the obvious corollary to his statement that "most americans will never know what it feels like to be non-white, because white people are nice to white people," would be that of course "brown people are nice to brown people." duh!just take minute and really absorb what he's saying. we need to change things in america to make it more comfortable for immigrants. ummm, no, last time i checked it was immigrants that needed to bend. if you really don't like the culture you sire are the luckiest of men.because you can get the hell out!respect us or we'll start shooting! sounds like the perfect "multi-cultural" slogan, no?h/t knickerbocker blog via vdaretechnorati tags: asian, immigration, gunman, racism, bite me, race war

in the latest blogs for borders video blogburst we told the story of isidro pena soto.  illegal alien scumbag who after repeated violations of the law and a deportation hold killed kent boone, a father of five.  now the family is looking for answers and there hard to come by as weak, foolish politicians who allowed senor soto free reign to ramp up to this crime hide under their desks, knees knocking...    a convicted felon and drunk driver in solano county was supposed to be deported in 2005. two years later, that illegal immigrant faces murder charges, and the victim’s family can’t get answers.   “nobody wants to accept responsibility. none. there’s questions that can be answered and nobody wants to answer it,” said april godin outside a fairfield courtroom wednesday, minutes after isidro pena soto, 26, pleaded not guilty to charges of second degree murder, felony drunk driving and possession of methamphetamine.   pena soto is charged with killing kent boone, 33, in a head-on crash on highway 12 between rio vista and fairfield march 31. the chp said he has four prior dui convictions, is an illegal immigrant, and had two pounds of methamphetamine in his suv. investigators estimate pena soto was traveling 90 miles per hour at the time of the crash.   a news10 investigation showed in april 2005, pena soto pleaded no contest to felony drug possession and misdemeanor dui. he was only sentenced to 122 days in solano county jail. as an illegal immigrant with a felony conviction, court documents show he had an immigration hold, meaning he faced deportation after serving his sentence.   u.s. immigration and customs enforcement officials, however, told news10 they have no record of being contacted about pena soto in 2005 or any other time prior to his latest arrest.   godin is the mother of two of boone’s children from an earlier relationship. she attended pena soto’s arraignment with boone’s current wife, regina sorioso, and other family members, including sorioso’s two children. many of them had heart-shaped lockets around their necks, which sorioso said contained a pinch of boone’s ashes…… h/t immigration watchdogtechnorati tags: 100% preventable, illegal immigration, criminal aliens, scumbag, kent boone, isidro pena soto, drunk driving

	 why not believe them?
	 
    


oklahoma recently passed one of the toughest pieces of legislation dealing with illegal immigration.  the comments beneath this article are an interesting and instructive snapshot of the current debate over illegal immigration...let's start with the pro-illegal side...57. 4/18/2007 2:49:18 pm, george washington,it was once illegal for women to vote. it was illegal for blacks to be free. it was illegal to help a runaway save. it was illegal for blacks to marry a white. it was illegal for blacks to learn to read and write. it was illegal for a black to testify against a white. it was illegal for blacks to own property. it was legal for a husband to rape his wife. illegal is a social construct. no human being is illegal. immigration policies have been embede with racism. europeans had easy passage the us.48. 4/18/2007 1:26:02 pm, chris,a guy 60 years ago (hitler) used the "laws on the books" to kill 6 million jews. we had slaves in this country for 200 years because of "laws on the books". we conquered and massacred natives indians in this country because of "laws on the books". there are genocides all over the world because of "laws on the books".i hear that illegal immigrants are criminals because they broke the law. how many of you break the law every day driving on freeways over the speed limit. are you criminals because you break the law? of course not.laws can be bad or unrealistic. making criminals out of people that came here for a better life and are hard working individuals is not fair. it is just a screwed up law! 49. 4/18/2007 1:52:07 pm, jessica,i agree with the above poster..not only hitler, but saddam husseim..!! he killed thousand of "invaders"..!!besides, deporting million of people is a crime, and it is genocide, even if they don't kill a single person. as per the new genocide law, massive deportations are also a crime, just take a look at dandurf and kosovo..1.5 million people deported, and the u.n. had to stop it. just imagine the usa deporting 20 million..is a horrendous crime.!!and thanks to the state of arkansas, they did not approve the immigration law, similar to the oklahoma law. oklahoma is the only retarded state in the region!! good luck!!42. 4/18/2007 11:54:29 am, aztec poet,racists always try to deflect their racism by yelling "they are playing the race card." strange irony. this bill is racism at its ugliest. in 100 years, people will hang in shame that grandma and grandpa were so blind to their xenophobic fears. stop the hate!now to the anti-illegal immigration side...67. 4/19/2007 9:51:28 am, adrock, los angelesgood work oklahoma! illegal aliens need to go back to where they came from. always bitching that america owes them better treatment. the government they ran away from owes them better treatment...america owes them nothing!i can't help but laugh at all you clowns defending illegals. most of you won't realize what's really happening here until it's too late. just wait until they come to your neighborhood and start pushing you around in your own town. 10 years ago, nobody out here in la thought illegals were a problem, and today they own the place. why don't all of you sympathizers move your families out to east la if want to experience the future of america because this is what you're ultimately fighting for.and for all you people crying about racism...buckle up. when latinos take over you'll see racism that you didn't believe possible and it will all be directed at your white, english-speaking ass. unlike most of you, i live amongst latinos and they are the most racist culture i have ever come across.disagree if you like, but do not forget my warning: illegal immigrants will be the death knell of america. you people are trying to be friends with people who don't want your friendship, and unless you stop this invasion, you'll see america dissolve into a third world sewer. and when that happens, just remember that you were one of the morons who fought for that outcome. 68. 4/19/2007 1:27:06 pm, kevin,i couldnt agree more with adrock. i also lived in southern california when latinos were much fewer in numbers, and everyone defended their presence and hard work, but now that they are the majority there, things are much different. they arent the quiet, mind their own business folk who are just hoping to make it here in america (illegally), they are now banding together (remember may 1 2006?) and demanding things they are in no way owed! they now are arrogant in public and will openly argue with you that this (usa) is mexico!! they have effectively ruined a once prestigious california school system by requiring so many resources go to esl programs and performing poorly on exams. all this, on top of vicious gangs, smuggling rings, and an extremely anti american attitude, its a wonder more states arent jumping to take the same action as oklahoma! if youre too ignorant to listen to people like me, who have experienced this, then you have no one to blame but yourself when america is destroyed. hooray for oklahoma making a very wise decision.when you have eyewitnesses why not believe them?  you should read through them all, like i said, interesting and instructive, a true snapshot of the current debate, of course only one side is interested in debating, while the other is quite fond of calling names.this made me laugh...maybe they shouldn't have come illegally.. i know that isn't right but you can't help who you fall in love with and asking someone their legal status before you begin a relationship is ludacris.h/t vdaretechnorati tags: illegal immigration, oklahoma, racism, communists,

source: the hilljust in case you had any doubt that (your future president!) bill richardson was a racist clown, he's nice enough to remove any doubt...presidential candidate and new mexico gov. bill richardson (d) said monday the reason he has not called for the removal of attorney general alberto gonzales is that the two both have hispanic backgrounds.richardson, in an interview with the hill, said he is "pretty close" to making such a call, but added that he is reluctant to do so before gonzales's senate testimony despite the high-profile involvement of new mexico in the u.s. attorneys scandal.[richardson says] "the only reason i'm not there is because he's hispanic, and i know him and like him... it's because he's hispanic. i'm honest... i want to give him the benefit of the doubt."let's play a little game. imagine if i was a politician and a fellow politician who was white had gotten himself into trouble and i went on record saying: i'm honest, i want to give him the benefit of the doubt because he's white.how long would my head remain attached to my body?  the double standard is truly mind blowing.previous coverage on this jackass: bill richardson: race pandering whore so close... pro-illegal crowd continues to hijack civil rights movement  bill richardson: loves cock...? bill richardson: governor of chihuahua? a hispanic president?h/t lonewackotechnorati tags: bill richardson, hispanic, alberto gonzalez, the tan klan, reconquista,

source: sunjournal lewiston - one student has been suspended and more disciplinary action could follow a possible hate crime at lewiston middle school, superintendent leon levesque said wednesday.   on april 11, a white student placed a ham steak in a bag on a lunch table where somali students were eating. muslims consider pork unclean and offensive.      the act reminded students of a man who threw a pig’s head into a lewiston mosque last summer.   the school incident is being treated seriously as “a hate incident,” levesque said. lewiston police are investigating, and the center for the prevention of hate violence is working with the school to create a response plan. should students be punished for this?  of course!  should the freaking police be involved?  only if islam is the state religion.oh, it is?  never mind!h/t hot airtechnorati tags: sharia law, islam, state religion, somali, jihad,

source: aafaqthe word comes down: don't ask allah for mercy on the slain vtech students...debate on virginia tech muslim students' association mailing list concerning permissibility of praying for mercy for non-muslim victimsthe liberal arabic-language website aafaq reports that a muslim student set off a debate when she sent an email to the mailing list of the muslim students' association at virginia tech asking the students to pray that allah have mercy on those killed and wounded in the shooting attack at the university.according to aafaq, the dean of student affairs at american international university, abu hamza hijji, responded, writing that allah the most merciful forbids praying for mercy for the non-muslim dead, or even for the non-muslim living, and that it is only permitted to pray that they be rightly guided. he added that what happened was a sad occurrence, but that does not give muslims the right to transgress the laws of allah the most merciful.aafaq reported that a student named chris, a recent convert, did not agree, and wrote that he usually does not intervene in this kind of discussion, but that this time he had to say "no." he added that his german teacher, who was wounded in the shooting, is a good man, and that he was praying that he would not die. he said that he would pray for him and for his family, whether they are muslims or not, and would pray for all those who suffered from this calamity. he expressed the view that religion must bring people together, and not drive them apart, and that the brotherhood of humanity takes precedence over brotherhood of religion or of state.according to aafaq, hijji answered chris, saying that there is no problem with praying that non-muslims be kept safe and not be killed, if there is hope that they might be guided [to the right path] [ds: conversion to islam]; but one cannot pray for the non-muslim dead, since there is no chance of their being guided. he said that the prophet muhammad had told the muslim soldiers at the battle of badr to not kill some of the nonbelievers, even though they were on the battlefield, as they had treated muhammad well when he was in mecca.hijji wrote that the students should ask allah to save chris' teacher (i.e. the german teacher) from death and turn his heart to the truth. but he said at the same time that the prophet did not pray for forgiveness for the non-muslims, and in particular did not ask allah to have mercy on them, even those whom the prophet had wanted to be guided when they were alive. once they died, the prophet was not permitted to ask for mercy for them. hijji added that the prophet behaved this way on allah's instructions.hijji wrote that the relative importance of brotherhood in humanity or religion needs to be evaluated according to allah's laws, and not according to human reason. he added that he might seem to be a hard-hearted person, but that this is what people throughout the generations said about the prophets and messengers who came with god's message to guide others to the truth.the only good news, and it's not a lot...according to aafaq, some students expressed their uneasiness with the discussion and asked to be taken off the mailing list, while others tried to justify the seemingly difficult matter.gosh, may we import more please?judgement bunny is not amused!h/t debbie schusseltechnorati tags: virginia tech, islam, muslim, allah, prayer, savages

	 tom tancredo: one trick pony?
	 
    


by james kotthoff i have been researching tom tancredo for awhile. he has gotten a reputation in the msm as a one trick pony, that trick being illegal immigration. that is amazing to me that any reasonable person would honestly say he is a “one trick pony” since he has been in congress since 1998. you don’t get re-elected if you only have one trick, just ask bush the senior. i want to look at his stand on some major issues. we will start with his position on the major issues of today. illegal immigration: he has a clear vision of what he believes and this has been constant throughout his career. he believes in not rewarding lawbreakers and most importantly to me he believes in self deportation. anyone who does not think that self deportation is a viable option needs to look more closely at reality. if you enforce the current laws against employers, sanctuary cities and social service agencies you remove any incentive for illegal aliens to stay. a vast majority would self deport and the rest could easily be rounded up and deported. the common myth that you can’t deport 12- 20 million people is just that a myth. legal immigration: he supports a cap on legal immigration in the amount of 250,000 a year, not the 1,000,000+ a year that legally immigrate here. even unlimited legal immigration is harmful to this country. even discounting the cultural damage and the damage to our infrastructure, he fact remains that our resources cannot support that many people. defense/ national security: he has a common sense approach to the iraq war. one that is neither a cut and run view nor a stay the course view. he advocates a strategy of a rapid response force to deal with al qaeda and other terrorist issues, while assisting the region to find it’s own balance of power. on the national security front the advocates secure borders. overall a solid strategy, iraq must decide what course they will travel. education: he supports parental control over the education of their children, not government control. he advocates school vouchers and school choice. a parent should be the one who decides on what is the best educational path for their child. social security: he supports partial privatization of social security for younger workers. to me this makes sense, you relieve some of the pressure on the system while still honoring the governments obligations to older workers and retirees. this is a compromise that takes a flawed system and makes it workable. as those who need the system die you can gradually phase out the social security system as it exists. and replace it with a system that puts more responsibility for retirement in the hands of the individual. taxes: he supports either a flat tax or a national sales tax in place of the current federal income tax. i see pluses and minuses to both systems. i prefer the flat tax option with limited deductions. a national sales tax would be fine as long as it was weighted towards luxury goods and not basic necessities. abortion: he is strictly opposed to abortion. me i am opposed to any abortion that is not based on a life threatening risk to the mother. i find it ironic that our government and society complain about the aging population and the low birth rate in this country, yet we allow the abortion of millions of babies. these are just a few of the issues, if you take the time and do a little research you will find more on his positions. the key thing that attracts me to tom tancredo as a presidential candidate is he is a federalist. for those unclear what a federalist system is here is the britannica definition. federalism political system that binds a group of states into a larger, noncentralized, superior state while allowing them to maintain their own political identities. certain characteristics and principles are common to all successful federal systems: a written constitution or basic law stipulating the distribution of powers; diffusion of power among the constituent elements, which are substantially self-sustaining; and territorial divisions to ensure neutrality and equality in the representation of various groups and interests. changes require the consent of those affected. basically he believes in the states right to self govern with little federal intervention. part of being a good citizen is to take an active role in deciding the direction of this country. as the old saying goes if you don’t vote, don’t complain. and if you do vote, do the research to make informed decisions.see tom's record...here. technorati tags: tom tancredo 2008, presidential elections, illegal immigration, social security, defense, national security, federalism

	 eroding citizenship?
	 
    


source: timesleaderi have to ask, has the aclu ever taken any case that made this country stronger, more safe, or supported the very idea of citizenship? register of wills won’t give license for illegal immigrant to marry area woman.   wilkes barre -- the american civil liberties union on tuesday filed a federal lawsuit against luzerne county register of wills dorothy stankovic for refusing to accept a marriage application of an illegal immigrant who wishes to marry a legal resident of the united states.  the suit, filed on behalf of heather buck and jose guadelupe arias-maravilla of west hazleton, says stankovic’s policy requires applicants to prove they are legal residents before she will issue a marriage license. the aclu maintains that policy is not based on any state statute and violates the u.s. and pennsylvania constitutions.  the suit could potentially have statewide impact as other counties are believed to have similar policies, said lawyer mary catherine roper of the aclu in philadelphia, the lead attorney in the case.  “this is a big deal,” roper said in a phone interview wednesday. “we’ve been talking to immigration attorneys all over the state and we understand the same thing is happening in practically every county you can name.”  according to the suit filed in federal court in scranton, arias-maravilla, a citizen of mexico, has admitted he is in the united states illegally and has agreed to be deported by may 12. he and buck, who is a legal resident, have been living together since october 2005. they have a son, who was born in december. the couple were making arrangements for their marriage when arias-maravilla was taken into custody in january.  the suit says arias-maravilla was walking to a pay phone after his car broke down when he was approached by police. the officers asked for identification and he presented a mexican driver’s license. he refused to answer when asked if he was in the country legally and was taken into custody and turned over to immigration officials.  arias-maravilla appeared before an immigration judge on march 6 and admitted he had entered the u.s. without permission. he agreed to voluntarily leave the country within 60 days.  the suit says arias-maravilla’s will still be deported even if he and buck are married. the couple want to go through with the ceremony so that their son has the “legal, social, spiritual and psychological benefits of the lawful marriage of his parents.”  pennsylvania law requires marriage license applicants to produce a birth certificate and provide information regarding their occupation, birthplace, residence and to certify they do not have a transmissible disease. it does not require proof of legal residency status, the suit says.  buck and arias-maravilla say they went to stankovic’s office on tuesday. arias-maravilla presented a mexican birth certificate as well as his passport and immigration papers, while buck presented a birth certificate and photo identification. deputy register of wills don williams refused to accept the application because there was no visa in arias-maravilla’s passport, which caused williams to conclude arias-maravilla was “illegally in the country,” the suit says.  the suit further says williams provided the couple a copy of stankovic’s policy, which directs employees to refuse a marriage license to any foreign citizen who cannot prove legal residence in the united states and to report the applicants to immigration officials.  “the register of wills doesn’t get to make up rules. she is supposed to enforce the pennsylvania marriage law. when you start making up rules that are not on the books, it infringes on people’s rights to be treated equally and you have a constitutional problem,” roper said.  stankovic, in a prepared statement, did not directly address the allegation the application was denied because of arias-maravilla’s residency status.  the statement says stankovic’s office requires all applicants for a marriage license to present proof of identity for both applicants. arias-maravilla’s application was denied because he did not produce “satisfactory proof of identification,” stankovic says in the release.  “this has been a long-standing policy of the clerk of the orphan’s court,” stankovic said. “it is my intention to adamantly oppose any move to have my office modify or change the current policy.”  the suit asks a federal judge to declare the policy void and to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting stankovic from enforcing it. it also seeks unspecified monetary damages for violations of the plaintiff’s rights, as well as court costs and attorney fees. illegal aliens are not "near beer" citizens, and we do them and ourselves no favors by pretending they are. citizenship is one of the most important commodities in a republic, and actions like this can only serve to weaken the republic, not strengthen it.  funny how the aclu never appears to take the side of the country that spawned it, ain't it?technorati tags: illegal immigration, aclu, wilkes-barre, pennsylvania, citizenship

source: 11 eyewitnessnewsvideo here. raleigh) - a man who stood with his back to the eyewitness news camera because he is afraid to show his face or reveal his name, is originally from mexico city and now a very successful building contractor who lives in the triangle.      he is also an illegal immigrant filing a federal income tax return, and in 2006, he made more than $577,000.   through an interpreter he said, “i’ve been long enough in the country, and i know i have to do the right thing. and i know paying taxes is the right thing.”      his wealth may be an exception, but the tax return filed by an illegal immigrant is not.   across the triangle and across the nation, undocumented workers are flooding a handful of income tax offices which cater to immigrants.   “over the past three years, what i have seen is every year there is an increase,” said blaire borthayre, tax service consultant.   according to borthayre more and more illegal immigrants are filing tax returns on the hope of gaining legal residency. immigration bills now pending in congress would legalize undocumented workers if they can prove a history of tax payment.      tax preparers say many immigrants are filing returns for multiple years, and they have cash for uncle sam.      “the most i’ve seen is $14k and that was in a suitcase this past year,” borthayre said.   it all must sound puzzling to some but many immigrants are filing returns not with social security numbers but with tax payer id numbers. the numbers are legally obtained and issued by the government.”      tax preparers echo a policy of the irs.      “we don’t care if you are legal or illegal, we just want your money,” borthayre said. “we want you to pay your taxes.”      the anonymous building contractor among many others is willing to comply. how many further laws did this individual break amassing that money? how many corners were cut in the building process and what recourse will those he served have if they have problems in the future? the list of questions is endless, and pointless.this story makes my head want to pop off. when you allow rampant lawlessness you empower only the lawless. decent hardworking folk trying to follow the rules are the ones hurt by this. goddamn you mr. president, goddamn you to hell!h/t immigration watchdogtechnorati tags: illegal immigration, raleigh, north carolina, displacement, jobs americans won't do, reconquista, gangsters, crime,

	 craig nelson on south korean backlash...
	 
    


there has been an incredible amount of chattering about "backlash" against south koreans after the rampage at virginia tech, and as usual no backlash has emerged though the usual suspects never tire of reminding us, who don't tend to backlash, not to backlash, i think i have whiplash! (of course when the shoe was on the other foot, whaddaya know, there was a backlash!)anywho, craig nelson sent this email out today and it cracked my ass up, crappy little country indeed!in the wake of the virginia tech shootings by a south korean immigrant, the south korean immigrant community held a church service to pray there wouldn't be a racial backlash against all south koreans in the united states, and even though there hadn't been a single incident reported anywhere of any such "anti-south korean backlash" occurring, the south korean government had the chutzpah to issue a statement warning against an anti-south korean racial backlash.i'm insulted, frankly, at the nerve of this crappy little country.in 2002, when a u.s. military vehicle accidentally struck and killed two school girls walking on the shoulder of a highway in south korea, it unleashed months of "racial backlash" against all things american. americans were attacked. american businesses were attacked. american military installations were attacked. the tightly controlled south korean press failed to report the american military's apology, it failed to report the handsome monetary gift to the girls' families (paying off a victim's family is a disgusting and widespread asian tradition), and massive riots were stoked by the korean government. never mind that our military, at great expense to the american people, are there to protect that crappy little country from the korean whack job to the north in the first place.oh, did i mention that the deaths of the two schoolgirls was an accident? that the soldiers of the unit involved built a memorial to the two girls and held a candlelight vigil for them?compare that to the methodical murder, the intentional murder of 32 americans by the south korean killer at virginia tech. did the south korean community apologize to the families of the victims? did the south korean government express its sense of grief at the heartache one of their own had unleashed? no, not a word to that effect. and despite not a single whiff of any anti-south korean sentiment anywhere, press coverage that took pains to describe the killer as "coming from our area (his immigrant family lived in northern virginia)", the despicable south koreans dared warn us against any backlash! it almost makes one want to do a little backlashing.here's a proposal. all americans in south korea, get out. come home where you belong.all koreans in america, get out and go back to korea, the crappy little country where you belong. then you can all engage in all the anti-american demonstrations you please and no one will notice, because no one will care what goes on in your crappy little country. in fact, you can demonstrate right up to the point when whackjob ill-in-the-head joong takes over and throws you all into nk uniforms and shows you what anti-american demonstrations are supposed to look like.if we'd thrown all you corrupt ingrates out a year ago, 32 of us would be alive today.damn!  now that's a scathing letter done american proud!h/t vfrtechnorati tags: virginia tech, shooting, rampage, backlash, heh, crappy little country

	 new york to open madrassas!
	 
    


source: ibdeducation seems to be a theme today...homeland security: new york city plans to give brooklyn arabs and muslims their own public school where they can speak arabic. the idea is to promote cultural harmony. but it's pollyannaish, and potentially dangerous.with this culture, tolerance is not mutual. putting aside the issue of american taxpayers supporting a school dedicated to the study of a foreign culture hostile to our own, the move raises serious security questions.will the school, located not far from ground zero, condone or encourage jihad? will it act like a madrassa? how will authorities know any better, if classes are taught in arabic?if the school were opened in any other place, it might raise fewer alarms.but brooklyn — home to new york's largest muslim population — has produced a number of radicals and terrorists. a popular mosque there has been linked to the first world trade center bombing and other acts of terrorism. *snip*the catalyst behind the movement for such public madrassas is a muslim immigrant from yemen. dhabah almontaser, a veteran of the new york city school system, pitched the idea to officials. she thinks the government should open grade schools aimed at teaching arabic, tolerance of islam and cultural diversity.and she'll be principal of the first of those schools, dubbed the khalil gibran international academy, in brooklyn. set to open in september, it will serve grades 6 to 12 and will eventually include up to 600 students.she wants to enroll muslims and arab immigrants to learn about their heritage, while exposing other students to arab culture. "i see arab-american students who want the opportunity to learn arabic, to read it and write it and have a better understanding of where their ancestors have come from," almontaser said.apparently the thousands of saudi-backed mosques that already do that in this country aren't good enough for her. the public school is opening in partnership with the arab-american family support center, a brooklyn advocacy group for mideast immigrants.the nonprofit's web site says it "addresses the countless social and economic barriers that face the growing population of arab immigrants." it complains that their "needs" — which apparently include promotion of their culture in public schools — "have been largely neglected."in the age of islamic and arab terror, the last thing we need to do is promote a culture of intolerance and violence in new york city, a prime target for attack. school officials instead should insist that american students be taught american culture — in english.the american jihad rolls on unabated. i have a word of advice to our muslim friends, do not think that our tolerance and forbearance of your plans and schemes is never ending. it has a limit, and you will find at the end of that particular road that pissing off america is a bit like biting down on a piece of tin foil wrapper stuck to a piece of candy.h/t toni @ bcltechnorati tags: new york city, madrassa, islam, american jihad,

	 reconquista u: suing doug mcintyre @ staying open!
	 
    


source: cbs2the academia semillas del pueblo, a racialist reconquista school in la, partly funded by tax payer dollars is suing jon mcintyre for slander..."mcintyre implemented a premeditated scheme to bring down the school at all costs because the school educated predominately ... latino-indigenous children in a non-western european format," according to the lawsuit.according to the lawsuit, mcintyre began criticizing several aspects of the school last may, including its funding, curriculum, demographics, administrators and educational statistics, all in order to increase his show's ratings.mcintyre exploited a combination of anti-immigration sentiment and the nation's fear of islamic terrorists to "create a racist fury against latino school children, teachers, administrators and staff at the school," according to the lawsuit.mcintyre's remarks included, "is this a reconquista school?," "this school is ranked the lowest of the low in the lausd and in the state of california" and "aztecs butchered and ate spanish invaders. i wonder if they're teaching that at asdp," according to the lawsuit.mcintyre also said aguilar's job was to "keep his school, his madrasa school, open so they can train the next generation of aztec revolutionaries," according to the lawsuit.the radio host also used "code words" aimed at a target audience to rile up listeners and create a backlash against the school and aguilar, the lawsuit stated.as a result, the school received many threats of violence, including a bomb threat that caused an evacuation of the school and is currently under investigation by the fbi, the lawsuit stated.as lonewacko notes, let's recall that the only real violence, an attempt to run down a local reporter who was covering the school, the perpetrator faces some hard time.however, in the good news department this anti-american tax funded monstrosity, with some of the lowest test scores in city replete with failing schools will be keeping its doors open, whew!  i'm relieved!in a march 13 report on academia semillas del pueblo, the staff cited low test scores, unconventional instruction and potentially conflicting school governance. about two weeks later, facing growing political pressure from former city councilman richard alatorre, former assemblywoman jackie goldberg and others, the staff changed course.under the five-year renewal conditions, semillas must meet benchmarks that for three years would place it at least at the median of comparable schools in terms of state and national standards. data show semillas ranks lowest among similar schools.the bnf reports has this to say..."so, we have a separatist group supporting a public,taxpayer funded school in los angeles. this school does not teach the students, as evidenced by the low test scores. so, one can ask, where is the accountability? why is this man, mr. aguilar, and the school allowed to just basically be a tool for him so promote his views (and the views of groups like mecha) at taxpayer expense?friends of dave has charts and sez "i don't think letting this school continue with its curriculum of spanish, english, mandarin and nahuatl-mexicano and instruction in the aztec base-20 math system is doing those students any favors. hopefully, they're going to end up closing this school in a couple years when they're unable meet the benchmarks the district required of them. those students will just end up getting transferred to other schools where they're going to need extensive remediation to undo this school's work."palosverdesblog sez "the school’s absurd multilingual curriculum includes spanish, english, mandarin and nahuatl-mexicano. but the board bowed to pressure from political stooges richard alatorre and jackie goldberg and spanish groups to keep it open, the kids be damned. until the unions lose their hold on politicians and school board members, the kids have little to no chance."puchica was happy "academia semillas del pueblo was there and we got a chance to congratulate them on the renewal of their charter school. very cool. "your tax dollars hard at work folks, teaching inner city barrio kids that they don't need to be a part of american life. yeah, how can that go wrong!technorati tags: illegal immigration, academia semillas del pueblo, doug mcintyre, california, reconquista, mecha, aztlan,
