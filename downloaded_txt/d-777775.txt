 the brand new “formaldehyde-free”
							    keratin treatment has arrived from new york

this product does not contain formaldehyde* and the smoothing effects last up to two to three months longer than other keratin treatments.
this product also supplies nutrition to the hair and helps wavy and puffy hair stay in place.  it contains collagen which makes the hair healthier, giving it shine and moisture, and works on all hair types.
(*keratin treatments typically contain a chemical called formaldehyde.  the american cancer society warns that formaldehyde is a known carcinogen.)
