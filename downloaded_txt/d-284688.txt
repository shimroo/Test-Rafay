orlando women’s center, abortion clinics in florida.
florida’s 6-week abortion ban is now in effect
we perform abortions for maternal/fetal indications for termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks.
criteria for termination of pregnancy:
1. elective abortions can be performed up to 6 weeks.
2. abortions can be performed up to 15 weeks as determined by the physician, if the pregnancy occurs due to rape, incest or human trafficking.
3. the pregnancy has not progressed to the third trimester of pregnancy (greater than 24 weeks) and two physicians certify in writing that in reasonable medical judgment, the fetus has a fatal fetal abnormality, or the termination of pregnancy is necessary to save the mother’s life or prevent a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
the orlando women’s center is a trusted and professional abortion clinic located in the heart of orlando, florida. our compassionate staff and experienced physicians provide safe abortion services in a confidential and supportive environment.
we offer both medical and surgical abortion options, depending on the stage of pregnancy and individual needs of our patients.
all of our clinics in florida are offering the one hour abortion pill procedure – 3 to 14 weeks. patients who qualify may receive a significant discount in the price of the procedure if they meet certain criteria. call us now for same day appointment.
