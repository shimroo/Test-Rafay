what 
                    is the purple crayon?  












			  i am a children's book editor, and i created this site so i could 
                post articles and other materials about how to publish a children's book. 
                over the years, the site has grown and now includes articles contributed 
                by other people, covering writing, illustrating, marketing, and 
                editing.
				
 



 




why 
                      the purple crayon?  










			  my first name's harold, and i have always loved the harold and 
                the purple crayon books by crockett johnson. so the name and 
                design of this site are an allusion and a tribute to them.

 "[harold] left his yard, taking his purple crayon and the moon along. to get very far he was going to need a lot of words. b is for books. he could find plenty of words in a pile of big books. he was ready for anything." -- crockett johnson, harold's abc.
