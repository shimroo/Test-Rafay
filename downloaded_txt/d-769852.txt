fleur de coin

meaning: flower of the die (french)
a perfect or virtually perfect coin. fully struck up. no contact- or other detracting marks 
		visible with the naked eye, and only minute superficial imperfections, relating to the manufacturing 
		process rather than any other cause, may be visible under magnification. fully lustre or mint bloom 
		is present. toning on silver coins (if present) must be attractive. brilliance (color) on bronze 
		coins should be 90% plus. eye appeal is outstanding. to reiterate, it is a completely flawless mint 
		state coin with nothing forgiven. this grade is very rare, not to be taken lightly or accepted easily.

    collectors around the world and become your on-line guide to coin collecting. we are continuously 
    expanding our selection of single coins, annual year sets, official blisters, starter-kits and banknotes, and 
    improving our check-out process to make it easier and faster to purchase coins and enrich
