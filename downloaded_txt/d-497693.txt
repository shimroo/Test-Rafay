our winter places

here’s a handy guide to which of our places are open this winter, so you can start planning some memorable days out.

conservation journeys at falkland palace 

investigatory works to determine the scope of known issues within the building fabric of falkland palace will ultimately lead to a project of remediation works, which has meant vulnerable collections have had to be removed to allow access.










13 feb 2025 
recording the plaster ceilings at kellie castle

we are creating digital scans and 3d models of the ornate 17th-century plasterwork ceilings at kellie castle.
