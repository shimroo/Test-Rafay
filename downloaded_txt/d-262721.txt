the liberty baptist church family is a fellowship of believers who seek to live for the lord jesus each and every day. our desire is to be a church that is following the scriptures in our practice and to express our love to god in our worship and our service to him. christ commanded us to “make disciples of all nations” – and we seek to do that by connecting with each other and with our community, sharing the gospel with those around us. we invite you to join us as we seek to serve the lord!
