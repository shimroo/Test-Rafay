let's grow together
growth is contagious here. although our young students are seemingly inching up by the day, the center is about to have one big growth spurt. slated to begin construction later this year, the preschool expansion project will extend the facility’s footprint extensively and our current space will get a makeover of its own. in the end, the expansion will allow the preschool to double its capacity, serving about 350-400 children each year.
learn more about the preschool expansion project and how you can support our current and future students.
