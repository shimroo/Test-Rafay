2024 ramsey county fair canceled
 
                   citing the  lack of progress on issues related to returning to the maplewood location and time  to find a new location and plan an event, the ramsey county agricultural  society board of directors canceled the 2024 county fair.
                   in 2020 and 2021, the event was canceled due  to the pandemic.  set to resume in 2022,  the fair was canceled again that year, and in 2023, due to demands by the  ramsey county board of commissioners for use of the maplewood site. while some  of the minor issues have been resolved, the main barrier is a $25,000 event fee  the board of commissioners is requiring the agricultural society to pay. 
                   the  agricultural society board is hoping to meet with the commissioners soon to  discuss the situation and work out an agreement.  while resuming the fair at the maplewood  site, where it has been since 1954, is the most ideal solution, the fair board  will continue to explore other options for 2025.
