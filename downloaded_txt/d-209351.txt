                            the updated ftc eyeglass rule of 2024 went into effect on sept. 24, 2024. the rules require doctors to obtain confirmation from a patient that the prescription was provided to the patient. in cases where the prescription is provided electronically, doctors need to obtain consent to send the prescription electronically and retain that consent. the eyeglass rule of 2024 mirrors the requirements of the contact lens rule of 2020. the aoa has developed a toolkit to assist doctors with compliance.
