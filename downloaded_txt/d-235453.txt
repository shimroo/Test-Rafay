inclement weather policywhen inclement weather strikes during the week, the cathedral will follow the policy of metro nashville public schools on closures and delays. a closure means that all weekday worship services and meetings are cancelled, with meeting organizers having the choice to hold virtual meetings. the cathedral music department may choose to set its own policy, so please look for emails from our canon for music or our associate organist and choirmaster. if the cathedral is closed on a friday, it will also be closed on the subsequent saturday. any changes to our sunday schedule will be posted on social media and on our website by late saturday afternoon.
