welcome to the division of student affairs!
 
student affairs is a multifaceted division dedicated to enhancing the overall student experience at tulane through support, connection, and growth. our mission is intrinsically aligned with tulane university’s core values, serving as a driving force behind the institution’s commitment to create a dynamic and inclusive campus community that empowers students to thrive both academically and personally.
our work is tailored to meet the unique needs of each student at various stages in their development while respecting and uplifting all the intersectional social identities they hold. our 15 departments offer vital services encompassing housing, healthcare, campus engagement, support, and guidance. our approach is flexible and responsive, acknowledging the complexity of each student’s experience, embracing diversity and inclusion, and championing equity and respect. the division of student affairs challenges all tulane students to learn, think, and act to benefit humanity. our work starts with you.
