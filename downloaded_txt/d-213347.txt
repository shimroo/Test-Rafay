    introductions!






                    crews critics is a rating and review site where you can register anonymous profiles to complete surveys and submit your own reviews about your experiences working on cruise ships. we will keep you updated with industry news, job postings, recruitment agencies, salaries, and other requests that you have so that we can support you. there will also be an entire forum devoted to rating the crew amenities, food, leadership and more and you will be able to cast your anonymous votes.
                

                    anonymity is so important to people, and we see a greater need for an outlet where we can also review our ship life experiences without that fear of retaliation. so we are very proud to announce the partnership of crew center and crews critics. with the popularity of crew center’s followers, and the not for profit work that crews critics did as the "sea me foundation" in 2019 (to expose the violations and the high number of sexual assaults onboard), we have some huge aspirations. we know that people rely upon their jobs and that there is a lot of fun that comes along with working and traveling, and there is no better camaraderie than those of ship friends! we want this website to bring you friendships, new connections, career networking, smiles and laughter. we also want to be fully transparent to the world about what needs changing, so that crew wellness finally gets the much-needed attention that you all deserve.
                

                    and it's not just for crew. without the passengers, we wouldn't be here! so there is a dedicated passenger area that can also participate and just like onboard, there are passenger only and crew only areas. there are also places we can all come together so that we can have guest and passenger support, working together for a better tomorrow. we won't say it looks easy, but we are confident that crews critics will be the biggest cruise community online and we can't wait to engage with you.

i am writing to you as a concerned crew member working aboard the grand princess cruise ship. i wish to bring to your attention an issue affecting the well-being and rest of night shift workers like myself. i kindly request anonymity regarding this matter.

as night workers, we often finish our shifts between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. on some occasions, our schedules are further impacted by time changes, such as an hour forward adjustment. this leaves us with very limited...

thread 'written warnings - explaining the process (official) process - what did you experience?'







			cruise lines use written warnings as a disciplinary measure for crew members who violate company rules or policies.

here's some of the reasons why they issue them:

maintain order and safety: warnings help ensure a safe and orderly working environment for both crew and passengers.
address performance issues: they address issues like poor work performance, absenteeism, insubordination, and safety violations.
document corrective action: they provide a formal record of disciplinary action...
