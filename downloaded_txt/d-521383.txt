welcome from our president
 

welcome to the otao website!i've been a member of otao for many years, and i've served on the board in various capacities. i'm passionate about advocating for occupational therapists and the people we serve.
in my previous role as legislative chair, i helped to pass hb2618, which requires the oregon department of education to do a work study to look into workloads for occupational therapists, physical therapists, and speech-language pathologists. this is a huge victory for our profession, and i'm proud to have played a role in making it happen.

i'm looking forward to working with our new board members and planning our annual conference. we have a great team of otps who are committed to serving otao and our consumers in oregon.

i also want to take this opportunity to encourage everyone to become a member of otao. your membership dues go directly to supporting our advocacy efforts. we need your help to make sure that occupational therapy is recognized and valued in oregon.

please consider connecting with the occupational therapy association of oregon and follow us to hear about all of the awesome advocacy work going on & for ot night out events in oregon.

if you're interested in joining the board or becoming a member, please visit our website at www.otao.com or email me at otaopresident@gmail.com

thanks,
katie o'day
president, otao
