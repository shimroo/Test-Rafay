sharing the everlasting good news with the world
 walking in obedience to the creator, in his light, and 
			salvation through his son iehoshua hamashiach. as hebrews 13:8 aptly 
			points out: iehoshua hamashiach the same yesterday, and today, and

              is in need of a saviour.(john 3:16-21
