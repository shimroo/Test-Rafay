                              definitely the only company that i will do
                              business with in the future. with those

the firewood is often
                                          dirty and either wet or
                                          covered in snow as its stored
                                          in outdoor piles.
more often than not there
                                          is a pile of gravel, dirt and
                                          bark to clean up after as well



 




                                        
our pallets are quick and
                                          easy to unstack as the bundles
                                          hold the 
                                          wood together for a neat and
                                          stable stack




 











each 1.4 cubic metre
                                            birch pine or fir pallet is
                                            made up from 48 neat and
                                            consistent bundles. 

                                            each ideally sized bundle
                                            will make at least one nice
                                            long lasting fire on
                                            average. that's 30 to 40
                                            fires per pallet for most
                                            people depending on burning
                                            habits. a bundle is more
                                            wood than most fireplaces
                                            can hold at one time. 
 
the
                                            wood is clean, neatly
                                            stacked and to easy move and
                                            re-stack once the pallet
                                            arrives at your home. 

easy,
                                            neat and slick.

                                            canada firewood, we take
                                            pride in strategically
                                            packing the bundles to get
                                            the most possible
                                            wood.  when we unpack
                                            all of this wood on a 48
                                            bundle pine pallet and
                                            unstack it, it consumes a
                                            footprint of approximately
                                            4x4x4 making it close to
                                            half chord in volume. 
                                            

                                            on our 1.4 m3 pallets there
                                            are 48 tight stacked bundles
                                            that come to approx 50 to
                                            55cu ft ,  which is
                                            only slightly less than a
                                            half a cord. bulk wood is
                                            not tight stacked so you are
                                            unlikely to get even close
                                            to the proper measurement.
                                            with loose cord wood a half
                                            cord is usually less than a
                                            third of cord when stacked.
                                              

                                            our tight stacked pallets of
                                            bundles are consistently
                                            sized and very close to size
                                            we claim them to be, we
                                            believe consumers benefit
                                            from packaging this wood
                                            tightly.

another


















                                            way of looking at this is by
                                            the weight.  a full
                                            chord of dry pine weighs an
                                            average of 2,290 pounds (see
                                            http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/home/heating_cooling/firewood.html 



























                                            ).  the average, 
                                            when weighing one of the
                                            skids of pine that contained
                                            36 bundles was 480 kg or
                                            1,056 pounds as this wood
                                            was super dry.  using
                                            this method, our product
                                            will be just slightly under
                                            a half chord,  if the
                                            wood was not as dry it would
                                            be slightly over.






our firewood is
                                      guaranteed to be dry and properly
                                      seasoned unlike the vast majority
                                      of firewood in the area, most
                                      birch firewood sold in calgary is
                                      less than a year old and not
                                      seasoned properly.  all of
                                      our premium firewood is moisture
                                      tested to insure it is ready to
                                      burn. 

                                        we will not sell unseasoned
                                        birch firewood and we guarantee
                                        that. 
generally we are
                                      a bit more cost wise, but when it
                                      all comes down to a fair
                                      comparison, we are pretty much the
                                      same as most others. our wood is
                                      handled more, aged longer and
                                      stored properly, so it has to cost
                                      a bit more than wood treated like
                                      gravel and stored in piles on wet
                                      ground. 

                                      we feel that hand selected, tight
                                      stacked firewood pallets add a lot
                                      of value and insure quality. we've
                                      been doing this for close to 20
                                      years and still have many of our
                                      original clients from the
                                      beginning. they stick with us for
                                      reason. 

try our pallets just once
                                        and you'll see the difference .
