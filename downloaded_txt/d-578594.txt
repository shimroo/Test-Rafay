âi have been with evan howell properties for a year now and this company is an
                                    absolute godsend. they have managed my townhouse and the tenant's issues - from the
                                    little things monthly that come up, to a leak that they responded to immediately -
                                    they handle everything promptly and appropriately. shana is a joy to ... work with,
                                    and i would recommend this company to anyone!!â

âevan howell properties has provided us intel and analysis that has allowed us to
                                    evaluate investment opportunities and lower our property taxes. as real estate
                                    represents our family's largest investments, we need to make informed decisions.

                                    the city of houston aggressively increased our home's appraisal by 20% and thus ...
                                    property taxes by about 10%. shana assisted us in the valuation of our home and what
                                    we needed to communicate to the city.

                                    we are quite confident that her analysis will save us money for many years going
                                    forward.â

                                    everything and very cordial and easy to work with. i definitely found a great

âevan has made having rental properties one of the best decisions we've made. we were

                                    everything and that he does. finding quality tenants, keeping the property in great
                                    shape with his awesome crew, collecting rent and dealing with any issues. i
                                    recommend him to anyone ... that i can. looking for a pm, look no further.â

âshana provided us with a property market report as we were considering selling our

                                    better hands when navigating the realty world. shana was focused and honest as we
                                    discussed our property value. i felt very well informed to make the right decisions

                                your investment









flat-rate fee
$149 a month is all we charge. we don't believe in percentage-based management, as we
                                strive to deliver the same high-quality service to all properties, regardless of
                                value














how
                                    do you handle delinquencies and evictions?



we follow a strict procedure which includes legal notice of contract breach,
                                        personal contact with the tenant in an effort to work things out and ultimately
                                        a court hearing, judgment and eviction if necessary. in such rare cases, we
                                        utilize a third party specialist - texas eviction llc, who handle filing the
                                        proper paperwork and all court communication.
a full service eviction can cost about $500.00. if your tenant requires a
                                        constable escorted eviction this can cost more because owners are responsible
                                        for the cost of moving a tenant personal belongings out of the residence and to
                                        the curb. we only see about 1-2 constable escorted evictions each year. 





how
                                    are maintenance requests handled?



our standard management agreement includes emergency service consent as well as
                                        authorization of non-emergency repairs up to $500. for non-emergency repairs
                                        estimated to exceed this threshold, no work is initiated without your approval.
                                        however, we need to be aware of landlord tenant laws which provide us with
                                        specific timelines on repairs being done, so time is of the essence when dealing
                                        with repairs at your property. in addition, we charge no additional overhead for
                                        maintenance orders of any size and all are included as part of the monthly
                                        management fee.
we utilize a large network of licensed local contractors, most of which have been
                                        doing work for us for many years. we are experts in finding you the best price
                                        for the job, and require all our third-party vendors to have the highest level
                                        of professionalism and quality.





what
                                    areas do you serve?



we are in the process of narrowing down our geographic region in an effort to
                                        provide excellent service to our customers. the best way to find out if we can
                                        assist you with management is sending us an inquiry on our contact form on the
                                        main page and provide the address of property.

trust that as a professional property manager and fiduciary, we will always work
                                        in your best interest. it is also important to understand that rentals are an
                                        investment, and sometimes investments require money in order to increase in
                                        value.
we want to be a good fit for our clients, and our clients to be a good fit for
