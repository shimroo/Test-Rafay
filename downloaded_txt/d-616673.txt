					welcome to 
					piecemaking llc owned by b.j. reed. here i showcase some 
					of my contremporary art quilts. i started my fiber art 
					journey as a surface dyer and fiber painter then 
					branched out into digitizing home embroideries, teaching classes in 
					surface design techniques and contemporary quilting. 


					i work out of my art studio where i create original 
					fiber art pieces.

enjoy 
						the view!
