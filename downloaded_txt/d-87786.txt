the last apartment in houma


jan. 29th, 2016 at 4:43 pm



 


pshaw_ravenit started almost immediately. i knew the place wasn't in great shape, but it was the only apartment in town.the neighbor's bathtub overflowed and soaked the carpet in my unit. since i'd just moved in, a lot of stuff was still in boxes - cardboard boxes. sketchbooks, manuscripts, all kinds of papers soaking up smelly burst-pipe carpet water like sponges. the weather was at least being decent, so it was possible to open the windows and get some air flowing, and it seemed like a nice gesture when one of the maintenance men brought a couple of blowers specifically to help dry things out.you wouldn't think those things use a lot of power, but you should have seen my light bill.at that point, i assumed the ridiculous security deposit was forfeit. even though it wasn't anyone's fault, i know how landlords work.as i said, it wasn't the best apartment in the world, but it was okay. for several weeks, sewage would back up into the bathtub, usually when you were trying to shower before work. they eventually fixed it. i shared a hot water heater with three other apartments, and eventually they upgraded it and it would produce enough hot water to allow you to shower for ten minutes rather than five.one night, i came home and went to the kitchen to start dinner and for a brief, bizarre moment i couldn't figure out why the floor was making squishy noises. it was because the dishwasher next door had failed and, once again, flooded my apartment. i managed to mop up most of the water, but it was challenging to get someone out at eight o'clock in the evening on a friday. i'm not asking asking you to put up new blinds, people, i'm flooded and i'm pretty sure the neighbors aren't going to be happy when they get home.five years later they replaced the kitchen tiles. which just proves that old saw you hear about squeaky wheels getting the grease.when the time came to move, we put in a lot of work on the place. i even dismantled the shelves in the refrigerator so i could wash down the interior. i vacuumed as thoroughly as i ever have. i even bought a small can of paint and touched up scuffed spots on the walls. i wasn't expecting any of my deposit back, but i had since gotten a job where i myself was an agent of a landlord, and i knew how frustrating a trashed apartment could be. they stay offline longer, take more money to fix up, and they piss of the maintenance workers.imagine my surprise when i got my deposit back. the check didn't even bounce!

shop 'til you drop


jan. 22nd, 2016 at 1:56 pm



 


pshaw_raventhey're all basically the same, no matter which company owns them. they look similar both inside and out. mostly the same stores pop up in each one - sears, hot topic, hallmark. the landscaping is usually different from region to region, though, and here you'll find palm trees and elephant ears, while in tennessee you might find dogwoods. and the only ones that are worth my time have bookstores.i actually do not like shopping malls. aside from the message to spend rampantly on stuff you may or may not need, they're echoing torture chambers filled with strangers. it's the noise that bothers me worse than the crowds. not only do you have the mumbling roar of hundreds of shoppers, there's the "main mall" piped music, and each individual store's piped music, often there's a wailing child, and may the gods help you if it's got one of those little trains.one coping strategy that has worked for me in other stressful environments is to wear ear buds. i don't have to have any music playing, but earbuds serve a dual purpose. they help block and filter some of the noise, and they're a visual signal to other people to not talk to me. i'm not here to browse, i'm not here to hang out and chat. i'm here to buy another bottle of twilight woods lotion from bath & body works. i know what i need and where it is.well, i almost know where it is. even in a mall i've visited dozens of times, i get lost. i believe they're designed that way, to essentially force you to window-shop by getting you turned around. since i normally park in a particular area and go in through a particular entrance, if i happen to go in another way, i may have to ask google maps where the hell i am. in orange park, i park on the north end near books-a-million. over half the stops i make at that mall are just to go to the bookstore.i don't mind hanging out with you at the mall, let's just make it one of those open, outdoor malls, okay?

just a buck


jan. 8th, 2016 at 1:25 pm



 


pshaw_ravenlate last year, fox signed me up for a service called bobcat in a box. based on an xkdc comic, this bot goes online every day and purchases an item with a cost of one american dollar or less, and has free shipping. you wouldn't think there would be a lot of stuff out there for under a buck that ships for free, but it's amazing what shows up in the mailbox. so it was a smart move on his part - i like small random objects i can use in my art, and i like receiving mail. it makes me feel important.ads are always asking, "what can you get for a dollar nowadays?" usually the answer is something like a taco, or one day of life insurance, or feeding a kid in some third world country. so far, i've gotten lots of costume jewelry, a pad of sticky notes shaped like band-aids, a plastic mushroom, a tiny wooden sign, a toy animal that might be a shark, and a spudger. to my mind, this is money well spent.sometimes, though, i find myself wondering about all the other costs associated with this. everything i've gotten so far has come from china. some human has to stick an item in an envelope and either take it to the post office, or another human comes and picks it up. then it gets put on, i assume, an airplane and flown over to america, where more humans handle the package, put it on trucks, take it off trucks, until it ends up with my rural route carrier who plonks it into my mailbox. each one of those humans does this because it's their job - some other human gives them money to do it. but how much jet fuel and diesel does this use up? what about the manufacturing of all those little plastic envelopes?but back to the service. you sign up from month to month and pay thirty dollars up front. if you want to, you can auto-renew. thirty bucks is not an inconsiderable amount of money - it could be part of someone's rent money, or it could buy enough food to get a small family through the week. thirty dollars could get you a nice hardback book, a pair of pants, or a bottle of liquor. if you split it in half, you've got fifteen dollars, which might get you a printed t-shirt, or a couple of manga. split into thirds, it's ten dollars, which is about what you might spend on a fast food lunch. but what else can you get for a single dollar? at the farmers' market, it might get me a cabbage, a couple of lemons, or some mushrooms. by itself, though, a dollar doesn't get you much at all. even a bottle of coke or a bag of chips is more than a dollar, and then there's sales tax.what can you get for a dollar nowadays? nothing, really. if you've got thirty of them, though, you can get a whole bunch of weird chinese crap!

the tycoon


dec. 28th, 2015 at 10:57 am



 


pshaw_raven"i want to play 'railroad tycoon' again. can you get it to run?"my now ex-husband was completely serious about this. he loved an old dos game that allowed you to run a railroading empire against the big business tycoons of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. it used to run on an ancient mac book, a so-called laptop that was the size of a dictionary. i sighed."i guess."hey, if he's playing that maybe he won't have time to make fun of me for playing katamari.i am more computer literate than some people, but i'm not a big-time hacker. i did all of my own maintenance and repairs on a g4 macintosh, and got a crusty old windows box up and running, so figuring out a way to make a dos game run on ... well, one of the two computers shouldn't be too hard, right?"so, did you figure out how to run 'railroad tycoon' yet?""i'm at work. i'll mess with it when i get home.""the printer's not working, either.""what's it doing?""it won't print."i rubbed the corners of my eyes. i wanted to ask him what kind of not working. "just reboot the entire system. shut down the mac, then the printer, and don't turn the printer back on until the mac is booted up."i have no idea why, but this solved the majority of my printer woes.that evening and into the weekend, i spent most of my time on the "railroad project." i downloaded more dos emulators than i can remember, testing each one on the windows computer with a copy of 'tycoon' for windows. i enjoyed visitng the abandonware sites looking for it - there were games available that i hadn't played in decades. and i wasn't going to get to play them again, because once this was running, he could basically lock up both computers at once.i had my laptop, so that was something.

draw one


dec. 7th, 2015 at 12:50 pm



 


pshaw_ravenabout ten years ago, i started collecting cards. some of them are tarot decks, and some are other kinds of divination cards. when i bought my second deck, i had one tarot deck in my possession that i'd acquired in college, and had gotten pretty dog-eared and beaten up over time. i try to be careful when handling my cards, and with that old college deck i learned that some kinds of shuffling are harder on your cards than others.since i lean towards unusual, small-run decks, my collection isn't enormous. occasionally i'd see a set featured on a tarot website and pounce on it - i was able to acquire a copy of the lunatic tarot that way, though when my deck arrived it was missing three cards. friends who knew about it started pointing me towards things i might like, or gifting me decks. soon i had crow's magick, pathfinders, deviant moon, and the saints deck.my tastes are a bit dark, and when i moved in with walkertxkitty we effectively doubled our card collections. we wound up not sharing decks, though, and i soon found out that we'd learned to read in entirely different ways. she had been taught very traditional methods, where i had done my own studying and come up with a somewhat haphazard but effective way of using mine.your mileage, though, like your cards, may vary.

chinese tea eggs - step by step


oct. 16th, 2015 at 1:16 pm



 


pshaw_ravenokay - so i've been making these eggs for almost fifteen years now, and since some of you expressed an interest, i'm going through the recipe with photos and explaining how to do it. the cookbook i originally found this recipe in was an old maybe 60's era chinese cookbook. i now just do it from memory, and have tweaked and changed things over time. you should feel free to change some of the seasonings here - there's a good bit of sodium in here, but you don't really need to salt the finished eggs. the soy sauce and salt in the cooking liquid makes them salty enough for me. anyway, step one is boil yourself some eggs. i put six eggs into a pan with enough cold water to cover them, then put them on medium-high heat and slowly bring the temperature up to a boil. then leave them at a gentle boil for ten minutes.once they're done, i usually put them in a colander and run cold water over them until they're cool enough to handle. in the meantime, get your seasoning together. put three cups of water in the pot and add the following:1 teaspoon salt1 tablespoon each - regular soy sauce and dark soy sauce2 tbs black tea (about six teabags)1 tbs grated orange or lemon peel1/4 tsp black pepper1 cinnamon stick2 cloves star anisethe dark soy sauce is richer and sweeter than the regular kind. you may have to look around for it, but as you might be able to tell from the pic, the brand i found is reggae country store, a jamaican (obviously) brand that also makes a superb habanero sauce.just add all this stuff to the water and bring it up to a boil. while physics is happening you're going to gently crack the egg shells. like so:gently tap the eggs on a hard surface  until cracks form. tap all around the egg and try to get things fairly even, because the cracks are going to effect how the marbling comes out. put the eggs into the flavored water, cover the pot, and let everything simmer for one hour. it looks weird, but it'll be tasty, i promise.after an hour, take the pot off the heat and let the eggs cool in the liquid. some people store the eggs in the cooking liquid for a more intense flavor, but i scoop them out and refridgerate them in a plastic bag. you can also eat them warm, or chill them.this maybe wasn't the best egg. it was just the one i peeled. leave the shells on until you're ready to eat them or pack them in a lunch. this guy came out flat on the bottom, but the marbling is nice. they last in the fridge for about a week.
