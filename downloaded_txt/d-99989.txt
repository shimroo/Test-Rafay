bolt-on modulesas feature rich as the milonic dhtml menu is, we also have a vast array of optional extras which come in the form of bolt-on modules. we do not include these modules in the full dhtml menu code as they are specialised scripts which the majority of our users would not utilise. modules for automatic dhtml menu opening, keypress dhtml menus, dhtml menu item activating and much more, are available to all of our users at no additional cost and can be downloaded from here.dhtml menu samplesthe dhtml menu samples available 
  demonstrate the versatility of the milonic menu. our extensive dhtml menu samples are split 
  into four categories; standard dhtml menu samples, are our basic and most popular styled 
  dhtml menu samples. functionality dhtml menu samples, show some of the more complex features of the 
  menu including activating functions on mouseover and tooltips. image based dhtml menu samples 
  feature menus which are predominantly made up of images and the random style 
  dhtml menu samples are a collection of styled menus which include various features. 
you may find it helpful to skip through all of the available dhtml menu samples 
  to see which may be suitable for your menu design. all of the examples on our 
  website are available to our users, and downloads include all the necessary 
  files including images. 
each and every one of the dhtml menu samples on this website has been built using a php 
  script with data from a mysql database, this has been made easy due to the menu's 
  fliexible object oriented data strucures.
