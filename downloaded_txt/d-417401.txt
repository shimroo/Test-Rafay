our ships list
 our ships database was developed to assist researchers; it contains mostly canadian ships, but also many ships that were foreign built but traded regularly with canada, or were sold to canadian owners. where available, further details of owners, masters, builders and voyages are also included. the database has been compiled from multiple sources – including tom tumilty's shipwreck research and the canadian heritage information network's previous heritage list.
