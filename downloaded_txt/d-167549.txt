about silkie
the beautiful silkie bantams
silkie bantams are some of the most charming and beguiling oddities of the poultry fancy. they possess many characteristics that set them apart from the other breeds of chickens; the most obvious being the texture of their feathers which is almost fur or silk-like in appearance – hence their name. feathers have several parts to them; the main part being the quill that grows from beneath the skin which tapers off up the center of the feather to become the shaft. from each side of the shaft comes the web which are tiny strands that are held together by small hooks or barbicels on the ends of the strands which gives the feather their typical appearance. the silkie does not have the hooks on the ends of the tiny strands of the web, which are fluffed out rather than held together.
