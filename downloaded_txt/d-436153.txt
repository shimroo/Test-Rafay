 looking for the kajukenbo cafe?from 2002-2023 the kajukenbo cafe message board was one of the few resources for the kajukenbo community. it sparked many discussions and conversations, some good and some bad but for the most part it was a place where we as a community could connect. i am proud to have hosted the cafe but the time has come to modernize for the next generation. i’d like to say thank you to all of the folks that were a part of this community; rob poelking (who started the cafe), community members; john bishop, john bono, mark gerry, rob peladeau, emil bautista, dan weston, mitch powell, greg harper, jason goldsmith, anthony hemenes, david amiccuci, rick kingi, gary forbach, and of course my father alan reyes for being advocates for discussion and openness. as a courtesy we have archived the cafe here.mahalo, sigung christopher reyes.
