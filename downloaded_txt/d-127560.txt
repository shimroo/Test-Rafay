review by musclassia

guts - nightmare fuel

review by andymetalfreak



8.0


guts is a very familiar word used in death metal, and their music is equally familiar, albeit with more groove than most.

abattoir's concert hunt - the autumn charm (2024)


			by abattoir
 jan 22

as i was preparing a schedule of the upcoming gigs i had planned to attend this past autumn, it turned into quite the quandary. the list of tours/shows that were popping up basically every week for months prior had become quite long. not to complain though, but i had to cut off a couple of them due to an overlapping and over-concentrated agenda. this is the recap of the entire 2024 autumn.

splitting hairs / hearing splits (jul-dec 2024)


			by radup, musclassia, nikarg, f3ynman, starvynth, andymetalfreak
 jan 19

we regularly review full lengths, collaborations, sometimes even live albums. eps and demos often get love in our clandestine cuts series. heck, we even review a bunch of stuff that isn't metal. but when was the last time you saw a review of a split album? exactly! we are here to make up for that!
