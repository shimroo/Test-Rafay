the beauty of finished software [link]
posted october 31st, 2023 @ 03:35pm by erik j. barzeski


the beauty of finished software:
when we buy a physical product, we accept that it won’t change in its lifetime. we’ll use it until it wears off, and we replace it. we can rely on that product not evolving; the gas pedal in my car will always be in the same place.
however, when it comes to software, we usually have the ingrained expectations of perpetual updates. we believe that if software doesn’t evolve it’ll be boring, old and unusable. if we see an app with no updates in the last year, we think the creator might be dead.

icloud private relay
posted june 25th, 2023 @ 12:02pm by erik j. barzeski


i am liking icloud private relay. one feature, though, that i wish it had… let me specify an ip address or a website domain name for which i don't want it to be active. a "whitelist" of sorts.
i administrate a few sites, and it's a hassle to turn the feature off and turn it on. i appreciate the "reload and show ip address" option, but that doesn't work for new tabs from the same session and it's something you have to do every time.

disable throttling of low-priority background i/o, then re-enable it.

sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0
sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=1

pro macbook pro tip: have a touch bar with touch id? if you edit /etc/pam.d/sudo and add the following line to the top…
auth sufficient pam_tid.so
…you can now use your fingerprint to sudo!

applescripting do not disturb mode in big sur (macos 11.0)
posted june 19th, 2021 @ 10:20am by erik j. barzeski


is it possible to applescript or use a shell script or programmatically turn on (and off) do not disturb mode in big sur (macos 11.x)?
this github project worked in 10.14 and 10.15 but requires more than we're willing to do to work around it in big sur.
any ideas?
p.s. will look at this but i don't think it's any better. just no time to look at the code right now.

2019 glasses/contacts eye prescription
posted march 13th, 2019 @ 12:52pm by erik j. barzeski


so… it's been awhile. i don't think i wrote my 2015 prescription down, nor my switch to the oakley barrelhouse 0.5 frames. i'm sticking with the same frames (in a "matte midnight" color, which has a strong blue tint to it).
my prescription and eyesight actually improved quite a bit. i was -1.25 in both eyes, and am now -1.00 in the right and -0.50 in the left. i hadn't noticed before how bad my eyesight had gotten (with my glasses) out of my left eye, but now i can see it… anyway:
left:sph -0.50, cyl -2.50, ax 143
right: sph -1.00, cyl -2.50, ax 50
in contacts that's a softlens 66 toric at -100/-050, -225 x 50/150.

mojave boots right through single user mode
posted october 5th, 2018 @ 07:12pm by erik j. barzeski


in trying to troubleshoot my two-month-old macbook pro with touchbar (2018) ((the front-right usb-c port has never worked - no power, no data, nothing.)), i tried booting into single user mode. this had previously worked, but for some reason, it now boots right through it. the text appears on the screen, small like always, and then i get the progress bar and the computer prompts me to log in with the normal login screen.
the macbook pro has a t2 chip and thus has the boot security, but those are set to full security.
filevault is not enabled. i've checked that a few times.
i'm not sure what's going on here, but the inability to boot into single user mode (cmd-s during startup) is troubling.

i have to reset spamsieve - my corpus is so old and so weighted toward what spam used to be that it's not as effective as it can/should be now, so i thought i'd do this one last time.

fixing the t.co and safari problem
posted february 16th, 2016 @ 01:06pm by erik j. barzeski


dscacheutil -flushcache
that's apparently all it takes. a more permanent (actual) fix in safari is on its way.
i hope this also fixes the delay in loading actual twitter pages, too, like lowest score wins (@lowscorewins) | twitter.
