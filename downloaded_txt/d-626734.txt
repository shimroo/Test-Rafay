virtual universe 'home' for ps3





i can't wait:capitalizing on the popularity of social networks and online worlds, sony corp. will launch its virtual universe and a 3-d game built almost entirely by players."home" is a real-time, networked world for the playstation 3 in which players create human-looking characters called avatars. the concept is strikingly similar to linden lab's "second life," a web-based phenomenon with nearly 4.5 million residents. but sony's world will feature heavy doses of video games for avatars to play, as well as virtual arcades, music and other sony-approved media downloads.sony will launch a beta version in april and officially debut "home" this fall as a free download at playstation's online store.more
