ince 1977, the quarterly review of wines has sought to be the most trustworthy source for wines. in 2011, we discontinued our print magazines while continuing online at qrw.com. honoring our commitment to providing our readers with truly unbiased and accurate information, we have decided to discontinue advertising of any kind. additionally we shall not charge subscription fees. no login or passwords required. no telephone numbers to call or email addresses to enter. just visit qrw.com and it will be there for you to enjoy. all future articles will first be posted on our site — free of charge. once we take it down, we’ll do our best to have it archived.
thank you for your support over the years. we feel this is the best way to say “thank you.”

biggest surprise was piper-heidsieck. it was the first time this champagne
made the cut, and we were impressed by the quality of reserve wine in the
cuvée, along with its flavor and texture. wine like this deserves a story
so we inquired about this with piper’s new ceo, cecile bonnefond.
