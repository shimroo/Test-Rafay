the only criticism we have is that i have a shellfish allergy and some of the dishes that we chose we were advised would not be suitable as they were cooked in the same pan as food that cooked shellfish.  we were very surprised about that with such an upmarket restaurant.  one of the courses we did chose had something that was cooked in a pan that had cooked shellfish and they just left that part of the dish off which was good.

we would definitely visit the restaurant again.more infothe ivy asia, brightonâ£â£â£â£price: very expensiveâ¢ contemporary asianâ¢ brightonâ¢4.3cchuxuanbrighton â¢1 review5.0dined 3 days agoweâre 4 people.we order the different kinds of steak and pork belly.
