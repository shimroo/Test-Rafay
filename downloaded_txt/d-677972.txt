										   welcome






										welcome to the mre website. below you can read a little bit about us and what we do.

										we have a complete understanding of foreclosures, deed-in-lieus, and property takeovers; including the sale of multiple "as-is" properties for reo companies, asset management companies, banks, and other types of investors as well.

										we are very motivated and take pride in our on time performance. currently we staff 
										3 people who work directly with the reo properties 
										handling things like offers, purchase and sale contracts, cash for keys, weekly property checks, bpo's, mmr's, and more.

										we currently have 2 licensed real estate agents who work out of my office full time.

										as the market continues to change marty's real estate continues to evolve with those changes.
