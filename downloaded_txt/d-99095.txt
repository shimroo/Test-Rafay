plans is all done!



oh no, what?!

with some regret, i am announcing an end to further development on plans.  it's been a worthwhile and gratifying project.

for several years, plans was at the forefront of web calendaring, thanks to the contributions of a dedicated community.  giant thanks to them.

so why quit?

because i do not have the necessary time to support the project.  that's the part i regret.

well, what alternatives are there?


google calendar is a highly worthly alternative.  its support for international languages and resource scheduling are excellent.

it also has "flair" icons :) 

but what about all the bugs?!

plans is open-source, so anyone can jump in, fix bugs, add features, and contribute.

the project infrastructure (the svn repository, this website, the google group) will remain indefinitely, and i'll support them).

thanks once again to everyone who has contributed to this project.  it has been wonderful to work with you.
