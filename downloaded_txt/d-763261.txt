for 
                  a culturally enriching, private historical tour of venice and
                  an educational experience unlike any other, choose a
                  leading expert to guide you through the world's most extraordinary city and
                  help you unlock its inner secrets.


no 
                  where else will you find
                  refreshingly innovative guided tours conceived
                  exclusively for the inquisitive traveler who truly wants to
                  understand the birth, development, and world-wide influence of venice while
                  walking through the city and enjoying its unique lifestyle, culture, art, and architecture.


together,
                  we'll stroll the quieter streets and discover just how and why
                  venice grew and changed over its long and eventful history,
                  how it lives and works today, and what its unique
                  contributions have been to the evolution of western
                  civilization.


along 
                  the way, we'll visit hidden treasures of the
                  city that are closed to the general public; tour world-renowned
                  landmarks, private homes, and simple artisan workshops; and
                  see incomparable artistic and architectural masterpieces but
                  in a way that will give them unexpected new meaning and life
                  and change forever your way of looking at venice.

                   




                          the real secret of discovering venice is finding someone who knows and understands the myriad of
                          historical and religious connections that created and then ultimately destroyed venice as a world power.  that secret is venicescapes!

                          our walking tour experiences in venice were simply
                          awesome!  the excellent organization venicescapes made the
                          complex and heretofore unfamiliar history of venice engaging
                          and clear.  no amount of outside reading could ever have brought that
                          story to life in the same way that our venicescapes walking tour did.

                          it was less a guided tour than a seminar, an intellectually
                          stimulating exchange that more than matched my expectations.

                          the guide's knowledge of history seemed boundless, and his
                          insights on politics, economics, and
                          religion were fascinating.  [...]  he truly had an uncanny
                          ability to tie all aspects together and paint a comprehensive
                          picture of venice....
