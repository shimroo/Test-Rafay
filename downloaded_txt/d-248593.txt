henion dicing: now more than ever your total resource
henion dicing products, llc has acquired the bolton dicer product line and will continue to service and support all dicing customers from their headquarters and manufacturing facility, in kennesaw, ga.
this purchase gives henion the capability to manufacture and rebuild the bolton 18” dicer model to original factory specifications.  henion has and will continue to rebuild bolton 9” machines.  since most of the bolton 18” dicers already use henion cutters and bed knives, this transaction will give dicing customers a single source for their dicing needs.
bolton has been a leader in dicing machine sales for several decades and has used henion precision style cutters and bed knives in many of their machines.  henion dicing products, llc remains committed to the continued support of old and new henion customers as well as current bolton dicer customers.  many companies already own and use both brands of dicers in their manufacturing facilities and they now have a one-stop shop for all of their dicing needs.
