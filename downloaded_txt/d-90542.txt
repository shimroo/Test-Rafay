	 mussels in white wine broth
	 
    


mussels with white wine can be a very romantic dinner. i like to prepare this for my husband when the kids are away. serve this to your significant other with a nice glass of your favourite white or red wine, a french baguette and voila! an intimate dinner for two.ingredients2 pounds of fresh mussels (de-bearded and washed well)2 cups of your favourite white wine1 package of knorr vegetable soup mix1/2 cup of green onions diced1/2 cup of red peppers diced1/2 cup celery diced1 clove of garlic minced3 tbsp. olive oil1 can (28 fl.oz.) of diced tomatoes1/2 cup of waterdirectionsusing a large saucepan on medium heat, fry green onions, red peppers and celery in olive oil. cook until translucent. pour in mussels, water, wine, diced tomatoes and soup mix. cover and simmer for approx. 30 minutes.now some may argue that i'm overcooking the mussels but i like to let them simmer so they absorb all the great flavours. i also didn't add salt and pepper to the ingredients list because i think the soup mix adds enough salt. you can always add salt and pepper after tasting. enjoy.posted in dinner recipestry a new dessert recipe with this dinner.labels: mussel soup

	 mashed potatoes with fresh rosemary
	 
    


these mashed potatoes are a refreshing change from the "same old". made with chicken stock and fresh rosemary, they're delicious served with any type of meat.ingredients10 medium sized potatoes, peeled and cut3 cups chicken broth15 fresh rosemary leaves, washed and chopped finely3 tablespoons of butter, margarine or olive oil2 teaspoons of garlic powdersalt and pepper to tastedirectionsplace potatoes in a pot and add chicken stock. boil until potatoes are tender enough to mash. the amount of chicken stock you use will vary, depending on the potatoes you're using so you may have to eliminate some of the stock or add more. once potatoes are mashed, add remaining ingredients. as an alternative, you can use beef stock, leftover stock from your turkey at thanksgiving or if you're a vegetarian, knorr vegetable soup mix works great.posted in dinner recipes for other quick and easy recipes click herelabels: mashed potato recipes

	 ham and cheese rice balls
	 
    


rice balls or "arancini" (as we italians like to call them) are a little messy to make but very easy and well worth it, they're delicious.arancini simply means little oranges, which is what they resemble after being fried.this recipe is an excellent way to use up your left-over white rice but if you're making your rice fresh, just be sure to let it cool completely. you'll want to have a large bowl of water nearby to rinse your hands while making them. you can make large ones to serve as a main meal or little ones which make great party appetizers.the nice thing about rice balls is you can use whatever you have handy. some people add peas, chicken, etc. if your mixture is to dry, simply add another egg. if it's too moist, add more freshly grated parmesan cheese or rice. ham and cheese rice balls are normally coated with bread crumbs before frying but i have used flour and they were just as yummy.ingredients3 cups cooked & cooled white rice2 eggs3 tablespoons fresh italian parsley2 cloves fresh garlic1/2 cup of finely chopped ham1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese1 container of mini bocconcini (mozzarella balls)1/2 cup of finely diced green onions1 stalk of celery dicedbread crumbs for coatingitalian marinara saucedirectionscombine all ingredients except bocconcini and breadcrumbs (mixture will be sticky but that's what helps bind them). grab a hand full of rice mixture and form into a ball. using your thumb, make a whole in the center of rice ball and place one mini boccocini inside. reform into a ball making sure cheese if completely covered with rice.heat oil over medium high heat. i usually throw a tiny bit of the rice mixture into the oil to make sure it's hot enough. fry rice balls until they are golden brown. serve with your favorite marinara sauce.posted in dinner recipesfor other delicious recipes click here
