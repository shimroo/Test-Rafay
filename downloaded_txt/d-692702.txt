		belen jesuit preparatory school was founded in 1854 in havana, cuba by queen isabel ii of spain.  the task of educating students was assigned to the priests and brothers of the society of jesus (the jesuits), whose teaching tradition is synonymous with academic excellence and spiritual discipline.  in 1961, the new political regime of cuba confiscated the school property and expelled the jesuit faculty.  the school was re-established in miami the same year, and over the next decade, continued to grow.  today, belen jesuit sits on a 30-acre site in western dade county, only minutes away from downtown miami.
