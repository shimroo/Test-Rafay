audrey, class of 2029
at mt. bethel christian academy, i have made friends that will last me a lifetime.  mbca has not only taught me about god, it has taught me about friendship.  i love my teachers because they are so unique and make me feel so special. all of my teachers are so encouraging. i love mbca!




casey, mbca mom of three
we choose mbca year-after-year, school-after-school, because making disciples is a lot of hard work, and there is a beautiful layering that happens when you have excellence in the classroom and administration that leads to continuity, stability, and loyalty among all the schools.




reya, student ambassador, class of 2024
when some people think of high-school, they get nervous as these four years are crucial into getting in college. i admit that i was nervous about high-school. i want to use this as an opportunity to share my personal experience and give reassurance to others that with the help of your teachers, peers, god, and self-motivation, you can conquer high-school. as a student ambassador, i want to assist and advise newcomers and, also, explain how mbca guide students both academically and spiritually.
