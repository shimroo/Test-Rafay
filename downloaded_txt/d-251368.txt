i like the friendly customer service and the emailed quotes. my sales representative is very knowledgeable and offers me cost saving alternatives. i especially like the firm quoted freight cost that is added to my order.

i’ve dealt with tulsa tube bending for many years. pipe bends that in the past took two to four weeks to deliver can now be turned in three to five working days. these quick project turnarounds are just what my customers are looking for.
