our valuesour mission at green candy press is to ensure that often stigmatized interests and people receive proper consideration through our books and our partnerships. we hope to uplift those who do good work for the community and encourage our patrons to do the same when and where possible.
featured dispensarythe medicine wheel is an indigenous-run dispensary that operates outside the regulations of the canadian government. they frequently provide us with high-quality, great-looking bud for our cookbook photoshoots, and we are happy to clue our readers in to this excellent business.
featured non profitthe last prisoner project is a non-profit organization dedicated to cannabis criminal justice reform. even as the u.s. is steadily legalizing cannabis production and use, there are thousands of people who remain incarcerated for non-violent drug offences that are no longer offences. last prisoner project is looking to change that.
