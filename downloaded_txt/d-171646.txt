our commitment to equityone of evergreen's aspirations is to design and nurture a community that is inclusive, equitable, and supportive of students and families regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identification, economic status, physical and mental abilities, religious values, or political affiliations.foremost in our work at this time is to create greater racial equity at our school.



our commitment to experiential education



we are grounded in the el education standards for student achievement and share the belief that engaging students in work that is challenging, adventurous, and meaningful results in authentic and deep learning and achievement. this model, developed by outward bound and harvard graduate school of education, challenges teachers and students to make learning relevant and to gain knowledge and understanding based on their first-hand experiences.students are actively involved in learning, and they are encouraged to take ownership of the learning process and the production of high-quality work.



our commitment to changing the world













since our founding in 1999, evergreen has empowered more than 9,000 students to do big things through academic mastery, character development, and craftpersonship. as a tuition-free public charter school, government funding per student is significantly less than traditional public schools and we receive zero funding for capital improvements. the evergreen fund bridges the funding gap. it heats our school during the winter. it ensures we can provide counseling services. it staffs our classrooms with associate teachers. it funds educational programming that not only teaches students about physics and algebra, but also how to be good people.
