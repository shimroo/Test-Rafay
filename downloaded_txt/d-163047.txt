trial investigates ketamine’s role in stopping epilepsy seizures




university of virginia brain institute and school of medicine researchers have received an initial $9.3 million award from the national institutes of health for a $30 million clinical trial to determine if the powerful anesthetic ketamine can save patients from prolonged, life-threatening grand mal seizures that won’t respond to other treatments. “status epilepticus,” as the seizures are known, are seizures that last more than five minutes or that strike repeatedly without the person regaining consciousness between seizures. these ceaseless seizures are considered…

new study sheds light on pelvic tissue tears in childbirth


grant enables study into mechanical properties of episiotomy cuts  millions of women undergo episiotomies during childbirth every year, yet the mechanics behind these surgical cuts remain largely unstudied. a new research project is poised to change that, addressing this significant gap in women’s health. an episiotomy involves cutting the pelvic-floor muscles to aid delivery, a technique currently guided largely by a surgeon’s personal judgment and experience. while intended to prevent severe vaginal tears or other complications during delivery, the procedure…

d2-gcn: dynamic disentanglement for node classification


classic graph convolutional networks (gcns) often learn node representation holistically, which would ignore the distinct impacts from different neighbors when aggregating their features to update a node’s representation. disentangled gcns have been proposed to divide each node’s representation into several feature channels. however, current disentangling methods do not try to figure out how many inherent factors the model should assign to help extract the best representation of each node. to solve the problems, a research team led by chuliang weng published…
