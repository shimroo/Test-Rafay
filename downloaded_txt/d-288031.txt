 all about lip augmentation and lip implants - a lip enhancement resource
ample, luscious, perfect lips have always had their admirers. among them was alfred, lord tennyson, the 19th century english poet who wrote what could truly be considered an ode to beautiful lips:
“a man had given all other bliss,
and all his worldly worth for this,
to waste his whole heart in one kiss
upon her perfect lips”
a plump pout is universally synonymous with youth, and an icon of sensuality. i love full, pouty lips. in fact, i feel lips are the most youthful aspect of a face, especially when complimented by high cheeks.
since modern medicine has made it possible for us to be healthier, more active and younger-looking than we are, we aren't about to settle for less without a fight. whether we pursue perfection through products (cosmetics) or procedures (plastic surgery), the means exist to get us where we want to go.
for years women have utilized all sorts of devices, injectables, lip enhancement surgery, over the counter plumping products< and manual massage to achieve pucker perfection â and yet the search continues for the ideal lips. today, when it comes to lip augmentation, there have never been more options available to enhance what mother nature gave you!
i have experienced lip greed myself. over the last 7 years i have researched lip augmentation products and have undergone numerous lip enhancement surgeries to achieve the desired size and shape for me. and they're all covered here, along with my personal commentary, just for you.
