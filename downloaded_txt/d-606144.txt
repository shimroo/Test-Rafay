summer camp
woodland lakes is devoted to creating a safe and nurturing environment where campers can grow spiritually, socially, emotionally, and physically while enjoying god’s creation. campers are provided the opportunity to better understand themselves, their relationship to god, and the people in their lives so they can apply their faith in every day life.  we invite you to join us for a summer that is sure to change lives forever.  we offer programs for individual campers 5 yrs old through high school as well as parent (or grandparent) and child programs and family camps.  your family’s summer adventure awaits at woodland lakes!
