the new york times: "defiantly original"the new yorker: "wonderous...a gem"the washington post: "an irresistable comic novel"the boston globe: "dazzling"npr: "superb"  

















 matthew klam's novel who is rich? is available from random house. the new york times: "...sometimes, miraculously, a writer manages to breathe some new life into a subject. matthew klam, author of “who is rich?,” turns out to be one of those writers....funny, maddening and defiantly original....gifted at discussing complicated themes... it’s a challenging novel, but klam’s prose is so clean, so self-assured, that it feels a little like a miracle... maybe it’s a love story; maybe it’s just a lust story, but either way, it’s a fine accomplishment. here’s hoping we won’t have to wait another 17 years for the return of this singularly gifted writer."the new yorker: "who is rich?' is a gem within the canon of infidelity literature. ...fischer is a wonderful narrator, lacerating and gentle... comic, wondrous, and sad."boston globe: "it’s a dazzling meditation on monogamy, parenthood, mortality, shame, erotic liberation, and artistic struggle, a tale told by an adulterous middle-aged schlub, full of sound and fury, and signifying, well, pretty much everything."washington post: "this is an irresistible comic novel that pumps blood back into the anemic tales of middle-aged white guys. klam may be working in a well-established tradition, but he’s sexier than richard russo and more fun than john updike...""i just finished who is rich? and i seriously, deeply love this book."--- michael cunningham"it's amazing to wait so long for a book, and for it to be everything you wanted. the most singular quality of matthew klam's writing is how alive it is. i loved every page of this book. it got into my bloodstream -- and kind of destroyed me." -- curtis sittenfeld"what a thrill to experience the fusion of matthew klam's fierce, kinetic prose with the mysteries of fatherhood and domesticity.  who is rich? is an electric amalgam of frustration and tenderness, wonder and rebellion:  a paean to the obliterating power of parental love."-- jennifer egan"who is rich? is a tantalizing novel -- acute and smart and stark, but mostly it's unrelentingly funny about a large number of very inappropriate things.  it's one of those rare books: you open it, then you're up all night.  i was." -- richard ford"like many people, i've been eagerly awaiting another book by matthew klam, and here it is and it's a stunner.  this, his first novel, is funny, dark, big and bold.  i read it straight through, with great pleasure and awe at all he knows about art, money, family, sex, kids, mortality, and shame.  who is rich? is not to be missed." -- meg wolitzer"matthew klam is a brilliant satirist and keen observer of unequal america, and his new novel takes a hard look at society's extravagant hypocrisies. his work is thrilling and distinctive -- and political in a way that is not always noted because it is also so funny. who is rich? is long awaited and first rate." -- lorrie moore"by turns fierce, disturbing, and outright hilarious, who is rich? is much more than a novel of midlife crisis, it's a frank exploration of what it feels like to struggle as an artist, and a man. klam writes like a surgeon, with the sharpest scalpel, and cuts to the bone."– jonathan tropper, author of this is where i leave you "i've arrived late at the brilliant bash that is who is rich? and there's simply nothing left for me to say, except that i agree with every word my fellow party-goers have beat me to saying."-- peter cameron"the book is hilarious. who is rich? is also an important work of fiction, not only for the mastery of narrative techniques, but for the boldness of imagination. not since richard yates’ revolutionary road have i read a novel that delves so provocatively into the often painful machinations of marriage and the complexities of life with small children. nothing has been withheld or dissembled. matthew klam is an original american storyteller of the first rank." -- philip schultz, winner of the 2008 pulitzer prize in poetry
