	 americans in the hot seat
	 
    


america, the global target"hoping to lower tensions between the mus-lim world and the west, british prime minister tony blair maintained the other day that the world confronts "a clash about civilization," not "a clash between civilizations." but the overriding lesson of events since sept. 11, 2001, may be that you can't have one without the other.in radical isl-amic propaganda, the united states has graduated from being a mere great satan out to undermine iran's ayatollahs to being depicted as a global monster responsible for virtually every crime and failing since the dawn of modern history. meet the new jews: the americans.don't misunderstand. americans have not replaced jews at the top of the hate parade in is-lamic countries. but the history of anti-semitism, a word coined in germany to provide a bogus scientific basis for prejudice against jews, and its spread in recent years across the middle east as an all-purpose explanation of whatever is wrong, should give americans no cause for complacency.the centrality of american power to global change -- good and bad, economic and political, topsy and turvy -- inevitably carries with it a heavy burden abroad of resentment and opposition. in the wake of sept. 11 and wars in iraq and afghanistan, a widespread stereotyping and a visceral hatred that imputes racial characteristics to national policies and actions have also taken hold.the distemper of these global times can be read in a wide variety of settings, where this new virulent anti-americanism competes with historical anti-semitism as a single explanation for the failures and delusions of entire nations..second, americans need to recognize that the problems we face in the middle east are bigger than the failings or mistakes of bush & co. those problems would not fade quickly if u.s. troops left iraq tomorrow."hatred.someone commits a hate crime every hour in the good ole u.s.a.and at least three jews become hate crime victims.american history is rife with prejudice against groups and individuals because of their race, including blacks as well as jews...however, the 20th century witnessed tremendous progress in outlawing discrimination, and nowadays most upstanding americans are against any form of bigotry.but "hate groups" such as izlamofacists haven't caught up with the times.they must produce   stereotypes, the evil jew, the arrogant american, to justify  their unequal treatment,terror and to maintain an atmosphere of rage among their people.at different times in history hate wore different faces...today the jew and the american have earned the spotlight.the murderous izlamofacists and the pc-dominated left wing groups who appease these enemies and publicly defame our soldiers, now unite. acceptance of differences and tolerance of others , however is human choice. it stems from a deep rooted  belief that all people are valuable, that no one is inherently less than another. not exactly consistent with izlamofacist indoctrination now is it?tony blair maintained the other day that the world confronts "a clash about civilization,"...the left wingers are nothing but a poor blend of fascist, communist, and socialist ideologies ..couple that with empathy for izlmofacists...and there is no longer "civilization".curtsy: to karl m.

	 what do we really own?
	 
    


fallen troops' effects handled with care medals, mail -- maybe even a forbidden pup. these folks get it home."aberdeen, md. - the personal stuff they carried to war, the remnants of lives lost in iraq, was spread neatly across long tables in a drafty warehouse last week.mortuary affairs troops wearing surgical gloves at the joint personal effects depot went about the tedious work of counting and separating out what belonged to the soldier and what belonged to the government... in three years of war, lt. col. deborah skillman, the depot's commander, said her unit at the military's aberdeen proving ground has cut the time for getting the personal effects back to the families from 45 to 22 days.but the checklist efficiency does little to relieve the stress of handling, photographing and doing the inventory on the last items a fallen comrade may have held, laughed about, cared about."you're touching somebody's life here," said army capt. cathy carman, 34, of eustis, fla., who is in charge of the section that carefully packs and boxes up the belongings for shipment home."it's an emotional job; nobody here will argue about that," carman said. she gestured to a box of tissues kept nearby for the 120 troops and civilian personnel, many of them retired military, who handle the items belonging to soldiers and marines killed in action.driver's license, house keys, letters from home, a bronze star, a purple heart, diaries, cigarette lighters, air jordans, photo albums, children's drawings, christmas stockings. also the spent cartridges from the farewell salute fired by the service member's buddies in iraq.when a soldier is killed, his unit inventories and packs what he kept at his bunk site in rucksacks, sea bags and footlockers.the personal effects of the more than 2,300 troops killed in iraq have all gone first to the dover, del., air force base and then to aberdeen.rivera pointed to a torn-up piece of a brown paper bag with "we love you" in what appeared to be a child's scrawl written in crayon upon it."we don't know what that is. maybe it's something a kid in iraq gave to him. it was in his stuff and that's going home.."is it about what they "own"?sometimes we construct meanings for material objects much in the same way  we construct meanings for people..we all have that special, cherished, or "favorite" possession.yes this is our "stuff"..a mere  tangible item - clothing, jewelry..perhaps a saved letter.but it is not of consequence what this soldier  "owned".  it is now about letting those who loved him or her own more "joy" through the memories of her prized possession...own more love  by  letting  his memory  shine out to all those honor him...and for us ..to own more respect for those laying down their lives for us...even as we speak.you must see this over at thirdworldcountry.it's time for a little less talk and alot more action on illegals.the amboy times has an insightful look at n. korea and nukes.

more human remains found near wtc site  "new york - construction workers cleaning toxic waste from a vacant skyscraper near the world trade center site have found more bone fragments and human remains, officials said tuesday.  the city medical examiner's office plans to extract dna from the latest remains to be recovered from the former deutsche bank building and try to match it against a database of the 2,749 people killed at the trade center on sept. 11, 2001, said ellen borakove, spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office.more than 40 percent of the victims at the trade center have not been identified. the medical examiner's office is storing more than 9,000 unidentified remains and hope that more sophisticated dna technology can allow for identifications in the future." bone fragments of an innocent american man or woman...unspeakable.the izlamo-fascist terrorists attempted to teach us some lessons from the taste of our own blood..they who teach their children to dance in the streets upon viewing carnage.they who share the hallmarks of a true barbarian :a total lack of empathy while demonizing of the innocent.what do the terrorists want?..is it our land, our  wealth, perhaps our stunning  monuments..perhaps... but the true goal is much more insidious than that my dear friends..the ultimate aim is to rent a room inside your head, your psyche,to rob you of your precious peace of mind, of knowing what it feels like to have faith and trust in something larger than yourself..to prevent you  from believing that this convoluted world of ours can also be merciful, excercise justice, and celebrate true freedom... but most of all...to kill your belief that love survives.but my precious fellow americans and new yorkers...love has...it has.so bring it on izlamo-fascists...because god is still in his glorious heaven...and there isn't a bomb built that can ever extinguish that.a ladys ruminations has a new claim by the dems bout osama..good grief.tmh's bacon bits reminds us how precious a child is.

	 rrrright it must be the lobby
	 
    


"there are two ideas that america, even now, will support; the ideally good and the underdog. israel falls into both of these categories." ..john j. mearsheimer and stephen m. walt have released a paper titled “the israel lobby and u.s. foreign policy.” they attempt to explain how israeli lobbies are guiding the policy of the united states in the middle east region..israel the good underdog clarifies.israel is the lone democracy in a sea of despots and oppression. despite continuous harassment they have been able to build a successful society in a sea of despair. for the last 58 years israel has done its best to establish and maintain this democracy. living in an area smaller than the state of new jersey they have been able to stave off attacks from the enemies that surround them. in fact, they are a constant reminder to the surrounding nations of their own failures. despite living in a terrain that is not conducive to crop growth they have been able, with the exception of grain, to be self sustainable. with a labor force of less than 2.5 million they have a gdp of $123 billion. because of their lack of resources they have learned to excel in the services sector of business. being a relative sliver of land they have been able to defend themselves physically and ideologically from their surrounding enemies. they have stood up against nations that have superior resources and finances. the only true ally that they have has is the united states.every day they face homicide bombers and enemies on the brink. they have had to watch as diplomats made excuses for the actions of those who wish to destroy israel...they have watched murderous thugs receive peace prizes and awards from the world body. despite this, they continue to fight for their right to exist. had their neighbors accepted the partition in 1948 none of what they face today would be occurring."trudat!did you know that israel celebrates independence day by holding a bible contest..all citizens have health care..airplanes have sky marshals, (go figure!)..close to 99% of all israelis have families, and are regularly in touch with them...western societies are just that: "societies". israel is made up of "a people",  ..and no mere amalgam of private selves releasing a paper titled “the israel lobby and u.s. foreign policy.” can change that fact.

funny, i must have missed this headline in my local newspaper..come to think of it,in my local news report, radio newscast,...or even on the world wide web (of deceit)......."u.s. soldiers serving in iraq have distributed more than 1,000 free wheelchairs to disabled iraqis since july 2005, according to a non-profit group that donates the chairs.american heroes: soldiers build wheelchairs for iraqisthe specially-designed chairs are made from modified plastic patio chairs, mountain bike wheels, and steel frames. each chair costs less than $45 for parts and shipping. according to the group's website, the design makes the wheelchairs durable and the mountain bike wheels enable the operators of the chairs to navigate rough terrain where a traditional wheelchair would give them trouble.soldiers and other volunteers use their free time to participate in the program. soldiers assemble the chairs and distribute them to iraqis of all ages who have debilitating diseases like cerebral palsy and injuries that limit mobility."one small detail that mainstream media seem to forget:the soldier, not the liberal reporter -is the one who preserves our "freedom of the press".so to the the ones who eagerly report on our "reign of terror" in iraq and are on the edge of their seats anticipating updates for the abu ghraib abuse photo gallery....howza bout a wheelchair for a young girl in the town of baladiat assembled by pfc. erik meyers..not newsworthy enough eh?  i didn't think so.the real ugly american has a brilliant post about media coverage and iraq.(but then again he's always right on spot!)for an insightful take on the religion of peeeeeeeeeeace seetmh's bacon bits..who else!great overview on illegal immigration at a ladys ruminationsiraqi doctor killing patients over at blue star chronicles

	 guard the borders blogburst of the week
	 
    


this past week there were numerous demonstrations across the country, as immigrants were organized to protest any federal legislation that would tighten immigration enforcement. the rallies were organized by unions, church groups, socialist activists, civil rights advocates, and immigrant organizations to demand free immigration rights as their due and protest the "unjust laws" of our nation. los angeles had the nation's largest mobilization of immigrants ever, which the la times described as "boisterous" and "spirited" and "mostly peaceful": "the marchers included both longtime residents and the newly arrived, bound by a desire for a better life and a love for this county." ("newly arrived" being a politically-correct euphemism for "illegal".) the estimated crowd of 500,000 proudly carried tens of thousands of mexican flags, which belied the blissful claim that they are "bound by a love for this country".  "there has never been this kind of mobilization in the immigrant community ever," said joshua hoyt, executive director of the illinois coalition for immigrant and refugee rights. "they have kicked the sleeping giant. it's the beginning of a massive immigrant civil rights struggle."in georgia, many latinos protested a newly passed bill aimed at curbing illegal immigration by not working or shopping for the day. guess what? the state's economy didn't collapse! a small american rally in temecula, ca, focused on border security and law enforcement. we also saw peaceably demonstrating american citizens attacked by an unruly crowd of pro-illegal immigration and socialist protesters in indiana. photo by freedom folksthis week, our senate continues the debate on illegal immigration, with an upcoming vote on the mccain-kennedy amnesty bill. and, pressing for his "guest worker" program, our president repeats the tired (and untrue) refrain that our country needs these workers to do what americans won't:"we must remember there are hardworking individuals, doing the jobs that americans will not do, who are contributing the economic vitality of our country," the president said in his weekend radio address.however, the minuteman party has responded:no longer content to sit on the sidelines while politicians sell out our sovereignty and turn our citizenship into a yoke of slavery in the service of foreign interests, we are fighting that government "of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth".what is this precious sovereignty that we need to safeguard? why is it central to our existence as a free nation? and how does it relate to our national security? considering the fact that pro-illegal immigration forces were able to mobilize hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to demonstrate their demands for what americans have and their rights to the privileges of our citizenship, it is imperative that we understand how much we have to lose. because once lost, it can never be regained. these issues have been addressed in layman's terms in a series of excellent essays by linknzona. the first in the series defines security and sovereignty and how the two are irrevocably linked (reproduced below with permission). links to the follow-on essays provide a step-by-step examination of the true impact of unchecked immigration and permissive illegal immigration on our sovereignty as a nation.security and sovereignty no. 1: what are we talking about? this is the first post in a new series addressing the security and sovereignty of the united states. these words are related but quite different in meaning and nuance. security is a noun meaning safety, the absence of danger or risk. in the national context, it means vigilance and actions taken by the government to prevent invasion, attack, and the sabotage, spying, and treason that accompany them; the totality of measures taken to keep the nation safe and free from danger. more realistically in today’s world, rather than free from danger; security means to minimize the risks or threats.sovereignty is a noun and means a government free from external control or the authority of one country to govern another. an important point is the source of sovereignty. the historical model of a kingdom was that the king ruled by divine right. in a totalitarian state power is gained and then held by force and coercion. in democratic countries, i.e. the us, power derives from the people. there are additional forms and various gradations between the definitions, but for the purposes herein, we will emphasize totalitarian and democratic countries. one shudders at the thoughts of countries without a history of security: poland, israel, and the low countries – these have been invaded throughout history and repeatedly have lost their sovereignty. that they stand free today is a tribute to man’s strength and hope. jordan kicked the palestinians out of their country and chased them into lebanon and for more than a quarter of a century syria held de facto sovereignty over most of lebanon. in contrast, the united kingdom has remained a sovereign nation for centuries. a country can lose its sovereignty in several ways. by conquest, by a division or a ceding as in a small country caught between two powerful neighbors, by appeasing an aggressive neighbor with territory or control, or by allowing migration, or infiltration of peoples from one country into another one until sufficient numbers and power are gained by the infiltrators to demand partitioning or complete control. thus, we see the link between security and sovereignty. in the ever dangerous world in which we live, sovereignty cannot be maintained without security. therefore, if sovereignty is the will of the people then they must devise and organize a national strategy for security. sovereignty requires security from war and conquest, from domination by other countries and partitioning or territorial ceding, security from threats and intimidation, and security from infiltration.security and sovereignty no. 2: setting the ground rules a summary of the sworn duty of the one person most responsible for our security and sovereignty: the president.security and sovereignty no. 3: the president's duties in light of the president’s constitutional duties to our national security and sovereignty, this essay assesses how he is meeting the obligations of his duty.security and sovereignty no. 4: how many illegal aliens are in america? frighteningly enough, no one really knows. the sheer volume of illegal border crossings makes any figure a guesstimate. how secure can our country be when millions of unknown foreigners are crowding our towns and cities?security and sovereignty no. 5: a tale of two small businesses what’s the overall economic impact of illegal aliens on american workers and taxpayers? the short answer is they cost america hundreds of billions of dollar a year.security and sovereignty no. 6: a threat to our two party system and some steps we can take this essay outlines the threat of illegal immigration to our sovereignty and what we might do to save america. the short answer is that we must eliminate illegal immigration, preserve our two party system, and restore respect for the rule of law in america.these essays are offered to our readership because knowledge is power, and forewarned is forearmed. if the pro-illegal alien crowd is geared up towards positioning wide open borders as a "massive immigrant civil rights struggle" then we have to make sure that the "sleeping giant" they've kicked is not ignorant of the ultimate costs of his continued inaction. this giant doesn't have the luxury of sleep anymore - there is too much at stake.__________________________________________this has been a production of the guard the borders blogburst. it is syndicated by euphoric reality, and serves to keep immigration issues in the forefront of our minds as we’re going about our daily lives and continuing to fight the war on terror. if you are concerned with the trend of illegal immigration in our country, join the blogburst! send an email with your blog name and url to euphoricrealitynet at gmail dot com.

	 bashing on bumpers
	 
    


woman gets ticket for bush-bashing bumper stickerdecatur, ga -- the officer cited 47-year-old denise grier for her bumper sticker that takes a dig at president bush. it combines bush's name with a vulgar four-letter word, as in "i'm tired of all the (blank)."the officer cited the registered nurse at emory university hospital for violating a state law prohibiting lewd or profane stickers and decals on vehicles.grier, the officer and an attorney for the american civil liberties union will meet in court next month when grier contests the misdemeanor charge which carries a $100 fine.grier told the athens banner-herald yesterday that she's not "a huge political activist or rabble-rouser." but she says, "i am so appalled at the officer's attempt to squash my freedom of speech.the aclu says the georgia supreme court ruled more than a decade ago that the law against lewd bumper stickers is unconstiutional.in addition to the offending bumper sticker, grier's white chrysler's rear window sports two other political statements: a crossed-out "w" and "hillary 2008."obscene” speech, “fighting words,” “clear and present danger” speech, defaming and libelous speech “can, consistent with the first amendment, be regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content....” r.a.v. v. city of st. paul, minn., 505 u.s. 381, 383(112 sc 2538, 2543, 120 le2d 305) (1992). in cunningham v. state, supra, 260 ga. at 831, we observed that “lewd is much broader than obscene ... meaning, among other things, vulgar, base, evil, wicked,poor, worthless.(1989).2ocga people who feel the need to "express" themselves via lewd and crude bumper stickers..ah yes...vulgar, base, evil, wicked,worthless...and to boot-a hillary fan..well, that explains it, now doesn't it.

	 don't flatter yourselves
	 
    


"kabul, afghanistan - an afghan court on sunday dismissed a case against a man who converted from is-lam to christianity because of a lack of evidence and he will be released soon, officials said.  the announcement came as u.s.-backed president hamid karzai faced mounting foreign pressure to free abdul rahman, a move that risked angering mus-lim clerics here who have called for him to be killed.""he said several of rahman's family members have testified that the 41-year-old has mental problems. "it is the job of the attorney general's office to decide if he is mentally fit to stand trial," he told ap."mus-lim clerics had threatened to incite afghans to kill rahman if the government freed him. they said he clearly violated is-lamic sha-riah law by rejecting is-lam.karzai has had to be careful not to offend is-lamic sensibilities at home and alienate religious conservatives who wield considerable power.he said rahman had been asking guards for a bible but that they did not have any to give him."have you ever heard of a major political decision being changed "so as not to offend" women, or jews for that matter? despite huge outcry and civil protest anti-christian artwork is routinely displayed, and yet the proprietors don't reconsider "so as not to offend" christians.why is that?it's all about the anger.anger is "an emotional state that varies in intensity-anywhere from mild irritation to intense rage.the instinctive,or what some would even call the most "natural way" to express anger is to respond aggressively. anger is a  adaptive response when one if feeling "threatened".it often evokes powerful, aggressive, feelings and behaviors, which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves (and our loved ones) when we are attacked. in other words, a certain amount of anger, is healthy therefore,and even necessary to our survival." conversely, we can't very well physically lash out at every person or object that upsets, irritates or annoys us. that's called barbarism.we therefore inact laws,institute social norms, and trust that common sense will place limits on how far our anger can take us.then there is the sociocultural influence.in some cultures, anger is often regarded as negative, while in south central l.a.for example, gang members are "rewarded" and considered "macho" when they riot and burn cars.  some consider anger "taboo", and  may be  taught that it's all right to express anxiety, depression, or other emotions but not to express anger. as a result, they don't learn how to handle it or to even  channel it constructively. one thing we do know is that family background plays a huge role. typically, people who are easily angered come from families that are disruptive, chaotic, and not skilled at emotional communications. in essence when governments withdraw political positions "so as not to offend" muzlims, what they are really saying is ..."so as not to incur their wrath"..and their subsequent pathological. rageful, murderous, barbaric behavior.you see, a "healthy" response to an anger provoking situation  is to reduce both your emotional feelings and the physiological arousal that anger causes. you  learn very early on in life that you can not eliminate or avoid, all the people or things that enrage you, and  you certainly know you have no power to directly change them. the one thing a 'mentally healthy' person learns, however is that he or she  can learn to control his or her reactions. in essence when we hear of policy change due to government's "sensitivity" toward a "group"..(since when has government of all things concerned themselves with emotion?)...that "group" should be far from flattered.read between the lines.what is meant is  that your "people" have a history of acting in ways that are out of control and frightening. they are viewed as undisciplined, unevolved "hotheadeds" who clearly get angry more easily and more intensely than a balanced  person does.they are prone to  show their anger in violent ways  - cursing, throwing things, burning buildings, cars, physically assualting or killing other people.in other words, they simply have no ability to take things in stride, most especially  if the situation seems to them somehow unjust. but as we all know...(or at least the "healthy" ones among us)..unbridled  anger actually escalates anger and aggression. in addition to which it does nothing to help you resolve the problem or situation. so, in essence, we are dealing with not only one person but millions who have proven themselves incapable of proper "impulse control" and " conflict resolution".they behave very much like a poorly disciplined child or bully, who  feels self righteous and justified, believing that there is  no way to solve the problem. they thus choose to bully, alienate,humiliate and torture people who might otherwise be willing to work with them on finding a compromise or long term solution.the attorney general's office is  to decide if rahman "is mentally fit to stand trial,"?that's laughable.in a culture where they all feel morally right, where any compromise or changing of their ways is an unbearable indignity that they deem that they should not have to suffer...where violence is the first response to disappointment and frustration...oh yea, they are excellent diagnosticians of 'mental health' aren't they?check out :church and state for more on abdul rahman.the real ugly american has his take on the media and war. he's a gem..whatever he discusses, he does with class!the uncooperative blogger has an indepth look at the sad-aam tapes and wmd's.for more insights about abdul rahman mosey over to the one an only..third world country

	 free speech: as long as you don't speak
	 
    


controversial prophet mu-hammad cartoons appear at free-speech rally london, england -- about 200 people have turned out for a free-speech demonstration in central london. and some of them carried posters of the controversial cartoons of the prophet muh-ammad that infuriated much of the mus-lim world. protest organizers had originally invited protesters to display the images on banners and t-shirts. but they later withdrew that invitation to avoid alienating sympathetic mus-lims. the reversal prompted hundreds of angry internet responses from people who called it political censorship. some demonstrators showed their support for the cartoons by carrying signs saying "stop toonophobia." others draped themselves in danish flags. nine men identified by police as mus-lim counter-protesters were escorted away." escorted away eh?..ahem..were those the "symathetic ones"? is your belief in 'free speech'based upon your morals, or on other people's morals?we know the united states government rarely gets directly involved in censorship issues, save during wartime.  (which despite the elective "blindness" of the left..this is)our oft quoted  first amendment guarantees freedom of expression within certain limits defined by the supreme court. senators and congressmen have always been  loathe to create censorship laws, as just about every attempt to do so (even involving brutal and violent images of torturing women) have been struck down as unconstitutional.and along come the muzlims claiming some  cartoons "offensive". the presses come to a grinding halt. but if dehumanization of an enemy is a component of wartime propaganda, they are guiltier than any other in their unending depiction of jews and americans as ugly, long nosed , sinister vultures. and now a handful summon up the courage to stage a free speech demo. and then don't excercise the very free speech they are  protesting for - so as to ..."avoid alienating sympathetic mus-lims?i think i need a stiff drink...and i don't even drink.stop the aclu has open trackbacks and the usual goodies.

	 counting down
	 
    


 afghan christian 'likely to be released soon : official  "an afghan christian facing possible execution for converting from is-lam was likely to be released from jail "soon," a senior government official said following huge western pressure over the case. he is likely to be released soon," the official said, adding there would be a top-level meeting on the matter saturday.  abdul rahman was arrested two weeks ago under is-lamic sha-ria law and faced a possible death sentence in a case that has attracted widespread condemnation, especially from the united states.afghanistan's supreme court said thursday it was trying to find a "good solution" to the case, the first of its kind here, including persuading rahman to revert to is-lam. sha-ria law, on which the afghan constitution is partly based, rules that conversion away from is-lam must be punished by death if the accused person fails to revert." well sweet friends, now is the time to wake up and dust off our state of complacency.this is only an indicator of things to come.

"it's a good thing president bush is a texan. i’m sure he sees the similarities between shoveling horse manure and taking questions from certain members of the white house press." oh..yeeehaww!..i'm luvin that one!when you play with a texan…  tells it like it is.   heh."obviously i’m not surprised at the left wing hypocrites within the press. these vultures will attack the president every time they get a chance. however, they should at least be more tasteful. the blatant cynicism and more accurately, the extreme loathing for president bush that the main stream media and some members of the white house press illustrate, gives a tainted view on our country—and that should never be tolerated! thus, helen thomas would be advised to know, that when you play with a texan, you’re going to be lassoed in front of the press for slanted journalism." jus thought i'd dedicate that to mah texan buddies..you know who you are!..heh.

the 'bible literacy project' - not attacked by the aclu yet! goes on to say..“congress granted the approval to print “a neat edition of the holy scriptures for the use of schools.” congress’ endorsement stamped on the first page: “whereupon, resolved, that the united states in congress assembled...recommend this edition of the bible to the inhabitants of the united states...”.okay, american civil liberties union, people for the (anything but) american way, and people united for separation of church and state --- don’t get yourselves in an uproar! it’s history. the above event happened twice --- 1777 and 1782 when congress ordered 20,000 bibles each time for the benefit of citizens and childrens’ education.....then there was no question about the bible as education...the last 80 years, the aclu and others have taken america’s christian foundation to court --- and won! through the idiocy of socialist-minded, self-serving supreme court judges...today’s public schools, connected as they are to the purse strings of the secular federal government, have pushed god and his word out of the schools thereby limiting childrens’ education. children lack background reference to many phrases common in language such as “walk on water,” “pearls before swine,” “30 pieces of silver,” “the golden rule,” and “the last shall be first.” how would a child or an adult know where these phrases originated or what they mean unless they have read the bible?despite the attempt to twist the first amendment to suit small-minded and self-serving interest groups, the people are responding through adopting bible curriculum as an elective in high schools. one such group is the national council on bible curriculum in public schools (ncbcps). their course called “the bible as history and literature” is taught in 1,100 high schools in 346 school districts in 37 states, from alaska and california to new jersey and florida. the bible is the textbook. the aclu does not endorse this curriculum but has not sued to date.imagine the congress authorizing the printing of the bible for public schools today. the enraged outcry from special interests, minority groups, and other secular, atheist factions would further extinguish the voices that speak to us through the bible." back in the day, a common question would be -  what does bible say about..?it was god who set the moral standards for mankind. how does morality exist outside of the theological context?look around you these days...it doesn't.what you bear witness to is moral chaos reminiscent of ancient israel before the time of its kings when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (judges 21:25).to state that moral relativism and situational ethics work in the long run is a purely dishonest rationalization.while it is certainly appealing to think that humans would discover "on their own"- that murder, lying, stealing, and pornogrpahy are harmful enough to the general welfare to be considered morally wrong...the evidence lies in the decadent godless culture you see before you.  when deciding issues of "right or wrong" it seems most find themselves hopelessly trapped in a maze of confusion with no clear direction.homosexual marriage?polygamy?incest?bestiality?wer'e lost with respect to the most fundamental aspects of our lives: our locus of control,what truly gives us  self-esteem,  our social values, and the status of the family. perhaps next time we are faced with a moral dilmemna, we would do wise to ask "what does bible say about..?"for ongoing updates see stop the acluto hear a man who isn't afraid to speak the truth about how he sees muzlims see the one and only third world countryfor another "outspoken" look at ji-hadism see the amboy timesfor the dynamic duo..tmh and dl's take on hillary..check out tmh's bacon bits!for some updates on hollywood insanity see:a ladys ruminations
