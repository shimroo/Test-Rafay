what are the pages like?   this site
provides album pages that you can download and
print off on your own printer.  pages should be printable on letter sized 
			(or a4) paper with
virtually all laser or ink-jet printers. you really need to download and print out some of the pages to see what
they're like (see the instructions 
			webpage for free samples), but this should give you some idea: 




hope you enjoy the pages.
