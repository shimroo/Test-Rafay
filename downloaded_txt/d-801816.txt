the swamp house river front grill and the happy snapper tiki bar are perched overlooking the beautiful and historic st. johns river in debary, florida. this amazing river looks as natural today as it did 150 years ago when this area was the southern destination of choice for america's more adventurous well-to-do. in order to escape their stresses at home, they would travel great distances by paddle boat into this wild and wonderful area seeking a truly unique experience....and here is where they found it! 
 today, there is no better place to bring family and friends to have your own truly unique experience (and to escape your stresses). nowhere else does our proud florida history and natural beauty blend so perfectly with great food, drinks, local live music and fun. visit us by land (car or motorcycle) or visit us by sea (boat...or even paddle boat). once you arrive you will see why people have been in love with florida ever since it was first discovered.
