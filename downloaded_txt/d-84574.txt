certified human -  by dieter luske - sci-fi crime novel
the book was written long before trump and elon disrupted  politics, but the question of âdo billionaires have too much power?â is woven into the narrative.

books: mind matters

              2.) your thoughts belong to you; take control:  recognising and challenging unhelpful thoughts is one key to improving mental well-being.
             3.) changes start with small steps: how do you eat an elephant trunk - chunk by chunk.

a positive mindset â harmony in brainland
change needs a positive mindset enhanced by positive thinking and speaking. the subconscious mind has a problem with negative-based language; it does not understand it.
