our mission and purpose


the national association of state directors of pupil transportation services (nasdpts) was established in 1968.    the purpose of the association is to provide leadership and assistance to the nation’s school transportation community with the goal of providing safe, secure, and efficient,  transportation to school children  in certified school bus vehicles.
 
nasdpts membership is comprised of state and national leaders in school bus transportation, local school transportation administrators, suppliers of products and services, as well as grassroots practitioners. the membership represents all 50 states, the district of columbia, school bus manufacturers and suppliers, state and national transportation associations, and others who support our mission and purpose.
