an exclusive buyer agent will help you choose the right lender for your particular set of financial circumstances, and will counsel you on reasons for getting pre-approved before you make an offer on any property. our primary goal is to help you find the home which best fits your lifestyle and your expectations, but also one that won't break your budget and you can afford. to help you avoid financial mistakes that often accompany home buying, check out our brief mortgage tips and information page.
an exclusive buyer agent will help you find a qualified home inspector who will treat you as their client and not as a customer, making sure the home you're considering purchasing is not a potential money-pit. prospective homebuyers are often confused about home inspections and buying real estate in johnson city, or any other area of north eastern tennessee.
