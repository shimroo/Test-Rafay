stealth cameras, maybe not...
watch out, new stealth cameras on motorways: devices on m25 in kent have caught 700 drivers in two months - and will arrive on m1, m3 and m6 soon.â a new generation of speed cameras being introduced on the m25 in kentâ they have been installed to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limiunlike traditional yellow cameras, they are painted grey and harder to spot and have already caught almost 700 motorists on the m25 in just two monthsâ same technology is now set to be introduced on the m1, m3, m60 and m6. the association of british drivers said they were not appropriate and were being introduced to punish drivers rather than make roads safer

hadecs stands for highways agency digital enforcement camera systemâ this is not a 'new' system at all, but an upgrade to the currentâ 'smart' motorway network.â you're probably familiar with these areas on, for example, the m1, m6 and m25. they enforce reductions in the limit not to catch people out or raise revenue (allegedly) but in an effort to keep the traffic flowing during busy times.â 

          the 'stealth' aspect of the mainstream media stories entirely relates to the new cameras' colour - the hadecs 3 will be grey not bright yellow. current motorway cameras are not only also grey but tucked away on gantries. hadecs 3 will be mounted in plain sight on dedicated poles, complete with speed camera warning signs in accordance with current guidelines.

reduce your insurance with a in car video recorder...
in car witness cameras or vehicle black boxes. can they make a difference to your insurance
it appears that insurance companies are now allowing customers who have in-vehicle witness cameras the advantage of a discount on their insurance premium. insurance companies such as towergate risk solutions are now offering witness cameras as standard to some of their customers.
also know as video black boxes, these systems record video, audio, gps position along with speed and g-force and they offer vital evidence in the event of an incident.
mi-witness, lukas and blackvue are able to get discounts.




 follow me on twitter for news, offers and most likely the odd bit of silly stuff.

pogo bought by road angel.
the king is dead...
road angel bought origin makers of the pogo alert plus, which in my opinion was one of the best small gps alert systems you could buy.
customers have been left in the hands of a company that offers poor service, a database thats going downhill and virtually no warranty support. when customers get an issue with the pogo they are offered the road angel plus, sometimes at a cost,which is know where near as good as the pogo.
so with the demise of pogo what are customers left with?
the new cheetah c150 offers some hope if you want a small device that will neither break the bank or tie you into a subscription contract. 
see the cheetah c150 here...

speed camera alerts in france
 all systems now illegal whether radar detector or satnav/gps
            
            
while radar speed camera detectors may still be legal at home â the 2006 road safety act did include enabling provisions allowing the secretary of state to make regulations to prohibit them but this hasn't been done yet â the position is different abroad where many countries have laws in place banning the carrying or use of these devices.
for some years now it is has been strictly forbidden underâ article r413-15 of the french 'code de la route'(highway code) to have a speed camera detector in a car in france, regardless of whether or not it is being used.
penalties can include fines of up to â¬1,500, confiscation of the device and of the vehicle.
until recently this legislation didn't apply to satellite navigation or other gps-based systems capable of displaying fixed speed camera locations as points of interest (poi).            
new law in france
effective from 3 january 2012â french laws prohibiting drivers from carrying devices capable of detecting speed cameras have been extended to include devices able to warn or inform of the location of speed cameras e.g. satnav or gps systems capable of showing speed camera sites as poi.
as well as now banning all devices capable of warning drivers of speed camera locations, the french government is installing around 400 new fixed speed cameras and is taking down road signs indicating the location of existing fixed speed camera sites.
 
what should you do
if you have a satnav capable of displaying french camera locations in france then you must at least disable camera alerts before driving in france. we recommend that you contact the manufacturer of the satnav for advice as it is likely that a software or database update is available that will actually remove camera data for france from the device.
if you have a satnav system built into your car then we recommend contacting the vehicle manufacturer in the first instance.
