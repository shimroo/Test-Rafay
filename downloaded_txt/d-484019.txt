burt® is an upper-limb therapy robot. it allows a patient to float weightlessly on a cushion of air with barrett’s gravitycradle™ supporting the patient while applying gentle forces to resist, assist, give subtle queues, and paint a realistic game/activities environment that matches what is visually projected in front of them.

how is burt® better? • easy set up (less than 1 minute) and quick left/right handedness swapping• patient safety ensured by burt® system's frictionless back drivability in all 3 planes• therapist safety ensured by letting burt® support the load so you can drive patient recovery; ots otherwise suffer 3x‡ more injuries than their peers• gaming software leveraging cognitive rehabilitation strategies to work on attention, memory, and visual neglect• 3 planes of upper extremity facilitation— transverse, sagittal, and frontal• facilitate faster consistent treatment leading to better recovery

get to know barrettthe origins of burt® and barrett technology begin with bill’s pursuit of his phd at the massachusetts institute of technology artificial intelligence laboratory (now called mit csail), funded in part by nasa. while there, bill was initially discouraged from designing a robot intended to interact with people because of the perceived generic danger posed by robots, which were all industrial at the time. bill felt that by applying thoughtful design and human factors, such as natural backdrivability, a robot could be built whose benefits far outweighed any risk. bill proved the naysayers wrong and built the world’s most advanced† (wam®) robotic arm.
