crush competition when you use high  quality backlinks



crush competition when you use high  quality backlinks

the 3 things you must know about your competition's backlinks
so you can replace them in the serps (search engine results page)

1. just who is your weakest google page 1 competition? 

2. how many backlinks does this competitor have? 

3. on what websites are these backlinks located?

the backlinks that you want to get are ones that show up
on popular web sites having a google page rank (pr) of 3 
or higher. when you have high value backlinks to your
website, the search engines will see them, and know that 
what you are saying on your site has value to searchers.

which affiliate networks to look out for when promoting



xtream global marketing business opportunity
==========================================

there are many horror stories about affiliate programs and networks. people have heard them over and over again, that some are even wary of joining one. the stories they may have heard are those related to illegal programs or pyramid schemes. basically, this kind of market does not have real, worthy product. 

you do not want to be associated with these schemes. it is obvious you want to be with a program that offers high quality product that you will readily endorse. the growing number of those who have joined already and are succeeding immensely is proof enough that there are reliable and quality affiliate programs out there.
