“the principal product you have to sell is the ice itself.”— frank j. zamboni



driven by a commitment to quality and innovation
we continually challenge our product, putting it to the test in the harsh environment it will call home. easy to operate and service with simplicity by design, zamboni has the highest residual value, while maintaining the lowest cost of operation.




we care about your air and have the solution
our electric resurfacers and edgers are trusted and proven performers, meeting the toughest endurance demands of arenas around the world. our fuel powered machines are robust, yet efficient with industry-leading fuel cost savings, reduced emissions and a cleaner arena environment.




a well-deserved reputation as the industry leader
one which we don’t take for granted. worldwide, more facility owners and operators choose zamboni than any other ice resurfacer. with machines designed for the needs of facilities large and small; indoor and outdoor; recreational or professional; zamboni is the clear choice.
