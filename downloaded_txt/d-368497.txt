sola scripturaaffirming the authenticity, accuracy, and authority of the bible – the standard for truth
“the entirety of your word is truth… given by inspiration of god, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of god may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.”psalm 119:160 & 2 timothy 3:16-17
how can i know the bible is true?
is it really the word of the living god? is it the final authority for my faith? these are questions that all of us must eventually answer. the holy bible is complete and supernaturally inspired without error in the original manuscripts. we can trust it to be accurate in all areas, whether historical, scientific, theological or practical. whatever your age, gender, background or heritage, the bible is relevant. it gives us clear guidance for living and points to jesus christ alone as the way to salvation.
the bible teaches that the entirety of scripture is truth. to understand scriptural passages correctly, we must discover the original intended meaning of the text. by reading scripture at face value – taking verses in context and comparing scripture with scripture – we can avoid conclusions based on popular interpretation or opinion. hence the name: sola scriptura, latin for “scripture alone.”
