el ritmo no perdona





daddy yankee acaba de lanzar su nuevo video musical llamado "el ritmo no perdona". la verdad que me sorprendi cuando vi el video, ya que era algo que no me esperaba. la cancion es de un ritmo mas energico y nuevo, ningun cantante tiene un estilo asi como es la de esta cancion. me gustaria bailar esta cancion en una disco con pal de mujeres (que sepan bailar por favor!). seria tremendo, jaja. bueno, la cancion esta bien chevere, esta gustando mucho. aqui los dejo con el nuevo video:

telento de barrio breaks record





daddy yankee's movie (telento de barrio) debut has smashed box office records in puerto rico. an estimated 12,000 fans turned out to see the movie when it debuted last week. i haven't seened it but plan to in the weekend. many people have already told me the movie was great so daddy yankee made a mayor hit with this. i wasn't surprized that the movie turned out to be good since it has been in the making for more then 3 years.
