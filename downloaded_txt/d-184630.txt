2025 new members exhibition
the 2025 new members exhibition is open friday, february 7th through saturday, march 29th. craft artists from all over the country were given the opportunity to become part of piedmont craftsmen’s craft artist guild. through a yearlong jury process and careful consideration, artists were selected to become exhibiting members for the quality of their work and originality of design.

clyde gobble collection shop stunning handcrafted ceramic ware by in memoriam artist in clay, clyde gobble, member from 1971-2014. clyde describes his own work as “mostly functional things, that are meant to be used—to live with, to cook with, to eat and drink out of, not put up on a shelf to look at.”
