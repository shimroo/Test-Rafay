interior doors can make or break the look of your home or office. to make sure you get the doors that will best suit your needs, we will assign to you a personal salesman from our extremely knowledgeable and experienced sales staff. they will guide you from start to finish through the design phase, ordering process, jobsite delivery and final installation.
your salesman will make every effort to make sure your door sizes, handings, finish color, etc. is exactly what you want while at the same time providing a smooth and easy shopping experience. you can provide any number of special requests because custom wood doors are our specialty.
wood doors will make your home as unique as you are. the natural variations in color and grain make wood one of the best materials for decorating a home. ask your sales expert which type of wood will best suit your needs.
although we are well known for our fine interior doors, we also offer fiberglass, wrought iron and wood exterior doors as well as hurricane, sound and fire rated doors.
we have an extensive line of architectural moldings to compliment our interior doors. with our vast array of window and door casings, crown molding profiles and unique baseboard designs, you are sure to find something that will look great in your home or office. we have 179 window and door trim profiles alone, with knife grinding capabilities for any custom wood molding that your house requires. our architectural molding is available in over 20 different species of fine hardwoods.

"the doors look perfect! i was skeptical about ordering doors online. your company performed flawlessly. delivery was prompt and the truckline was courteous and professional. your pricing is very competitive and the product is excellent. my only regret is that i did not order all of my doors from you when building my home.
                	  thank you for making this a pleasant experience."
- jack from finland, minnesota 



"i can't tell you how pleased we are with the workmanship and the beauty of these doors. your source will be an asset to our project and we will enter your name on our blog and we will refer your name to our clients confident that they will receive a quality product that will make them proud."
- alex from connecticut 



"i just want to follow up with a written thank you for the great work you guys did on my custom doors. i couldnât be more thrilled on how they turned out. they will match my heritage house perfectly! it can be a little unnerving when dealing with a company in another country and with people youâve never met or dealt with before. everything from communication, admin and transactions went smoothly with honestly, integrity and trust. and to have such great quality product is amazing! i will strongly recommend your company to everyone!"- dave from brantford, ontario, canada

"i placed my first order with homestead over a year ago. six unfinished oak, 4 panel, cathedral style interior doors. one word to describe them. fantastic. i placed my second order just last month for another six doors. again, both service and quality are outstanding. the doors are beautiful with excellent craftsmanship and delivered on time. i would highly recommend using homestead."
- bill from iowa

"the quality is awesome. the staining and finishing work was well done. the hardware was top shelf.dealing with you was a pleasure and i know i was a little intimidated with the delivery process and handling any issues but there were none. thanks for a great internet experience as well as dealing with terrific products. i have advised my decorator about our experience as well as two local contractors."
- gene from connecticut 



"i never knew how much doors can make a house a home until we put in our interior doors. they are so beautiful...the workmanship allows us to recommend your company to others with pride. thank you for all you have done in working with us and hopefully we will be back to you as the need arises."

                	  i hope to do more with you guys going forward!!"
- kenneth from new york 



"i just wanted to let you know that our door order was received last week. all looks well. we really like the door that you got for us with the obscured glass. i had asked around to many places in our area and couldn't find anything that matched so well. thanks very much for your help!"

- ned from maryland 



"i received my doors last week, they are truly a work of art. my contractor and i continue to consider leaving them in their natural state, as the craftsmanship is not to be taken lightly.

"my new homestead doors arrived yesterday in great condition.
                    while the doors are wonderful, my reason for this email is to tell you how pleased i am to 
                    have been interacting with tom.  i found him to be knowledgeable, honest, (what he indicated 
                    would happen, did, how and when he said it would), and patient.  his patience during several
                    telephone and email conversations was refreshing and allowed me to consider alternatives and
                    proceed at my pace."
- jim from palo alto, california 



"my husband and i purchased three prairie style 9-light doors earlier this summer. our remodeling project is now complete, and i can't begin to tell you how happy i am with the doors. they are truly a focal point and are exactly what i was hoping for. scary to do this on-line, but so worth it in the end. only wish you could see them.
thank you very much for the beautiful product."
- nancy from fairmont, west virginia 



"we received doors april 5th. i stained them today (7th)....everything looks great. i'm impressed with the quality of workmanship and will definitely recommend and use your services in the future. thank you very much"
- norm from whitehall, montana
