improving transportation operations and reliability by enhancing agency capabilities
 capability maturity frameworks and supportive interactive tools have been developed for seven operations programs areas (traffic management, traffic incident management, road weather management, planned special events, work zone management,  traffic signal management, and active demand management). the framework and tools help agencies assess current capabilities and generate a set of targeted activities to strengthen their operations programs. learn more about the frameworks and tools at https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/tsmoframeworktool/index.htm.
