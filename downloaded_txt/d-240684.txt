new ! time to re-activate, re-evaluate and re-boot a buried gem of a movie:  : "i ♥ (heart) huckabees" (2004).  why now ?  all will become clear if you read on and watch our wickedly "incendiary" clip montage...





 - mark wahlberg crushes jock-macho stereotypes as tommy corn - a fiercely green, anti-oil, geopolitically inflammatory, bicycling fire-fighter seeking a much better world - and an all-electric cadillac.



 - click any image or here for our full unexpurgated tommy corn article and clip collage...



evuk exclusive(yet again !) :  "spensational" update:  billionaire (baron) michael spencer becomes co-director of superdielectrics ltd.
companies house filing confirms appointment.  full details. 


new ! sssh !  superdielectrics - silent bombshell news:   the sunday times(alone) quietly breaks the "supercap silence" : 
 "michael spencer - the "city of london' s richest self-made man" - invests £8 million in disruptive uk supercapacitor company" 
 
 
- superdielectrics now valued at £250 million
- sunday times:  "the cambridge-based company is eyeing a float in london"
- read our uniquely detailed report - guaranteed to raise a few smiles and eyebrows too of course...

new ! exclusive !   supercap these(x14) !  just for the record(as in book, guinness ?):    superdielectrics ltd officially registered / incorporated fourteen new 'ltd' companies in one single day(...but noone seemed to notice)

(ps. it's not just socket science or rocket science or pocket science...)

new ! schooling grown-ups: 
- a clip-chain youtube tribute to st.trinians-thunberg-tesla.
 "never too small to make a difference"  - school girls kick some serious adult a$$
...and wind power, green power, girl power save the day - for st. trinian's and (saint?) thunberg !
joining the dots..by joining the clips.  click any pic to see the full clip-trip:

above  left:    
celia - st. trinian's very own greta thunberg - delivers this clear and very un-movie-like green message in 2009 ..when greta thunberg was just 6 yrs old:
celia:  "climate change is the most important issue our generation faces. sea-levels are rising. the ice-caps are melting ". 
above  right:     
tesla roadster movie debut:    a predictably underrated(too subversive !) 2009 film,  "st.trinian's - the legend of fritton's gold" was also the first movie ever to feature a normal-looking or sinfully cool all-electric car.
and, yes, wind-power, green power and girl power save the day for st.trinians and saintly thunberg:

and here's one more tesla-trinian connection or bond for you to recall or wonder at:    elon musk and st.trinian's "head girl" talulah riley married and divorced each other twice between 2010 and 2016 - so in the space of six years following the release of "fritton's gold". (click image for more..).

new ! supercap this ! (part i)
"50-500 times the energy-density of lithium ion"  
 "potentially". "theoretically".



rolls royce plc are now backing this potentially game- or world-changing technology - so why is almost noone talking about it ? 
  still too disruptive for the mainstream and the masses ?   watch exclusive 30 second clip - containing that extraordinary "50-500 times..etc" statement.

when will next-gen supercapacitors take off ?



breaking news ! (feb 4) :    "tesla buys leading supercapacitor manufacturer maxwell technologies".  
(now there's a coincidence !   just 6 days after we posted up our silence-shattering supercap piece above...musk makes this "ultra-timely" move right out of the blue. supercap synchronicity ? )<>

new ! tesla v hyundai
who's 
laughing now hyundai ?

tesla's 
5000-7000 model 3's per week and global delivery
..versus : 
hyundai's derisory, laughable 18,600 kona evs for the whole of 2018.


hyundai's original tesla-teasing billboard should obviously have targeted the world's major car manufacturers:    they all still refuse to produce electrified suvs and crossovers, only two of their evs have an official 200+ mile range and what's more - make that less - gm sell the bolt in just four of the world's 196 countries...and the zoe ain't for sale in the us.
 (read on...)

new ! having it both ways:  the global auto alliance aka car-tel cabal.  square these circles  : 

1) "evs cost too much to produce !" 
 - versus: 
2) "evs need just a fraction of the workforce to produce compared to combustion vehicles"   "millions of jobs will be lost globally !"
see:
-reuters:  "switch to evs threatens 75,000 german auto industry jobs"

-reuters: "hyundai union leader says evs destroy jobs"    "evs are evil !"

 - versus:
-  "gm loses money on every bolt ev"


  - so someone must be lying or being very uneconomical with the truth - forever dreaming up new pretexts for procrastination or digging up old ones to stem the growing tsunami tide of change - king cabal-canute-style.



(...and all-too predictably no journalists/commentators seem keen to highlight the glaring, truth-exposing self-contradiction)

see:   vw brand chief vows to boost(almost triple) gasoline suv sales".   as does bmw - using the handy, have-it-both-ways excuse highlighted above  ie. 'cos evs cost so much to produce  - what with having to pay so few workers to produce 'em,  n'all....

june 18 2018:  breaking  (collusion)  news :  "audi ceo rupert stadler arrested, vw confirms" 

from 
bmw raid to global alliances aka car-tel cabals - the ugly truth will out. 
two (exclusive/elusive) video refreshers:
- redacted tonight's satirical take and take-down.  watch tv clip :

recall(april 2):  global auto alliances, assocs aka the "united voice" car-tel cabal own the epa -  overturn emissions and clean car legislation.  even the wash post is unimpressed..




- boom & bust's un-redacted bmw raid wrap - for all those who've forgotten - or never knew - that a raid by eu investigators ever happened. watch tv clip :


redacted side-split:     amusingly, the bbc did not report the october 2017 raid on bmw offices until 5 months later in march 2018(!) - and then 
reported it as if it had just happened..
with the raid date rudely redacted.


re-view ! "go slow!" 
the coalition of the unwilling - the 'cartel-cabal' - crawls out of the shadows..yet the world's media stays largely silent.
but it's official(elektrek etc):
global auto cabal still pressing china to slow down ev advances.

below:   two videos of two wickedly disruptive ev advances that the cartel-cabal(and others) still don't wanna see happen...


but what else and who else are they opposing, ganging up against, blocking, stifling, snuffing out ?
(cf. " the simpsons - stonecutters:  "who holds back the electric car...?")

new ! a comedy first ?   "redacted tonight":    top us political comedy-satirists stand up for ev's.

fiction reflects fact:  green day - boo'ed and garbage-bombed for daring to talk green...

 - watch our caustic "summer camp"  clip mix - with a lethal dose of simpsons and green day car-toon musicology/ecology.
new ! latest-tech diesels are still 6+ times dirtier(nox) on average than eu legal limit in the real world - not the lab(german environment ministry )


- so why do most people think the problem's been solved...and why is the media so silent + compliant - again  ?

german tv report:    "it just keeps getting dirtier"
original text and translation.  tv video.(nb.  we're not just talking german cars...)
jürgen resch :   diesels exported to the us emit over 90% less nox.   cost of fix:    "a few 100 euros".  
3sat 'nano' video 2. 

3sat 'nano' video 3(18. may): "dirty stuttgart" - a cycling, masked tv presenter hits out.

innovation/science/tech show.  mon-fri - since 1997.  

new ! roll up roll up !   surrey/bristol universities and augmented optics welcome media interview requests:     see this open invitation with full contact details at supercapacitormaterials.com under "notes for editor" - click this image/facsimile:

many mainstream media outlets covered the original breakthrough supercap news - so where are the 2017 follow-up stories and interviews...to keep the dream alive ?

new ! university challenge: -  are oxbridge
 'profs' about to be trumped, topped and capped by bristol/surrey univ.  'drs'?  
oxbridge profs(cap-less ?): 

surrey/bristol drs.(supercapped !): 

plus:
did musk lift a li-air patent(in 2013) from the us defense department(2007)?   guilty as charged ! 
and a related q+a:
q:  will  'coming soon' supercap + battery combi-powerpacks(batt-cap packs?) eclipse elusive li-air ?
a:  yes - here's why ! 
gigacap factories next then, elon ?
why waste zillion$$ on superchargers when superfast supercapacitors beckon ?
nb. musk has been a semi-secret supercap-superfan..for 25 years !

tesla v army(li-air patents):
 
li-air plus li-ion(etc) combi-powerpack patents - time now to combine supercaps with li-ion(etc) instead ?

new ! as the quest for the holy grail power-pack ramps up...
..an sos plea to chris paine:     is it not time for one final electric shockumentary ? title: 

"who keeps killing the miracle battery ?"
(for smartphones, evs etc)



right:  "charge in seconds..40x lighter than li-ion..millions of charge cycles..eco-friendly".   eureka ?  or the auto and oil industries' worst nightmare ?
- see our top 15 holy grail contenders / pretenders.


- and as yet another international battery conference wraps up(iba 2017, march 5-10, japan) ...someone just has to ask:
- what will the world's battery scientists do with their time if the miracle cell ever makes it to production ?

- now connect those storage dots with:
mit tech review:  
 "battery manufacturers don't want radical breakthroughs".
(memo to mit:   neither do most carmakers !)

new ! ">hallelujah !    gm sells vauxhall and opel !

- will this open the door to the sale of the chevy bolt and volt in europe/britain and an end to the  "ampera" and "ampera-e" name-change nonsense ?

new ! jan-feb highlights (x 3):
1) loglio & pečjak:     two ev world range-record rivals meet in slovenia.

3) schwarzenegger and kreisel shame major carmakers with all-electric suv(mercedes g-wagen)   plus ...

the nissan altra  looks that speak for themselves. slick, state-of-the-art, stealth..and just 1.50 for a 120 mile charge. you do the math(s)! - you can be sure the treasury already  has! the mainstream motoring media give it near- 
rave reviews
...not available in $6-a-gallon europe!!
real, long-range ev's available/'test-able' in the us - of course unheard of in the uk/europe:





:



solectria sunrise* - 373 miles per charge. ('mpc')  (cost - 3.50)




:



gm ev1 - 225 mpc.




:



nissan altra ev - 120 mpc..




:



the xebra roadster ev - 100 mpc.




:



ford ranger ev - 100 mpc.




:



daimlerchrysler epic minivan  - 100 mpc.this is the electric version of tony blair's 'grand' people-carrier.




:



tzero - 100 mpc. smacks the phat a!se (us=a!s) of a ferrari in san francisco.




:



toyota rav4 - 125 mpc.




* the sunrise is so good - no major carmaker will touch it ...  bmw/rover/alchemy what's the story? what
 do
 we owe opec (bp, shell...)? see "ev campaign"
scandalous! - none of the above available in $6-a-gallon europe!!please - ford, nissan et al: don't just force-feed europeans with worthy but nerdy little eco-shoppers designed to deter mainstream car-buyers!! "th!nk var!ety, th!nk cho!ce!!" how's about an electric  mcc smart roadster, "smart tridion", pt cruiser, ford streetka (e-streetka?) or an ev'en better beetle? see dynasty's "it" dreamcar.

please note: whilst we welcome your feedback and comments, we'd like to stress that the role of evuk is primarily to raise public awareness and to increase pressure from the public for change:  sadly,  "real", advanced, long-range ev's have only been made available - and publicized - in the usa and japan (with the exception of jersey, uk). so please don't ask us where to buy them in the uk - instead, why not join the campaign by visiting britain's leading - evuk-linked - ev discussion(& media watch) group electric cars uk?)

 thought for the day/decade 
  fuel cell hard-sell and filling station dependency..


americans, unlike europeans, have every reason 
 not
 to question the growing fuel cell hype. this side of the pond, however, you can bet your bottom euro that every vested interest in sight  - taxman, oil-turned-hydrogen fuel-supplier(ie. bp, texaco, shell etc.) , 'ice'-maker and 'ice' retailer(see 'glossary') - will frantically connive and collude to keep the price of hydrogen fuel pegged at least as high as that of petrol.indeed  exxon, toyota and gm have since 1998 been openly conspiring - sorry  "collaborating" - to ensure that we actually continue to use petrol(!) to power our fuel cell cars. so - there'll be no ulterior motives there then. europe's drivers have two clear 
 eco
-nomical escape routes from this filling-station tyranny: 
1) charge-at-home battery ev's like the e-ka, altra, sunrise (see diy clean electricity hotlinks) and....
 2) fuel cell vehicles powered by  'home brew', diy hydrogen  - ideally stored as liquid for real range. (attempts will no doubt be made to ban this option on "safety" grounds).don't expect the media here to dwell on these fuel cell 'negatives': they will no doubt simply continue to dance to whatever tune the carmakers and car advertisers want them to twirl to....see also the economist (24th march): 'the fuel cell's bumpy ride'
see also: "fuel cells and the platinum problem"
disagree(and don't work for exxon)?   tell us why

 "n.i.c.e...."downing street taps new power source!



the uk's visionary high-tech transport minister, john pressconn, today announced that downing street rooftops are to be fitted with state-of-the art solar panels and that midlands based clover cars, renowned world-leaders in space-age alternative vehicle technology, would be supplying ministers with worldbeating electric vehicles ( or "zel's": 'zero emission limousines's/limo's ) fitted with electrofuel's revolutionary 250 mile-per-charge superpolymer lithium-ion batteries.

"lisa for president?!" - see evuk's hollywood page.

glossary for the uninitiated:

* zev - 'zero emission vehicle'* ev - 'electric vehicle'* ice - 'internal combustion engine'* nice - 'no internal.....as in have a nice day!'* mpc - 'miles per charge'


      



..or more precisely..rrrevolting actionendless procrastination, endless excuses but when will long-range ev's hit the high street?.spread the message, wear the t-shirt - logo: "have a n.i.c.e. day!/suck amps!"
