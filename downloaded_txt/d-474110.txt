hi, 
                my name is doug.  i've been gardening in one form or another for as 
                long as i can remember. somewhere along  the trail i also started becoming very 
                  aware of how wasteful we  humans are, especially here in the us.  this led me to start doing 
                  every day tasks in a much more conscientious manner in order  to avoid as much waste 
                  as possible, while also finding new uses for objects that most people tend to see as trash. i find it very satisfying to turn discards into art or some other 
                  form of treasure.  

                  one of the most important gardening experiences  was when i created my first compost 
                  pile, where i could see first hand my organic garden waste changing into 
                  nutrient rich soil to nourish my plants.  it was almost like magic. 
the environment and its 
                preservation has been very important to me for decades, 
                creating an urge in me to recycle 
                everything possible, both at home and at work.  my goal here is to motivate as many of you as 
                possible to begin, or to increase, your recycling efforts.  the time has 
                come for all of us to pitch in and do as much as possible to preserve this 
                planet earth that we all share. your help will be greatly appreciated by 
                everyone, especially future generations. be sure to check out some of my 
                articles. 
                thank you.    

                ps: i hope you'll always ask yourself and others... what have you done today 
              to make the world a better place?
