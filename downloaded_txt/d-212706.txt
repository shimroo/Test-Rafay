welcome!
thank you for visiting the saint steven serbian orthodox cathedral website. we hope you find our site informative and edifying. we also invite you to join us for one of our liturgical services – services that have been part of the worshipping tradition of apostolic christianity since the era of the “early christian church."
our parish is more than just a place where people come to worship the living god (although it is first and foremost that!). st. steven's is a vibrant faith community of people of all ages and backgrounds who are working out their faith together and raising their families in accordance with the commandments of our lord and savior jesus christ and the sacred norms for spiritual life of the ancient holy eastern orthodox church.
we are always honored to have visitors join us for prayer and worship.
