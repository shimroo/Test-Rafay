armed and ready





made it through another work week, didn't take any pills for the arm but wore a wrist brace and elbow brace for much of the day, in addition to utilizing my nifty heated under-keyboard pad. robin does buy me the coolest things; i also have pink fingerless heated gloves now, in addition to 30 "forever" roses which look absolutely stunning, better than the real thing, on the corner table by the living room air conditioner. in return, i agreed that a valentine's day sushi delivery was more than appropriate; i can't remember the last time we ordered in. i'm as set for the weekend (including a rainy visit to mom on sunday, i hope) as i can be...

jiggety jig





home again, with all sorts of plans for which i won't need my secondary pair of sneakers (the waterproof ones) nor my too-tight jeans. my left arm seems to be taking the brunt of the pain i've somehow caused myself, all the way from the tricep to the wrist and thumb. not fun. need sleep. who knows?

a dusting of trouble





i wore my cleats and robin walked me to the bus this morning, returning with the cleats as i knew i wouldn't need them on the homeward bound bus. between those and the pair of jeans that seem a bit too tight, i'm sure i'll have done myself some damage later in the week. i wonder what it'll be? i'll be happy to return to only two in-office days next week, but i will admit it was nice leaving my laptop locked up yesterday and this evening. tomorrow's soaking should take care of much of the snow, but of course that will leave everything slushy. have i mentioned yet how tired of winter i am?

done and dusted





robin walked me out of the driveway this morning in case of ice, and there was so little i doffed the cleats along the main street and walked to the bus alone. both bus journeys were interesting in their own way (morning late but fun, evening on time but horrid and almost 2 hours), and i got a lot of stuff done in the office in between those rides, so a pretty good day overall. doing it again for two more consecutive days, which allowed me to leave the laptop locked at my desk, so we'll see how the weather holds.

stupor bowl





wow. entertaining game (except for the cutaway shots of the orange shitgibbon and his aussie enabler), some fun ads (love the seal one!), and a helluva halftime show that's going to be discussed for some time to come, especially considering it was not necessarily for us white people. just terrific, well worth staying up for, even more so after watching liverpool's b-squad lose their fa cup game this morning. i'll probably be walking around like a bit of a zombie tomorrow, but i knew what would happen going in.

pre-superb owl madness





we shopped a bit earlier today, and good job we did, because we had trouble finding a parking spot and the supermarket was hella crowded. it wasn't like they were giving anything away, it's just that everyone seems to want to stock up before tonight's storm and tomorrow's super bowl. it was even worse further up in yonkers, where there were intermittent closures on stew leonard drive due to folks crowding into costco and stew's. absolute madness. glad we got back home relatively quickly, it wasn't the day to shop! i have a lovely fruit platter and veggie platter and hot wings and i'm pretty set for the puppy bowl tomorrow considering there's just the two of us. i definitely just want to cocoon now!

all except the bike





today i reorganized our snack shelf in the larder, grouping together all the nuts and the sugar-free choccies, etc., while i was refilling the tea holder, all in between doing weekly timesheets for my partners. called both my mom and my uncle, even showered... everything that can be organized is organized, except i still have to get back on the bike. and start to make medical appointments. i totally blame the weather. it's either too cold for my system or there's too much precipitation about, sometimes both. i don't hate february as much as january but i'm starting to.

icy clearly now





we heard the telltale pattering of ice against the window when we woke up this morning, so i'm pretty sure i made the right decision. it's all gone now, of course, but the weather looks pretty changeable in the next week or so. i filled out a full day of work and am ready to do the usual timesheet submissions tomorrow, even cooked a couple grilled cheese open sandwiches with caramelized onions (which i'm still tasting, damnit) and tomatoes for dinner, and now i'm tired, but a good kind of tired, i think. at least my body seems to have reset itself, so i should be in good shape for whatever's to come.

under it





yeah, it was the cookie, methinks. at least when i thought about it in the reading room, which seemed to be my prime destination today. lesson more or less learned. i took a few hours as sick time, let my folks know i wouldn't be in tomorrow due to the expected icy weather (i'll try coming in three days running next week to make up for it), and managed to attend enough meetings and take care of enough other stuff to make up the rest of the work day.
