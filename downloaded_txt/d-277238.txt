clean plant nutrition.
combining cutting-edge microbiology with ethically-derived plant nutrition, climategard™ is the most complete organic fertilizer on the market. in addition to micronutrients, silica and humic acid, each climategard pellet is infused with a high-performance blend of living bacteria and fungi that will continue enriching your soil long after your last application.more than 90% of organic fertilizers derive their nutrients from inedible slaughterhouse and fishery materials like blood meal, feather meal and fish emulsion. not only are these ingredients harmful to the environment, they're actually less easily absorbed by plants than other, cleaner sources. climategard's no-kill formula is delivered to your home in an environmentally friendly organic cotton bag with a compostable inner liner.


























tools for climate farmers.
climate farming™ is our signature protocol for growing delicious, nutritious food while protecting sensitive ecosystems and helping in the fight against climate change. two key components of this methodology are the integration of animals in growing operations, and the minimization of soil disturbance.rotational cell grazing with chickens is one of the best ways to further these goals, and it’s never been easier for climate farmers to implement thanks to the introduction of the chickmansion — a massive, mobile chicken coop that can hold up to 100 birds.





 
























earth friendly lawn care.
less than half of the nitrogen in traditional fertilizer is actually absorbed by your lawn. the remainder washes into nearby rivers, lakes and streams, causing deadly algae blooms that kill thousands of fish annually.climateyard™ is a probiotic lawn and landscape solution that replaces conventional fertilizer with an eco-friendly blend of beneficial bacteria and fungi. these microorganisms colonize the root structures of grass and other plants, feeding them atmospheric nitrogen and increasing the bioavailability of phosphorus that’s already in your soil.
