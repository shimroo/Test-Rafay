you’ve done the hard part: the man or woman of your dreams is yours, and aren’t they lovely? do we ever have a wedding spot to match — aboard a carnival ship!

a carnival shipboard wedding is a great way to start your life together… a spot as unique as the two of you. after all, think of all the weddings you’ve been to — we’ve got the fun alternative, with a view that’s hard to find on land and a sea breeze you just can’t get at a country club. your shipboard wedding will be held in the port of your choice, so choose a city you’ll remember forever as the one where you made it official.

leave wedding stress ashore, because for a simple fee carnival takes care of it all: the ceremony includes not only an officiant to get the knot tied right, but little details like the cake, champagne, music and more. and perhaps best of all: once you’re married, you’re already on your honeymoon!

your shipboard wedding can be customized to fit your imagination and budget. add packages that include everything from a simple open bar and hors d’oeuvres reception to an elegant sit-down luncheon in the ship’s formal restaurant. whatever you’re looking for, let our professional wedding agents help you design your ideal wedding.

personal touches

what matters most on your wedding day is that you’ll be spending it with the person of your dreams. but if you could custom-design your dream wedding, how would you make it truly your own?

let’s start with where — a carnival destination wedding lets you choose a scenic island as the background for your memories. the blue skies, the sounds of nature and even the sea-scented breeze as you say “i do” will become some of the most vivid parts of the memories you make that day.

it’s important to remember that a carnival destination wedding makes planning easy, because we take care of nearly every detail. we’ll take the bride and groom to the wedding site, select a local officiant to perform the ceremony, and handle the music and bouquet. we’ll even help you obtain a legally-binding marriage certificate in your destination port!

since we’ve already thought of everything, all you need to think about is how great it’s going to be.
