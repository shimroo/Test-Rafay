the story of sara’s

                                                    it began with sara, mother to the current owner, brian. she arrived at the tender age of 14 with a 4th grade education from county roscommon, ireland. sara’s father chose her, the hardest worker of 8 siblings, to travel to the united states to provide for the family. the early years of the “great hunger” left them desolate and poor. her first paycheck was sent home to her family to purchase a cow … which was life changing! her legacy of hard work, sacrifice and drive led us to where we are today!

                                                    we want you and your loved ones to make great meaningful memories, too! we appreciate and understand the sacrifices you make when choosing a family destination. family has always been important to us, and that’s why our promise is to continue to strive for a clean, safe, family-friendly getaway. let’s continue to make meaningful memories at saras …  it could very well be life changing!
