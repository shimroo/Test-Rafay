make your own jack-o-lantern or bird house
take a hardshell gourd. with a sharp knife, cut out the eyes and mouth for the jack-o-lantern. cut out the entrance for the birdhouse. leave the gourd to dry. when it is hard and dry, clean the inside. apply brown varnish on the outside. finish it with a coat of polyurethane. this will make your bird house long lasting.

hanging garden
if you are planning a terrace garden, and do not have too much space, wrought iron planters can be the answer. hang these planters on the wall to hold small pots of bright coloured annuals or hanging greens. alternate them wrought iron display shelves or wall brackets.

hypertufa in the garden
hypertufa is a synthetic substitute for tufa rock - a spongy cellular rock found in limestone country. it is hollowed out to make planters and tubs. because of its versatile nature, its much favourded in the garden to make birdbath, steps , benches, paving stones etc. hyper tufa is made of cement, sand and peat moss. the process is very simple and containers can be made easily and cheaply.  they are an attractive , natural alternative for expensive tubs and pots. hypertufa is porous, so are preferrable to plastic or terracotta containers. the walls of the container acts as a reservoir for water and allows the roots to breath. so switch your bulky stone trough for the light and versatile hypertufa.

using plants in your halloween design
oftentimes, people discount the use of plants when designing their halloween yard. when using plants to enhance your halloween ornaments, think about plants and flowers that thrive in the fall temperatures and weather. colorful perennials and annuals can provide an attractive splash of color to go along with your scarecrows or goblins. marigolds can provide a beautiful array of golds, oranges and yellows for your halloween display. chrysanthemums, ornamental kales, flowering cabbages and dusty miller may also provide that extra color for decorating your halloween yard.
