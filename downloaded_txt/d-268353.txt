bismuth & covid-19:
during the care of hospitalized covid-19 patients we administered bismuth subsalicylate to those patients having diarrhea or other gastric issues. upon retrospective review, we noticed that these patients became less dependent on supplemental oxygen. using arbitrary yet conservative criteria, we reviewed these cases and herein report the results. all patients showed at least some improvement in their oxygen needs and several showed marked improvement. noteworthy, none had any side effects from the bismuth, and the improvement came after the patients had already been treated with common covid-19 drugs. based on these observations and literature relating to bismuth and covid we recommend a detailed clinical evaluation of bismuths potential role as an adjunct treatment for covid-19. read the full research paper at bismuth subsalicylate & covid-19.
