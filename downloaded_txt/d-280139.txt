riley homes - established in 1967
 
riley homes, inc. was established in 1967 and quickly became a desired housing choice for many central illinois families. in 2019 ownership changed hands and was acquired by two key employees. while the corporation remains intact, there are new corporate officers. the two people who now operate the corporation have over 60 years experience in the industry.
 
we remain here to serve you with the experience and expertise you deserve. we are experienced in the sales, working with your lender, site development, and service facets of the business.
