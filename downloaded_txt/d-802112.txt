provencalcozy yet breathtaking just like your romance, our provencal is inspired by the provence region of southern france, a quaint countryside that sidesteps the hustle of paris without deserting the charm or splendor.  this property offers romantic chemistry, pairing the exotic and exciting, with the cozy and familiar resulting in an ideal wedding day ambiance.   guests enter through the main villa and proceed through towering trees into a courtyard covered in flowers, shrubs, and ornamental fountains while scenic terraces overlook the property. an assortment of open and covered patios encircle the central gazebo, allowing your guests to view your outdoor wedding.
