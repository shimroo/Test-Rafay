ask me “what do you you?” when you have a lot of time to listen to stories. i dive into all kinds of creative things from business writing to graphic design to circus performing. i also manage tech projects, plan events, and make sense from chaos. and i teach yoga, publish e-books, lead art workshops, and surrender to my cats’ whims.
feel free to dig around to discover who i am and what i do. browse my blog; check out my work portfolio.trivia: i’ve been online since 1989 and running this website since 2000. for many years the first search result for “kristen” was me, but i was later eclipsed by actress kristen stewart. so it goes.
