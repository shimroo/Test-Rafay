what they're saying



 












 

	            we love the rotating exhibits as well as remember the same great brain teasers and puzzles. this was a great place for visiting, summer camps, and school trips. you have to go at least once or twice even as an adult.

	            great place to go learn and play, even if you don't have kids.
building history was wonderfully maintained.

	            we had such a great time.  truly fun for all ages.  we took a 2 and 3 year old -- both had a great day.  i was worried that they may not have enough for kids that age, but they really do.  the experiments and layout really is great for everyone.

highly recommend going if you are in the area.

	            me and my son had a blast. he was most interested in the water tables and the race track. we will definitely be back!
