l'arche 



winnipeg 



creating a world where everyone belongs 






learn more



















l’arche winnipeg operates throughout the local neighborhoods of transcona, st. boniface, and southdale. we live, learn, grow, work, gather, and build community in treaty one territory, the home and traditional lands of the anishinaabeg, cree, ojibwe-cree, dakota and dene peoples, and the national homeland of the red river métis. we give thanks for our clean drinking water, which comes from shoal lake 40 first nation, in treaty three territory.we respect the treaties made on these territories, and we mourn the systematic oppression and discrimination of indigenous peoples. we dedicate ourselves to move forward in partnership with indigenous communities in a spirit of reconciliation and collaboration to create an inclusive and accessible world where everyone belongs and is celebrated for their unique gifts.
