 vision
we envision reservoir hill as a model of a vibrant urban community with excellent schools, safe streets, abundant green space and outdoor recreation areas, multiple opportunities for residents to interact, housing that meets the needs of growing families and a broad range of incomes, and revitalization that benefits everyone.


    


  "cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody."
