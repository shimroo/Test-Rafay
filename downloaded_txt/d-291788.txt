king’s daughters' has been nothing less than a miracle in our lives in the care and development of our joey. it is hard to put into words how much we appreciate the love, patience, and innovative approaches to maximizing his possibilities of an independent life. the staff treats joey-the-boy with the love and care of a family member and the patience of saints. i can share countless examples of this which provide comfort when we hit those often moments of missing our boy. i do not know what we would do without them.

there is a sign as you approach the campus, and it has the letters i h n (in his name). every time i see this sign, it brings to mind a time i have witnessed this mindset among employees at the school. most employees at kds see their job as a calling. they recognize it goes well beyond the job description. students are well respected and guided along life’s journey. i see kds and the members of the team as part of our extended family. i am so impressed with the variety of activities available to our grandson from art to technology to recreation.
