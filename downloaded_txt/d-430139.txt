publicity & media




much of supportline's work involves supporting adult survivors of childhood sexual, emotional and physical abuse and since the media focus on the jimmy savile and other vip  cases of abuse, and the child sexual abuse inquiry, an increasing number of survivors are turning to supportline for help and support.
supportline is urgently in need of funds to enable our vital services to continue, please support us so we can continue to support others. thank you.
you can call our helpline number on: 01708 765200
or email us: info@supportline.org.uk
