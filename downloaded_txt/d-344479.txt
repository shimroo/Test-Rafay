arquilla park
parts of arquilla park will be closed to the public beginning wednesday june 26, as we begin the first phase of a multi-million-dollar rehabilitation project to mitigate neighborhood flooding.
 
remaining open:
 
• basketball court
 
• parking lot
 
• fieldhouse (rentals still accepted)
 
closed:

this project began years ago with the acquisition and demolition of several nearby properties. after recent votes by the mwrd board and village trustees, this $5m phase can now begin.
 
as this infrastructure work is carried out through 2024, we will begin outreach to residents for feedback on amenities we should prioritize when the park re-opens in 2025.

firestation rehabilitation
 
work has begun to rehabilitate fire station 2 at arquilla and roberts. the station was originally built in the1960's with the addition of a bay to house the ladder truck in the 70's.our modern-day operations were hampered by the constraints of the building with only one tiny bathroom, sleeping quarters adjacent to the truck parking bays, inadequate ventilation, no handi-cap accommodations and asbestos to name a few.
 
the planning phase identified the ability to maintain the original building and "add onto it". the work began friday october 20,2023 and is expected to be "on going" for 6 to 8 months depending on weather. once complete the facility will have three apparatus bays, administrative offices, a workout facility, locker rooms and complete compliance with current codes and standards.
 
for the duration of construction of the apparatus and crews have been relocated to a temporary trailer placed at public works with the vehicles housed in the public works building. this relocation will maintain rapid response capability on the westside of the rr tracks.
 
we look forward to a grand opening in the summer of 2024 where the entire community can enjoy the enhancements provided to your fire and ems providers, your firefighter paramedics and emt's!
 
funding for this project is courtesy of the tax increment financing districts and will not impact general fund operating budgets of the village.
 
please contact chief welsh1-708-753-2440 if you have any questions, concerns or if you would like to hear more about our modernization plan!

water quality report 2023
village of glenwood
 
annual water quality report
 
each year, the village of glenwood works with the illinois environmental protection agency to ensure our drinking water remains safe.
we are pleased to say that the most recent water quality report, for calendar year 2023, has shown that our water remains clean and safe to drink.
the source water protection testing process involves months of samples and ongoing testing throughout the year, ensuring pollution protection and that chemicals like chlorine, lead and other contaminants never rise to dangerous levels, whether they come from things like agricultural runoff, land disposal, septic systems or shoreline erosion.
 
to view glenwood’s 2023 report, please click here. if you would like a paper copy of this report mailed to your home, please call glenwood public works at 708-753-2417.
 we appreciate your interest in this annual report and hope it provides assurance of the safety of our drinking water.
