support the theatre

ticket sales alone are not enough to pay for everything a not-for-profit theatre gives to its community each season. as a not-for-profit regional theatre, 40% of our annual budget comes from charitable contributions from individuals and corporations, like you.
to learn about the many ways to get involved – to champion live theater, ensure access to the arts, prepare all children for a creative future, and safeguard the theater’s positive financial impact on local businesses – we invite you to explore the different opportunities by clicking the links below:
