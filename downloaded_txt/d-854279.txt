    we're feeling the love today thanks to reception's gorgeous love bugs! the children have made them in time for valentine's day, using lots of fine motor skills to sculpt their clay bugs and thread the beads onto the antennae. #valentinesday #prepreplife 82 0    year 3 pupils enjoyed their 'lightbulb moment' as they used an online circuit-building app, @phetsims, to show their understanding of basic electrical relationships in a circuit. their teachers passed them various challenge cards to complete different circuits and the children were excited to see the lightbulb flash on screen when they had accomplished the task correctly. well done, year 3! 
#stem #circuits #schoolscience #privateschool #hertfordshire 31 0    house spirit stayed strong despite the freezing rain and rivers of mud during our seniors' house matches this afternoon! we saw some lightening fast running this afternoon from woodhall house who won their match against sacombe house. thank you to the brave parents who turned out to support from the sidelines. 80 3    they've done it! our u11 netballers have earned their place at the @iapsuk nationals after winning the regional netball tournament in ipswich today. the girls' work-rate was faultless, their teamwork second to none, and their passion for netball as strong as ever! they kept pushing right until the final whistle, winning 10-5 in a thrilling last match against @duncombeschool. congratulations to the super seven and their coaches on a fantastic achievement. #netball #prepschoolsport @iapsuksport @muddystilettosschools @goodschoolsguide @tatlerschools 104 3
