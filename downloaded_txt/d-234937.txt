mpi's southern california chapter


  in the spirit of unity and support, we have compiled an extensive list of resources to aid those affected by the recent fires. these include immediate relief options, housing and financial assistance, mental health support, and more. additionally, our partner, visit anaheim, has stepped forward with special offers for evacuees to provide safe and comforting refuge. we have also secured additional resources from other partners, and will continue to do so. these resources are linked in our instagram bio. check back there, and on our instagram story, for new updates.updated january 16, 2025
