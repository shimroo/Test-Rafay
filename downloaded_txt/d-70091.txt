an inch at a time: reflections on the journey



sister joan chittister famously said, "we are each called to go through life reclaiming the planet an inch at a time until the garden of eden grows green again." reflecting on that journey -- a blog at a time -- is the focus of this site.

new year’s homily 2024: looking to the growing edge





[a new year's eve homily for all saints church, pasadena.]it
was christmas 1992 – 32 long years ago -- and i was the parish administrator at
st. paul’s in ventura where i was just beginning to think about thinking about thinking about what it might mean to
enter the ordination process. i received as a christmas gift from the rector a
copy of sister joan chittister’s just published book: wisdom distilled from the daily: living the rule of st. benedict today.
while
i think i mustered a polite murmur of gratitude i know i quickly set the book aside on the pile of flannel pjs and
see’s candy under the christmas tree. and because the
memory fades i can’t honestly remember when i finally picked it up to read. but
i can honestly say that when i did, it changed my life.
sister
joan was my first introduction to the radical notions of personal faith
connected to faith in action, of communities committed to challenging the
status quo rather than conforming to it, of monasticism that is about embracing
the world rather than escaping from it.
it
is fair to say that my theological education really began in earnest with this
slender, initially unappreciated, eventually devoured volume with its series of
reflections on what it is to live a life of faith and internalize a quote which
you have heard me offer more times than i can count from this pulpit:
“we are
each called to go through life reclaiming the planet 
an inch at a time until the garden of eden grows green again.”
an inch at a time. 
on
this new year’s eve as we teeter on the cusp between the year-just-finished and
the year-about-to-begin i find both comfort and challenge in those words. an
inch at a time. it doesn’t seem so much – an inch. the comfort is that when the
obstacles that surround seem overwhelming, the work ahead is daunting and the
miles-to-go-before-we-rest loom exhaustingly-before-we-even-start an inch at a
time seems pretty doable. that i don’t have to fix it all – solve it all –
figure it all out – just the inch in front of me – can be vastly reassuring.
empowering even.
an
inch at a time. it doesn’t seem so much – an inch. the challenge is that when the obstacles that surround seem
overwhelming, the work ahead is daunting and the miles-to-go-before-we-rest
loom exhaustingly-before-we-even-start an inch at a time seems not enough to
matter – too little to bother with.
who
am i – who are we – to think we can actually make a difference – much less
reclaim the planet! sometimes, rather than empowering, the inch in front of me
can be discouraging. immobilizing even.
thankfully
– in this cusp moment between a year that was full of challenges and year that
is rife with uncertainties – joyce rupp offers an antidote to that
immobilization in the prayer of meditation in our service leaflet this evening: 
be not wary of what awaits
youas you enter the
unknown terrain,be not doubtful of
your abilityto grow from its joy
and sorrows.for i am with you.i will be your guide.i will be your
protector.you will never be
alone.
 you
will never be alone. we will never be alone.there
is no inch we will be left to claim on our own.there
is no mountain we will be called to climb on our own.there
is no obstacle we will be left to overcome on our own.there
is no oppression we will be abandoned to dismantle on our own.
that
is hope and promise we claim on this new year’s eve 2024 … waiting to enter the
unknown terrain of 2025. the guarantee that we will never be alone … in either
the joys or the sorrows that lie ahead. 
and
-- as we gather in this sacred space this evening -- let us not forget that it
is not just new year’s eve … it is the 7th day of christmas … and we
continue to celebrate the gift of the word made flesh in the birth of christmas
baby … the love that came down at christmas.

the word made flesh in order to convince us that
we are never alone becausewe
are so loved by god that
god became one of us in order to show us how to love one another.
and
it is out of that sure and certain knowledge that
absolutely nothing can
separate us from that love – that
we can risk – we
can dare.
we
can be the change we want to
see in the world that
is crying for change:for
hope, for light and for joy as
we enter the unknown terrain ahead … together
as we continue to celebrate the incarnation – as
we continue to strive to live up the high calling of
being the body of christ in the world  ... of
loving one another as god loves us.
in
the words of howard thurman we heard
lori read just a few minutes ago:this is the basis of hope in moments of despair,the
incentive to carry on when times are out of jointand
men have lost their reason,the
source of confidence when worlds crashand
dreams whiten into ash.the
birth of a child —life’s
most dramatic answer to death —this
is the growing edge incarnate.look
well to the growing edge!
on this new year’s even 2024, dr.
thurman’s words ring as true for us as they did when he wrote them in the 1940’s
-- a time of global strife, war, division and the rising tide of fascism – calling
us to “look well to the growing edge.” but where do we even start?
for that, i want to return to the wisdom
of angela glover blackwell – social
justice advocate, attorney, and leader in the fight for racial and economic
equity – who recently gifted our all saints leadership team with a time of
teaching on how to take her learnings of a lifetime in the struggle and apply
them to the challenges of the moment. 
among the notes i scribbled while
listening to dr. blackwell was this quote: 

 “if
     you want to build success in the chain you have to start with the link
     that is the most vulnerable in order to strengthen the entire chain.”

if we are looking for the growing
edge … looking for which inch to start reclaiming – looking for where to begin
– we need look no further than the most vulnerable … not just for the sake of
the most vulnerable but for the sake of the entire chain. for the sake of what
dr. king called “the inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment
of destiny.” for whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.
in this moment we start with
immigrant neighbors facing threats of deportation, with transgender siblings
being targeted for discrimination and with women being denied access to
life-saving health care. 
we
look well to those places – these growing edges – where god is yearning to be
made present to the least, the lost and the last – and where we are called to make
god’s presence known as beacons of god’s love, justice and compassion even – or
perhaps especially – in these times of challenge. times described by bishop steven charleston this week in
one of his daily reflections:“some
will say: how
sad a season, so
much sorrow, so
little joy. but
if so little, then
so precious. if
so rare, then
so valued. so
much the essence of all our hopes. a
single drop of love like that can
light up the sky for
more dreams than we can count. so
release your joy. you
will shine among so many others who
share your hope, as
your love begins to
light up the world.”
a single drop of love
like that can light up the sky …
or
light up an email inbox! 
which
brings me to this story … not from once upon a time, long, long ago but from
this week. 
on
boxing day – the day after christmas – i was going through the incoming parish
email (as one does) and there -- nestled amid all the spam and year-end
fundraising appeals in the general all saints church inbox -- was this note
from across the pond in scotland: 
"i
saw a picture of you promoting tolerance and love with a progress-pride flag
above your door, and though i'm not a religious person, i wanted you to know
that i feel god's love through you. it's difficult for me to explain, as a
hopelessly rational person, but i think you will understand. 
i feel it from
certain churches here in scotland too, and strangely enough i seem to find
strength in knowing god exists through people like you. so i just wanted to
take a moment to let you know that small gestures from those i consider to be
real christians brings god into my life in small but meaningful ways. god bless
you."
 i seem
to find strength in knowing god exists through people like you.
 my
brothers and sisters and gender fluid siblings, this is the witness we hope we're making in the world – a
single drop of love in a photo in an instagram post lighting up the sky for
someone we’ll never meet in scotland.
this
is the growing edge we strive to incarnate as all saints church – work that
transcends the tenure of any rector or priest in charge, the term of any warden
or staff or vestry member. 
it
is the work we have all been called to do … it is work that has been for too
long delayed in the doing … and – if we’re honest about it – it is work that
will not be finished in our lifetimes … it is work we do in community:
every
time we gather … and every time we go outfed
by the holy food and drink of new and unending lifeweek
after week … inch by inch … drop by dropsustained
by the community that sends us out and then welcomes us back.and so as i close this homily and we close
this year … i want to return to sister joan and give her the last word:
in community we work out our
connectedness to god, to one another, and to ourselves. it is in community
where we find out who we really are … alone, i am what i am but in community i
have the chance to become everything that i can be. and so, stability bonds me
to this group of people and to these relationships – so that resting in the
security of each other we can afford to stumble and search, knowing that we
will be caught if we fall and we will be led where we cannot see by those who
have been there before us.
let
us go forth into this new yeartrusting
that as we work to become everything we can bewe
will be caught if we fallas
we rest in the security of each otherand
in the love that came down at christmas.merry 7th day of christmas.happy
new year.amen.

the both/and of advent: a sermon for advent iv 2024





i’ve
confessed before from this pulpit that advent has always been one of my
favorite seasons in the liturgical year.  what’s not to like about a season that is only
four weeks long, where
we get to wear blue and there’s baby jesus at the end of it? 
and
as much as i’ve loved advent over my now many years in the church, i don’t
think i can remember a year when it has lived up as fully to the adage “time
flies when you’re having advent” as it has this year – for here we are already …
all four candles glowing on the wreath and christmas just around the corner. 
and
as we light that fourth candle this morning – the candle of love – i want to
begin by recalling the words of the late theologian and mystic, howard thurman
– who famously wrote that for him the advent candles represent:

•
joy despite sadness,
• hope where despair keeps watch
• courage for fears ever present
• peace for tempest-tossed days
• grace to ease heavy burdens
• love to inspire all our living
 for
me, thurman’s words put flesh on the bones on the “both/andness” of these
advent candles which shine in the gloom which surrounds us – lit in
anticipation of christmas – and with prayers that they might burn in our hearts
all year long to keep us ready.to keep us ready. to inspire all our living.

for i love the idea that advent isn’t just a time of preparation for christmas –
but for a way of living in preparation for life’s challenges which don’t
miraculous disappear at the end of four weeks of blue with baby jesus at the
end. at least they don’t in my life. and i suspect the same is true in yours.
which is why we are called to be ready. to keep our lamps trimmed and burning.
to
live with both expectation and anticipation of the kingdom god not quite here  but yet within and among us. 
to
hold in tension the endings and beginnings which are the quintessential
themes of advent. to stay awake – what some would call “woke” not as an insult
– to the ongoing inbreaking of god’s love, justice and compassion continually
coming into the world – awake and prepared for the ongoing call to action as we
walk in love forward into god’s future – continuing … as our baptismal promise frames it … to strive for justice and
peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being. 
and
so this morning i want to tell you about four candles that i have seen glowing in
the darkness that surrounds us. they aren’t candles on a wreath in a sanctuary
– they are candles of action in the struggle. 
·       the first was a candle
of healing & hope in an email
o  
earlier
this month i was invited to be part of a tiktok puppet video series called “ask
the rev” and responded to the question from one of the puppets about what the
episcopal church believes about marriage.
o  
of
course my answer included that we believe marriage is a vocation for any two
people who feel called to live happily ever after together until death do they
part and ask the church’s blessing on their love. 
o  
it
got over 72k views and a number of predictable attacks from folks who wanted to know what bible i read and reminding me that if i persisted in heresy i would burn in the lake of fire. but that's par for the course. and it also inspired this email:
dear reverend russell,
i recently came across your video about
marriage on tiktok and found it profoundly healing. allow me to introduce
myself: my name is luis and i live in colombia. i am a catholic, and my faith
is something i hold very close to my heart. however, i have experienced
rejection from my local clergy due to my homosexuality, which has been a source
of deep pain and confusion. thank you for the work you and your church does and
the hope you bring to so many. god bless you all. 
·         the second was a candle
of resistance & rebooting in a diocesan meeting where 80 people gathered -- in person and online -- for the "rebooting" of our sacred resistance task force ... originally launched in 2016
§  q. what is “sacred resistance?”
§  a. one of the core
promises of our baptismal covenant is to “persevere in resisting evil.” we
understand that as a call to stand in resistance to the systemic evils that
oppress and marginalize any member of our human family – including but not
limited to racism, sexism, nativism, homophobia, anti-semitism and
islamophobia. grounded in our baptismal promises, our resistance to public
policies that perpetuate those evils is how we put our faith into action in the
world.
o  
resistance
is one of the ways we live out the words from the prophet micah this morning:
§ 
and they
shall live secure, for now he shall be great
to the ends of the earth; and he shall be the one of peace.
o   peace for all people – not just some people.
o  
“reconciliation is holy work. resistance is too. when the
agendas of elected officials scapegoat people of color and muslims, deprive our
fellow citizens of control over their lives, loves and bodies, desecrate god’s
creation or enrich the wealthy at the expense of the poor, we must oppose them.
this is not a partisan political statement; it is a confession of faith.” – gay
jennings
·       the third was a candle
of resilience & repair in an after church forum
o  
resilience
in the all saints community as 78 people gathered in the guild room for truth
telling about and exploring what reparations look like for the damage done by
unexamined privilege and systemic racism. 
o  
we
gathered for the hard, long haul work of listening across differences, hearing
each other into speech, truth telling, reconciliation and reparations ... work
that transcends the tenure of any rector or priest in charge, the term of any
vestry or staff member
o  
it
is the work we have all been called to do … it is work that has been for too
long delayed in the doing … and – if we’re honest about it – it is work that
will not be finished in our lifetimes. 
o  
nevertheless,
we persist. 
o  
and
in the year ahead we will persist together – with god’s help and with the
leadership of a growing team of good people of deep faith who are committed to
the aspirational goal of moving beyond inclusion to celebration of every single
member of the human family.


·       the fourth was a candle
of compassion & care on the quad lawn
o  
“do
you need a warmer coat?” was the question the volunteer asked of the visitor to
the food table on a chilly sunday morning.
o  
here at all saints church over 200 coats given to under-resourced and unhoused neighbors over the last few weeks
o  
on
this fourth sunday in advent – with christmas just around the corner – we
prepare to celebrate again the arrival of the one who loved us enough to become
one of us in order to show us how to love one another
o  
and
the both/and of that celebration is that that love is already here – already
among and within us – already 
o  
it
is the love that leaves nobody out, draws everyone in and is good news for all
people
o  
and
it is a message antithetical to the one being proclaimed by those hijacking the
good news of god’s inclusive love in the service of christian nationalism
o  
for
the love we proclaim lives itself out by putting into action the words of the
magnificat which our sister mary proclaimed in today’s gospel: 
§  casting the mighty
from their thrones and 
§  scattering the proud
in their conceit 
§  as we participate in
the struggle against empire and oppression which is as old as roman occupation
and domination in the 1st century and as current as the headlines of
the rise of global oligarchies in the 21st. 
 all of these both/ands of advent
point to the truth madeline l’engle penned in her poem “first coming” -- which
is as true today as it was when she wrote it in the 1980’s:

we cannot wait till the world is sane
to raise our songs with joyful voice,
for to share our grief, to touch our pain,
he came with love: rejoice! rejoice!
rejoice.

for many of us … the candles burning on the wreath notwithstanding … that’s a
tall order in a year, in a moment, in a world, in a nation that far too often
feels the exact opposite of sane … where we are bombarded with what my father
used to call “news of fresh disasters” as innocents are slaughtered in a war
that rages on in the land where shepherds watched their flocks by night; as gun
violence continues unabated, hatred and polarization reach epidemic
proportions, and refugees seeking sanctuary find no room at the inn at our
border while fascism rears its ugly head in a nation aspirationally dedicated to
the proposition that all people are created equal.

nevertheless, we light the candle and we claim the promise – because we are
hardwired to live with the both/and – the not yet and the already – to live
into the non-binary truth of advent that grief and pain can co-exist with love
and joy – and that the incarnation of that truth is once again about to come
among us as that baby born of our sister mary: the word become flesh to show us
how to live in a broken world as if the kingdom god has already come -- as if
the love of god is greater than anything that challenges it.
and how do we do that seemingly impossible task? imperfectly. haltingly. sometimes
begrudgingly. but most importantly we do it together. we do it together as
community.

we do it as the body of christ living out the hope, peace, joy and love of the
advent candles
not just during the run-up to christmas but all year long as we gather around
this table to fed by the bread and wine made holy and then go out into the
world as beacons of god’s love, justice and compassion.
 that is the work we have been called
to do, equipped to do and empowered to do: to witness to the light coming into
the world we will celebrate in a few short days in our christmas celebrations
and then take out into the new year ahead … in a time when that witness has
never been more essential. so -- in the words of our brother, bishop steven
charleston:
 let us be bold in
our witness, for the time of change is upon us, and the dreams of many hang in
the balance. let us be clear in what we say, for there are uncounted numbers
listening, waiting for just such a message as we ourselves have been given. let
us be transparent: we are agents of love, workers for peace, stewards of the
earth, and members of a community of seekers, united in respect and diverse in opinion by the indestructible power of god's
inexhaustible love
let us be bold in
our witness, for the time of change is upon us,
and the dreams of many hang in the balance.

as we prepare to go forth this morning,  as we turn the
corner from advent preparation to christmas celebration, may we be given the grace to move forward in
faith as rejoicers and resisters, as
agents of love and workers for
peace, as outward and visible signs to a weary world in desperate need of that indestructible power of god's
inexhaustible love.
won’t you pray with me:

o come, desire of nations, bind
in one the hearts of humankind;
bid thou our sad divisions cease,
and be thyself our king of peace.
rejoice, rejoice.
emmanuel shall come to thee, o israel. 

amen.

when we fight, we win





"when we fight, we win" does not mean we win every battle. it does not mean there are not heartbreaking defeats, demoralizing setbacks and sleepless nights wondering wtf. it does not mean that the principalities and powers we fight against -- racism, sexism, heterosexism, patriarchalism (just to name a few) are not deeply entrenched and wired into this beautiful and broken world which this morning feels further than ever from the beloved community it was created to be.nevertheless, we persist.and we need icons of persistence, i give you the philadelphia eleven. i give you eleven women who picked themselves up off the floor when the 1973 general convention of the episcopal church gut punched them by voting down the ordination of women by a wider margin than it had voted it down in 1970 and organized a resistance movement that led to their ordinations in july 1974 -- and to the regularizing of those ordinations in 1976.today's election results feel to me like i imagine that 1973 vote felt to them as they questioned everything they thought they knew about the church they loved and served. i know i'm not alone in questioning how to respond to this gut punch from a nation theoretically dedicated to liberty and justice for all choosing to vote instead for power and privilege for some.today i don't have answers. but i do have faith.i do have community.i do have sisters in the struggle, brothers and non-binary siblings in the fight and the history of the philadelphia eleven in my heart.when we fight, we win and we have only begun to fight.la lucha continua

revisiting "the sisterhood of the red blazer"





here in the diocese of los
angeles as we prepare for our 2024 diocesan convention in riverside next week,
we are also preparing to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ordinations of
the philadelphia eleven … the first women ordained to the priesthood in the
episcopal church in july 1974.we will welcome the reverend dr. carter heyward
as our keynote speaker and as the presider at our convention eucharist where we
will use the liturgical propers appointed for the feast of the philadelphia
eleven added to our church calendar at last summer’s general convention. the
reverend norma guerra will be our preacher, the procession will include all the
clergywomen present at convention and the festival color will be red. it will be a grand and glorious occasion.
and planning it brought me back to this
reflection i wrote a decade or so ago:my first diocesan
convention was back in 1987. back then i was a lay delegate from my parish (st.
paul's, ventura) and my credential read "mrs. anthony russell" ...
never mind that the sum total of mr anthony russell's involvement in the work
of the diocese of los angeles was to show up on christmas eve and easter
sunday.it was back in the day when we didn't dare run more than one woman in any of
the elections. i remember a literal coin toss between two women clergy one year
about which one would run for general convention deputy because the diocese would
never send two women! (lynn jay beat out liz habecker.)it was time when if we
sang a hymn that wasn't in the hymnal or -- god forbid -- used a liturgy with
expansive language -- there would be a queue at the microphone afterwards with
dour clergymen asking for a "point of personal privilege" to express
their outrage at the “abandonment of the faith received from the fathers.”and i remember when i
was in the ordination process being told it wasn't a good idea to wear my red
blazer (and i loved my red blazer!) because red was a "power color"
and i'd better pack it away until after i got safely ordained.so yes, the church has
changed in the decades i've been a delegate to the annual meeting of the
diocese of los angeles -- and my response to that versicle is "thanks be
to god!" there may be a few left who yearn for those halcyon days of
yesteryear when women delegates were named "mrs. husband" and we knew
better than to run more than one of us in any given election. but the rest of
us are celebrating the steps forward this church has taken to overcome its
sexism and are going to "keep on keepin' on" until we are fully the
inclusive body of christ we are called to be. we may not be there yet … but we
are not going back!however, some of us are going to get on the road shortly for riverside. prayers
invited from all ya'll for my diocese as we gather in convention ... and now i
just need to pack my red blazer and i'm off!
and when i got to riverside i
found a whole cohort of sister clergy who had read the piece and packed their
red blazers … and from there rachel nyback (pictured above) and i coined the
phrase “the sisterhood of the red blazer.”this year as we gather in riverside we will celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the sisters who shattered the stained glass ceiling and paved
the way for women called to the vocation of ordained ministry to respond to that call and
validated the vocations of women called to lay ministry as a vocation -- not as a default
because the path to ordination was closed to them. and so we’re encouraging red as
the festival color of the day -- not just for the stoles women clergy will wear
in procession or for the photo we’ll take to mark the occasion at the end of
the eucharist -- but as an outward and visible symbol of the faith received
from the mothers (and fathers) as we all move forward together into god’s future!

see you there! (i’ll be the one in the red blazer!)

reprise of isaiah 58 in the wake of ongoing gun violence





shout out, do not hold back!lift up your voice like a trumpet!why does the united states worship gunsinstead of god?yet day after day they seek meand delight to know my ways,as if they were a nation that practiced righteousnessand did not forsake the ordinance of their god;they ask of me righteous judgments,they delight to draw near to god.why do you go to all these churches, but you do not see? why do you humble yourselves, but you do not notice?” look, you serve your own interest on your worship day, and then just do the bidding of the national rifle association.look, you pray and then go out to buy and sell guns and make it easier for many to commit mass murder. such prayers as you do today will not make your voice heard on high.is such the worship that i choose, a day to make it easier to sell guns? is it to bow down the head in prayer, and then call for prayers for gun victims? will you call these prayers, a day acceptable to the lord?is not this the prayers that i choose:to free the nation from the yoke of the nra,to undo the fraudulent interpretation of the second amendment,to let those who fear guns in their neighborhoods be freed,and to overturn the gun lobbies?is it not to share your opposition to out of control guns with your neighbors,and to bring better policy to our nation;when you see those in terror of gun violence,protect them and keep them safe?then your light shall break forth like the dawn,and your healing shall spring up quickly;your vindicator shall go before you,the glory of the lord shall be your rear guard.then you shall call, and the lord will answer;you shall cry for help, and god will say, here i am.["our great god gun -- it is clear to me that americans really worship the great god gun. so i imagined god’s response to this idolatry via the profound words of isaiah 58." susan thistlethwaite ... one of the great prophetic voices of our time.]

celebrating the feast of the philadelphia eleven 





the philadelphia eleven (the eleven women who made history
in 1974 as the first women ordained to the priesthood in the episcopal church)
now have their own feast day in the church’s liturgical calendar -- and i am proud to be part of the
diocese of los angeles which helped lead way in making that happen.
the following resolution was adopted in november 2023 at the
diocese of los angeles’ 128th annual convention:  
resolved, that the 128th annual convention of the
diocese of los angeles submit the following resolution to the 81st general
convention of the episcopal church meeting in 2024: resolved, the house
of ________________ concurring, that the 81st general convention include and
enter the philadelphia eleven to the lesser feasts & fasts calendar of the
church year to be celebrated on july 29.
sent forward to the 81st general convention of the episcopal
church in 2024, it was adopted by acclamation. the resulting addition of this
feast day to our calendar means that as we approach the 50th anniversary of
those stained glass ceiling shattering ordinations on july 29, 2024 there are
now liturgical propers and prayers officially authorized for use throughout the episcopal church. 
the philadelphia eleven were also celebrated during general
convention with a tribute resolution and  a moving moment of prayer and reflection led by the reverend dr. cynthia black -- a moment captured in this video clip. yes, there are miles to go before we rest and ... how far we have come indeed!

celebrating incremental victories





"have you seen the new episcopal pride shield? omg!" was the subject line in the email ... which contained this link to an update from the episcopal public policy network release which began: "in affirmation and celebration of the episcopal church’s lgbtq+ members, the office of communication is pleased to unveil a new pride shield available online for churchwide use." and --  as my friend and sister-in-the-struggle elizabeth kaeton has famously said -- my eyes started to sweat.in the middle of a regular-old-thursday at my desk catching up on everything i was going to get to after clergy conference and have to pay attention to before general convention ... plus some random check request issues, a pastoral visit with a discernee and a staff eucharist thrown in ... i was flooded with a mental slide show of the ghosts-of-inclusion wars battles past and a little "pinch me, i think i'm dreaming" moment.twenty-four years ago as we prepared to go to denver for general convention we were assaulted on all sides by those who thought we were moving too fast and were going to split the church, by those who thought we weren't moving fast enough and were planning to come and chain themselves to the convention hall doors in protest and those who were telling the clergy planning to vest and process at the integrity eucharist that it would be end of our careers in the church.and now as we prepare to go to louisville for general convention we count six queer bishops in our house of bishops, have a task force on lgbtq inclusion as one of our interim bodies and now an official pride shield (and i quote) "in affirmation and celebration of the episcopal church's lgbtq+ members."i literally did not think i would live this long.which does not mean we are done.which does not mean there isn't work yet to do.and certainly does not mean we can risk underestimating the forces at work in our world marshalling their resources to push back the gains toward full inclusion in our church, our nation and our world.nevertheless -- as the inimitable george regas of blessed memory taught us -- the way we get where we're going is to set audacious goals and celebrate incremental victories.the audacious goal is still nothing less than the dismantling of oppression in all its forms. and the incremental victory is today's unveiling of a pride shield for the episcopal church. so let us rejoice and be glad in it. and then let's get back to work.

because as we've said before and will say again: la lucha continua ... the struggle continues. and we are in it to win it.

welcome to my blog ...






... where i try to be really clear about what i'm clear about. for example:

religious persecution is when you're prevented from exercising your beliefs, not when you're prevented from imposing your beliefs.============ using "biblical standards" to condemn those who understand that sexual orientation is morally neutral makes as much sense as using "biblical standards" to condemn astronomers who understand that the earth revolves around the sun. the bible may have said it but that doesn't always settle it. ============ it's liberty and justice for all -- not some. it's respect the dignity of every human being -- not just straight ones. got it? great. let's do it. ====== in order to keep moving forward toward liberty and justice for all we can't just be right about what the 1st amendment protects. we have to be smart about how we respond to those who skipped the 9th commandment and think lying is a traditional family value. ======= jesus said "love your neighbor." not "love your neighbor unless your neighbor is gay."

bottom line:






a comment on comments

strongly held perspectives are appreciated. ad hominem attacks will be deleted. when in doubt, revisit page 305 of the bcp and if what you're typing doesn't meet the "respect the dignity" clause of the baptismal covenant then save us both some time and energy and don't hit "send."

my youtube response to using the bible as a weapon of mass discrimination




smart things other people have said you should know about

“faith in action is called politics. spirituality without action is fruitless and social action without spirituality is heartless. we are boldly political without being partisan. having a partisan-free place to stand liberates the religious patriot to see clearly, speak courageously, and act daringly.” -- ed bacon“power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice. justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love.” – dr. martin luther king jr."it's time for "tolerant" religious people to acknowledge the straight line between the official anti-gay theologies of their denominations and the deaths of these young people. nothing short of changing our theology of human sexuality will save these young and precious lives." -- the rt rev gene robinson"how can you initiate someone into the body of christ and then treat them like they’re half-assed baptized?" - the rt rev barbara harris“i swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. we must always take sides. neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.” ~ elie wiesel, 1986 nobel peace prize"resolve to be tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and wrong. sometime in your life, you will have been all of these." — siddhārtha gautama"i'm so glad mary didn't wait for the formulation of a doctrine of the incarnation before she said 'yes' to god." -- ed bacon"the great easter truth is not that we will be born again someday but that we are to be alive here and now by the power of the resurrection." -- philips brooks (paraphrase)"history belongs to the intercessors, who believe the future into being.” -- walter wink“patience, a quality of holiness may be sloth in the soul when associated with the lack of righteous indignation.” -- abraham heschel"don't tell me what you believe. tell me what difference it makes that you believe!" -- verna dozier“we establish no religion in this country, we command no worship, we mandate no belief. nor will we ever. church and state are, and must remain, separate. all are free to believe or not believe, all are free to practice a faith or not, and those who believe are free and should be free, to speak of and act on their belief. at the same time as our constitution prohibits state religion, establishment of it protects the free exercise of all religions. and walking this fine line requires government to be strictly neutral.” -- ronald reaganlet's be clear. the fact that the state authorizes a marriage in no way compels any church to perform or recognize it. marriage equality merely guarantees equality under the law to all citizens; it does not compel churches to do anything.-- katherine ragsdale
