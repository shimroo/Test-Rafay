								about us							








								10 step process							








								featured article							







in 1969 i purchased my first collector car, a 1933 dodge. it was also my first full restoration project. i sent the bright work out for full professional restoration, and i was very unhappy with the first results.
a few tries later, some of the trim was still not meeting my standards, so i decided to learn how to restore the trim myself. between 1969 and 1985, the year i established iverson automotive,

 


i honed my trim restoration skills – learning the nature of various metals, compounds, and finishes, and the effects of temperature, speed, and pressure upon them. i developed my own method for restoring stainless, aluminum and pot metal trim.
part style and part scientific process, i created a 10-step procedure for bringing automotive trim back to life. remove all dents, scratches, pits, and recontour, if necessary.

 














steps to trim restoration

 




remove all dents, pits, scratches, and recontour.
sand with 280-grit sandpaper.
sand with 320-grit sandpaper.
sand with 400-grit sandpaper.
random-orbital sander with 400-grit paper.

 




smooth with 3m silicone composite wheel.
polish with medium cut compound.
polish with light cut compound.
polish with white finishing compound.
finish with a final coat of “metalsome” to a high luster.
