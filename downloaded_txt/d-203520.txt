from our president





 

peggy davies
the first quarter of 2025 is off to an excellent beginning.retailers and wholesalers nationwide launched campaigns for january’s store brands month aimed at educating consumers about the quality and value of their store brand assortments.  the manufacturing industry led by plma members actively supported this initiative and shared their enthusiasm across social media platforms. we’re pleased this inaugural event has been a success, and we’re excited to build on this momentum moving forward.not surprisingly, we’re delighted to report that the industry has once again surpassed our expectations, achieving a record-breaking $271 billion in sales.as shoppers continue to fill their carts with both food and non-food store brands in 2025, your organization is committed to leveraging consumer and business trends affecting our industry. we aim to create opportunities for our members and their customers to collaborate and grow their businesses in the coming year.
