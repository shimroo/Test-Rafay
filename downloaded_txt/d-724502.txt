                  not every s-130/190 basic firefighter class gets a live-fire field exercise, but the april, 2017 students sure did.



keep updated with the firecamp training schedule in google calendar.





thanks to dean staley and ryan o'conner for a great feature 
                  filmed during s-130/190 basic firefighter, #140 in march, 2014
                  and aired   on krqe news 13 in albuquerque, new mexico during april:



instructor mark thomas gave a great,  live interview on npr's “talk of the nation” on september 1, 2009. listen to “a day in the life of a forest firefighter.”





colorado firecamp is a 501(c)(3) 
                non-profit, wildland firefighter school, dedicated to expanding
               the opportunities for firefighters (and those who someday will
              be)  to attend quality redcard wildfire training. we primarily
              offer  100- and 200- level courses developed by the national wildfire
              coordinating  group (nwcg) in the areas of leadership, incident
              command and suppression  skills. 
by working with local (upper arkansas valley), zone (pueblo
                dispatch) and regional (rocky mountain area) training teams,
                colorado firecamp fills a niche in the wildland fire training
                market. we offer another option for fire management officers, fire chiefs, county sheriffs,
                and training officers to advance the skills of their firefighters.
                and, we give those without firefighting experience or previous
                firefighter training a chance to get a 'foot in the door' with
                the wildland agencies.
classes are taught using the conference facilities of the ponderosa 
                lodge. located 12 miles west of salida, colorado firecamp sits in 
                the middle of the maysville-north fork wildland/urban interface. 
                field exercises reinforce the classroom lessons.
simply stated, the mission of colorado firecamp is centered on 
                “keeping quality in qualification” 
                of wildland firefighters.
