"sidewalk of dreams"


            in the chalice town of the broken wheel where jarlath rested 
            and hung his tack they speak a secret tongue self mocking.

tuam 
                lies 32km north of galway city on the n17 major route. it owes 
                its origin according to legend, to the broken chariot wheel 
                which st. jarlath took as a sign to found his monastic 
                settlement here in the 5th century. tuam, the probable capital 
                of ireland during the 12th century, when the high king rory 
                o?connor was in residence. during this period the o?connors 
                endowed tuam with the processional cross of cong (now in the 
                national museum), and are associated with the ornamental high 
                crosses (now in st. mary's cathedral). tuam's location on the n17 
                makes it a natural dormitory town of galway city, but it also 
                has many fine local industries.
tuam 
                is best known as a centre of church affairs, ancient and modern 
                and has two cathedrals. the town owes its foundation to
                a 
                monastery established here in the 6th century by st. jarlath ; 
                ruins of temple jarlath, in the centre of the city, date from 
                around 1360. the 14' 12 century high cross of tuam, a decorated 
                sandstone piece, was once broken in three, with each piece in 
                different ownership. it is now situated in the rebuilt (1878) 
                church of ireland cathedral, which has a magnificent red 
                sandstone chancel arch in laboured romanesque, erected certainly 
                between 1128 and 1152.

tuam will commemorate the 400 year 
                anniversary in 2013, with a festival of events designed to 
                celebrate this historic marker as well as acknowledge the 
                extraordinary achievements of its townspeople and market tuam as 
                a great place to live, work and visit.
