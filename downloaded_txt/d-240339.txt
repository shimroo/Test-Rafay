 traveling
          hospital clown program
 

if you, a
          friend or a family member had a sick or chronically ill child on a
          long hospital stay wouldn't it be wonderful to see a pair or trio of
          "fun-loving-jovial" clowns visit your loved one to help
          brighten their day; helping to alleviate the loneliness & boredom
          they might be experiencing while being away from home.
doc magic
          (dm) visits ward to ward 2-3 times a week, 50 weeks a year at major
          host hospitals in metropolitan areas. 
"clown
          doctors/nurses" (professional clowns parading as medical
          doctors), provides relief for sick children & their families.
dm is
          supported by your generous donations. please click on the the above donate

        programs:
doc magic
      traveling hospital (dm):
a sick child in a
      hospital can be a traumatic & frightening experience. dm helps to
      alleviate the stress of being away from home by providing clown
      doctors/nurses who make clown rounds 2-3 times weekly at host hospitals in
      the tri-state area.
"send in
      the clowns..."
 
doc magic
      children's wishing well:
... where dreams
      do come true
in an on-going
      effort to brighten the lives of chronically ill children; dm grants a
      once-in-a-lifetime experience to children 4-15 years; the fulfillment of a
      cherished wish. 
the wish could be a
      policeman/fireman for the day, meeting a favorite baseball star, visiting
      the circus, etc..
doctor, nurses,
      social workers, parents, or caretakers: 
to  refer a child fax
      all info on diagnosis & health status to: call for fax..
 
operation red
      nose transplants:
a
      novel way of adding additional funds for doc magic's programs, with a
      comical twist.

      the selling of red noses each child we visit
      at our traveling hospital clown program receives as a gift a  red nose to
      keep. donate a nose today!

doc magic provides a
      very special week long "holiday" for groups of "extra
      special children" who are disabled or disadvantaged.
they may be terminally
      ill, chronically sick, physically disabled, sensory impaired, abused, or
      homeless.
we desperately need
      your support to continue this program. please donate today. for ages 4-15.
 
other ways to
      donate:
1) donate a day:
another way of
      becoming a friend of doc magic, that appeals to many donors, is to cover
      the basic cost of one or several days of clowning for patients, i.e. $600
      a day. we can inform you of the chosen dates by email, so that you know
      exactly which day you have made brighter for a hospital patient. if you
      wish, we can post your name and the date(s) on our website and include a
      dedication or an in memoriam. we will of course, be happy to receive the
      gift of a part of a day of clowning too -- any donation at all will be
      gratefully accepted.
2) monthly giving
      program:
to help reach more
      children throughout the year, you can support our programs through an
      ongoing gift by making monthly contributions that can be automatically
      charged to your credit card. the monthly giving program is a simple and
      cost-effective way to contribute to doc magic. to join call: 212-544-8153.
      ask for ext dmd.
3) anonymous
      gifts:
donors may wish to
      donate anonymously. please simply fill out credit card, expiration date,
      and amount only, or mail your check/money order.
 
where do we go
      from here
doc magic has many
      visions for the future. we are attempting to trademark our name and move
      toward national and state recognition.
secondly, we are
      working on developing proposals for major financial grants to hire a
      full-time staff to run the group. until we do, your support/donations are
      needed.
dm wishes to create
      a network of "on-call" clowns to travel to various hospitals,
      nursing homes, detention centers, and homeless shelters; and provide
      laughter to those that need it most when they need it the most.
with the proper
      grants, dm would like to travel from hospital to orphanage throughout
      south america & the world.
your contribution
      today will help us immediately reach more children in more hospitals. with
      enough funding, we can expand to sending clown doctors in homes for
      terminally ill children who are spending their final days with family.
