art zoo, set in an 18th-century canal house in amsterdam, is a museum of natural wonder showcasing the exquisite taxidermy art of darwin, sinke & van tongeren. visitors walk through giant aviaries, reversing the roles as they observe flamboyantly posed animals, tulips in specimen jars, and even a hidden t-rex skeleton. this modern wunderkammer immerses guests in a dreamlike world where art and nature collide.
