big daddy is a pinball parts web site geared towards the small hobby collector. the majority of the kits and parts are for solid state games from the late 70s to mid 80s, but you will find a variety of generic parts for all games. my goal in this business is to help pinball hobbyists and make life easier 				        when it comes to buying parts and accessories. if you don't see something you need, please ask by emailing me at: 
						  












i currently only accept paypal, and you do not have to have an account to pay, simply a credit card. 
							shipping costs and payment is made upon completing the checkout process.
