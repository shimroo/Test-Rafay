						"chris is amazing. he has detailed knowledge of the area and even the specific homes. especially impressive is how candid he is – he tells it like it is and if he doesn’t think something is worth the price, he tells you, unlike many other agents who are just looking to get commission as quickly as they can. he really knows how to build a trusting relationship with his clients."

						"we found chris edwards online because he had the best internet real estate (mrlakehopatcong.com) website, and we decided on using him after we read about how he is so connected to lake hopatcong. we were not disappointed. considering that we really wanted to live on the lake with the opportunity for a rental property, i think we found exactly what we needed. chris helped us every step of the way, and even afterwards. we highly recommend using chris if you want to find a great place on the lake"

bob and whitney h. 






						"in the past few months i have made two really great decisions.  the first was moving from the mayhem of city life to the quiet and stunningly beautiful lake hopatcong area.  and the other was employing chris’ services to search for and ultimately buy the lakefront house of my dreams.  both chris’ knowledge of the area and patience with my selection process, which took several months and countless viewings, guided me toward purchasing a move-in ready house with the potential to improve and expand over time.  i have nothing but wonderful things to say about my experience with chris. he most definitely made it easy to select the perfect house. a million thanks!!!!"					


brian d. 






						"i’m writing to thank chris for his help with the purchase of my lakefront home. my wife and i benefited from chris’ knowledge and professionalism. he was quick to answer my calls, respond to my texts and repeatedly visit the house prior to the sale. i wholeheartedly recommend chris to anyone looking for a house on lake hopatcong."

						“chris was amazing. there is nothing that can match working with someone who is so plugged into the local area. he helped us navigate to properties that met our criteria, and saved us a lot of time (important since we lived far away) by filling us in on the drawbacks of possibles we saw on-line. when we finally settled on the house we wanted, chris helped facilitate the transaction with the somewhat-difficult sellers. chris recommended a great local lawyer, and put us in touch with some local contractors for repairs. same for restaurants, fishing, boating – and more. we joked that he should be known as “mr. hopatcong”! we can’t recommend him highly enough!”
