once a quiet, upscale winter retreat taking on ghostly overtones during sleepy summers, naples has evolved into a popular -- and well-populated -- year-around playground with abundant choices for steak, seafood, ethnic and other fare at both family friendly and stratospheric (for a small town) price levels. waterfront options include dining at the village on venetian bay, the waterside shops at pelican bay, or at the naples beach hotel & golf club's hb's on the gulf (the only oceanfront dining enclave within official naples boundaries). other hot spots are on trendy fifth avenue south or third street south in old naples, at tin city, or along u.s. 41 heading north to ft. myers.  among newer dining 
sizzlers is the bellasera resort's zizi restaurant & lounge, where tuscan-inspired fusion fare and seasonally themed delicacies are served in the dining room or as moonlit cabana repasts for two.
