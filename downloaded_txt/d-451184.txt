roommate matching is by major metropolitan area only, as that works best for most.  we're currently across the united states and canada.

suburbs, please select your nearest metro.

if you're nowhere near, we're sorry not to serve you at this time.





















we review roommates before our subscribers do.

scam, spam, and scum get kicked to the curb instead of contacting you.
sidestep a horde of time wasters.






   avoid nitwits
quickly determine who is worth it with roommate behavior ratings.we also delete the insincere or just completely insane, before they'd see your profile.






   ip address actual location
know where potential roommates actually are, not just where they said they were.






   sidestep the scumbags
our human reviewers also screen for scum.this is, obviously, if you're well-intentioned, a roommate service.not a place to look for dates or confront "adult" content.anyone trying to sneak in something shady is too sleazy for us.






   expect freshness
we require a valid email address to start roommate matching, then we stay in touch, deleting anyone no longer looking for a roommate.we also check in every 3 weeks, requiring a response to remain active.other roommate services allow online-only profiles, or leave them up indefinitely.our roommate profiles are as current as reasonably possible, making it less likely you will waste your time trying to get in touch with anyone no longer looking for a roommate.






   save your time
you won't squander your free time here via tedious database searching, board browsing, or site wading.you don't have to surf day after day to find new roommate matches.we just email you.






   human moderated
no scumbags allowed!humans take out the trash for you.






   spare your email account
your information will not be shared, sold, or rented to anyone outside this roommate service.no "partner offers," and no other word games designed to distract you from noticing we're actually selling your information outside this roommate service even though we said we wouldn't.we just won't.all information is only used for the purpose of roommate matching via this roommate service.we are exclusively about roommates, so you'll hear from us regarding your roommate search, not for any other reason.






   pre-screened for trash
scammers specifically targeting roommate searchers are common.  our human reviewers use their actual eyeballs and organic brains to review all roommate profiles.many get tossed in the trash.immediately.we don't rely on our subscribers as our only reviewers, waiting to see what trash they report after wading around in it themselves.we take out the trash for our subscribers.we collect a lot of data, not just our actual questions, but also information from the submitter's computer and location.  we also do an ip address actual location analysis, and share the city in which potential roommates are truly located.unlike many ways you could find a roommate, we are paying attention to this information, and making use of it to decide which roommate profiles are worth accepting, and which are probable scams.
