(campaign to the university) ask the university to add an export feature to the student calendar application


                                                                        export classes/workshops/labs timetable to a .ics or .csv file. this would allow students to import their classes into their calendar app of choice.

a fellow computer science student implemented their own export script in javascript [1], so developing this feature should be a relatively trivial task. it'd be great if the university could add this feature to the mylboro app and the timetable web app to simplify the exporting process.

(campaign to the university) notify students via sms/email, reminding to pay parking

(campaign to the university) more security cameras and road lights in the campus also around the uni


                                                                        due to the poor police force there has been a lot of crimes happening like theft recently, the uni should set up more security cameras and road light in and out side the uni to protect everyone's safety.
