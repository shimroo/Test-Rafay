classic italian cuisine 



brothers roberto and riccardo pietrobono have created a red-sauce restaurant with a cozy, welcoming vibe. vintage family photos, flickering candles and rustic brick set an intimate atmosphere. at olazzo, we are determined to win you over with our passion for italian-american classic (cuisine) from our childhood. we aim to be your neighborhood nightspot and a place to spend time with friends and family, sharing good food and memorable moments.
















olazzo is a family owned and operated italian restaurant, founded by brothers roberto and riccardo pietrobono. sons of italian immigrants, the pietrobono brothers have been providing the washington dc metro area with an italian-american cuisine reminiscent of their days growing up in a pasta-centric household.since 2002, the attentive service and quaint yet comfortable atmosphere, have made us neighborhood landmarks.using only the freshest ingredients, olazzo offers concise, well-executed classics such as lasagna bolognese, linguine with sausage and peppers, and penne pasta with homemade meatballs, along with a lengthy wine list.



our location is in the heart of vibrant downtown bethesda. located on norfolk avenue, we are a community favorite, attracting diners from all around the dc metro area craving delicious italian cuisine. off wisconsin avenue and just a short distance from the dc line, our location is a fabulous meeting place for lunch, drinks or dinner!recently, we remodeled, with much of the work done by the pietrobono brothers (with the help of their father, a long time bricklayer). the classy yet rustic décor provides the perfect atmosphere for a romantic dinner, family celebration or any other dining occasion.



family owned. fresh ingredients.
