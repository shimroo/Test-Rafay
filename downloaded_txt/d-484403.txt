hcoe equity statement

hcoe is committed to equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging. we believe that the circumstances children are born into should not predict their access to the resources and rigor necessary for success. we strive to create a work environment and schools that cultivate a sense of belonging; grounded in safety, dignity and respect. we are committed to building a culture of connectedness, allowing us to grow and learn better together.
we see and celebrate the range of human differences as a source of strength. we welcome the unique contributions that each person brings. we recognize that inequitable systemic barriers exist, and that our work, individually and collectively, is to eliminate these opportunity gaps that result in disparate educational outcomes for our most vulnerable students. we accept that our equity work is a journey and not a destination.
