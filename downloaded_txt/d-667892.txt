rollover options for your 401(k) retirement plan: a comprehensive guide


introduction: what is a 401(k) plan?
a 401(k) plan is a retirement savings plan sponsored by an employer. it allows employees to save and invest a portion of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. the plan is named after section 401(k) of the internal revenue code, which established these types of employer-sponsored retirement plans in 1978. over the years, 401(k) plans have become one of the most popular ways for americans to save for retirement.
historical context
the 401(k) plan was introduced in the united states in 1981 as a way to encourage long-term savings. the plan gained rapid popularity due to its tax advantages and the ability for employers to match contributions. today, it is one of the most common types of employer-sponsored retirement plans, alongside others like 403(b) and 457(b) plans.
