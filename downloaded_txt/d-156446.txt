why microwave food?it's fast! generally, cooking food takes one-fourth the time in the microwave than it takes in your conventional oven. it's cool! cooking heat is created within the food, so your kitchen does not become overheated. it's tastier! natural flavors are retained in the food. it's nutritional! reduced cooking time means more vitamins and minerals are retained. it's economical! you only cook the amount of food you need. your microwave uses less electrical wattage than with your conventional oven, and you're cooking for a shorter amount of time. it's convenient! you can cook right in the serving dish, on paper plates and in paper towels. there is less mess to clean up after you're done.
