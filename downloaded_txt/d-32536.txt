welcome to north carolina’s first and most experienced 3d/4d/5d ultrasound centerwhat sets us apart? in addition to being north carolina’s first and only elective center to offer diagnostic ultrasounds/imaging, all diagnostic scans at womb’s window are performed by a diagnostic medical sonographer…guaranteed!












  

 nothing is more miraculous than the birth of your child. the wait for that special event is one of the most exciting times in your life. you hope, you plan, you dream, and ask yourself a million questions. will it be a boy or a girl? who will they look like? what is their world like? what do they do? do they smile, yawn, suck their thumb? wouldn’t it be great to be able to find out? wouldn’t it be fantastic to literally see your baby before you see your baby?

 












all 3 locations of womb’s window are family owned and operated. it is our goal to make you feel like family during every visit with us!






















  
































friends and family welcome!all of our scan rooms are very spacious with comfortable seating for your friends and family to join.

this place is the best! the owner is absolutely wonderful and so kind. the techs pay close attention to what they are doing and try to make you so comfortable and at home. so grateful to have met such wonderful people and get to experience my ultrasounds with this place, not once, but multiple times. 10/10 experience

i cannot say enough about the wonderful experiences i've had at womb's window! the staff is absolutely amazing, the facility is super clean and comfortable, and i know i'm in such great hands while i'm there, if you're a nervous new mama needing some reassurance that everything is progressing in those early weeks of pregnancy or just want to see your baby, this is the place to go!

samantha k., wilmington location, google review





we have visited womb’s window on several occasions during my pregnancy. the staff is professional and really builds relationships with their clients. it's also very important that the girls performing the ultrasounds are trained ultrasound technicians. they know what to look for and are looking out for both mommy and baby.

this place was wonderful! not only were the women in the office so caring and attentive, the office was immaculately clean and extremely welcoming! we went for a sneak peek gender reveal and were blown away! they really took the time to make us feel comfortable and made sure we were happy from beginning to end! it was such an amazing experience and i highly recommend to any expecting parents!

5 starts truly isn't enough. the whole experience was a 100/10. the people were amazing, so sweet, so kind. it was honestly so fun, it didn't feel like a doctor's office, it felt like we were all at home, just hanging out and having fun. it was so relaxed. i cannot thank them enough for what they have given me today. god bless them and this place.

corrie j., wilmington location, google review





going to womb's window was an incredible experience. they're so friendly from the moment you walk in the door, putting you at ease and talking to you like you're an old friend. their office is clean and well kept, with comfy recliners and couches to sit in during the scan and for family members. their technicians are trained and knowledgable. i went for a gender reveal ultrasound and she sat with me until she got a good view and could determine the gender 100%. worth every bit of money and would absolutely return again. highly recommend.

kristen b., jacksonville location, google review





we had a great experience today. the staff is excellent! the facility is beautiful and very well kept. i love the recliner the expecting mom gets to relax in. the whole experience is definitely worth it. i read reviews for 4 other facilities and this by far was the best choice i could've made. thank you again!!
