about us               hpa designs a building around your needs. our staff begins by gathering information to create a programmatic document with the goals, specific spaces, sizes, relationships,  atmosphere, and functional requirements. we collaborate with the client to achieve what they need. hpa believes every project is a team  effort. hpa uses a hands-on approach to project planning. each project is assigned a principal architect and project manager. as the project moves  toward construction, the team at hpa does not change.

testimonials









 “[hpa] has provided the answers each time we ask a question. i appreciate [their] fast response to even the most challenging situations. i am looking forward to many projects in the future.” 

barry mahler, wichita county commissioner, pct 3  





“the project team from hpa worked tirelessly with us. i recommend hpa without hesitation. if you are considering building a project and need an architectural firm that is knowledgeable and can help you bring your project in on time and within budget, hpa [is] a solid choice.” 

lynne johnson, registered architect





“it has been a pleasure working with [hpa]. i would recommend [hpa] without hesitation to any future prospective client who is looking for sound, practical, functional and aesthetically pleasing design.”

gary fragosso, ncarb, mba, assistant director, catholic diocese of fort worth 





“[hpa] has served as the county’s architectural firm since 1977.  this has been a very positive relationship due to their exceptional professional capabilities, personal commitment to the county and the continuity of work from one project to another.  i strongly recommend you favorably consider them for your upcoming project.”

woodrow w. “woody” gossom jr., former wichita county judge





“[hpa’s] plans and specifications are always very clear and well organized which helps assure very competitive bids and fewer changes. they also do a good job working with the contractor while ensuring that the owner gets the project as it was designed.  i have always respected the way they handle every project as if it was for them personally.  if i needed to hire an architect for any reason, it would be [hpa].”

— kevin darnell, president of m & f litteken co.





“[hpa is] professional, responsive, and provided a high quality product. they produce a high quality set of construction documents that are informative and easy to read. [hpa] is always ready to answer questions and clarify issues to ensure the project [stays on] schedule.”

— donny raffaele, former chief estimator of pete durant & associates, inc.





“[hpa’s] commitment to owner’s interests, details in design, understanding of constructability and oversight/administration of contracts exceed most design professionals that we have worked with and are on par with the very best.  all while being collaborative and open to suggestion and input from the construction point-of-view, which is not the custom in our industry.  hpa’s balance of these competing interests adds to the experience for the participants in the process and in the finished product for the end users.”

— dave lilley, esq., ceo of trinity hughes construction
