january 21, 2025, 10:05(est) by eric (a.k.a. tweakhound) 3 comments i’ve got linux mint 22.1 installed and running fine in a vmware virtual machine. as many of you know i do much of my computing in my linux mint vms.
i did not do an upgrade because going from linux mint 21.3, which i was running, required going from 21.3 to 22 to 22.1 and frankly i wasn’t in the mood.
here are a few screenshots. click on them for full sized.

notable in the release notes are virtual machine display issues.
i’m still on linux mint 21.3 cinnamon. that is now 2 versions behind. i will test out the new version in the next few weeks, most likely doing an in place upgrade first.
