what we are
about









the little capitals philosophy is simple: we are committed to helping every little cap reach their full potential at the tier 1 level and preparing them to thrive in junior hockey, ncaa, and beyond. we believe this focus on player development is the key to building a competitive program. to this end, the washington little capitals provide the cutting-edge content and curriculum consisting of strength and conditioning, on ice team and skill practices, and film study.   we offer our players well-organized, intense, and competitive practice sessions. players improve by being pushed out of their comfort zones.

hockey program











40+ years of history. the washington little capitals (little caps) is an elite tier 1 hockey organization that formed in 1983. little caps teams, from pee wee to midget, play in the atlantic youth hockey league (ayhl) and tier 1 elite hockey league (t1ehl).
once players become little caps, we are committed to continuously evaluating and supporting their development throughout the season. this gives them consistent feedback and communication from their coach letting them know where they are making progress and where they still need to improve. our coaches demonstrate patience and commitment to the players we select for our program. in turn, we expect our players to demonstrate hard work, commitment, and dedication to excellence at every practice and every game.
