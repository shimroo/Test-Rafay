service that never ceases
god simplified the law to two basic focuses:  loving him with all that you have, and loving others as yourself.  campus ministry seeks to develop ways for students to fulfill both of these.  they learn to love god by participating in adoration, worship and learning his word. they learn to love others by participating in and reflecting on service projects.
