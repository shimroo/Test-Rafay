illinois police accreditation coalitiondedicated to professionalism
our mission is to promote professionalism and accountability among law enforcement services in illinois and the surrounding midwestern states.
i-pac is dedicated to and supports the concept of accreditation to enhance the quality of law enforcement services. i-pac’s primary functions are to provide a network for member agencies that will encourage communication, cooperation, support, and the sharing of valuable resources.
calea (commission on accreditation of law enforcement agencies) accreditation was created in 1979 and is considered the gold standard in public safety. calea has programs for law enforcement agencies, public safety communications centers, public safety training academies, and campus security agencies. i-pac also supports accreditation through iaclea (international association of campus law enforcement administrators) and ileap (illinois law enforcement accreditation program).
i-pac provides support and assistance to agencies considering accreditation, those in self-assessment, and those agencies who have earned accreditation.
we recognize and support accreditation as a vital means to enhance the quality of law enforcement services.
