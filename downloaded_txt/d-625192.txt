 sapelo island: a stella bankwell mystery















stella bankwell and the gang are back — and this time there’s a murder. it couldn’t have happened in a more beautiful place than the historical georgia barrier island of sapelo, where wildlife flourishes and the ocean vistas are both breathtaking and calming. the new adventure begins with a corporate retreat at the home once owned by r. j. reynolds jr. — a mansion set among gorgeous oaks hanging heavy with moss. it’s the perfect setting for a southern gothic tale. among those returning in this second installment of the stella bankwell mysteries is chatham “chatty” balsam colquitt iv, mccager burnett, and us marshal jack culpepper.  our favorite redhead, stella, and friends are together again  to take on this mind-boggling challenge.
