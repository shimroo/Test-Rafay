in sunny san juan, scientists continue hai conference




after 14 years in miami, hai is on the move again. this january conference started in chilly boston and moved around the north for some time, meeting in chicago, seattle, and toronto, before settling in a warmer clime in 2011. for 2025, hai pulled up stakes again and landed in san juan, puerto rico. there, 419 attendees from 16 countries shared data about how to line up blood biomarkers with pet data, how locus coeruleus connectivity might influence tangle spread, and what the field is learning from its growing focus on studying non-white populations. read sara reardon’s stories.




proteomics lays groundwork for ftd biomarkers




how do cerebrospinal fluid proteins change over the course of frontotemporal dementia? hints come from proteomic analysis of csf from the world’s two large genetic ftd cohorts, genfi and allftd. synaptic proteins dropped in all forms of the disease, while extracellular matrix changes were mostly tied to mapt mutations, and rna-processing proteins to the tdp-43 proteopathy linked to c9orf72 and grn. the three genes had distinct proteomic profiles, implying that researchers could find biomarkers that distinguish each form.
