ella: keke palmer topher: joe carroll marie: judy kaye madame: nene leakes gabrielle: stephanie gibson charlotte: laura irion jean-michel: todd buonopane lord pinkleton: phumzile sojola sebastian: peter bartlett footman: andy mills driver: michael callahan lady of ridicule: jill abramovitz a nice capture of keke just two days before the show closed on broadway. she’s lovely in the role, but has a very different voice than laura or paige. many of the melodies were changed to fit her voice. nene is also fantastic and gets a lot of laughs. a very nicely captured video; there are a few heads at the bottom of the screen during act one, but they are easily worked around so they rarely affect the action. act two has no obstruction. there are also a couple quick dropouts in each act, but no major blackouts. it’s filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. the sound is excellent. includes curtain call, encore, and playbill scans.

filmed from the back row of the right balcony; small theater so zoomed closeups are very clear shot.no picture at the beginning of each act, so the picture is blurry or non-existant for a bit, and there's one short coverup during donkey's entrance, but other than that everything is there. there's very little audience obstruction and spotlight washout, and the sound is excellent throughout. a

filmed from the back of the nicely raked stalls with virtually no head
obstruction and only a couple of 30-second blackouts towards the beginning
of act one due to latecomers being seated; full show is included on the
video, curtain call is not; action is followed very well, using different
types of shots when necessary; little spotlight washout and the colors are
great, especially in the big church numbers. a

beautifully filmed. audio is excellent. a few heads at the bottom of the screen in wide shots, but they don't detract from the action on stage. first performance of the show after the strike, so a funny line change was put in the show. the dvd has been enhanced with animated menus and scene selections with chapter stops for all of the musical numbers. a
