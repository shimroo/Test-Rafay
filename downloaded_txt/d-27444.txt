hers rating home energy scale disclaimer
this home energy scale may be displayed on a model home or utilized in other marketing materials for homes within this community, illustrating a projected “hers” score rating and potential utility savings. energy efficiency ratings may be expressed as a hers (home energy rating system) index rating. the hers index® is a registered trademark of the residential energy services network (“resnet”), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization formed in 1995 to develop and maintain national standards for evaluating building energy and resource energy performance. the hers (“home energy rating system”) index allows buyers to compare the relative energy efficiency of different homes. the hers index home energy rating is determined by an independent resnet-certified home energy rater (“rater”). the lower a home’s score, the more energy efficient it is in comparison to the hers referenced home. for every one-point decrease in the hers index score, there is a corresponding one percent (1%) reduction in energy consumption as compared to a home with a hers index of 100. using resnet’s energy efficiency software, the rater determines a home’s energy rating by analyzing the home’s construction plans and performing onsite inspections; the hers rating provided by seller is generally not an “as-built” rating. note that newer energy efficiency building codes have been adopted in some states so that newly-constructed homes in those states will usually achieve a hers index score lower than 100 and thus be more energy efficient than the hers-referenced “standard” new home. the hers index score for this home, and the estimated energy costs, if shown on the label, are estimates only and are based upon the average energy performance for specified home categories as determined by hers. energy efficient features will vary depending upon the floor plans, elevations, design amenities/upgrades and the location of the home. seller does not represent, warrant, or guarantee all homes sold by seller have been individually rated. further an energy rating score may or may not factor in all options and/or upgrades available to be installed in the home. seller does not warrant or guarantee the monthly or annual utility bills for the home. the estimated monthly energy costs, if shown on the label, actual energy costs and/or energy usage are dependent on a number of factors, including utility rates, energy consumption, home maintenance, size of household, energy conservation practices, home orientation, and surrounding climate and weather conditions. seller does not guarantee any specific level of electric and/or gas energy utility costs or savings. seller has no business interest in any home energy efficiency evaluation organization or system, software program or rater. seller reserves the right to modify or vary features or components so long as they are constructed in accordance with applicable laws. information contained herein is based upon data obtained from third parties and should not be used as the only source of information when making purchasing decisions, investment decisions or tax decisions, or when executing other binding agreements. seller reserves the right to modify or vary features or components which are constructed in accordance with applicable laws.
