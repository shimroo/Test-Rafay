our mission

			-our mission-        



life miracle usa is a premiere developer and manufacturer of extraordinary health and environmental products, and has been trusted online since 1996. we are a socially responsible company that strives to solve some of the most serious health and environmental challenges our world is currently facing.
whether it is helping people with solutions for their overall wellness and taking control of their health — cleaning up our endangered and irreplaceable fresh water supplies with our amazing nano towels and other green cleaning solutions — or simply getting the proper comprehensive nutrition to stay healthy (with our potent liquid vitamins) — our goal is to change the world, one household at a time.
try one of our unique products through our 100% risk free trial, or contact us if you are interested in making an impact as our wholesale distributor, selling our products anywhere in the world.


 


			our philosophy on the environment:			 




we believe in creating true conservation, both environmental and financial, though innovative products and technology. the most important thing about a “green” concept, product, idea or technology is to save and preserve finite natural resources, and to actually replace something that is inherently wasteful and ecologically toxic. the bottom line is that the earth has a finite supply of natural resources that we can use. eventually, they will run out. it is our responsibility to create products and solutions that conserve our natural resources for future generations.
our goal as a company is to create innovative product solutions that have a small ecological footprint, and will save you money over time because they will save you from using expensive natural and man-made resources. we create solutions that are ecological, save natural resources, and save you money. they are meant to solve problems at both the personal household level and the global level.


 


			our philosophy on health:			 




we believe in natural health care, not allopathic “sick” care. our entire health care system is based upon treating sickness, not in creating wellness. good health starts with prevention. it is a lifestyle. it is not taking a drug when you get sick, or giving your personal control and choice over to an allopathic “health” system that too often chooses profits over patients and actual healing. in our view, good health is taking control of your own wellness, exercising your own personal power, and conscientiously engaging in natural anti-aging methodologies to keep you healthy for the rest of your life. our natural health products are designed to help you to take control back, and live a lifestyle of true wellness.
we are very grateful for the opportunity to serve you, and make a real difference in your life. please sign up below so we can continue our relationship and dialogue with you. we share articles of interest, special promotions and offers, and would love to have you a part of our community.

nano glove l/xl 11″ x 7.5″
$14.97


the nano glove® uses proprietary nanolon® fiber, the original breakthrough fabric technology that cleans with only water®, replaces expensive paper towels and chemical cleaners, and can help you save hundreds of dollars per year while potentially making your home safer, healthier and greener. 
go green go…use 80% less paper towels and completely eliminate chemical cleaners. the nano glove may be the most versatile cleaning instrument ever invented. you can use to clean a dizzying array of surfaces and substrates.
use it for cleaning glass, countertops, sinks, tubs, floors, wood, granite, dusting, and even difficult to clean stainless steel. completely clean all the surfaces in your bathrooms and kitchen. then you can clean the interior and exterior of your car, boat or rv.
use in your bathroom for keeping mirrors clean and free of toothpaste, hairspray and makeup. easily wipe down the sink and chrome fixtures. the nano glove is so gentle it can even clean skin and remove makeup with no harsh chemicals.
we do many harmful things to ourselves and to the environment out of simple force of habit. big corporations bombard us with advertising and we tell ourselves “everyone else” does it. these harmful lifestyles become routine because “it’s the way it has always been done” and frankly most people think that paper towels and toxic chemicals are the only way. but we believe that once someone discovers the harm they are doing to themselves and are given an option to create a new positive change, they jump at the opportunity.
think about it. you don’t have to completely eliminate your paper towels or cleaning chemicals. but just try the nano glove, and you will find yourself effortlessly adding it to your routine to make a huge difference in your health. 
 under normal conditions the nano glove should last between 2 to 3 years, or 300-400 washes.
