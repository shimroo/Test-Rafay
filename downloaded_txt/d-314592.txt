welcome to the jewish community center of paramus / congregation beth tikvah
“my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples” (isaiah 56:7)
we are a warm, active, vibrant, diverse and inclusive community that welcomes everyone to join us.  we embrace people of all social and cultural backgrounds, abilities, family structures and sexual orientations.  come pray with us, come learn with us, come celebrate with us, and add your strengths to our nurturing and caring community so we can all become stronger together.
our synagogue is located in paramus, new jersey in northern new jersey, about 8 miles from new york city. we are both a synagogue and a jewish community center. we offer conservative jewish worship in both egalitarian and traditional services; a community hebrew school together with congregation b’nai sholom/fair lawn jewish center; adult education; adult, family, and youth activities, and a full calendar of other activities all year-long.
the jccp/cbt is proud to announce that we take our members’ safety and our building security seriously. there have been numerous upgrades to our building as a result of homeland security grant funding.  we are grateful to our local and county law enforcement for their continued presence and support. armed guards are present during religious services and other activities.
