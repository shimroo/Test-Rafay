book 3 in my upon this rock series just released





 upon this rock: book 3 — consider pipnonia now availabledespite the alien’s best efforts, the so-called little nudge has failed, and the rogue planet pipnonia is once again on a collision course with earth. it’s time for the “big bump,” the alien’s last-ditch effort to save earth and its inhabitants from total annihilation. but first it pressures ranger jace kuliak to accompany deut prophecy, the thirteenth apostle, on her mission to pipnonia to preach to its doomed population.

meanwhile, civil society is disintegrating around the world. vera tetlin, the popular governor of alaska, and her family are on the run from agents of the antichrist. and doomsday preppers from the lower 48 are seeking refuge in the little ghost town of mchardy. among them is a petty tyrant and racist who wants the town for himself.

things are heating up — literally.ebooks available at all online bookstores. order a print copy at any brick-and-mortar bookstore or from amazon.

i am happy to announce the release of my latest novel








glassing the orgachine is the second book in my sci-fi series upon this rock. the series is an epic new saga about faith, family, and alien invasion in the bush of alaska. the second book attempts to answer the question: what do reverse cyborgs want? follow the continuing mis-adventures of the prophecy family on stubborn mountain, the park service ranger who loves/hates them, and the celestial visitor (whatever it turns out to be). read all about it on my website. available on amazon and at all major booksellers.




but if you haven't read book 1 yet, no worries. upon this rock: compilation joins both books in one stunning ebook. get it at amazon, apple books, nook, or kobo.

as for myself, i'm in my writer's cabin slinging words at book 3.

upon this rock now available!





today i launch my latest novel, upon this rock: book 1--first contact. it's available everywhere in ebook format. it's available in paperback at amazon now, and in about a week you'll be able to order the paperback at any bookstore.




here's what it's about:


an epic new science fiction series about faith, family, and alien invasion in the wilds of alaska.



when a shooting star plunges through the atmosphere and touches down in the alaska wilderness, only two earthlings are present to witness the event. but they perceive two utterly different realities. what park ranger jace kuliak sees is a ufo and the arrival of a dangerous alien species from beyond the solar system. what poppy prophecy sees is the star called wormwood, as recorded in scripture, and the arrival of an archangel of the apocalypse.



the thing is — they’re both sorta right.



poppy prophecy is the despotic patriarch of a large end-times prepper family that is busily converting a depleted copper mine into its own private doomsday bunker. their copper mine is a century-old relic from territorial days when east coast robber barons ruled alaska and plundered its mineral wealth. today the abandoned mine sits in the middle of the largest, wildest, most majestic national park in the united states. but poppy isn’t impressed by mere earthly beauty, and he doesn’t mind bulldozing federal land when it suits his purposes.



backcountry ranger jace kuliak does mind, and he and fellow rangers confront the fundamentalist family in an armed standoff over the construction of an illegal airstrip. it doesn’t help matters when ranger kuliak falls hopelessly in love with poppy’s second daughter, the lovely, innocent, and totally clueless deuteronomy.



an uneasy truce between the prophecys and the park service is shattered when the falling star lands in their backyard and is claimed by both sides. what is it? who is it? better yet, of all the pit stops on all the planets in all the galaxies, why did the visitor choose this particular rock to screw with?



hope you enjoy it. if you want advance word on book 2 in the series, please sign up for my novel update list.

sign up for novel updates






it’s obvious to anyone looking at my posts on this blog--i stink at 
social media. months or years go by without an update. i guess i’m just 
not that into being social. but i still want to keep my readers informed
 about my current novel in progress and other writing projects. so, i’m 
reviving a mailing list from the days of my first novel. if you’re a 
reader of mine, i encourage you to sign up. i’ll be sending out only a few novel updates a year. no spam, no fuss. maybe a few free giveaways. also, this is the way you can reach me if you want to start a conversation about my work.

alaska sampler 2014 is free for the taking!









this is a new ebook project i’ve started with fellow-alaskan writer, deb vanasse. we put together writings from ten of alaska’s finest authors to show off the place we love, without all the reality-tv-hype nonsense. pieces range from biography, fiction, and memoir to adventure and humor. best of all, it’s free. go here to download.

now, back to my non-social mode.

room for one more





the science fiction apprenticeship i'm teaching in february through 49 writers has room for one more writer. if you'd like me to work one-on-one with you on a short story of yours, this is your chance. no need to be an alaskan resident.

ebook production workshop





my six-hour uaf wintermester workshop in ebook production, which begins next week, still needs a couple of more students to sign up or it will probably be canceled. if you've been thinking about self-publishing your book on amazon's kindle or b&n's nook but aren't sure how to go about it, this is the course for you. on
the evenings of january 7, 9, and 11 we will cover the basics of ebook
production: file conversion, cover design, proofing, and uploading to
amazon and barnes & noble. even if you think you’d prefer to hire a
conversion service to do the conversion work for you, this course will
be helpful. your book can be fiction or non-fiction. come with a
manuscript and leave with a published ebook. here's the course syllabus.
