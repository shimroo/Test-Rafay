my health, our family








families that include people with mixed viral status (also known as ‘serodiscordance’) play a critical role in supporting those who have been diagnosed with hiv, hepatitis b and/or hepatitis c. however, little is known about the role and experiences of families in the prevention, management and treatment of these viruses. this research documents – for the first time – firsthand accounts of what serodiscordance means in the context of everyday family life.

what we do well: stories of love, sex & relationships








this project focuses on the positive actions aboriginal young people take to reduce their sexual risk and build sexual wellbeing, and describes the social, cultural and personal strengths and resources that they draw on to do so. the project seeks to change the narrative about aboriginal young people’s sexual health, from one focused on deficit and problems, to one focused on strengths and resourcefulness.
