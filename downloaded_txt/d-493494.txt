recipients received $7,500 for enrollment costs at a dedicated power line program
keeping the lights on is difficult and requires a detailed understanding of how electrical systems work. without proper training and instruction, however, it can also be incredibly dangerous. power line programs prepare individuals with the skills and safety awareness necessary for their future careers as lineworkers. as beneficial electrification accelerates across the country, it is also a field that is in high demand. lineworkers often have access to excellent opportunities including job security, high pay, and exceptional benefits.
united power awarded four lineworker scholarships to colorado residents pursuing a career in the profession as part of its community benefit plan through the empowering rural america (new era) program. 
parker horton, divide, co
trinidad state rocky mountain lineman school
horton became interested in a professional career as a lineworker after a conversation with a close family friend, mentor, and retired lineworker. horton found the career pathway compelling because of its vital role in providing access to electricity, and is eager to contribute to an essential service. 
zackery johnson, thornton, co
trinidad state rocky mountain lineman school
johnson is pursuing a career as a lineworker because he wants to provide power for the community and provide help after natural disasters. johnson said enrolling in a power line program interested him because he would like to learn more about the electrical system that powers the country. 
katie killinen, bayfield, co
colorado mesa university tech, electrical lineworker program
killinen was an intern for la plata electric association over the summer in 2024. she is pursuing line work as a career because it is challenging and rewarding and also enables her to work outside and problem solve with other people. she finds the concepts and theories in electrical work interesting. 
griffin steele, fort collins, co
trinidad state rocky mountain lineman school
steele has been working with fort collins water for a year, but has been looking for an opportunity to pursue line work. his favorite part of working in utilities is the sense of purpose it provides. line work would add a challenge to that sense of purpose and provide a stable long-term career.
