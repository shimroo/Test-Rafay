 this is my older brother, billy and my dad.  he was in a bad car accident 4 years ago and sustained massive head injuries.  he has had some major accomplishments, and has made those because of my parents and how much they take care of him. for some reason, in this picture, he was most comfortable sitting in the recliner backwards. it was so hard to get him up.this is harley, our weiner dog. he loves ice and even more so when it has some snow cone syrup on it!! he had the cup suctioned to his face!!! these are sean's sisters and i in october. i have an older brother and i always wanted a sister. i never expected to get 4 of them!

	 long time...no blog!
    


well, here it we is the first of july and it seems like yesterday that we moved to abilene. it has been good to be here, but definitely a lot different than when i lived here in college.  mike cope has been doing a series on parenting. it has been really good.  it has definitely made sean and i think about when we have kids.  speaking of that, it has been fun seeing that how different sean and i when it come to disciplining the dog!!  he is definitely the more lax parent. we don't have any big plans for the july 4th.  we will probably watch fireworks somewhere.  we grilled some burgers tonight and will probably some more tomorrow. that's it for now!

awww.....lazy, rainy saturdays. life is made for such as these! i slept til 10:00 this morning, made brunch, or edible breakfast, watched never been kissed and then slept some more on the couch.  i guess that i have been needing a lot of sleep b/c i slept till about 7:30 when i got home from work. we are going to the brazil mission trip desert auction tonight.  it should be a lot of fun.  rod and elisabeth pringle are singing, yummy deserts and live and silent auctions.  how much more fun can you get on a saturday night.  i'll let you know if we get anything at the auction.

	 packages!!
    


well, not for me, but packages nonetheless!!  i love sending people stuff in the mail, maybe it's my own selfish way of thinking that maybe they will send me something back.   and anything you get that is not a bill is always good news!my sister in law, bethany, is finishing her first semester away at school. she has been going to a community college for about 3 semesters.  so, i got a huge paper box and filled it with goodies for her and her roommate.  it was fun shopping for stuff like bubbles and silly string and junk food that keeps you from studying, which is the whole point of finals week anywy, right?  once i got it all filled, i was expecting it to cost a whole lot to send it. plus, one of my good friends from college is in pennsylvania now and apparantly they make hot sauce differently than they do in texas.  and he needs some texas hot sauce!  i got him 2 jars of hot sauce and wrapped it in bubble wrap and packaged it in peanuts made of corn starch, which harley wanted to eat. i was also expecting it to cost a whole lot.i took them both to the ups store at lunch today. bethany's package weighed 17 pounds and aaron's weighed 10.  it cost $25 to send both of them!  i was surprised that it didn't cost more, really.  and thought her's would weigh more than that.  they both should get there by friday. now comes the waiting for shipping........

	 i love my weiner!
    


 sean's sister, stephanie, has let us borrow her digital camera. and so we have spent the last couple of days taking pictures of our dog!!  yes, he is the love of our lives...most of the time anyway!  his name is harley and he's a long haired daschund.  we got him about a year ago from a family in lubbock that just didn't want him anymore.  he was 2 1/2 then, so we are guessing he's about 4 years old.  he loves to travel and take trips in the car.  he also loves to take walks and chase a racquetball. i also thinks sometimes that he thinks that he is a cat because he also likes to sit on the back of the couch.   when he is not doing any of this, he is laying on a green fleece pillow.
