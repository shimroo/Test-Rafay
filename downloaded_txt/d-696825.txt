the divine plan ...
and you are in it!

to us the scriptures clearly teach...
... that the hope for the world lies in the blessings of
knowledge and opportunity to be brought to all by christ's millennial kingdom - the
restitution of all that was lost in adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of
their redeemer and his glorified church - when all the willfully wicked will be destroyed.
- acts 3:19-23; isa. 35.
... that the basis of hope for the church and the world lies in
the fact that "jesus christ by the grace of god, tasted death for every man,"
"a ransom for all," and will be "the true light which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world," "in due time." - heb. 2:9; john 1:9; 1 tim.
2:5, 6.
... that the hope of the church is that she may be like her lord,
"see him as he is," be "partakers of the divine nature," and share his
glory as his joint-heir. - 1 john 3:2; john 17:24; rom. 8:17; 2 pet. 1:4.
... that the church is the "temple of the living god" - peculiarly
"his workmanship"; that its construction has been in progress throughout the
gospel age - ever since christ became the world's redeemer and the chief corner stone of
this temple, through which, when finished, god's blessing shall come to "all
people" and they find access to him. - 1 cor. 3:16,17, eph. 2:20-22; gen. 28:14; gal.
3:29
... that meantime the chiseling, the shaping, and polishing of
consecrated believers in christ's atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of
these "living stones," "elect and precious," shall have been made
ready, the great master workman will bring all together in the first resurrection; and the
temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between god and men
throughout the millennium. - rev. 15:5-8.
... that the present mission of the church is the perfecting of
the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace; to be god's
witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age. - eph. 4:12;
matt. 24:14; rev. 1:6; 20:6.
