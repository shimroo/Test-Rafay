(matt. 5:16). i pray that this graduating class will go boldly to dark places where the light is most needed. light shines brightest in the darkest places.administrationadministrationadministrationnews and updatesnews and updatesnews and updatesnews and updateslatest updates from aptslatest updates from aptslatest updates from aptslatest updates
