    2024 bishop kelley advanced placement excellence


 july 25, 2024

seventy-four bishop kelley students were recently named ap scholars through their demonstrated excellence in the advanced placement (ap) program.                                                                                                 thirty-six of these students were named as ap scholars with distinction.  the accolade is granted to students who receive an average score of at least 3.5 on all ap exams taken, and scores of 3 or higher on five or more of the exams.  this is the highest recognition the college board offers through the ap program.                                                                                                            in addition, thirty-two bishop kelley students were named ap scholars with honors.  these awards are granted to students who receive an average score of at least 3.25 on all ap exams taken, and scores of 3 or higher on four or more of these exams.                                                                                     another thirty-eight  students have been designated ap scholars, granted to students who receive an average score of at least 3.5 on all ap exams taken, and scores of 3 or higher on five or more of these exams.                                                                                                  two hundred and seventy-five bishop kelley students took a record 605 ap exams in may, 2024 with an extraordinary 82% scoring “3” or higher.                                                                                                 twenty percent of bishop kelley test takers scored the highest possible “5” on their exams, the equivalent of “extremely well qualified” according to the college board which administers the international testing.  a “5” equates to an a+ or a in college level classes.  internationally, only 9% of all tests earn a “5” score.                                                                                     another thirty-three percent of bishop kelley students scored at the second highest tier, a “4,” equal to ”very well qualified,” a level only achieved by twenty percent of all testers.                                                                                                  the record number of exams for bishop kelley students cover a wide range of disciplines including science, math, english, social studies, fine arts, world languages and business.  the largest number of tests for bishop kelley students included one hundred and one ap english language and composition students, followed by ninety students who took the ap united states government test, fifty-five who took the ap united states history exam and fifty-one who took the ap english literature exam.                                                                                                 ap exams are scored on a scale of 1-5 with a “passing” score considered to be a “3” or higher.  bishop kelley offers students ap exams in nineteen different subject areas.  ap tests, developed by college and university professors, are considered among the most rigorous college-preparatory exams for high school students today.                                                                  bishop kelley ap scholars with distinction                                                                   vaibhav aggarwal
