"south wall banquet hall was the perfect venue for my now wife and i. mike wore many hats during our special day and did an amazing job; he helped set up the hall the night before, dropped off our marriage certificate, catered the wedding (by: taste of italy), officiated our ceremony and took care of the alcohol. the venue itself has a $2,000 rental fee but it was well worth it. we had about 100 people but it could fit many more comfortably. i couldn’t recommend south wall enough."- liam c.

"this venue was beautiful, the staff super accommodating, and the building manager made everything so easy. we planned our wedding in 3 months with their help. they truly made us feel cherished, even taking time to check in with me as to make sure i got food and drinks the whole night which everyone says never happens at your wedding. perfect location for a ceremony, cocktail hour and reception. handicap accessibility was a good feature too as everything was on the same level."- jocelyn t.
