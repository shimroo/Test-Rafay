trinity baptist church in madison, al

you are welcome here

i'm new































welcome!
isn’t it amazing what you can learn from a website? it’s a great tool!

with that open door to the website, let me suggest the very best way to get a feel for our church. come sit among its people. spend a sunday and risk worshiping with us, join a small group, invest some of your time with us. you will learn much more about our church. here is what i think you will learn: this is an authentic community of god’s people that will welcome you. let me know if i can help you explore trinity; the door is open.
dr. mike oliver, senior pastor
