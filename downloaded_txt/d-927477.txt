                        nasa-std-3000, the man-system integration standards has been superseded and is no longer being maintained.  the nasa-std-3000 standard remains available here as ongoing contracts such as the iss boeing contract and nasa ssp 50005 were based on the nasa-std-3000 standard. if you have suggested updates, please address how these can be updated in the replacement documents.
                        


                        for current requirements and design guidance, please go to the replacement documents:
â¢         nasa-std-3001 space flight human-system standard volumes 1 (crew health)
â¢         nasa-std-3001 space flight human-system standard volumes 2 (human factors, habitability and environmental health) and 
â¢         nasa/sp-2010-3407 the human integration design handbook (hidh)

man-systems
integration standards
revision b, july 1995
introduction
the nasa-std-3000 was created to provide a single, comprehensive document defining all generic requirements for space facilities and related equipment which directly interface with crewmembers. 

this document provides specific user information to ensure proper integration of
human-system interface requirements with those of other aerospace disciplines.
video images from relevant space missions are also provided to illustrate human
factors design concerns.

see volume i - man-systems integration standards
to view the design standards.
see volume ii - appendices to
view background information relating to the standards.
see videos from skylab.
