burnt ridge nursery and orchards is a family-owned farm, in business since 1980. our 20-acre farm is located in the foothills of the cascade mountains with a beautiful view of mount st. helens. our mail order nursery specializes in unusual and disease resistant trees, vines, and shrubs that produce edible nuts or fruits. we also have a large selection of northwest native plants and ornamental and useful landscape trees. we send nice sized, healthy, well-rooted plant material. the varieties we carry have done well in our orchards. if you have questions, please feel free to call, write or email us. we can help you make appropriate choices for your growing area.

winter/spring shipping (jan-june) check out the fruit and nuts videos produced by burnt ridge nursery, featuring michael dolan. 60+ minutes of varietal information, organic practices and growing tips that will help you decide which plant varieties to grow at your location- a great gift idea. once you order, plants are committed on a first come, first serve basis. we will wait to ship your trees to your location until the approprate time, keeping weather conditions in mind.
summer shipping (july-oct)  we do continue to ship plants throughout the summer but we cannot guarantee against damage from excessive heat in transit. summer shipping is more expensive than domant bareroot shipping because all of the plants are shipped in pots. please refer to the summer shipping tab for summer shipping charges. 
fall shipping (nov-dec) for fall shipping, please refer to the fall shipping tab.
