about commetrex
for the past fifteen years, commetrex® has made “developed for oem” a way of life. with a continued focus on fax, commetrex has become the trusted source of fax technologies for the transition from traditional fax to ip fax, featuring products such as t.38 fax relay & terminatingt38™(which we invented), t.30 protocol, and v.34 fax modem. and now, many in the industry look to commetrex technology as the standard for t.38 interoperability.
 
t.38 fax relay software
commetrex is the industry-leading developer of t.38 fax relay software, providing the highest-performing t.38 fax relay software for use in ip networks for the ata or gateway oem . t.38 fax relay software from commetrex supports data and controls redundancy, meets the itu-t recommendations, and supports proprietary protocols for secure-fax applications by converting data to an audio stream, which greatly reduces the effects of packet loss.
