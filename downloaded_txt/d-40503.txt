the legend of heroes: trails through daybreak ii review on noobfeed:
​
the legend of heroes: trails through daybreak ii review

trails through daybreak ii is a masterclass in storytelling and strategy that will challenge your every step.
reviewed by sabi on feb 08, 2025

the legend of heroes: trails through daybreak ii is being developed by nihon falcom, one of japan's longest-running video game development firms, with a nearly four-decade history. founded in 1981, falcom is primarily known for its work within the role-playing game genre through the legend of heroes series. the trails subseries, launched in 2004 with trails in the sky, has developed into one of the most extensive, longest-running narratives in gaming.

trails through daybreak ii is a direct sequel to trails through daybreak, the very first mainline game sporting the calvard republic as its core setting. but with its new protagonist, reworked fight system combining the best of both action and turn-based worlds, and a fresh sociocultural backdrop steeped in political intrigue, daybreak marked quite the departure from formula.

[...]

verdict
trails through daybreak ii offers a fun mix of good storytelling, strategic gameplay, and character growth. however, it might be a bit too much for new players because of its complicated story and features.

score: 80/100

avowed review

avowed understands the joy of adventure, offering a rich, immersive experience that, while not without flaws, is well worth the journey.

obsidian entertainment is well known within the realm of rpgs, and avowed, an action role-playing title under the banner of xbox game studios, is their most recent ambitious project. set in the world of eora, the same universe as that of pillars of eternity, avowed leaves behind the tactical isometric combat to engage in first-person action full of sword fights, spell casting, and treasure hunting.

the world of avowed feels lovingly contrived in a way only reminiscent of the last generation, with its rigid designs contrasting modern rpgs with open sandboxes. but what does seem to limit at first seems liberating thereafter as you progress, unlike most modern rpgs that are obsessed with their seriousness.

[...]

verdict
avowed is a decent rpg with strong storytelling and exploration, but its combat and enemy variety fall short. despite some flaws, its immersive world and adventure-driven design make it a worthwhile journey, especially for pillars of eternity fans.

score: 76/100

rpgfan reviewed the legend of heroes: trails through daybreak ii:
​
review: the legend of heroes: trails through daybreak ii

those who forget the lessons of the past are doomed to repeat them. the legend of heroes: trails through daybreak ii takes this notion and runs with it, offering several chances for players to experience "do-overs" of significant plot events that can open up markedly different outcomes. ultimately, does the narrative coalesce into something coherent despite the myriad time loops arkride solutions and its allies face? the answer is a tentative yes, especially from a character growth standpoint. however, those hoping for this sequel to have more of an impact on the overreaching plot set up by the first game might be left wanting.

[...]

the legend of heroes: trails through daybreak ii is an enjoyable rpg experience, especially from a character stance. it isn't the most substantial sequel within the legend of heroes: trails series' lineup, but it's far from a terrible game. i enjoyed playing it and eagerly await the next adventure to hit the zemurian continent. we should heed the lessons of the past, if only so that brand-new possibilities might emerge, and i feel the legend of heroes: trails through daybreak ii encapsulates that message well.

score: 87/100
