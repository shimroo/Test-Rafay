remembering our co-founder, sherri schultz



oct 5, 2023




the northwest editors guild community has been deeply saddened by the loss of one of the guild’s two co-founders, sherri schultz. sherri and phyllis hatfield started what was then called the northwest independent editors guild in 1997 with just eleven members, and in 1999, as the guild became a little more formal, sherri built its first website. in addition to her extensive work in helping the guild to grow into a registered nonprofit and setting us up to become today an organization with more than 400 members across the united states, sherri was a passionate educator, organizer, and builder of community. to learn more about sherri and everything she did for the guild and its members, check out our new memorial page.
