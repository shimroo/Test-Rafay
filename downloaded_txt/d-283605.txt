stories from our patients
the safegait 360° at kaweah rehabilitation hospital is the top-of-the-line model and was a gift from kaweah health foundation. with just more than 100 feet of track and multiple curves, it is the longest track in the country, and it is the only safegait 360° in california. therapy supervisor tara norman is very excited about the its impact for patients and staff, “it's really increased the ways we have to work with patients in a very safe manner. patients really like it, too. it helps build their confidence because they don’t have to worry about falling.”
