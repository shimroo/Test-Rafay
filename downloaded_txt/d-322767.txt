	bob and i have been to many places similar to 'almost paradise' but this is by far the most private, wonderful, out-of-the-way place of all. thanks for thinking of all the details that make a stay so comfortable. the hot tub was well used after long hikes! thanks, too, for sharing — it was fantastic! we highly recommend getting out to see the stars at night and watching a sunset from up on the hill. can't wait to come back to this part of the country.
