cleveland, 2004. basketball wunderkind lebron james has just been signed to the cavaliers, and two die-hard fans strike up an unlikely friendship–with high hopes for their new superstar player. as lebron’s career takes him to the height of fame, pulls him away from cleveland, and brings him triumphantly back to the city, matt and shawn’s lives play out off-court with all the drama of a championship season: full of slam dunks, huge upsets, and the unshakable bond of those who share a love of the game.
