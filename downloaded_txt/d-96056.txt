democrat ends prayer with 'amen. ... and a-woman

on sunday, a
democratic representative â who also happens to have been a pastor for
37 years â gave an official prayer to open the 117th congress. with
great pomp and circumstance, he closed his prayer by invoking âthe
monotheistic god,â brahma, and the god who supposedly goes by many
names. he then concluded with the most asinine thing i have ever heard.
he ended with âamen â¦ and a-woman.âyes, in a moment worthy of the
babylon bee, rep. emanuel cleaver (d-mo.), added the nonsense neologism
âa-womanâ to the classic prayer ending, âamen.â
âwe ask it in the name of the monotheistic
god, brahma, and god known by many names by many different faiths,â
cleaver concluded. âamen. â¦ and a-woman.â
âamenâ means âso be it,â âit is so,â or
âverily.â jews and christians have used the term to conclude prayers
for thousands of years.  continue

forgotten
word ministries
...
 
is a
non-denominational christ based ministry which is dedicated to
spreading the gospel of jesus christ to the entire world and to
exposing the error in the teachings of many of the false teachers who
have invaded our churches.  founded by reverend robert wise under
the calling from god and after many years of studying the
different denominations and preachers who have gotten away from the
true word of god and have allowed man's selfish wants and wishes to
dominate their organizations and local churches.  it is our belief
that the bible is not being preached in many of today's pulpits. 
preachers have turned from the true word of god and have made a
concerted effort to turn our churches and pulpits into a self centered
based belief system. churches have become mini country clubs without
golf courses. pleasing the pew sitters is what is being preached
instead of pleasing the lord. our goal is to be an avenue to share the
gospel with anyone who wishes to hear it like it was intended to be
told.  from the bible.  forgotten word ministries website has
materials that are
designed to help you to understand the word of god, identify false
teachings which are designed to help you along your christian walk.
 
message from the
founder   about the founder
forgotten word ministries was
brought  to life by directive of the holy spirit to promote the
true word of god through his holy scriptures.  we do
not hate any of the people we have listed on our
site, in fact we love them all but we disagree with
their teachings.  our intention is to show you how some preachers
are using the word  of god for personal gain
or are
just plain misled themselves, thereby misleading
others who follow them and their teachings.  we do everything we
can to discuss these matters with those involved but the majority
refuse to discuss anything with us or with very few others.  we do
pray that these persons who are either purposely misleading for
personal gain or are misled themselves will see the lord's word for
what it is, not what they wish it to be.

god bless you, 
pastor wise
 
 
concerns:
this
website will divide it's attention between proper bible teachings and
pointing out the false prophets and the false preachers that have risen
in great numbers in the church these last 35 or so years.
 
false
preachers are leading thousands if not millions of people in the 
wrong direction and causing them to follow a jesus that is not the
jesus of the bible.  false preachers are getting rich off of the
flock and that is certainly something that needs to be attended to.
 
there
is a section of who these false preachers are and sad to say, the
list  continues to grow.  as heartbreaking as it is to me and
you, imagine how heartbreaking it is for the lord.
