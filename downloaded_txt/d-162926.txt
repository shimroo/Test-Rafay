what is fragile x syndrome?
fragile x syndrome (fxs) is a genetic condition that causes intellectual disability, behavioral and learning challenges, and various physical characteristics. though fxs occurs in both genders, males are more frequently affected than females, and generally with greater severity. life expectancy is not affected in people with fxs because there are usually no life-threatening health concerns associated with the condition.
we provide unwavering support for every family affected by fragile x, while relentlessly pursuing a cure.
