our clients, partners, & employeeswe sincerely value our clients, partners and employees. it’s easy for us to say it, but we’d rather you hear and see it directly from them. below are some of those testimonials. the people we work with are our most valuable assests.berlin has worked on many of the buildings that o’donnell & naccarato has designed; with project sizes ranging from small to very large. the success of our designs cannot be achieved without the professionalism, timely performance and team approach of the structural steel fabricator and erector. a commitment to these qualities is something that berlin has consistently brought to the projects on which we have worked with them.dennis v. mordan, pevice president - o’donnell & naccarato, inc.i wanted to thank everyone for the huge effort and execution of erecting the three bridges at midtown center. i believe i can speak for my whole clark team how impressed we were with the berlin team…. a lot had to happen in a short amount of time, many factors could have impacted this plan but it didn't because of your effort.john swagartvice president - clark construction group, llc
