as a couple who have previously had 5 new boats built for us including a hinckley and back cove, bellingham yachts exceeded our expectations.

greg vg. - back cove 41





i have purchased and sold a number of boats from various brokers over 25 years, but none have provided the level of personalized attention, follow-through and quality of service as we had at bellingham yachts.
