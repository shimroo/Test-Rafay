inspirational stories: "our why"

daphne's story
daphne's story is one of a devoted athlete whose life was changed forever when she was diagnosed with lymphoma in june of 2018. just five years prior, daphne, the race director of the asheville marathon at biltmore estate, chose the leukemia & lymphoma society (lls) as the charity partner for the marathon in 2013. she had no personal ties or connections with lymphoma or leukemia, saying "i just thought they were a solid organization to give back to and to help support through our event."
after being diagnosed last year, daphne turned to lls for information, support and a community to help her through the trying battle ahead of her, saying "when i received the lymphoma diagnosis i knew that it would be very important for me to learn all that i can about my cancer and then support the organization that is dedicating its research dollars to finding a cure."
