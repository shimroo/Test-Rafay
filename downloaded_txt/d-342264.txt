our connectivity solutions are driving operational efficiencies on over 13,000 vessels, providing ship owners and operators with benefits such as reduced running costs, improved profit margins, better attraction and retention of talented crew and the capacity to future-proof operations.
within shipping, digital technologies are now an established and necessary part of business, and their presence will only grow in the future, providing competitive advantages for early adopters.
reflecting this industry progress in digitalisation, data consumption is growing exponentially, with figures for shipboard business applications and crew usage more than doubling over recent years.
remote offices at sea
shipping companies are increasingly implementing high-performance data exchange mechanisms that enable their fleets to operate as remote office locations, integrated into their business networks.
as these it networks become more complex, with built-in tools and services to facilitate not only trade but also operations, robust connectivity becomes more critical to enabling growth. profitability increasingly relies on connected solutions that enable voyage and port-call optimisation as well as condition monitoring and condition-based maintenance, which drive efficiencies and reduce costs.
the same cloud computing that has revolutionised collaboration and enabled the refinement of processes on land is taking place on board vessels as operators overcome the historic concern that maritime connectivity is bandwidth constrained.
it is now essential for shipping companies to adopt scalable digital solutions and resilient connectivity strategies that will propel them into the future of maritime. now more connected than ever.

the digital wave - transforming vessels into floating offices and remote homes








as the global shift to digitalisation accelerates, ships increasingly function as floating offices. many ship owners and operators have already embraced satellite communications as a vital link between ship and shore, propelling a surge of smart technologies that can enhance the safety, cost-efficiency and environmental performance of today’s vessels.  













‘always-on’ and collaborative software is becoming increasingly critical for operations and seafarer welfare as the reliance on digital technologies increases. a clear trend observed during the research is that the use of digital tools and applications is changing as ships get closer to shore.

the digital wave

           learn more about the business value of digitalisation for the maritime industry and new business models that rely on digitalisation, connectivity, and collaboration. 
        



















“for me, the floating office concept means that we have upwards of 100 mbps bandwidth, good latency, and a proper sla behind it. if we have that, we can move away from these isolated vessels that we have today and integrate them seamlessly with our onshore and cloud infrastructure.” 
dr. dominik pfeiffer, director of fleet it, hapag-lloyd. 












 
an effective connectivity strategy includes:







voyage optimisation platforms that calculate and propose routes with different objectives, gathering data directly from vessels and combining it with external data sets to provide recommendations.
port-call optimisation based on the timely sharing of information between trade and supply-chain partners to streamline vessel logistics and cargo operations, ensure accurate cargo completion times and reduce waiting time.
transparent collaboration platforms that allow data sharing to optimise cargo operations by connecting key stakeholders in the supply chain. trade-process automation makes it possible to exchange documents, transfer e-bills and receive external verification and acceptance digitally.






condition-based monitoring and maintenance using sensor technology and data analytics to predict failures before they happen, allowing shipping companies to take safer and more cost-effective approaches to planned maintenance.
remote equipment intervention allowing crew to receive remote support when troubleshooting and performing repairs at sea. video streaming enables two-way communication with shore-side technicians and can prevent diversions and delays.
remote surveys conducted by surveyors on shore and aided by crew members on board using tablets and other portable devices. most leading classification societies now facilitate remote surveys in full or in part, and in response, to the international association of classification societies (iacs) released  guidance.
