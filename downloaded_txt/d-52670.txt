holograms boost 3d printing efficiency and resolution
innovation - feb 17

scientists at epfl and the university of southern denmark have used holographic projections to bring unprecedented resolution to a light-based 3d printing technique. the method allows the fabrication of millimeter-scale objects within seconds using significantly less energy than previous approaches.

curbing the global spread of sexually transmitted diseases


cases of bacterial sexually transmitted infections are on the rise worldwide. an international team led by the university of zurich has now developed a new method for genome sequencing and discovered a previously unrecognized strain of chlamydia

physics  - feb 14
mechanism driving molecular network formation


scientists have identified a new property, interface flexibility, that controls how certain molecules naturally self-organize into crystalline supramolecular networks. this significant discovery could change the design of synthetic molecules for network growth at the nanoscale.
health  - feb 13
