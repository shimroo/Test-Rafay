bitvise ssh server: secure file transfer, terminal shell, and tunneling
our ssh server provides secure remote access to windows servers and workstations. security is our ssh server's key feature: in contrast with telnet and ftp servers, bitvise ssh server encrypts data during transmission. thus, no one can sniff your password or see what files you are transferring when you access your computer over ssh.
bitvise ssh server is ideal for remote administration of windows servers; for secure file transfer by organizations using sftp and scp; for advanced users who wish to access their home machine from work, or their work machine from home; and for a wide spectrum of advanced tasks, such as securing other applications using ssh tcp/ip tunneling.
you are looking for an ssh server if you want to set up a computer to receive connections from other people and their computers. if you want to initiate connections or file transfers, you are looking for an ssh client.

our free and flexible ssh client for windows includes state of the art terminal emulation, graphical as well as command-line sftp support, an ftp-to-sftp bridge, powerful tunneling features including dynamic port forwarding through integrated proxy, and remote administration for our ssh server.
you are looking for an ssh client if you wish to initiate connections or file transfers to someone else's computer. if you are looking to receive connections, you are looking for an ssh server.
bitvise ssh client can be used free of charge in environments of any type.
