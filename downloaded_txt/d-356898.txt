faqs






what is an online assessment platform?online assessment platforms are enterprise software systems designed to manage large-scale and high-stakes examinations for organizations where this is a core part of what they do.  examples are a civil service selection department that exists to administer pre-employment exams or a certification board that exists to deliver certification exams. the site is designed with advanced functionality necessary for these organizations, including item banking, complex survey construction, and modern psychometrics like adaptive testing.

what is assessment software?an online assessment software is a digital tool used to create, manage, and evaluate surveys and tests. our software is intuitive and packed with a variety of online assessment tools and key features for the specific needs of educators and test takers alike. with such a professional site tool, the learning process becomes easy for users.

what is an assessment test?an assessment test is a structured evaluation designed to measure a person’s abilities, knowledge, competencies, or abilities in a specific area. these quizzes are commonly used in recruitment, education, training, and performance management to assess individuals’ proficiency levels or determine their suitability for a particular role or task. many organizations rely on assessment tools to produce, administer, and analyze assessment surveys efficiently.

what is item banking?item banking is the process of developing, reviewing, and managing large pools of items.  a professionally-managed exam will have a pool of items which are frequently rotated, with needs to track metadata such as statistics. it’s also often required to have a workflow management module to ensure all items are reviewed.

what is item response theory (irt)?item response theory is the modern psychometric paradigm, used for developing, analyzing, and validating most of the large-scale and important surveys in the world. it utilizes a machine learning approach which provides a number of advantages, including more accurate scores, stronger equating, and adaptive testing.

what is psychometric consulting?psychometric consulting is the necessary work to develop high-quality surveys that meet international standards such as aera/apa/ncme or ncca. these require complex studies like job task analysis or machine-learning analytics like item response theory.  if you don’t have a psychometrician in-house, you will need to hire consultants.

what is remote proctoring?remote proctoring is a way to ensure the validity and integrity of your survey without forcing examinees to drive to a physical testing center. there is actually a range of options pertaining to levels of security, from low-security exams that just record video with ai flagging to high-security exams where the computer is locked down and there are two video streams watched by a live person in real time.





what is adaptive/multistage testing?adaptive testing uses irt to personalize the exam for every student, candidate, or examinee. it typically refers to surveys that adapt after every item while multistage testing adapts in blocks of items. this quiz maker makes surveys more accurate, more engaging, and more secure.

how to create an online assessment?to create an online assessment, start by defining your goals and developing questions using item banking. choose a platform with features like adaptive testing and psychometric tools. validate the test with pilot testing, then publish and monitor results in real time.

how to host a virtual assessment?select a secure platform with remote proctoring and exam integrity features. set up the test, enable proctoring, and provide candidate support. finally, analyze performance through the platform’s analytics to ensure success.
