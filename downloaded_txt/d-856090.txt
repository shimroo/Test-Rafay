                                                            today, we stopped our class to take the time to pray for one of our hsm families. to know that i work at a school that i can pray with the students is what i love most about hsm. and, the students value their education here!

                                                            i love being a student at hsm because of the great education and many opportunities it gives me, such as growing my faith life, socializing with friends, representing the chess club, and more.

                                                            choosing holy savior menard as the school for our children was easy. faith and family go hand in hand. hsm offers students both — a strong catholic faith foundation as well as a close-knit atmosphere.
