santorini hotels
the world famous santorini, one of the cycladic islands positioned at the edge of the aegean sea, has a lot to offer to its visitors. its magnificent setting on the brim of the volcano makes it a unique and a favorite spot in greece, if not worldwide.many people are visiting this volcanic island every year, just to capture a few colorful and silent moments that mother nature offers during sunset. for many people, this is the most romantic moments of their life…
the prehistoric city of akrotiri, the caldera trekking paths, the wine routes that first appeared in the year 3000 b.c., santorini's exquisite cuisine… the cherry tomatoes, the white aubergines, the yellow split beans (fava) and a large selection of sun dried products.
the considerable variety of santorini's grapes, cultivated with minimal irrigation under the mediterranean sun and hit by the salty breeze of the sea gives them a distinctive grade in wine production. colorful santorini with its black, red and white beaches, coves and reeves. santorini,the island of unique architecture and design, the island of culture and history.
santorini, not only is the ideal holiday delight offering its visitors relaxation but also a taste of adventure, romance and fun.
santorini is the island of great contrasts…
live the experience, explore it now !!!
