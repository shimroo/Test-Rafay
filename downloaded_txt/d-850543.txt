student spotlight
senna keesing
a&a undergraduate and brooke owens fellow
senna keesing possesses a diverse range of research interests
                    spanning particle physics, submarine navigation, and, of
                    course, aerospace engineering. her research in the uw axion dark matter experiment (admx) focuses on
                    detecting a
                    hypothetical particle that could explain dark matter. her well-rounded education of the cosmos will
                    serve her well for
                    future work on planetary probes and deep space missions.




related story
