the redlands bicycle classic is the longest continuous running invitational, professional stage race in american bike racing. each year, the city of redlands and surrounding communities open their homes, their hearts and their streets to world-class athletes. from humble beginnings on a memorial day weekend in 1985, the event, featuring 350 elite racers, has hosted future stars of the olympics, tour de france, and world championships. the redlands bicycle classic’s long heritage of attracting future stars has earned its position in history: “where legends are born!”
