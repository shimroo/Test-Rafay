vexenthe tyrants' tariffsjanuary 28th, 17:59us president trump has threatened several countries with tariffs and economic sanctions, "alarming global leaders as he uses the prospect of sanctions and tariffs to force other nations to do what he wants. trump's combative approach [puts] him on track for simultaneous confrontations around the globe". under trump, the us has no economic allies. he has "stunned the world by saying he would be willing to pulverize the economies of even allied countries over seemingly routine policy disagreements". john creamer, who was a senior diplomat for more than 35 years and was a deputy assistant secretary of state, says this kind of approach has not been seen since the post-wwii era.he's threatened mexico and canada with 25% tariffs, china with 10% on all imports, tariffs on denmark unless they give greenland to the usa (which the world thought he was joking about, but after denmark said 'no', he threw an enraged hissy fit on the phone, prompting moves for nato nations such as denmark to boost military defence of greenland against its own ally and fellow nato member).his threat to raise "high levels tariffs and sanctions" on russia unless it ends the war in ukraine would be fair enough, except, he also wants ukraine to give up land to russia, which isn't fair at all. trumps threats don't have a sense of what is right and seems to be about pure power.trump also floated the mind-boggling idea of 100% tariffs on the "brics" nations (brazil, russia, india, china and south africa) if they pursue alternatives to the u.s. dollar. this aggression and instability will almost certainly ensure that brics countries will seek to move away from the us wherever possible, boosting the status of china and india as safe economic partners, instead of the usa.trump doesn't understand tariffs; it was only in 2024 that he made confused statements that foreign nations pay for tariffs - in reality, it's us consumers who pay, making goods more expensive in the us (but not elsewhere). he also doesn't understand the psychology of how to maintain us interests in the world. his childish approach and temper-tantrums harm the us, make it an untrustworthy trading partner, and will make foreign nations - and networks of nations - solidify an anti-us response."canada, mexico and china are the nation's three biggest trading partners. those three export more than $2 trillion to the united states alone each year, about two-thirds of everything americans import. economists have warned that the imposition of tariffs will raise prices for consumers here — undermining trump's promise to control inflation."quotes from https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/01/27/trump-economic-power-play/ .tags: china, denmark, greenland, india, russia, tariffs, trump

vexendictatorsjanuary 27th, 16:11(1) dictators can be effective & can do some good things.(2) people who act without compassion can get things done.(3) those who don't bother fact-checking, are often emboldened & doubtless in their actions.but all 3 paths lead to disaster, abuse, corruption and failure.
