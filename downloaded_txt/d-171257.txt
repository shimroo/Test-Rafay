 what our clients say
      


wayne built a bookcase door for one of my closets and it turned out amazing. it looks great and functions perfectly. he built exactly what i asked for and took the time to make sure the fit and finish of the install was done right. i highly recommend his work.  jason l.

   


fiorenza was excellent to work with. made me several cabinets for my home. the quality is exceptional. mr. fiorenza took his time to do the job in the correct fashion and his professionalism was above reproach. i would hire him to do all my cabinet work the price and scope of work was detailed and reasonable. i highly recommend fiorenza custom wood working for anyone looking for good quality craftsmanship.  deborah p.
