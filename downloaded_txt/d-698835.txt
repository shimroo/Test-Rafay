the most renowned criminal defense attorneys in michigan. scott’s vision was to create a firm that specializes in criminal law with a team that shares his passion for protecting the rights of

people would say a sex crime (especially if the alleged victim is a child). we’ve had clients tell us that they’d rather be accused of murder than a sex crime. to be sure, a sex crime accusation—whether it’s sexual assault, criminal sexual conduct, possession of child pornography, or something else—can be humiliating. more importantly, though, an accusation can be extremely serious, with certain crimes being punishable in michigan by up to life in prison. and in the believe-the-victim-at-all-costs world that we now live in, police and prosecutors are often all too eager to charge you solely based on the alleged victim’s accusation, even without any hard evidence against you. to defend against a sex crime allegation, you need to deploy an aggressive approach.sex crimes are a large part of our practice. our michigan criminal attorneys have handled many high-profile cases, and we’ve developed a tried-and-true strategy for defending our clients. depending on the case, this might include:exposing the bias and other shortcomings of the police investigationuncovering inconsistencies and discrepancies in the alleged victim’s accusationsanalyzing the sexual assault nurse examiner’s report to determine if the physical evidence matches the alleged victim’s storyin child sex abuse cases, scrutinizing the forensic interview of the alleged victim for interview errors that can provoke false claimsin child pornography cases, ascertaining whether someone else downloaded the filesadvising the client on whether to submit to a polygraph examination to prove their innocenceby taking these and other measures, we’ve been able to secure no-charge decisions, dismissals, not guilty verdicts, and very favorable plea bargains for many of our clients.defending against sex crime accusations is not for the faint of heart. you need an aggressive, experienced team of criminal defense attorneys in michigan on your side. call us.michigan drunk driving defensein michigan, drunk driving crimes are referred to as operating while intoxicated, or owi. more colloquially, these crimes are often referred to as dui (driving under the influence). for average, law-abiding citizens, if they’re going to be arrested and charged with a crime, it’s likely to be owi.most people know the legal limit—0.08. that’s roughly equated to a blood alcohol content (bac) of 0.08 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. but 0.08 is only part of the picture. michigan owi crimes are generally divided into three categories:operating while visibly impaired. to prove this crime, the prosecution must show that because of the consumption of alcohol, you “drove with less ability than would an ordinary careful driver.” your ability to drive “must have been lessened to the point that it would have been noticed by another person.” significantly, you can be charged and convicted of operating while visibly impaired even if you’re under 0.08.operating while intoxicated. to prove this charge, ordinarily, the prosecutor will purport to show, either with a breath or blood test, that you were “over the limit” of 0.08.operating with a high bac. if your bac was at 0.17 or higher, the charge is aggravated, with more severe penalties if you’re convicted.being arrested for a drunk driving offense can be extremely disruptive. you can temporarily lose your license and even serve jail time. and, importantly, drunk driving crimes are not expungable, so they never come off your record.notice, too, that all the above also applies to driving under the influence of certain controlled substances, even if prescribed. it often comes as a shock to clients that they can be charged with owi even if they have not consumed any alcohol.with stakes this high, you’ll want an aggressive team of michigan criminal defense lawyers ready to defend against an owi charge. if you retain us, we’ll explore every avenue of getting the case reduced or dismissed. did the police have grounds to pull you over? did the police conduct their investigation correctly? was the breathalyzer working properly? was the blood test properly performed? these are just some of the questions we’re likely to ask in your case.domestic violence defense in michigandomestic violence is another one of the most common charges that we see in our practice. all it takes is a call to police and an allegation that your spouse or significant other hits you, and you’re likely to end up in court. to be sure, plenty of these calls are legitimate, and you simply did something out of character in a moment of frustration. other times, though, a call to police and an accusation of domestic violence can be used as a vindictive ploy.whichever the case, our criminal defense attorneys in michigan can help. if the allegation is true, and you made an uncharacteristic mistake, we can often help you receive a deferral, which ensures that a domestic violence conviction never goes on your record. if the allegation is false, we can help you prove it by introducing evidence of the accuser’s motive to fabricate the allegation or a thorough analysis of the physical evidence.michigan drug crimesalthough—like the legalization of recreational marijuana in michigan shows—attitudes on drug use and criminalization are changing, many prosecutors still take a tough stance on drug crimes. whether you’re charged with possession, delivery, or manufacture, prosecutors are often eager to throw the book at you to keep drugs out of “their county.” the variety of drugs involved can also play a significant role, with crimes involving, for example, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine being treated more harshly than other drugs.regardless of the specific drug crime you face, our michigan criminal lawyers can help. to fight a drug charge, your attorney needs to leave no stone unturned. did the police have sufficient cause to stop you? did the police have sufficient cause to search where the drugs were found? did you know that what you possessed was a controlled substance? these are just some of the questions we’ll be asking in your case. in the right case, a dismissal or deferral—leaving you without a criminal record—is often attainable.driver’s license restoration throughout the state of michiganif you’ve been convicted of multiple drunk or drugged driving offenses, you’ve likely lost your driver’s license, and you’ll have to petition the secretary of state to get it back. many people in this position try to go it alone without a lawyer, often with disastrous results.simply put, the secretary of state does not make it easy to regain your license. instead, the secretary of state has erected an obstacle course of rules and regulations that make the process difficult and uninviting. to make it through, you need a lawyer at the helm.with grabel & associates, the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor. we have a 97% success rate for driver’s restoration cases and a written guarantee.michigan criminal law appealslet’s say things didn’t go your way in the district or circuit court. maybe you lost at trial or else you took a plea bargain that you now regret. can you appeal? the answer, in most cases, is “yes.”if you’ve decided to appeal, first things first—act quickly. in most cases, there are tight deadlines for filing your appeal. retain a criminal defense attorney in michigan as soon as possible.in most cases, the odds of winning an appeal will not be in your favor. to have any chance, you need to hire a team with a track record of success.at grabel & associates, we’ve enjoyed unparalleled success in criminal appeals. just in the past few years alone, we’ve won several significant appellate victories in michigan’s circuit courts, the michigan court of appeals, and the michigan supreme court.we’ve done that by doing things that other firms don’t do. most appellate attorneys restrict their review to “the record”—the transcripts of court hearings along with any documents that were filed with the court. but the key to a successful appeal, perhaps more often than not, lies outside the record—a witness who wasn’t called, a document that wasn’t introduced, etc. we look outside the record to get the full story, a story that we can then share with the appellate court.we’re willing to bet that no other firm in michigan has had as much success in criminal appeals than us. call around. ask. then call us.probation and parole for michigan clientsif you’re on probation or parole, that doesn’t mean your case is over. all too often, it seems that a probation officer or a parole agent is just waiting for you to stub your toe so you can go back to jail or prison. to keep your hard-earned freedom, you need the representation of a seasoned law firm. at grabel & associates, our michigan attorneys helped scores of clients successfully defend against probation and parole violations.we can also help clients attain parole in the first instance. do you have a loved one who keeps getting “flopped” on parole? we offer a robust consulting service geared toward avoiding another flop and getting your loved one home on parole.finally, let’s say that you’ve been granted parole, but the prosecutor objects and tries to appeal that decision. we can help you oppose the prosecutor’s appeal and keep your parole. our law firm has successfully opposed prosecutor parole appeals and secured our client’s freedom.criminal record expungement in michiganif you have a criminal record, you probably already know that it can make it difficult to find work, housing, and even travel out of the country. and then there’s the stigma of being branded a “criminal,” even decades after you committed your crime.fortunately, with the october 2020 passage of the clean slate act, michigan law has made it easier than ever to have a conviction expunged or removed from your record (it’s also sometimes called “setting aside” the conviction). and most judges are usually more than happy to grant expungement if the client has been rehabilitated. if you’re eligible, there is no reason not to file for an expungement.contact our criminal lawyers in michigan to determine if you’re case is eligible for expungement under the new law.criminal law postconviction motions and writslet’s say that you were convicted at trial or by taking a plea and then you appealed and lost. you’re wondering, is this the end of my case? not necessarily.in michigan, after an unsuccessful appeal, you can file a motion for relief from judgment, commonly referred to in michigan as a “6.500 motion,” so named because the rules governing these motions are found at subchapter 6.500 of the michigan court rules. this is your opportunity to raise any valid issues that weren’t raised on appeal. you can also try to present new evidence to the court in a 6.500 motion. the motion is filed in the circuit court you were convicted in. if you’re unsuccessful there, you can appeal to the michigan court of appeals and then the michigan supreme court.warning: 6.500 motions are extraordinarily difficult to win. if you want to have any chance of winning, you need a team with a track record of success at getting convictions overturned.another route for continuing to fight your case is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which is filed in federal court. importantly, not every case is eligible for habeas relief. you need to have an issue of federal law in your case, usually a federal constitutional issue. if your case is eligible for habeas, you’re essentially taking your case to federal court and arguing that the state courts have deprived you of your rights under federal law.another warning: just like 6.500 motions, habeas petitions are notoriously difficult to win.clemencysay you’re not eligible for expungement, or say you have a loved one in prison who has exhausted all their appeals and postconviction motions and writs. is there any other way to try to get your case overturned?if you’re not eligible for expungement, or if you’re serving a lengthy prison sentence, we can help you apply for executive clemency through a commutation or pardon application.criminal pre-charge caseslet’s say that you haven’t been arrested or charged with a crime, but you know—or suspect—that you’re being investigated for one. do you need to hire a criminal defense law firm? the answer is a resounding “yes.”we routinely advise clients who are under investigation for a variety of crimes, and we’re often successful in helping our clients avoid charges altogether.how? we open lines of communication with the investigating police agency as well as the prosecutor. our michigan criminal defense attorneys uncover evidence of innocence that the police won’t follow up on. we advise the client on whether to talk with the police or take a private or police polygraph examination. in short, we build a wall between you and the police. to get to you, they need to go through us.why is that important? often, clients can be their own worst enemy. they talk to the police when they shouldn’t. the police can be incredibly persuasive; it’s their job. even if you’re completely innocent, they can cajole you into making incriminating statements to make it easier for them to close the case.if you’re being investigated for a crime, don’t just sit on your hands and hope that it will go away. most of the time, it won’t.title ix investigationsif you’re a college student and a fellow student accuses you of sexual assault, the university will investigate the allegation and possibly take disciplinary action against you. the university is required to investigate the allegation under title ix of the education amendments of 1972. but the law gives universities a large amount of discretion when it comes to how they conduct their investigations.unfortunately, universities tend to aggressively pursue even the most baseless allegations and impose draconian punishments, including expulsion, against accused students. even where the allegation is false and the client is never charged with a crime, certain universities will routinely decide in favor of the accuser. “due process,” too often, is not a part of the university administration’s vernacular. and the stakes in these cases are high. if you’re expelled, you may never be able to obtain a college degree and pursue the career you had always dreamed of.fortunately, in recent years, the pendulum has begun to swing the other way. a series of significant court decisions have leveled the playing field, providing some modicum of due process. even so, the deck is still often stacked against the accused student.although a title ix investigation is not a traditional court proceeding, you need a defense law firm by your side. our law firm can force the university to adhere to recent court decisions requiring, for instance, cross-examination of the accuser. our law firm can also help you mount a counter-investigation and provide the university with evidence of your innocence. and an attorney can create a favorable record in case the university decides against you and you need to initiate a civil lawsuit against the university. again, your college degree and your career dreams are on the line. a title ix investigation is nothing to play around with.contact us for a free case evaluation, we can helpas the defendant in a criminal case, you feel as though your life has come to a screeching halt. the process can be scary and overwhelming. but it doesn’t need to be. our michigan criminal attorneys are available 24/7 to help you.areas of criminal law practice in michiganour highly experienced attorneys have worked in

attorneys are ready to provide you with a free initial case consultation and begin to walk you through the next steps you need to take to protect your rights and freedom.do i really need an attorney for my criminal charges? yes, you absolutely need an attorney for your case. but we understand why you’re asking. maybe you got pulled over for drunk driving and blew over the legal limit. is it even worth hiring a criminal defense attorney? or maybe you were caught red-handed shoplifting. is there anything an attorney can even do for you? or maybe you were arrested and confessed to police. isn’t getting an attorney pointless?while you might think your case is hopeless, a knowledgeable michigan criminal defense lawyer will often think otherwise. even if you believe you were caught dead to rights, an attorney may be able to get the case dismissed. for instance, even if you confessed to police, an attorney may be able to find legal grounds for getting the confession thrown out. or in the drunk driving case where you blew over the legal limit, an attorney may be able to uncover one or more reasons why the test result is inadmissible.and even if an attorney can’t get the case dismissed, he or she may be able to get the case drastically reduced. in some cases, an attorney will be able to work out a deal that leaves you with a clean record and no jail time.is it worth retaining a lawyer or should i go with a court-appointed attorney for my michigan criminal case? yes, it is worth retaining an attorney for your michigan criminal case. to be clear, most court-appointed attorneys are conscientious, hard-working advocates. but the indigent defense system in michigan is broken. it’s consistently rated one of the worst in the country. court-appointed attorneys are given too many clients and not enough resources to effectively handle each case. the result is that, in many instances, a court-appointed attorney simply will not have time to do the kind of legwork that results in dismissals and reductions.with retained attorneys, though, you’ve literally paid for their time and attention. they will scrutinize the case from every angle, looking for any hook to get your case dismissed or reduced. they will consult with you to learn the real facts of your case, not just what’s in the police reports. they’ll keep you constantly updated on the status of your case. and, apples to apples, retained attorneys typically achieve better results for their clients than court-appointed attorneys.our criminal lawyers defend clients throughout michiganwe also practice
