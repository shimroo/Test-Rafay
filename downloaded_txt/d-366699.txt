washington rowing - the 100+ 
year  
history
 






 

we have moved! the majority of the content on this site has been 
            moved to our new website,
            
            www.washingtonrowinghistory.org. 

            particularly for users on handheld devices and phones, the new 
            website offers much easier navigation and a better user experience. 
            huskycrew.org will remain on the web until we have migrated all of 
            the race results from 2003-2012 over (which will take time), but the 
            majority of the history is at our new site.  see you there!
 
 






        a note to our readers: the 
        best viewing experience of this content is by laptop or desktop computer 
        (or tablet). 
        originally published on the web in 2003 using microsoft frontpage 
        software, the husky crew history was written years before social media 
        and smartphones. technically upgrading the extensive content and 
        collections now to meet smartphone formatting (over 600 pages of 
        historical writing, photos and media) is financially prohibitive, and if 
        we did have the resources to do it, we would much prefer those resources 
        go to support the current teams!
        from the beginning, this project was built for the web: combining the 
        flexibility to update and add new material with the ability to support 
        the history with audio and 
        video. it continues today as one of  only a handful of 
        extensively detailed and consistently updated (men and women combined) collegiate sports history 
        collections in the world. the downside to publishing 
        on the web is the ease to which material can be used without consent. 
        please respect the effort and time that our authors, photographers, and 
        contributors have put into this body of work, and if using any material 
        published here, please contact us first.

introduction and table of contents



the university of 
washington campus as we know it was less than ten years old when the first 
students took to the water to row.  the shores of lake washington that 
bordered the 600-acre campus were a natural draw to the students and faculty.  
still heavily forested, most access around the lake was by dirt logging roads 
and trails with travel by horseback (if you were lucky) or foot down to the 
pristine water.  (click here -->    
uw early years on union bay 
for an overview of campus at the turn of the century.) yet given the natural 
limitations of an age when seattle was striving to be viewed as more than a 
pioneer town, an estimated 5,000 people showed up on shore and by boat to watch 
the first intercollegiate rowing race between california and washington in 1903.










although it looks very different today, little has changed in the values that 
are taught or the community support that defines washington rowing.  from 
the very beginning seattle embraced - in fact virtually demanded - the sport.  
the men and women that participated, although not familiar with weight rooms, 
ergometers, indoor training facilities or sports medicine, trained extensively 
and with an ethic that lives on today.







the history that is presented 
here tells the story of husky crew supported through photographs.  many of 
them are your photos - pictures taken by fellow athletes, friends and parents 
that ended up in scrapbooks or in boxes, but that now tell a story of amateur 
athletics in the purest form.
we would like you to 
participate with us in this history.  we welcome any personal photographs 
or memorabilia you can share (see below), and also encourage you to write down a 
memory or two about the more personally important events that shaped your rowing 
experience at washington.  pick out a particular race, a particular event, 
a particular practice, or a special memory and get it to us.  we will post 
under the year that it relates.  please email us at webdev (at) 
huskycrew.org with your memory!
this project is an open book.  
it is a work in progress.  we hope you visit it often to read what your 
classmates and friends have to say and to enjoy the new pictures/videos/stories 
that will be consistently added.  like walking back into conibear 
shellhouse after being away for a decade, the history of washington crew is not 
about someone else.  it is about you - our alums, our friends and our fans.  
thank you for a spectacular 120 (and counting) - years!
 

 


 



 



    the washington women's rowing history 

 
    - in honor of the 50th anniversary of title ix in 2022, this major addition 
    to huskycrew.org was added in the spring of 2022 and is consistently 
    updated, featuring a written and photo history of the last fifty years of 
    women's rowing at washington.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1900-1909 women 


    - the women at the university embrace the sport from the beginning, setting 
    the stage for an explosive rise in popularity under the progressive and 
    passionate (and controversial) leadership of hiram conibear. 


 
 
 
 


 



 

1910-1919 women 


- a decade where the sport becomes the most popular on campus for women, mostly 
to the chagrin of the university establishment, and only through the leadership 
of a number of women on campus and the commitment of hiram conibear.


 
 
 
 



 


 



 

1900-1909 men 

 
- the first years, including coach james knight, trips to 
california via steamship, hiram conibear, and a number of power crabs, broken 
boats, swampings and sinkings.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1910-1919 men 
- the varsity boat club is born, a world renowned boat building business is 
born, and national coaching stars are born.  tragically however, a legend 
dies.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1920-1929 men 
- ed leader and rusty callow take the reins from conibear and build a dynasty on 
the west coast.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1930-1939 men 
- al ulbrickson guides washington through a decade of boat racing at the highest 
level, culminating in the now legendary olympic victory in pre-war germany. 



 
 
 
 


 



 

1940-1949 men 
- both before and after a war that would forever change the landscape of 
intercollegiate sport, washington produces some of the finest crews in the 
history of the program.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1950-1959 
men 
- an ira sweep and a stunning victory behind the iron curtain bookend a decade 
of washington dominance on the west coast, ending with the retirement of two of 
the greatest coaches in rowing history.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1960-1969 men 
- some of the toughest men to wear the purple and gold continue to control the 
west, and compete in a sport undergoing rapid change - along with everything 
around them.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1970-1979 men 
- the program drops the ira and adds a permanent, international dimension under 
the guidance of dick erickson, a tireless man with an unwavering vision of what 
the sport could bring to the young men at conibear.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1980-1989 men 
- a decade of wild ups and downs, but also a decade of fierce and varied 
competition - the strongest field on the west coast in the history of the sport 
testing the very core of the tradition at washington.


 
 
 
 


 



 

1990-1999 
men 
- bob ernst takes a stair-step approach to the re-development of the program, 
gradually building the crew into a national contender again, leading into an era 
on the west coast reminiscent of the early/mid-century.


 
 
 
 


 



 

2000-2006 men 
- cal begins the decade in dominant fashion, yet the washington/california 
rivalry is still as competitive as ever, leading to both teams matching speed on 
the national level.


 
 
 


 



 

2003-2012 men and women 
    - huskycrew.org was the primary source of race information prior to the 
    mainstreaming of social media in 2012. our race result pages from those 
    earlier digital years are archived and 
    provide detailed historical perspective on both the men's and women's teams.  please note that many of the newspaper 
    articles from these years have since been removed by the original content providers 
     
    (unfortunately beyond our control), but all of 
    the photos, interviews or videos we posted are still active. below are links to each available year:

the original men's 100-year 
history - written in conjunction with the program centennial in 2003 - was 
written by eric cohen (beginning in the late summer of 2002 and completed in the 
spring of 2003).  in the decade that followed, additional years were added 
(2004-2006), and the first two decades of the women's history were written by 
ellen ernst and published here. as the years passed, more material has been 
added to every decade in every year (substantial new content was added in 
2020/2021), with the significant addition of the women's history, written by 
eric cohen, in the early part of 2022.
some notes about this website: 
it is not perfect! it was originally designed before smart phones existed and 
developed in frontpage, at the time the most popular software to build 
websites... and today wholly obsolete. but to move the size of this content (the 
text alone - without the thousands of photos - equates to 600+ pages) to another 
format would likely be a six-figure investment that honestly we would rather see 
go directly to the team. in addition, the text has not been professionally 
edited, and the project, since inception twenty years ago, has been done on 
volunteer time.  the goal has always been to re-connect our friends and 
alums back to this exceptional program that has had such a broad impact on our 
community for over 100 years.  and there is still a lot to add;  our 
goal is to continue to collect new material, including videos, interviews, and 
more personal stories as the months/years progress.
there have been 10,000+ young 
men and women who have rowed for washington over the last century (plus).  
if we got a name wrong, or left somebody out, let us know.  our goal is to 
be as accurate as possible.  thank you for reading - we hope it takes you 
back!
