protecting specialty crops
 
 
 





who we are
the western region ir-4 project coordinates research trials to support pesticide registrations and non-conventional pest management technologies for specialty crops.  these efforts are essential for delivering effective pest control tools to farmers.

 
 
 




program areas
the western region ir-4 program areas in food use, environmental horticulture, and integrated solutions address an array of new and established pest control problems in both food and ornamental crops.  new compounds for emerging pests and new strategies for existing pests are addressed with ir-4 projects.  in addition, resistance management, residue mitigation, and organic controls are all issues that we address.

 
 
 




get involved
all western region ir-4 project activities start with our specialty crop growers and stakeholders. working with you we define pest control needs and pursue solutions with our research collaborators. give us a call and we can work together toward effective solutions.
