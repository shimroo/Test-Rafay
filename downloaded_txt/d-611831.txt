splash guards/valley controllerwe carry a few options to help control water on the inside roof valleys as occasionally water can overflow the gutter in these problem areas.  the barnett valley controller is able to prevent water from shooting over the gutter with its patented design that allows the water to enter the gutter while still allowing any debris to clear the roof area.  the barnett valley controller is able to be painted any color with our aerosol spray paint (sold separately).  conversely, our splash guards are a more economical way of controlling the water in the inside valley of a roof.  our splash guards are 18.75” long, manufactured from .018 gauge aluminum, and have been “scored” in the center for easy installation on top of the gutter or miter in the inside corner.
slip connectorswe offer a few solutions when needing to attach two pieces of gutter together using a slip connector.  slip connectors are especially useful on extremely long runs of gutter or on applications where expansion and contraction of gutter is a concern.  slip connectors allow some expansion and contraction with the seasons without causing the gutter to buckle under normal conditions.  we offer a 5” all-aluminum option with a channel on either side to slide the two sections of gutter into to complete the joint connection.  we also offer a neoprene slip connector in both 5” and 6” options where the middle portion of the connector is made of neoprene rubber for better expansion and contraction.
strap hangerswe offer many options for applications that require the gutter to be fastened to the roof.   both the roof hook straps and the t-straps are complimentary products with the hook straps designed for the brute™ bracket (sold separately) and the t-strap designed for the hangtite™ bracket.  the wrap around hangers and the vampire hangers, meanwhile, are designed to be stand-alone products not requiring any additional brackets for installation.

roof hook straps (for use with brute® brackets)roof hook straps are made of .060 aluminum and are designed for use with the brute™ bracket for applications requiring the gutter to be attached to the roof. the hook goes down through the keyhole nearest the back of the hanger and then back up through the keyhole towards the front of the hanger to “lock” in the strap. then the hanger can be attached to the gutter and the strap can be attached to the roof. roof hook straps can be used with any brute bracket.
t-straps (hangtite™)t-straps are designed for use with the hangtite™ bracket for applications requiring the gutter to be attached to the roof.  also known as “twist” straps or “t-bars”, the notched end is inserted into the keyhole in the hangtite™, then turned to “lock” in the strap, from there the strap can be attached to the roof.  t-straps can be used with any hangtite™ bracket.
vampire hangersthe vampire™ t-bar is precision stamped from .063″ aluminum. the assembly of the vampire™ t-bar hanger includes a custom, strong rivet securing the strap to the hanger. the vampire™ t-bar is compatible with all types of seamless gutters. the installation process joins this pre-fabricated hanger to the gutter in a unique manner, which assures the strength of the final installation. the two prongs on the hanger (the vampire™ fangs) pierce through the back of the gutter and are bent up for permanent attachment to the gutter. the vampire tool is sold separately and is required for installation. the vampire hanger is available for both 5” and 6” gutter.
wrap around hangerwrap around hangers, similar to t straps, are used when there is no fascia to attach the gutter. the wrap around hanger goes all the way around the outside of the gutter to give the gutter the proper support in this type of application.

slip connectorswe offer a few solutions when needing to attach two pieces of gutter together using a slip connector.  slip connectors are especially useful on extremely long runs of gutter or on applications where expansion and contraction of gutter is a concern.  slip connectors allow some expansion and contraction with the seasons without causing the gutter to buckle under normal conditions.  we offer a 5” all-aluminum option with a channel on either side to slide the two sections of gutter into to complete the joint connection.  we also offer a neoprene slip connector in both 5” and 6” options where the middle portion of the connector is made of neoprene rubber for better expansion and contraction.
strap hangerswe offer many options for applications that require the gutter to be fastened to the roof.   both the roof hook straps and the t-straps are complimentary products with the hook straps designed for the brute™ bracket (sold separately) and the t-strap designed for the hangtite™ bracket.  the wrap around hangers and the vampire hangers, meanwhile, are designed to be stand-alone products not requiring any additional brackets for installation.

roof hook straps (for use with brute® brackets)roof hook straps are made of .060 aluminum and are designed for use with the brute™ bracket for applications requiring the gutter to be attached to the roof. the hook goes down through the keyhole nearest the back of the hanger and then back up through the keyhole towards the front of the hanger to “lock” in the strap. then the hanger can be attached to the gutter and the strap can be attached to the roof. roof hook straps can be used with any brute bracket.
t-straps (hangtite™)t-straps are designed for use with the hangtite™ bracket for applications requiring the gutter to be attached to the roof.  also known as “twist” straps or “t-bars”, the notched end is inserted into the keyhole in the hangtite™, then turned to “lock” in the strap, from there the strap can be attached to the roof.  t-straps can be used with any hangtite™ bracket.
vampire hangersthe vampire™ t-bar is precision stamped from .063″ aluminum. the assembly of the vampire™ t-bar hanger includes a custom, strong rivet securing the strap to the hanger. the vampire™ t-bar is compatible with all types of seamless gutters. the installation process joins this pre-fabricated hanger to the gutter in a unique manner, which assures the strength of the final installation. the two prongs on the hanger (the vampire™ fangs) pierce through the back of the gutter and are bent up for permanent attachment to the gutter. the vampire tool is sold separately and is required for installation. the vampire hanger is available for both 5” and 6” gutter.
wrap around hangerwrap around hangers, similar to t straps, are used when there is no fascia to attach the gutter. the wrap around hanger goes all the way around the outside of the gutter to give the gutter the proper support in this type of application.
