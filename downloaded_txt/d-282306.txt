when choosing a martial arts school, don't think merely of cost and location; always consider their qualifications, teaching method, and value.

kim soo karatekim soo karate is a traditional martial arts school for adults, children, and families. the style of martial arts practiced at kim soo karate is called chayon-ryu (korean for "the natural way" ) and was developed over many years by grandmaster kim soo. 
































 









chayon-ryu is based on the natural movements found within each of its parent styles - chinese chu'an fa, japanese karate, korean taekwondo, okinawa-te, judo/ jujitsu, and hapkido/ aikido. chayon -ryu teaches natural body motion as the basis of all techniques in order to promote power, safety, health, and fitness.chayon-ryu is more than just the physical practice of several martial arts. within the practice, it incorporates an educational system of teaching: morality, purpose, humility, common sense, persistence, and patience.we invite you to join us in a trial class - please contact us for more information.
