what i saw at the abbey of the genesee and why it matters for the crisis in the church.

this article by larry chapp is great (found via michael liccione).  it reminds me of an intellectual version of the great façade by thomas woods and christopher ferrera.  i am putting two bits from the article here but the whole thing is really worth reading and pondering:

"and so my larger point is that the bishops are/were not singularly evil men, but were rather the products of the ecclesiastical culture of their age.  and that culture is largely reflective of the culture that surrounds us.  but therein resides the true nature of the “winter” in which we find ourselves, and the true nature of the disease that afflicts us.   in short, at some point in her history the church in north america and europe ceased to be culture-forming and came to be, instead, formed by the culture. 

"my claim, therefore, is that the fundamental crisis in the church today is not rooted, primarily, in sexual perversion.  it is rooted, rather, in the idolatry of worldly comfort, which i take to be the very essence of the bourgeois spirit.  it is an idolatry made respectable (and therefore unrecognized as idolatry) by the church’s modern acceptance of the enlightenment’s co-optation of the kingdom of god by politics and economics.  this entails as well the de facto, practical atheism that ensues when god’s transcendence comes to be viewed competitively over and against our worldly fulfillment.  in such a bourgeois regime, where christianity has been tamed and has become just one more aid or help to our self-improvement in this life (shmemann’s genius insight), the kingdom of god has to be gutted of its true supernaturally transformative power and replaced with either the ridiculous gospel of prosperity or the totalizing social/political gospel of the left.  and, as schmemann further points out, our status as homo adorans, as primarily in our essence “worshipers of the true god”, is thus replaced by homo faber, or humanity viewed as a mere economic commodity, either as a producer or as a consumer, and as a forger of brave new worlds in the here and now."

an inside look at voice of the faithful on long island

in january of 2004 i posted about an article in crisis magazine that gave a behind the scenes look into voice of the faithful on long island (when i was getting the print edition).  it showed how the group had good intentions but seem to end  up doing nothing more than being another forum for liberal dissenters.  i did not link to the article at the time but it is on line here.  one line that jumped out at me was this line about newsday's bob keeler speaking at a local votf meeting:

"keeler did issue a warning: it seems many of the younger priests and those currently in seminaries are leaning in an orthodox direction, and in 15 to 20 years these men will be our pastors. there were reflexive gasps from the crowd." 

this was written 16 years ago and the day has arrived!  some pastors are much more traditional but i do not hear much complaining about them.  so far, i have heard positive feedback and no one seems to be pushing for the 1970's style catholicism to return.  again, i think a lot of the people in the 1970's - 1980's thought that everything in the church had to change but the vast majority of catholics just want solid, true christianity.

the canons of st. leopold in glen cove celebrate the ordinary form, extraordinary form and apparently apparently the byzantine rite as well -

tomorrow, friday, in addition to the usual 8:30 morning mass (from an exotic location with some special guests!) we will also celebrate a divine liturgy in the byzantine rite at 5:00 pm. after the divine liturgy, we will together make the consecration to st joseph. please join us!

their livestream is on facebook - https://www.facebook.com/glencovecatholic/

i do not know much about the byzantine rite so this should be interesting to see.

catholic answers give a little info -

"the byzantine rite is one of several eastern rites recognized by and in full communion with the bishop of rome. its origin can be traced to the ancient city of byzantium (modern-day istanbul), renamed constantinople when the emperor constantine relocated his capital city there from rome in a.d. 330.



although in full communion with the church in the west, the byzantine rite retains distinctive features. byzantine churches are beautifully adorned with icons, and the sanctuary is separated from the congregation by an iconostasis, a screen covered with icons. leavened bread is used for the consecration of the body of christ in the liturgy (not called the “mass” in eastern rites), which is either the liturgy of st. john chrysostom or that of st. basil the great. communion is received under both kinds and administered by the priest from a spoon."

with safety in mind, dioceses look to reopen 

church doors

this article from our sunday visitor points out mostly things i will not mind at all, with the exception of only communion in the hand.

"the next time you go to mass, someone wearing a medical protective mask may take your temperature and ask if you have a sore throat or shortness of breath.




you may see every other pew roped off to keep the faithful 6 feet apart from each other. alcohol-based hand sanitizers could be located throughout the building. the seating capacity will probably be reduced, so not everyone who wants to go to church may be allowed inside.'

...



"as more governors begin talking about reopening their states, most of which have been shut down for almost two months because of the coronavirus pandemic, a growing number of the nation’s catholic bishops are looking to bring back public masses, albeit with restrictions.




“proper distancing, all must wear a mask, holy communion only on the hand,” bishop richard f. stika of knoxville, tennessee, tweeted april 28 in announcing that public masses in his diocese will return on pentecost weekend.




by late april, the dioceses of great falls-billings and helena in montana, as well as las cruces, new mexico, and lubbock, texas, had resumed public masses, but with conditions that limited the number of people who could attend the liturgies and that mandated the gatherings still comply with public health regulations aimed at stemming the pandemic.




in great falls-billings, for example, social distancing has to be maintained at all times. the sign of peace is prohibited, as is receiving communion on the tongue. the offertory procession is not held, the precious blood is not available to the faithful and baskets are not used for collections."

where did all the catholics go?

the above link is to the latest from one of my favorite writers rod dreher.  i have been reading him since he wrote in the ny post, remember him writing of his conversion to the catholic church and then his exit to the orthodox church.  i consider him to be one of the most reliable sources of info and ideas on the church, especially because he has written from an outside-inside-outside viewpoint.  i was able to read the benedict option during this lockdown and highly recommend it.  in today's link he quotes ryan burge:


i know, the nones are growing rapidly. but, the share of evangelicals who are going to church weekly or more has never been higher - same for mainline protestants. there's been no real shifts among black protestants. the real decline is catholics - 45% in 1970's, 25% today


of course the corruption of the clergy accounts from a lot of it, but most catholics were not aware of how extensive this problem was until recently.  what has driven people from the church is that for 50 years we were told that anything traditional was bad, no good, terrible and also immature.  they built or redecorated churches to make them look bland or just without any beauty.  they tried to water down all the teachings and when all is said and done most catholics did not see any reason to continue with any of it.  the traditional mass is making a big comeback (i can longer keep up with how many of the newer priests celebrate it) and hopefully with the mass will come more traditional teachings and practices.  in the end though, the most traditional priest celebrating the most traditional mass will mean nothing if he and the people are not authentic followers of jesus christ.  this is why i consider myself a 'reform of the reform' guy, whereas so many in my shoes have gone full traddie.  catholics, especially those in positions of authority in the church have been so fearful and angry of anything traditional that they lost sight of what it was catholics were looking for - authenticity.

the catholic church during coronavirus

during this whole covid 19 and lockdown situation i have seen more veiled chalices, traditional latin masses, ordinary form masses celebrated ad orientem, eucharistic processions and house blessings than ever before.  this is amazing when you lived through the 1970's and 1980's.  when i first was blogging (17 years ago!) i followed all the arguments and discussions on the church and kept up with all of it.  now, i can't keep up with it all and don't have any desire to but the church on long island is looking a lot more traditional than in the past.  one of the best bloggers amy welborn at charlotte was both puts it best in this post:  pendulums.  it is well worth a read.

a sample:

"there are countless angles to come at in examining the past few decades of catholic history, but one that i emphasize frequently – because i see it neglected in other discussions of the time – is that a major focus of the changes in that period was the conviction that the stuff of faith, from buildings to ritual, to objects of devotion, to devotional practices themselves, were not actually helps to authentic faith, but obstacles. "

unesco, uae begin reconstruction of historic iraqi church destroyed by isis

"work has begun to rebuild a christian church in iraq destroyed by the islamic state as part of a partnership between the united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization and the muslim-majority united arab emirates.

unesco announced last week that construction has commenced on the conventual church of our lady of the hour in mosul. mosul was once iraq’s second-largest city before it was overrun by the islamic state terrorist group in 2014 but liberated by u.s.-backed coalition forces in 2017. 

"with the official approval from the dominican order, unesco — in close collaboration with relevant authorities — will now start the stabilization and rehabilitation of the conventual church of our lady of the hour in mosul,” the international body said in a statement. "

two reasons for fewer vocations

the above article at corpus christi watershed is by richard clark, a native long islander now living in boston.

below is his main point:



"myriad causes can be distilled into one: lost catholic identity in our increasingly secularized world. such secularization has crept its way, in varying degrees, into two critical areas:




1 • celebration of the sacred liturgy
2 • catholic schools and faith formation of children and adults"

pandemic in the diocese of rockville centre



yes, i am still here and still not updating this site.  but i thought it might be good to show some of the good things being done here on long island during this weird lockdown.  



notre dame parish in new hyde park has been featuring some good stuff on facebook.  they are live streaming masses, including last night's solemn high mass in the extraordinary form on the feast of st. george.  the parish is led by a young traditional minded priest fr. joseph scolaro and he did the excellent videos  behind the catholic mass and stump the priest.



st. william the abbot in seaford has also been streaming masses on facebook as well as a 'round table' with the 3 parish priests.  the pastor, fr. joe fitzgerald also has done video interviews featuring a school student and an er nurse (so far).



the diocese lists all the parishes doing live streaming of masses here.



and of course the catholic faith network has been showing the mass from st. agnes cathedral.

american priest: the ambitious life and conflicted legacy of notre dame's father ted hesburgh

 

 

the above link is to the amazon page for an interesting new book about the long time head of notre dame.  famous for both civil rights and public activity, hesburgh also was part of the land o lakes statement that ushered in the era of catholic universities downplaying their catholicism to appear 'independent'.  the author of the book is fr. wilson miscamble, c.s.c, a fellow priest of the holy cross who was friends with hesburgh but who apparently has written a balanced account of his legacy.  i just finished watching a good interview with the author by raymond arroyo on ewtn.  fr. miscamble was clearly on the side of those who felt the land o lakes statement and subsequent actions in catholic higher education hurt the transmission of the faith to the younger generations.  it seems like this book will be a great book about a great and imperfect priest.  crux news has a shorter written interview on the book here.

national catholic prayer breakfast hears call for 'catholic great awakening'


washington d.c., apr 23, 2019 / 01:30 pm (cna).- the national catholic prayer breakfast heard an uncompromising call to holiness and the defense of every human life tuesday, with speakers calling for a “catholic great awakening.”
a total of 1,400 gathered in washington, dc for the 15th-annual prayer breakfast, where keynotes were delivered by bishop thomas olmsted of phoenix and curtis martin, founder and director of the fellowship of catholic university students."

...

"in his keynote address, focus president curtis martin noted that human history was punctuated by periods of renewal, sparked by a return to god in a spirit of atonement. but instead of doom and gloom, he said, the coming generation of young catholics has the potential to do great things.
the current generation, he said, are “survivors by god’s design” having been born after abortion was legalized and are poised to “wake up” and “vanquish the devil in this generation.”
the united states has experienced ebbs and flows in religious devotion before, and has seen two “great awakenings” among protestants that resulted in renewed faith for believers. perhaps, said martin, this is what the church in america needs.
"wouldn't it be a great time for a catholic great awakening?"

knights of columbus pledge support to sri lanka after church bombings

i am very glad i belong to this group.


"in response to easter bombings in sri lanka that left over 320 dead, the knights of columbus have pledged support to the diocese of colombo to help rebuild the local christian community.


“the knights of columbus stands in solidarity with our christian brothers and sisters in sri lanka during this time of trial. terrorist attacks like those on easter sunday are the acts of those who reject the sanctity of life, human rights and religious freedom,” said ceo carl anderson in a statement."
...

"every country should protect its religious minorities, and freedom-loving countries must demand nothing less of their neighbors. talk of human rights and religious freedom rings hollow when people are killed for nothing more than worshipping the one who taught us to love one another,” he continued.

the financial support of $100,000 from the knights has been sent to cardinal malcolm ranjith, archbishop of colombo, who has criticized the sri lankan government for failing to heed warnings of the attack."

in praise of james v. schall s.j.

over at the catholic thing, some authors remember fr. schall.  i learned he was a fellow fan of peanuts and charles m. schulz.  i only knew him from his writings so it is great to read of his considerable personal charms, which some intellectuals lack.


"now much as fr. schall loved beautiful cathedrals and “the burning fire of thought,” we must immediately add that he endorses blake’s next thought, which descends to a more homely level: “he who would see the divinity must see him in his children.”

this schall manifestly did every step of his life. i saw him once befriending a camera crew who had come to film an interview with him and then doing the same with the cab driver who arrived to take the crew away.

even more i think of an incident as he and i descended a large stone stairway at white gravenor hall after class, deep in conversation over plato. just ahead of us, a lass began sobbing on the landing, no doubt after some treacherous youth had dumped her there. schall instantly dropped plato and was at her side, consoling her and taking her away for a private talk."

sri lanka attacks: 'international network' linked to bombings

 

from the bbc:

 

"a wave of bombings that killed 290 
people in sri lanka on sunday was carried out with the support of an 
international network, officials said.
the government has blamed a
 little-known local jihadist group, national thowheed jamath, although 
no-one has yet admitted carrying out the bombings.
another 500 people were injured in the suicide attacks on churches and hotels.
police arrested 24 people in a series of raids and the president's office declared a state of national emergency."


hundreds more catholic martyred on easter sunday by the followers of that horrible and violent ideology of islam.

retired priest from merrick killed by impaired driver

"family and parishioners of a merrick church are mourning the loss of a
 retired priest who delivered a sermon on jesus' life and resurrection, 
then died hours later on good friday in a crash allegedly caused by an 
impaired driver on the southern state parkway.


the rev. t. chacko mammen, 69, was driving 
west in his gmc sport utility vehicle when a honda driven by christopher
 gomez-almendarez, 23, rear-ended his vehicle about 12:10 a.m. near exit
 30 in north massapequa, state police said. the gmc careened onto the 
shoulder and hit a tree. mammen was rushed to st. joseph hospital in 
bethpage, where he was pronounced dead, police said."


                          



this is a tragic loss for his family and for the mar thomas church - this is a church not in communion with rome but with its origins going back to st. thomas the apostle.  god bless his family and his parish.

fr. james v. schall, s.j., has died at the age of 91

 

carl olsen writes an obit at crisis magazine.  he neglected to mention the ignatius press book another sort of learning which i have in my library and now i will have to read it again.  fr. schall wrote about his book in 2009 here at the catholic thing and it sounds very timely even 31 years after publication.

 

"this
 book is designed to bypass the colleges without denying their 
existence. i have always thought that anyone can get an education if he 
can read, something i learned from both samuel johnson and my friend 
anne burleigh. reading has the great advantage of making an end run 
around academic correctness, wherein little theoretic order is to be 
found. reading can take us to things that no one in the schools tells us
 about. the problem is, as always, “what to read?”

notre dame cathedral 

various people have suggested that the rebuilding effort of the great cathedral should be combined with a rebuilding of the catholic faith in france and europe.  hopefully, this huge tragedy will be the impetus for real renewal.  others have pointed out how universal is the appreciation for this great beauty of a church- even among those who are indifferent or hostile to religion, christianity, or catholicism.  

steven schloeder commented on his facebook page a great thought as a catholic architect, ending with this very true bit:

"consider the los angeles cathedral. it already looks like a wreck. no one would care if it got destroyed. no one loves it. no one thinks it a sign of god's effusive beauty and glory and goodness and order.

 yet notre dame de paris made us weep for its loss. what a contrast."

this is good news:

the 10 worst catholic church songs of all time

the above link takes you to an enjoyable video of the catholic talk show. i am finding that as blogging has become almost dead, the podcasts and vlogs are providing the same thing i used to find with catholic blogs:  great conversations, funny and orthodox but irreverent discussions on catholic stuff.  this topic of awful catholic music has been discussed for years yet we still hear the same music at most parishes.  some of the songs discussed in this episode might make fine folk music on its own but the music is not made for congregation singing and is overwhelmingly sappy and thus, not right for mass.

o’malley blesses marathon runners in first mass at restored cathedral of the holy cross


"the stately cathedral’s faded red carpet is gone, as are the steps into each pew that sometimes tripped congregants. new stone tiles that were handpicked by o’malley gleam, and the aging pews have been refinished and fitted with new kneelers. when more than 50 runners gathered at the altar for o’malley’s blessing, they stood on steps of shining marble.
 
“it’s a dream come true,” o’malley said of the restoration in an interview after the mass. “this is a great old cathedral, and there was a lot of benign neglect over the years. but, as in all of these old churches, if you don’t make the sacrifice to preserve it, eventually you’re going to lose it.”

new pastors

st. william the abbott in seaford is getting a new pastor:  fr. joseph fitzgerald.  he is also the vocation director for the diocese of rockville centre.  he was profiled in the national catholic register a few years back - 

from olympic athlete to diocesan priest

snip:

"i entered immaculate conception seminary in douglaston, n.y., on aug. 30, 2001, which was my 30th birthday. shortly after that, and only a few miles away, the 9/11 attacks on the world trade center occurred. that was a very jarring time. it showed how goodness and hope, as expressed in the vocation to the priesthood lived out, were sorely needed.

i was ordained on june 9, 2007, and now as a diocesan vocations director, i want to encourage other men to share in this life of generosity and love that the priesthood allows. "


st. frances de chantal, right next door in wantagh, is also getting a new pastor:  fr. seth awo     doku who is currently at st. agnes cathedral.

"fr. seth n. awo     doku was born and raised in ghana. he wanted to be a priest at     age 12. after graduating high school, he attended the minor     seminary prior to his philosophical and theological formation,     and was ordained on july 21, 1990, for the archdiocese of accra.     he served in two pastoral assignments before proceeding to the     catholic university of america in washington, dc, to do graduate     studies. he earned the licentiate degree in liturgical studies     in 1999 and returned to ghana, where he served as the director     of liturgical services of the archdiocese of accra and also as a     pastor. in 2004, he returned to the catholic university of     america to complete his studies, obtaining the doctorate degree     in liturgical theology.

maryland man inspired by islamic state attack plotted to drive truck into national harbor pedestrians, officials say 

18 years after 9/11 and we are now so used to terroristic plots they barely make the news!

"a maryland man inspired by the islamic state group plotted to ram a stolen u-haul truck into as many pedestrians as possible at a popular convention and tourist destination just outside the nation’s capital, federal prosecutors said monday.
the allegation was made in a court filing as prosecutors in maryland urged a judge to keep the defendant, 28-year-old rondell henry, detained on a charge of driving a stolen vehicle across state lines. the police arrested him on march 28 after officers who discovered the stolen truck saw him leap over a security fence."

cardinal sarah on mass migration


"it is better to help people flourish in their culture than to encourage them to come to a europe in full decadence,” he said. “it is a false exegesis to use the word of god to promote migration. god never wanted these heartbreaks.”

the guinean cardinal, one of the most conservative voices in the vatican, said priests, bishops and even cardinals were today afraid to proclaim divine teaching.

“they are afraid of being frowned upon, of being seen as reactionaries. so they say fuzzy, vague and imprecise things to escape criticism, and they marry the stupid evolution of the world,” he said.

migrants arriving in europe were parked somewhere without work or dignity, he added. “is that what the church wants?” he asked.

 

the church should not support “this new form of slavery” because the west, with its low birth rate, risked disappearing, he argued. “if europe disappears, and with it the priceless values of the old continent, islam will invade the world and we will completely change culture, anthropology and moral vision.”

 

many of us catholics were praying for an african pope to follow benedict xvi due to their orthodoxy, strength and great understanding of real christianity in the real world.  unfortunately we will have to wait.

all in the family: isis edition 

 

why is this news not a major news story?  whenever i see an article on a 'right wing' or 'left wing' site, i always google it to confirm other major news sources have the same details more or less.  i see mostly local texas news covering the original story and the ap story is here.  but americans going overseas to join the islamic state, or al shabab, or any other terrorist organization (or anyone covering up for them) should warrant major news coverage.  now that isis has been mostly defeated, we need to bring to justice all the people who joined them.  we should not allow what happened with the nazis to happen with isis - hundreds of them starting a new life somewhere else and living freely for decades. no country should allow anyone to return from syria or iraq, let them rot in jail or be executed where they caused such evil.

 

"arman (28) and oman (27), isis fighters and ideologues to their core,
 haven’t turned up from the battlefield. the brothers were last known to
 be fighting with isis in syria after allegedly traveling there from 
egypt between october and december 2014. their father, mohommad hasnain 
ali, is set to be released from a dallas halfway house on april 17 as 
part of his year-long federal prison sentence for covering their tracks.
 their mother, sumaiya ali, is in federal prison in carswell, new mexico
 until april 2020 for lying on their behalf to investigating fbi agents,
 although she is writing letters to the judge begging for earlier 
transfer to home confinement. more on that later.
the ali family 
is hardly alone these days as the remnants of destroyed isis society are
 somehow fit back into various parts of the world. not more than 250 
americans attempted to join the caliphate; not all successfully. now 
comes the final chapter of the story, the returnees."

all our children



presented by the sheen center for thought & culture


april 6 - may 12, 2019


 
"a terrible crime is taking place in a german clinic for disabled 
children. the perpetrators argue that it will help struggling parents 
and lift the financial burden on the mighty third reich. one brave voice
 is raised in objection. but will anyone listen?
stephen unwin’s
 riveting new play is set against a forgotten chapter of the holocaust, 
the murder of disabled children and young people, remembering those who 
died and those who fought against this injustice. tony award® winner john glover (saint joan, the drowsy chaperone,  love! valour! compassion! on broadway;  “smallville”) is featured in a company including jennifer dundas (the little foxes, arcadia on broadway), karl kenzler (fiddler on the roof, you can’t take it with you on broadway; “law & order,” “house of cards”), tasha lawrence (good people and wilder wilder wilder on broadway; “the looming tower,” “royal pains”) and sam lilja (the iceman cometh on broadway). directed by ethan mcsweeny (gore vidal’s the best man, a time to kill on broadway).
the
 persecution, sterilization and murder of hundreds of thousands of 
disabled people is one of the most overlooked chapters in the whole 
ghastly history of nazi germany. between 1939 and 1945, it is estimated 
that well over 200,000 people with a wide range of disabilities were 
dismissed as lebensunwertes leben (‘lives unworthy of life’) 
and systematically killed in six converted psychiatric hospitals across 
austria and germany. public opposition to the program was limited. the 
most striking intervention came from the bishop of münster, clemens von 
galen, who will be played by john glover.
all our children is a timely work of historical fiction, but rooted firmly in the true evils of the past.
not appropriate for children under 13."


the above play looks interesting - you can read more about bishop von galen here:

the catholic church’s culture clash

the above link is to a great article by fr. dwight longenecker.  he talks about the consumerist attitude of catholics today compared to the original idea of a geographic parish in the days where people could not travel easily.  go read the whole thing.  he says the old way of geographic parishes does not work any more and suggests an alternative that is interesting.  it sounds a lot like the oratory in brooklyn i recently found out about.  


"the administrative, sacramental and pastoral structure of our church is geographical. the kingdom of god (which is the church on earth) is divided into archdioceses, dioceses and parishes.
this system was established when people had a national and regional identity. they were local. they lived in a village where they were born. they lived within an extended family, and the parish had its own hierarchy. “the rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate.” the church and the priest contributed to the spiritual part of that model.
this works just fine as long as people remain local. without modern transportation everyone walked everywhere or at most, rode a horse or took a carriage.
the parish church was simply a part of this larger social structure.
but we don’t live that way anymore. we are mobile and globalist. the family is broken. we go anywhere, live anywhere and settle (if we settle at all) anywhere."

recently there were dozens of wealthy parents, including a couple of celebrities indicted for bribery to get their children into high priced elite universities.  george weigel looks at the state of these universities and offers an alternative:

the high-priced spread, revisited


"....i said that a first-class liberal arts education at a college or university with a strong catholic identity would prepare their sons and daughters for anything. absolutely not, parents insisted. the kid had to get into harvard, or stanford, or duke — or some other academic version of the high-priced spread — lest his or her life be ruined.
when i pointed out that undergraduates at so-called “elite” universities are frequently taught by graduate assistants rather than by senior faculty, the parents were unmoved. when i reminded them that few, if any, members of the philosophy departments at elite schools are convinced that there is something called “the truth,” rather than just “your truth” and “my truth,” they didn’t budge. when i cited the experience of my daughters, who had gone on to premier graduate schools and successful professional careers after attending a small, demanding catholic liberal arts college, i was met with blank stares.  when i asked why they were willing to spend north of a quarter-million dollars to send their children into a decadent environment in which corruption (chemical, intellectual, sexual, political, or all-of-the-above) was a real and present danger, the mantra continued: the kid must attend an elite school to have any chance in life, because that’s where you begin to “network.”

bishop brennan was installed today as the bishop of the diocese of columbus.  the mass was livestreamed on the columbus diocese website and salso hown on catholic faith network.   columbus is made of 278,000 catholics with 105 parishes.  i hope bishop brennan will make us proud - he is the 6th long islander to be sent off the island to serve as a current bishop.


 

bishop brennan honors faith heritage at installation


"in his installation homily, columbus bishop robert j. brennan paid tribute to his family’s history of faith and urged the people of his new diocese to appreciate their own faith heritage and give it to future generations through everyday sacrifice and concern for others.“my grandfathers handed on a priceless legacy of faith, hope and love that was passed on to us by my parents,” bishop brennan said at his installation mass at columbus st. joseph cathedral on friday, march 29. “these are the great treasures, aren’t they? here for us in the diocese of columbus, we too are the heirs … to a wonderful legacy of faith.“we stand on the shoulders of the people who built this up for us. and now it’s our turn, it’s our turn as the new generation. the faith they handed on to us – faith, hope, and love – these aren’t museum pieces to be admired and watched, but a living encounter with the risen jesus christ.”about 800 people, including 35 other bishops, filled the cathedral for the one-hour, 50-minute ceremony, at which archbishop christophe pierre, the vatican’s apostolic nuncio to the united states, read the letter written jan. 31 by pope francis appointing bishop brennan as the 12th bishop of columbus. he had been auxiliary bishop of the diocese of rockville centre, new york, for nearly seven years."

recalling mother angelica, prelate says catholic journalists are to spread the gospel

"vatican city, mar 27, 2019 / 10:24 am (cna).- the crisis facing the church today calls catholic journalists not only to “relentless and fair reporting” but also to spreading the gospel, archbishop georg gänswein said in a mass said in memory of mother angelica.
the march 27 mass at santa maria della pieta in camposanto dei teutonici in vatican city marked the third anniversary of the death of mother mary angelica of the annunciation, foundress of ewtn global catholic network. ewtn is the publisher of catholic news agency."

i found this quote regarding fr. gommar depauw who founded an independent traditionalist chapel on long island back in 1968.  the emphasis is mine:

"in matters liturgical we are committed vernacularists, but there is no denying the truth of the depauw contention that the council's constitution on the liturgy permits but does not require increased use of the mother tongue.  the character of the liturgy is not a matter to be determined by popular preference, but in view of the constitution's permissiveness, the traditionalist request for one mass in latin in each parish each sunday does not seem unreasonable, at least for an interim period in those parishes where there is some demand for such an arrangement.  it took a long time for the bishops themselves to grasp the necessity for liturgical renewal, and yet few of them, it seems to us, are showing sympathetic understanding of the shock experienced by many catholics who (despite all the pre-council and conciliar discussion) were not prepared for the changes."


the above quote was from the national catholic reporter, january 12. 1966.
