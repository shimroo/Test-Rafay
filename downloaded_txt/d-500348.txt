buxton online - come and find out...

discovering buxton is to find a town
that has everything. the 'capital of the high peak' sits proudly high
on a hill overlooking stunning scenery, pockmarked with quarries, but
quilted with lush green pasture. 

left out of the national park
status, we would disagree that buxton is definitely an area of
outstanding natural beauty. with its myriad of streets, alleyways and
open spaces, there is certainly a mixture of hustle and bustle,
comings and goings, but there is also plenty of time to sit and
contemplate your journey, whether it be back into the town to sample
the delights of the diverse and different shops, or to wander lonely
as a cloud, through the parks and gardens.
21st century modern day shops, sit
comfortably alongside stunning architecture, which transports
visitors back in time. buxton has a rich and varied history, a river
running underneath it, which pops up now and again to offer the
famous spring waters to rejuvenate those tired and aching shopaholics
feet.
soak up the splendour of the
crescent, once home to ostlers and servants, stop a moment and scout
the architecture above the shop fronts. transport yourself back in
time and imagine what life was like as horse and carriages meandered
along their way up terrace road. go further back to roman times,
where queen's were imprisoned and outlaws hid in caverns, where
farmers and 19th century dukes worked the land together.
parts of buxton haven't changed at
all, but other parts have moved on with the times. the shopping
centres are free from traffic, and full to bursting with a huge range
of goodies, antiques and gifts, books and clothes. shops galore, with
cafes and bars littered around the town for respite a vibrant mix and
the market twice a week with traders selling their wares, proving
it's a great town to find a present for those hard to buy for people
we all know.
to stay in buxton is a great choice
to have made, and buxton accommodation is vast and varied. there are
grand hotels, budget bed & breakfasts, holiday cottages to suit
any budget and all the while you will know that a peaceful break can
be had by all, or a fantastic weekend away sampling buxton amenities,
is always an option. the events in buxton centre around the pavilion
gardens, a 23 acre area of beauty in itself. buxton opera house
offers a diary packed full of musical events and operates, a
spectacular festival, edinburgh fringe style, and a museum and art
gallery tracing history back in time.
uncover the truly beautiful spa town
in the very heart of the peak district and you see for yourself  the
historic and modern, the quaint and the cosy.  discover buxton and
you'll be very glad you came.
