these advanced search filters are cool. you can search by age, location, interests and relationship type. whether you’re looking for a regular fuck buddy, local hookup or something more specific like horny women, milfs or horny teens the filters will help you find what you’re looking for. plus with private messaging, chat rooms and video calls the interaction between users is enhanced.
another feature is the app’s matchmaking algorithm which suggests matches based on user preferences and activity. while the app has a lot of free access, the premium versions may have more features like more search filters, unlimited messages and more visible profile. we’ll take a closer look at these features as we put the app to the test in real life.
how to use local sex app
using the local sex app is easy. the app has both desktop and mobile app so you can use it on your preferred device. the sign up process is super quick, under 3 minutes.
to get started you need to create a username and password and submit a valid email address. once you submit those details you’ll get a confirmation email to activate your profile before you can access the app. this simple sign up process means you can start browsing matches in no time, one of the fastest sex sites to get started on.
safety during sign up
when setting up your profile on the local sex app you need to take some safety precautions. one of those is to use a dedicated email account for signing up on the app. this will keep your main email account separate and safe.
another tip is to use different photos for your dating profile to prevent reverse image searching, which will protect your identity. and don’t share live or motion photos as these can have geolocation data that will expose your location.
also be careful with profiles that have no bio, linked social media accounts or only one picture as these may be suspicious or fake profiles.
never share personal information such as:

your social security number
credit card details
bank information
home address

with someone you haven’t met in person. by following these precautions you’ll be safer using the app.
interface and design
the local sex app excels in interface and design. the app is easy to use, you don’t need to be tech savvy to navigate around. this makes it accessible to a wide range of users.
the design is clean and nice, text and photo profiles are mixed in a way that enhances the user experience. user testing shows the app is responsive and maintains its intuitiveness even under stress conditions so you’ll have a smooth and fun experience even with heavy traffic.
overall the local hookup app is a seamless and fun platform for casual encounters.
profile options

having clear intentions in their profiles is important for users to match with compatible partners. the app also allows users to create profile avatars so you can express yourself while remaining anonymous. these options will make it easier to find and connect with like minded people.
search and filter
a powerful search and filter mechanism is available in the local sex app. you can do quick search or filtered search to narrow down matches by:

location
physical characteristics
age range
kinks
language

these filters include age, ethnicity and body type which can be customized to your exact criteria. the app also has specialty filters for specific demographics like college students or lgbtq+ community. these advanced filters will help you find exactly what you’re looking for making the app very effective for casual hookups.
real life usage
testing the app during peak and off peak hours will give you an idea of the local sex app’s real life performance. during peak hours the app slowed down a bit but still functional and responsive. this means the app can handle heavy traffic and user load.
off peak hours was even smoother, response time was faster and latency was reduced. this shows the app can perform consistently regardless of traffic. user reliability was consistent during peak and off peak hours, minimal downtime and crashes.
overall the app is a reliable platform for casual encounters.
success rate and user feedback
user feedback is a good indicator of the app’s effectiveness. allen said he got laid the first time he used the local sex app and now has friends with benefits through the app. michelle from atlanta said she has a regular hookup from the app and uses it to get what she wants while traveling for work.
for new users there are tips to maximize the app’s potential for casual hookups. users suggest being strategic with your profiles and interactions to increase your chances of success. these testimonials and tips prove the local sex app is very effective for casual encounters.

this local sex app is taking over boston
while apps like tinder have become a household name and widely known as hookup apps, there are countless others others out there. and while some may be niche, some of them just have a slightly different take on things like bumble. however, in boston, people are signing up for this new app, and you wouldn’t ever guess it if you look up the most popular local sex apps.
the biggest hookup app in boston
what is this app you might wonder? well, if you live in boston, i’m sure you’ve used it or heard of it from friends. of course, we’re talking about down — an adult-only dating app that’s available to everyone with an interest in casual relationships (or even more). what makes this particular platform so special though, is how easy it is to find exactly what you want within the site’s vast network.
you can filter by sexual orientation, gender, body type, race, age, etc., which means you never need to worry about scrolling through dozens of profiles looking for someone who meets your criteria before getting frustrated because they’re all too similar. 
not only do you get a wide range of options when browsing profiles but you also have plenty of search filters to make narrowing down potential matches easier than ever. if you don’t know anyone using the app yet, feel free to add yourself without any commitment required; after all, there isn’t really anything wrong with wanting something different every now and then!
once you decide you’d like to connect with another user, you simply send them a message and wait for them to respond. once they accept, you’ll be able to start chatting directly.
what makes it different?
now that you’ve gotten an idea of what the app is actually all about, let’s move onto the real question: how does down stack up against other hookup apps? well, in terms of functionality, this platform comes out ahead due to its sheer amount of features compared to some others. let me list just a few of those for you:
view photos and videos
all profiles come with at least a single photo and video so that the people behind them can show off exactly what they want. this includes full nudity (or even less), which makes down different from many other adult dating platforms. 
while being open about your sexuality doesn’t mean someone necessarily wants to take things further (it also shouldn’t hurt your chances if you’re someone who prefers discretion!), it definitely makes it much easier to get started, especially since communication takes place through text, or video if your prefer.
search filters 
filters make finding potential partners super easy. one reason why tinder has become so popular, aside from its cute design, is because the app allows for simple search filters that make it easy to find exactly who you’re looking for — regardless of gender, sexual preference, location, etc. the same applies here on down as well, though with more options than we’d ever need! 
you can choose whether or not you want male or female matches, plus filter by body type (thin, athletic, curvy, petite, chubby, thick). for those who are into threesomes or are seeking a relationship but are currently in between a casual fling and a long term partnership, there are additional checkboxes that will allow you to view users who are only interested in one-on-one hookups, one-on-two hookups, and couples.
instant connections
unlike tinder, where you’re only matched up with people who swiped right on your profile, everyone on down can start communicating with anyone else on the site immediately without having to wait around for the matchmaking algorithms to dole out your first match. 
if you don’t happen to like any profiles that come your way, that’s okay too — it simply means that no one has gotten the chance to connect yet! so go ahead — give it a shot yourself! there’s really nothing stopping you from sending someone a message if you want something different from what they’ve already got going on at the moment.
the bottom line
down isn’t necessarily trying to compete with tinder (though it is very similar) because of how drastically different their target audiences are. but what this particular platform does offer is a far more streamlined experience when compared to most other dating sites. 
even though many might argue that using an adult dating app is kind of weird, let’s be honest here: tinder doesn’t even have nudity in its default setting! sure, you’ll still see plenty of photos showing off all sorts of naughty things, but those are always optional for each user; not the entire point of the app. 
what down also offers is much easier search functionality that makes finding exactly who you’re looking for much simpler than before. as long as you know what you want, then down is a great choice for casual encounters that are 100% safe.

a traveller’s guide to boston harbor fishing
boston harbor is one of the busiest ports in the country, and it’s also a great place to fish. there are plenty of spots to cast your line, and you’re likely to catch a variety of fish. here are some tips for fishing in boston harbor:
1. the best spots to fish are near the piers and inlets that are deeper than 20 feet, where the fish are naturally congregated. these spots include black bay, spectacle island, long island, inner harbor cove, and peddocks island.
2. if you want to catch mackerel or striped bass, head for spectacle island during high tide. use live eels or clams for bait, and cast out a few hundred feet. striped bass tend to be in the deeper sections of the harbor, about 20-30 feet down.
3. if you want to catch cod or flounder, try north point park or fort independence at castle island. cast about 200 yards off shore, and use squid or clams as bait.
4. during summer, you’re likely to catch sunfish at fort independence and long island. use worms as bait, and cast just a few feet off shore into the shallow waters of these areas.
5. to catch bass or bluefish, head for black bay off of moon island during high tide. cast 200-300 feet off shore, and use clams or bunker chunks for bait.
6. to catch shrimp, go to the mouth of the harbor near deer island in late spring when they’re in season. use a cast net to catch them!
7. if you want to fish from a kayak or canoe, try moon island or peddocks island. however, be sure to stay at least 1000 feet from commercial fishing boats.
8. don’t forget about the north and south rivers – you’re sure to catch a variety of fish there!
9. if you want to go bottom fishing, try using eels or squid for bait, and cast into deeper water (about 200 feet).
10. when fishing in boston harbor, try to cast along the edges of channels where fish are more likely to congregate, and drop your bait into the deeper parts of the harbor. be sure to check your local regulations!
11. always bring a net for safe release of smaller fish!
12. try using bloodworms as bait for larger fish like cod and bass – they’re sure to bite!
boston harbor is a great place to fish, and with a little bit of knowledge, you’re sure to catch some big fish. be sure to check your local regulations before casting your line, and have fun fishing in one of the busiest ports in the country!

looking to go whale watching in the boston harbor? here’s how.
since the massachusetts bay made its way into boston harbor, whales and other water-based life have been sighted during their migrations. because of this, there has been a long tradition of whale watching in boston. from those taking lunch breaks to those looking to take an educational trip, there is no wrong reason to go out and see these magnificent creatures.
if you’re interested in seeing these mammals for yourself, here’s how to get started:
1) plan ahead
it is important to figure out if you truly want to go whale watching before actually spending money on the trip. if you are only considering it, chances are you will change your mind later. to help with this process, use sites like google to see what other people are saying about these trips. this will help you decide if it is right for you.
2) check out the different whale watching options
there are multiple places in boston that offer opportunities to go whale watching. the most popular of which include the new england aquarium and sail boston . both of these locations offer different trips at different prices, so it is important to do some research before settling on a choice.
3) go during the right season
whale watching is available year-round, but some seasons are better than others. the best time to go is usually in the spring or fall when the whales are migrating. this means that they are more likely to be seen. also, because these are off-peak times for the attractions, prices are usually cheaper.
4) sign up early
because whale watching is a popular activity, it is best to sign up as soon as possible. this will allow you to get on the boat that you want and ensure you have a spot on the trip. even if your plans are slightly flexible, it is recommended to sign up early.
5) bring food and water
though some trips include snacks or drinks, it is always a good idea to bring your own. this is especially important if you are going on a longer trip. not only will you be able to save money, but you’ll also have the chance to eat what you want.
6) dress appropriately
the weather in boston harbor can change quickly and it is important to dress appropriately. make sure to bring a hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses if needed. in addition, it is best to dress in layers so you can be comfortable in any situation.
7) expect the unexpected
though whale watching trips are usually very successful, there is always the chance that you will not see any whales. this could be due to many different reasons, such as the weather or the time of year. do not let this discourage you, as there are still many things to see in the harbor.
8) have fun!
this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so make sure to enjoy it! whale watching can be a very educational experience, but it is also important to have some fun. talk to the people around you, take pictures, and just enjoy the view.

boston harbor distillery: capturing the local spirit of boston

there is something truly spectacular about the essence of feeling like a local. soaking up the history, yet exploring the ever-changing world around you. boston’s newest piece of culture-in-the-making lies at 12r ericsson st, the boston harbor distillery. this brand new business is located in a building with culture as rich as its spirits. the beautiful brick facade once was home to other local institutions, like the putnam nail factory, the george lawley & sons shipyard, and seymour’s ice cream. the boston harbor distillery continues to honor the history of these past businesses with the names of their first three brands: the putnam new england rye whiskey, the lawley’s new england spirit, and the seymour’s local roast coffee liqueur.

the brick exterior of the distillery provides a rustic feel, inviting visitors inside for a taste for more. after a tour of the space and a sampling of the spirits, it is impossible to not feel like a long time local of boston, drinking in the culture surrounding you. manning the stills were two young distillers who you meet by first name. in speaking with them, it is clear the passion they have for their craft. upon entering the great room, you’re instantly made to feel at home and greeted with warm smiles by the barkeep – a young transplant from texas who makes a mean old fashion and other craft cocktails with spirits produced just a few feet away. behind her, stacks of crystal drinkware sparkle on shelves fashioned from belts and reclaimed wood. the modern, yet cozy interior is filled with honey-colored wood and plush plaid fabrics, whisking you away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
in fact, the distillery itself is nestled in a part of boston that is off the beaten path, but within earshot of the gentle hum of the highway. “the port”, as the owner of the distillery refers to it, has been a home to local craftsmen for hundreds of years, and with the addition of this latest venture, the neighborhood continues its legacy of homegrown goods. the boston harbor distillery carries on the tradition of past commerce and culture, while redefining american spirits. you’ll come for the drinks, and stay for the experience that truly captures the history and local spirit of boston.








tours are $10thursday & friday 4-8saturday 12-8
