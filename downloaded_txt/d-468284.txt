what our customers are saying…







“as a society, we are often remiss in recognizing and offering gratitude for those whose kindness and professionalism brighten our lives. accolades, however, in this case are richly deserved because of the wonderful efforts of your shift leader, belinda. during a recent visit to store #45 in taneytown, i attempted to make a purchase from the store’s lottery machine. because of a system malfunction, i was unable to secure a ticket voucher. from the outset, ms. utz was pleasant and knowledgeable as to the process of the machine’s operation. perhaps most importantly was the patience she displayed in attempts to rectify my problem. because of time constraints, i left the store without my vouchers. ms. utz promised to secure them and did so! she even contacted me to share her success. i salute and appreciate the efforts – thumbs up, belinda!”

“the cashier here (wish i got his name) was really helpful, talked up the reward card without being pushy, and put a smile on my face despite me walking up on the wrong side of the bed. i didn’t see any mess in the bathroom or on the floor either. it’s those little things that make a big difference i your day, so shout out to him and whoever is keeping the place clean!”

“let me tell you something about your saint michaels location. the staff you have running that place during the day are by far the greatest employees you’ve ever had at this location. from the way the food services ran to the cleanliness of the store to the clerks everything is top notch. margie always goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome. stephanie runs the food service like a magician and tara is so friendly and sweet at the counter. kayla, sean and randy are also spectacular. they really deserve some recognition for their dedication and service in, i’m sure, one of your busiest stores. it’s because of the staff i refuse to shop anywhere else.”

“every time i make a stop here for gas dayton always greets me with a smile, he was the first person to tell me about the rewards program and took his time explaining to me how it works. he even went out of his way to make one of this company’s famous handcrafted hurricanes- ice cream dairy product which was absolutely delicious!! thank you for being you and having a great personality and vibe.

” great service! thank you. tonight, after filling the tank with gas, i went inside to buy a half gallon of delicious high’s egg nogg. seeing no half gallons in the fridge, i bought two smaller bottles. the cashier told me a half gallon would be cheaper and went behind the displays to bring one to mw. he came through and even wiped off all the sticky stuff on the bottle before placing it on the counter in front of me. what a considerate individual, a real caring soul!
