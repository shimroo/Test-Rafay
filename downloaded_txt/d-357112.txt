steel mill innovation results in high-quality products
cmc advanced the latest innovation in steel-making technology using a continuous process at our eaf micro mills in mesa, arizona and in durant, oklahoma. pioneered by cmc, we are the first steelmakers in the world to successfully operate technology of this type. this innovative continuous process melts, casts and rolls steel from a single uninterrupted strand, producing higher strengths and lower energy costs compared to traditional mini mill processes.

in addition to our u.s. micro and mini mill facilities, we operate the second largest long-products eaf mini mill in poland. the eaf steelmaking technology is the cleanest and most energy-efficient steelmaking process available today.
by using recycled scrap as our raw material, we reduce the need for mining natural resources. in addition, by operating our mills with innovative electric arc furnace technology rather than conventional blast furnaces, our co2 emissions are 63% less than the global steelmaking industry average, further helping to preserve our natural resources while still producing high-quality products. our steel is utilized in numerous applications including infrastructure, construction, agriculture, manufacturing, service centers and fabrication businesses.

for every ton of steel produced, we avoid the use of:
