our philosophy

for individuals and organizations, success depends upon:

knowledge and skill
strategies and tools
engagement and persistence
productive relationships


















                                i feel that [our] instructional system will be more effective due to the intervention process and staff will be more knowledgeable in carrying out instructional system both short and long term.

                                school leaders and leadership teams have been able to identify strengths and weaknesses and narrow their focus in order to target instruction in the classroom. leader visibility has increased tremendously which has had a great impact on the school in so many areas.

indistar allowed the district and school teams to plan, act, and revise as needed around those indicators. âwe began to see broad, authentic interest in what this process meant for teaming, teaching, and learning."

                                seeing instruction through the studentsâ eyes was impactful. many times leaders assume we know what is happening in classrooms, but the student lens provides us with what is actually happening.

                                the transformation academy has forced me to be more intentional on being in classes at least 50% of the time. it also allowed me to build capacity in other building leaders by delegating responsibilities that released me to be in classrooms more often.

                                the payoff is for our students, who now see their parents and their teachers working together for them. we are a much stronger community now.
