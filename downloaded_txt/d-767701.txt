making disciples of jesus christ, gathering around god's word, and loving our communities. 
plan your visitwatch livegather with us we at ibc believe the church is a family who gathers together in one place, at one time, around god’s word. we all struggle at times, and are met with obstacles. it is family that helps to see you through. as a family we come to the father with a spirit of humility, acknowledging our failings and our need for a savior.  it is through jesus christ that we receive salvation. our gatherings reflect this in every aspect: they are joyous and word-centered.
