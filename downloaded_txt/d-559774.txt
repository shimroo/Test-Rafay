talk of
				the town






















during the past 35 years of building communities, megaworld has gone through many ups and downs, turns and curves, rough and smooth roads.
through those times, we have thrived, survived, and kept the vision alive.
thank you, megaworld, for making us part of uplifting many lives, impacting our society, and helping shape our nation.
may this vision last for many generations to come.
we are megaworld.
cheers to 35 years of a lasting vision!
