welcome to high places realty - texas hill country real estate 




high places realty is located in the heart of
                leakey, a small, quiet town tucked away
                in the most picturesque part of the texas 
hill country;
                the frio river valley. leakey sits at the crossroads of us highway 83 (serving as the "mainstreet" of
                town) and ranch road 337, one of the most scenic drives you'll
                experience anywhere. leakey is your gateway to "high places", a
                rugged land of rimrock canyons, lofty hills clad in oaks and pinyon
                pines, deep green valleys, tumbling creeks and unlimited
                possibilities.
the clear
                spring-fed frio river meanders through our
                beautiful corner of the hill country, drawing
                vacationers, hikers, anglers, nature enthusiasts and artists year
                round. many generations have come every summer to spend their
                vacations tubing the frio river and kicking back
                at legendary garner state park. fall and winter
                months bring the hunters with high expectations of bagging a trophy
                buck, turkey or russian boar. many exotics have been introduced
                into the area and are now free roaming.
any time of the year is a great time to explore the texas
                hill country, for a weekend or a lifetime. we count
                it a privilege to be able to help people like you own a part of it.
