upcoming concert june 5, 2025
8pm at riverside church in new york city






the locrian chamber players are a group of performers and composers dedicated to the music of our time.  our concerts are devoted exclusively to works less than a decade old, and programs include both established and emerging composers.  we perform contemporary music without pre-concert discussions and voluminous program notes, believing that the best music, when presented directly, speaks for itself. since the first concert in 1995, the locrian chamber players have presented over thirty world premieres and have given the first new york performances of works by george crumb, philip glass, morton subotnick, joan labarbara, james tenney, alvin curran, george tsontakis, roger reynolds, jo kondo,  along with many others.
