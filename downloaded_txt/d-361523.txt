why save your spot online at urgent care?
urgent care booking allows patients to view available times and reserve their space in line at an urgent care before they arrive. when you save your spot online at urgent care it is important to remember that this is not an appointment. if you are experiencing a medical emergency, please dial 9-1-1 immediately.

book a visit to your desired urgent care location at a time convenient for you.
arrive fifteen minutes prior to your reserved time and check in at the kiosk.
get care faster with the help of our board-certified providers.
online booking is not required, walk-in visits are always welcomed. this is not an appointment. when you “save your spot” online for an urgent care visit, our team will make every effort possible to see you at your reserved visit time, but please be advised that medical emergencies may arise.
