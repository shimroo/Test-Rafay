shift national conference
registration now open!the theme for shift 2025 is ”this is my story.”this year's conference will highlight the story that god is writing for the missionary church, and in doing that, we'll explore each of our stories and how they all contribute to the kingdom.give thanks to the lord, for he is good; his love endures forever. let the redeemed of the lord tell their story.— psalm 107

harvest offering 2024
each fall we challenge all of our churches to take a special offering called the harvest offering. this is one of the major funding streams for this church multiplication initiative. choose a sunday before the end of the year to join churches across the country to take this special offering, or choose a sunday before the end of the year. we ask you and your church to take part in this generosity that will fuel church planting for the coming year.we can’t wait to see how god moves as we join together to do more than any of us or our churches can do alone.find resources and learn more at mcusa.org/harvest.

bless every home
we currently have 25 churches who are a part of our network who have people praying for their neighbors. 4880 homes have been adopted and are being prayed for. over 40 homes are listed as having been discipled by someone in those 25 churches. imagine what the lord might do if we had 400-500 churches around the country with people regularly praying for their neighbors and intentionally caring for them and sharing the good news of jesus.we are encouraging churches to sign up through this special link that connects with the missionary church so that we can track the impact across the country.

mcif
is investing all about the rate of return? or where the money goes? the answer is yes. to both. if numbers are king, there’s no telling where your dollars go. if it’s all about the mission, but your rate of return is paltry, you might as well stuff it under the mattress (although matthew 25 should get you thinking otherwise). truth is, rate of return and mission should both be a priority. and they can be.

the prayer awakening conference session videos are now available to watch! 

it is our hope and prayer that prayer awakening provided challenges and encouragement for your personal prayer life and that it stimulated ideas for mobilizing prayer in your local church.

the stories, tools and times of prayer should challenge each of us to go deeper in prayer with the realization that god desires for his kingdom to come and his will to be done in response to our prayers. greater things are yet to come as we seek him in prayer.

 you are a vital part of what the lord desires to do in the days ahead. we invite you to download our session videos and material and share!

“houston, hell has a problem.” 😏

29 church planters and church plant teams from the us, puerto rico, and costa rica gathered today in houston for the first of three days with our church multiplication training center. dozens of new churches will be planted from this group, proving this promise of jesus is true: “i will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” #multiply #churchplanting #movement










another incredible baptism story from michigan! these 69 people from colonial woods missionary church were baptized in lake huron last sunday. god is moving! share your baptism stories with us, too! #changedlives










located in the small township of bliss, michigan - population 568 - is bliss missionary church, averaging 43 people per sunday morning (nearly 10% of the town’s population) and where 14 people were baptized this past sunday! #multiply #movement #baptism #church










more than 40 pastors and leaders were on the @bethelindiana campus today for the annual pastors prayer walk. campus, students, faculty, and staff were all covered in prayer before the first chapel of the new school year. join us in praying specifically for students from all over the us and more than 20 different nations who make up this year’s freshman class! #bubeblue #gopilots










leaders from seven developing church plants gathered in atlanta this weekend for the church multiplication workshop, the first step in a 12 month process of training, coaching, and resourcing our developing new churches through a reimagined and relaunched church multiplication training center (cmtc)! 

pray for these leaders and these emerging new plants in ohio, florida, south carolina, washington, montana, and tennessee! pray for 11 more plants that will gather next month in houston to begin their cmtc process. god is moving and we are multiplying! it’s because of you and your support of investment in shared ministry and the time to multiply campaign that we are able to do this! www.timetomultiply.com #multiplylikejesus #bettertogether










new latino church | myrtle beach, sc — plant 

ignite church, a missionary church congregation of around 100, was planted in myrtle beach in 2011. pastor jim neece and the church’s leadership began to feel a calling to plant a new church that could share its facility and reach the community’s growing latino and spanish-speaking population. working with our cultural ministries director, jose mendez, and the building bridges network, ignite church is in the early stages of identifying a pastor, organizing a launch team, and hosting worship services for myrtle beach’s latino community — the first of which was held last fall — to begin building relationships. 

your support of time to multiply will help resource ignite church and other existing churches to multiply!

https://donorbox.org/time-to-multiply

#timetomultiply #multiply #churchplanter #churchplant










training, coaching, and equipping church plants requires generous donors who will share in making a small investment that will generate a huge return!

our goal is to fulfill 1,000 “shares” of $25 per month from those across the country who will join us in making this vision of church multiplication become reality. meeting this goal will generate the funding needed to help support 40-50 new plants each year.

whether you can give one share of $25 per month or four shares of $100 per month, no amount is too small! churches are also challenged to consider how many shares they can give, too!

together, we can make a difference.

river church | delta, ohio — replant

this east central region church was on the verge of closing when pastor seth adkins and his family arrived with a heart to see what god was up to.

four years ago the church had 13 regular attenders, and now there are more than 100 at a typical service! small groups have been formed in nearby towns, and more than 200 people are involved in ministries. seth’s focus is not to simply grow a church, but rather to build communities of people who can celebrate jesus together. 

you can help more replants like this lead to further multiplication across the country!

we are committed to the great commission16 then the eleven disciples went to galilee, to the mountain where jesus had told them to go. 17 when they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 18 then jesus came to them and said, “all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19 therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you. and surely i am with you always, to the very end of the age.” amen.— matthew 28:16-20 —
