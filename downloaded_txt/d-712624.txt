blues before sunrise for 02/16/25
  chicago blues fest revisited +
barbeque bob & laughing charlie




this week on bbs we
  present two dynamic features. first, during hour #3 we’ll dust off a
  series of sides by a pair of brothers from atlanta, the hicks brothers
  – barbeque bob and laughing charlie. it’s a twelve-string
  jamboree. then during hour #4 a pair of past performance sets from the
  chicago blues fest – charles brown w. a solo piano set from 1988
  – and then big smokey smothers and the ice cream men from 1985
  featuring postwar pop idol floyd “dark road” jones in his final
  public performance.
it all happens
  right here – only on bbs!
