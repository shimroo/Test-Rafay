executive homes 



							when a small-scale home is ‚Äútoo small‚Äù or an estate home is ‚Äútoo big,‚Äù we can help you plan a mid-sized executive home that is ‚Äújust right‚Äù for your family and lifestyle. these usually range in size from 2000 to 3000 square feet.

						‚Äúwe want to thank you for the work you did on our house plans in comanche trace. the finished product is exactly what we asked you to produce, a texas farmhouse. even though we started with one of your standard plans, we incorporated certain ideas we had and you made them work in the plan without much added square footage.‚Äù
