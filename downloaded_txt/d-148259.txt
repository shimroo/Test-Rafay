the uclouvain centre for cosmology, particle physics and phenomenology (cp3) hosts research on high energy particle physics, cosmology, phenomenology and theory of the fundamental interactions. it is strong on both the experimental and theoretical fronts. the aim of the centre is to bring together researchers in these scientific fields and to encourage collaboration. you'll find below links to the details of our main research directions and the related projects.
research directions:


astroparticle physics
cosmology and general relativity
data analysis in hep, astroparticle and gw experiments
detector commissioning, operation and data processing
phenomenology of elementary particles
research and development of new detectors
theories of the fundamental interactions
