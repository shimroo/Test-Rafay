“poetry is as necessary to comprehension as science.  it is as impossible to live without reverence as it is without joy. . . touch the earth, love the earth, honour the earth, her plains, her valleys, her hills, and her seas; rest your spirit in her solitary places.  for the gifts of life are the earth's and they are given to all, and they are the songs of birds at daybreak, orion and the bear, and dawn seen over the ocean from the beach.”
quote from “the outermost house” by henry beston
