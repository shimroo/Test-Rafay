salary and satisfaction surveys
mbs has conducted and published an independent annual plastics salary survey for the last 15 years. if you’re a plastics professional, we’d love your input in this years survey! click here: 2025 salary and satisfaction survey
in 2023 and 2024, mbs partnered with the manufacturers association for plastics processors (mapp) to conduct an employee satisfaction survey. the 2024 employee satisfaction survey is included in mapp’s 2024 wage and salary report and is available here for free.
key take-aways: 2024 shows a decrease in employees who are likely to seek a new job in the next 12 months, suggesting more job stability and less job hopping in the coming year. a positive work environment and competitive compensation are the most important factors for job satisfaction. hiring companies, are you focused on creating and maintaining a positive work environment to attract and retain employees?
