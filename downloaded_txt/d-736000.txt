protect your investment from vapor intrusion!
 
liquid boot® is the most extensively used under slab gas vapor membrane we use in the united states.

liquid boot® — gas vapor barrier system
 
 
 


system description
 
liquid boot® is a seamless, spray-applied, water-based membrane containing no vocs, which provides a barrier against vapor intrusion into structures
liquid boot® is installed under slab and on below grade vertical walls as a gas vapor barrier to minimize vapor and nuisance water migration into buildings and is ideal for methane migration control.
liquid boot® spray-application directly to penetrations, footings, grade beams, pile caps, etc., provides for a fully-adhered gas vapor barrier system.
 
 

typical uses
 

z

underslab and below-grade vertical wall gas vapor barrier, used to minimize vapor andnuisance water (non-hydrostatic conditions) migration into buildings.

 
 

z

ideal for methane migration control.

 
 

z

concrete water reservoir and tank liner used to prevent water seepage into concrete.

benefits
 

z

spray application provides excellent sealing of penetrations, eliminating mechanical fastening.

 
 

z

seamless, monolithic membrane eliminates seaming-related membrane failures.

 
 

z

unique formulation provides superior protection from methane gases and water vapor.

 
 

z

fully adhered system reduces risk of gas migration.

liquid boot® — plus gas vapor barrier system
 
 
 


system description
 
the liquid boot® plus system is a combination of the traditional liquid boot® spray-applied membrane and vi-20™, a 20-mil, high performance polyethylene-evoh copolymer membrane.
the system, paired with the geovent™ gas venting system, is designed to provide excellent resistance to contaminants.
the liquid boot® membrane is spray-applied to a uniform substrate, provided by the vi-20™ geomembrane, bonding together to create a highly resistant protection barrier.
once the membrane is fully cured, ultrashield™ non-woven geotexile protection course is installed.
 
 

typical uses
 

z

installed under slab and on below grade vertical walls as a gas vapor barrier to minimizevapor and nuisance water (non-hydrostatic conditions) migration into buildings.

 
 

z

ideal for applications with chlorinated solvents, btex and other pahs.

geovent™ — gas venting system
 
 
 


system description
 
venting systems are typically installed in conjunction with a gas vapor barrier when volatile or explosive gases are present.
geovent™ is a low profile pressure relief, trenchless collection and venting system designed to improve venting efficiency and reduce installation costs. geovent™ has several advantages over trenched installations and can be used as an “active” or “passive” venting system depending on the specific project.
used in conjunction with liquid boot® or coreflex™ gas vapor barrier systems, geovent™ can alleviate the accumulation of gas vapors under the slab.
 
 

typical use
 

z

geovent™ is designed for use as active or passive under-slab venting when used with all cetco gas vapor mitigation systems.

benefits
 

z

installed directly on subgrade eliminating costly trenching and potential interference or damage to existing underground utilities.

 
 

z

placed in closer proximity to the gas vapor barrier allowing for more effective venting of any accumulated gas vapor.

 
 

z

greater opening area per linear foot of pipe and integral filter fabric allowing for higher ventilation efficiency.

 
 

z

installed at a higher elevation reducing susceptibility to inundation from perched groundwater that may accumulate beneath the building foundation.

 
 

z

flow characteristics meet or exceed that of a typical trenched installation. the overall capacity of the system is far in excess of typical gas flux rates.
