about the 

campaign to end portland's cooperation
with the fbi's terrorism task force! (updates sept 2020)


on september 8, 2020, a

new letter demanding that portland

 fully end cooperation with the joint terrorism task force (jttf)
signed by 27 organizaions and two individuals was sent to city council.

on january 4, 2021 pcw and other groups released a 
"people's report" 
on the joint terrorism task force 
suggesting that council reject the bureau's formal report 
unless it answers important questions.
 this follows the november 8, 2017,  letter 
signed by 
23 organizations and a prominent portland area survivor of unwarranted spying 

was presented to portland city council asking to get the portland police 
out of 
the joint terrorism task force (jttf). 

on february 13, 2019 city council voted to pull the two officers out of 
the jttf. 

on may 8, 2019 council adopted the second 
resolution which allows the ppb to work 
with the jttf on cases of terrorism "and/or threats to life including 
hate crimes." 

a 
report  released in january 2020 

indicated the limited
contact with the fbi in 2019 did not revolve around terrorism.

october, 2020:

on october 9, 2020, 16 oregon-based social justice organizations and
three prominent individuals sent a letter 
to governor kate brown 
asking her to end the state's cooperation 
with the fbi's joint terrorism task force.

"union" contract! updated dec. 2020

on december 10, 2020 a 
new

  this followed the 2019 letter to city 
council
