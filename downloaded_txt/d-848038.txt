research in earth and space sciences
the earth and space sciences — geology, geophysics, geobiology and geochemistry — play a critical and unique role in the advancement of knowledge, improvement of the quality of life, and in understanding humanity’s place in the universe. research in earth and space sciences draws on methods and theory from chemistry, physics, biology and computational sciences.
faculty in our department are concerned both with fundamental research and with the dissemination of earth-science knowledge in the service of society.
limited resources, geologic hazards, and related environmental change are among the most serious challenges we face.  we use our expertise to provide the training and education required to address these challenges, and we are engaged in serious efforts to include a more diverse community of scientists, students and stakeholders than in the past.
