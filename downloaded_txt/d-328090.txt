we chose chadd as our sloane realty agent through the internet.  we are very satisfied with chadd's service and we are extremely likely to recommend him.
chadd was very patient with us from the beginning.  he worked with us for over 6 months.  he listened to what we wanted and watched for any properties of interest to come on the market.  he gave us very sound advice when we put in our bids on 2 homes (1 we did not get).  we could not have asked for a better realtor!  we feel we gained a friend with chadd.  we will recommend chadd to friends.

we chose jesse mccrery as our agent because he was recommended to us.
we are very satisfied with jesse's service as it applies to our real estate transaction and we are extremely likely to recommend him to family, friends and colleagues.
i would recommend jesse mccrery because he is communicative, transparent, and isn't trying to sell you something.  i had a great, smooth experience with him.

we are very satisfied with james' service at it applies to our real estate transaction.  we are extremely likely to recommend james to friends and colleagues.  james provided excellent service and very capable and friendly!
