													an interview with our dean, sandra l. wong, md, ms
													









"in our people, i see this great desire to meet our missions, to really be able to provide the best patient care, to be top educators and to continue to push the boundaries of innovation and discovery. the challenge is how do we do all of that? i think we're good for it. i think we have all the right people. we need to put the pieces together and make sure that we continue to grow in the same direction."
