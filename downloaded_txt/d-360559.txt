the carolina brewmasters is a non-profit club whose members enjoy making, tasting, and sharing beer, mead, and cider.
our 100-plus members live in or around the charlotte, nc, metropolitan area and range in experience level from beginner to expert at making great home brews. the club meets at 6:30pm the first wednesday of each month at brewers at 4001 yancey (see map) where we discuss club activities, hold educational presentations, and enjoy a sampling of home-brewed beer (21+).
we also hold monthly brew sessions at differenr members’ houses, which presents opportunities to learn about different methods, systems and gadgets that other home brewers use. cbm members also regularly enter home brew competitions, including our own us open held each summer in charlotte. our 2024 us open will be held from july 23-27!
visitors and those curious about homebrewing are always welcome, and it is free to attend both our monthly meetings and monthly brew sessions.
