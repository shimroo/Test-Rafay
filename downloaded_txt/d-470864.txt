presenting authentic informationabout islamic creed and methodology














the website is still under construction, more content will be available soon.














he is allaah..	the first: nothing is before him.the last: nothing is after him.the most high: nothing is above him.the most near: nothing is beyond his reach.he begets not, nor was he begotten.the creator, provider, and all-rich.the all-seer, the all-knower.he is one and self-sufficient.he is not nature, or any part of it.he ascended above his throne, high above the seven skies.no vision can encompass him, buthis grasp is over all vision... [الأنعام، 102] ( ذَلِكُمُ اللّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَاعْبُدُوهُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَكِيلٌ ) such is allaah, your lord, none has the right to be worshipped but he, the creator of all things. "so worship him (alone), and he is the wakeel (trustee disposer of affairs, guradian, etc.) over all things." [quran, ch. 6, 102; translated meaning] [الشورى: ١١] ( لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ البَصِيرُ )"nothing is like unto him, and he is the all-hearer, the all-seer"[quran, ch. 42, 11; translated meaning]


























welcome to all



basic facts about islam are known only to the few. the objective of this site is to provide beneficial & authentic knowledge regarding islam, its creed, and methodology vis a vis the entire codes of life. this is illustrated by the quranic verse: [الأنعام: ١٦٢] ( قُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ )say: verily, my prayers, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for allaah (the true god), the lord of all that exists. [quran, ch. 6, 162; translated meaning]accordingly, islam is a comprehensive “religion” that describes the way to fulfill the purpose behind our creation. this is to worship none but our creator, allaah: the god of adam, noah, abraham,  moses, jesus, and muhammad, the final and last messenger to all mankind.

















reminders









"if your intention is one of these three, do not seek knowledge: to shame the ignorant, or to argue with the fuqahaa' (scholars), or to cause people to turn their faces in your direction. intend with your actions and words that which is with allaah, for indeed that which is with allaah shall remain and everything else shall perish."

ibn mas'ud –(radiyallaahu 'anhu) – would advise his students





"deeds without sincerity are like a traveler who carries in his water-jug dirt. the carrying of it burdens him and it brings no benefit."

ibnul qayyim –(rahimahullaah)
