even if you have never heard of the name before, you have definitely done calisthenics already. simply put, calisthenics are body-weight training exercises done without any special gym equipment. so if you have ever tried pushups, squats or crunches, then you have already done calisthenics. this article explains why you should consider adding calisthenics to your workouts even if you love lifting weights to build muscles.
they are easy to do
calisthenics don’t require any special equipment or much space to perform. you can do them anywhere and at any time. all you need is a small space to perform a wide range of exercises without having to purchase expensive workout equipment or paying for a gym membership. as such, you can save a lot of time since you don’t need to get to the gym. you can simply take a little bit of your time early in the morning or late in the evening to do calisthenics.
strengthen your body
even with no special workout equipment, calisthenics are excellent exercises for increasing muscle and building strength. in addition, they don’t simply target certain muscle groups, your entire body will always be working to do the exercises. for instance, when doing press-ups, it is not just your chest and arms doing the work, a number of muscles are required and are, hence, being strengthened.
burn fat
doing calisthenics is a great way of burning excess fat. such exercises can be done at high intensity, increasing your heart rate and therefore, increasing the ability to burn fat. moreover, the increased heart rate increases the rate of metabolism, which allows you to burn more calories and more fat even when at rest.
enhances flexibility
performing calisthenics is also a great way of enhancing your flexibility, which also helps to improve your overalls fitness.
variety
spending a long period of time on the cross trainer or treadmill can be quite monotonous after some time. on the other hand, calisthenics gives you many different exercises to try and also different types of those exercises, so you are not likely to get bored of the routine. fed up with squats? you can now try squat jumps, pistol squats or eagle squats.
note that you don’t even need to abandon your regular workout routine to benefit from calisthenics. combining the two can be greatly beneficial, but abandoning calisthenics simply because you are working out with weights would be a loss. you can add some important body-weight exercises to your regular gym exercises and achieve more amazing results. just like tree removal, performing advanced calisthenics is a highly technical task that requires the help of experienced professionals. for professional advice and guidance, you may want to work with calisthenics expert.
