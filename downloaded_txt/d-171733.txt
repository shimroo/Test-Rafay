about sundance marine 



welcome to sundance marine. 







we are a top-ranked boat dealer selling new boats and used boats on the east coast of south florida. sundance marine serves the stuart/jensen beach, pompano beach, miami and surrounding markets.








new boats
sundance marine sells new everglades boats*, regal boats, parker boats, cobalt boats, chris-craft boats, edgewater boats, sportsman boats, and barletta boats.
used boats
sundance marine offers south florida’s largest selection of top-quality used boats for sale. our used boat inventory changes daily, but we commonly have the most popular used boat brands available: sea ray, chaparral, bennington, pursuit, everglades, sea hunt, scout, nautique, as well as used cobalts, regals, crest pontoons, and more.
sundance marine delivers customer satisfaction:
we are consistently recognized as an industry leader in delivering an unparalleled buying and ownership experience. while we could bore you with customer satisfaction awards and accolades, we believe that there’s no better testament to our service after the sale than customer loyalty. more than half of the boats we sell each year are to existing or previous customers. it’s this kind of customer loyalty that fuels our passion and drives us to continue to raise the bar in how we treat our customers. in fact, we don’t view our customers as customers; we consider them part of our family.
