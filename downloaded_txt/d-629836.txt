matt stuart - fantastic street photography





whoa it's become a ghost-town here huh? i've been spending more time on my daily food blog and have practically neglected this one. still trying to decide if i should continue blogging or just leave this as an archive.

while i mull it over, wanted to share some really cool photos i found (thanks to b3ta). matt stuart has a wonderful eye for the quirky and funny in his beautiful and often funny photos. i'm amazed at his timing. these are some of my favourites:

remembering the royal wedding





london is awash in lots of cheesy memorabilia commemorating the wedding of prince william and kate, but today, i bought what i think is the best of the lot.


a paper doll book!


"use the figures of hrh prince william and his bride kate middleton at the centre of this book to decide which social occasion you would like them to attend!"


the now-famous blue issa dress is of course in the book


there's even outfits for walking in the country.


wills and kate "love indulging in a spot of shooting, walking or riding in the countryside".


i love that kate is not wearing a bra, but is conservatively dressed in a camisole, while wills is showing us his fun patriotic side with union jack boxers.


it's important to have the right outfit for every occasion.


very garden-appropriate


"it's a right royal riot!"

the book also has their interpretation of the wedding gown. let's see how accurate it is come 29th april! i almost want to buy another book so i can actually cut out and play with the paper dolls.

flowers flowers flowers





we've been spoilt with beautiful weather for the last 5-6 days, with blue skies, blazing sunshine and temperatures that went into 21 deg. this, coupled with the blossoming of all the trees in spring, just makes me take pictures and pictures of flowers. i love spring. :)

addicted to skiing






13 boarders, 3 skiiers

it's taken 3 years for me to go on a ski trip since moving to the uk, and i can't believe it took that long. a large group of us took off to the dolomites in italy for a quick weekend trip, where we skiied and ate huge amounts of pasta and pizza. having only skiied once about 20 years ago in verbier on a family holiday, i wasn't sure how much i'd remember. turns out it's like driving a car - you don't really forget. all i needed was one refresher lesson on the first morning, and after that, i was good to go. i'm incredibly proud of myself for going up into the mountains and doing the red runs. sure, i tumbled quite a few times, and i was a little scared to go fast, but by the third day, something clicked and i was able to conquer my fear and just let go. my favourite part was high up in the mountains, where the snow was powdery and we descended gradually while being framed on each side by magnificent trees. truly magical. i can't wait for the next trip.

sweet in singapore





it's rather shameful to be posting pictures of my visit back home to singapore 2 months late, but oh well...the last visit, which lasted 3 weeks, was another wonderful visit where i got thoroughly spoilt by family and friends. it felt harder to leave this time, and the feeling of homesickness took a little longer to leave me. luckily there are always the pictures and memories of sweet things back home.


the sweet finish to a decadent high tea at the shangri-la


a pretty setting for cake at barracks in dempsey. sadly the cake didn't live up to my expectations.



tantalising display of pastries at my favourite bakery bread society


i got hooked on gong cha bubble tea. 



sharing desserts at ootoya


my favourite japanese dessert is cream anmitsu. this is from sun with moon at wheelock place.

club monaco spring 2011






club monaco is overpriced, but it doesn't stop me from loving their collections. the spring lookbook has lots to love for a casual but polished daytime look - maxi-skirts, lace, white, a touch of sparkle, undone unfussy hair.
