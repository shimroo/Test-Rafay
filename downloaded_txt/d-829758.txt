for the love of books





reading is my passion.  i have been reading books since i was a little girl and i would read the story by the pictures.  i don't read picture books any more, but my love of literature is still strong.  i read a variety of genres and look forward to sharing my reviews and opinions with you.  let me know if there are any particular books you would like me to review or discuss.
