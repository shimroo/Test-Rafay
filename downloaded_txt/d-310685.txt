i try to document each guitar i build with a youtube video. check out the videos.


please note: all zachary guitars are hand made, meaning that every operation and tool is guided by the human hand.

no cnc (computer numerically controlled) programmed machinery is used here.

each zachary guitar is made by hand, one at a time by the same builder, alex csiky.

if you are looking for a cnc made guitar, you will have no problem finding it but not here.

currently almost all guitars are made by robotics with as little human involvement as is possible, with ever-diminishing hand work.

cnc is not only utilized by large factories but also one man amateur shops and everything in between.

such is the state of the guitar industry as it heads toward total trans-humanism.

the best guitars... you will ever play
making guitars by hand, one at a time. something very rare these days of mass production through robotics. 
this is not a money-making enterprise but a passion for creativity. 
selling guitars should be emotionally very difficult, as it is for me.

it would be a fantastic experience knowing nothing about the instrument beforehand, other than who is making it and what kind of work to expect, and having it show up and being surprised.

art is a collaboration between god and the artist, and the less the artist does, the better.

all i can say is you just earned a lifetime customer! truly stunning guitar. on every tour i have two on hand, they are solid, well built and can handle abuse.
