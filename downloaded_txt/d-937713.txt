homebankruptcy attorneys dallas tx
effective september 5, 2024, i am not taking new bankruptcy cases.  i am available for hourly consultation or for matters that can definitely be resolved and concluded by year’s end.  it has been a long 50+ year career in bankruptcy and it is time to pass the torch to the younger generation.  i thank all of my prior clients for allowing me the opportunity to represent them and for all that i have learned from them.
hi. i am herman a. lusky.  i founded lusky & associates, p.c. in 1980 as a boutique bankruptcy law firm serving clients in the dallas, fort worth, plano, and north texas areas.  it has been continuously serving clients ever since.
lusky & associates, p.c. is a small firm taking a select number of bankruptcy cases.  we use the latest technology to produce the best results for our clients.  we are not a “mass producer” of bankruptcy cases.  by being small and more selective, we are able to “hand craft” each case to meet the client’s needs.  all clients have direct contact with me.  we do not assign clients numbers – they are known by their names.
the firm takes pride in delivering personalized service to its clients. it is not the largest filer in the area — doesn’t want to be. it uses the latest technology so that it can offer the best personalized service at a competitive cost. all clients deal directly with me. when you call, the call is likely to be answered directly by me.
although lusky & associates, p.c. is a small firm, having been in the business for many years, we are able to network with other attorneys and professionals with proven abilities to assist clients in different and more complex matters.
benefits of hiring a bankruptcy attorney lawyer
if you are feeling overwhelmed by your financial situation, then you may want to consider filing for chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy. filing for bankruptcy can provide you with the relief and time that you need to get back on your feet and to begin feeling at ease in life once again. a dallas, tx bankruptcy attorney can help you begin the process of gathering paperwork, scheduling necessary meetings with creditors and filing the appropriate documents with the court for your bankruptcy case.
debtors find that they often feel a sense of calm after filing for bankruptcy. under a chapter 7 bankruptcy, debtors are no longer required to repay a majority of their debts. in addition, one can still enjoy ownership of certain forms of property. texas law offers more exemptions for debtors in comparison with most other states. filing for bankruptcy in texas can be a very smart option for people who are financially strapped for cash and unable to meet their monthly obligations.  in the beginning stages of a bankruptcy filing, a bankruptcy attorney will help you figure out which types of property are included in the bankruptcy estate. the bankruptcy estate is the total sum of assets that will be used to repay creditors. a trustee is in charge of distributing the assets contained in the bankruptcy estate. the trustee is a neutral, third-party in your case.
texas offers several classes of exemptions that debtors can benefit from in their bankruptcy case. as a leading dallas bankruptcy service provider we will be able to analyze your property holdings and figure out which assets fall under the classes of exemptions in texas. a single person is able to keep certain property that has a value of up to $50,000. a family is able to keep property that has a value of up to $100,000. certain tools and equipment that are used in one’s profession may be totally exempt from a bankruptcy filing. any equipment that is used for farming purposes is exempt from a bankruptcy estate. under texas law, a homestead, certain insurance, and certain retirement plans are unlimited in value.
other notable exemptions include a motor vehicle for each member of the family, a limited number of farm animals and wages for personal services. clothing is also totally exempt in the state of texas. these exemptions are liberal in comparison with other states that allow only a small amount of the value of one’s wardrobe, professional equipment and motor vehicle to be exempt from the bankruptcy estate.
there are also “bankruptcy exemptions.” in texas, you can choose one or the other, but not both. while the texas exemptions are very generous, in certain cases, it may be better to claim the bankruptcy exemptions. a good texas bankruptcy lawyer will be able to assist you in choosing the exemptions that are best for you. a good texas bankruptcy attorney will assist you in maximizing what you are able to keep.
by hiring the best dallas bankruptcy attorney you can rest assured as you will be in good hands. rather than dealing with the stress of bankruptcy by filing alone, our bankruptcy lawyers will provide you support during the time when you need it most. we will attend all meetings, such as the 341 meeting, with you. you will not have to worry about being left to deal with difficult creditors as our experienced bankruptcy attorneys will be your advocate at all times.
