the savoy hotel in florence occupies the perfect position: mid-way between the duomo and the piazza vecchia, on the corner of the piazza della repubblica. i had the pleasure of meeting sir rocco forte on this visit, and i know that his hotels always have magnificent locations. and there can be none better than this. in a handsome late 19th century building in the classical style and surrounded by shops for the beautiful people, the savoy is itself a temple of contemporary elegance - full of works of contemporary art, including paintings by luca pignatelli. but, as is the way with sir roccoâs establishments, its modernity is of the comfortable and welcoming kind and there is a sense throughout that all is of the highest quality. it also boasts a very good chef.
