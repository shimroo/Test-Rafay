how are we different?
here at florida real estate learning center, we have one goal in mind, helping you pass the state exam the first time.
we have many ways of accomplishing this, but our primary method is by compiling feedback from previous students that have taken the state exam.  we never ask students for questions that were on their exam, but rather, was there anything on their exam that we did not cover in our highlights.  this keeps us very focussed and up to date on what you need to know.
we also have many test taking strategies that work exceptionally well on this exam.  these methods and strategies have helped us keep a high percentage of first time passers.
feel free to contact us with any questions you may have.

5 reasons that real estate might be the career for you
 
have you ever wondered about getting in to the real estate business, but were nervous about taking the first step.  maybe you talked to a few people that had been in the business at one time, but didn’t have too much success.  well the fact is, you really can’t rely on other peoples opinions and experiences to determine what’s right for you.  sure your mom or dad may have been pretty good at telling you what’s best, or maybe not, but only you know when something is right you.
 
some of the most unlikely people have become incredibly successful in the real estate business.  i have seen numerous professionals put aside their college degrees to participate in the real estate industry, which turned out to be more financially rewarding for them.  the good news is, it doesn’t take a lot of time or money to find out if it’s right for you.  the financial and time investment in getting in the business is minimal compared to most other industries.  another important factor is that a florida real estate license allows you to be involved in dozens of different niches and specialties.  there is certainly one that fits you just right.
 
but if your still not sure, here are 5 signs that real estate might be the career for you.
 
1.  do you love being around homes, new and old, designing and decorating perhaps?
2.  do you enjoy being in charge and control of your business dealings?
3.  do you enjoy setting your own schedules and not missing out on family functions?
4.  do you enjoy working with people and making them happy?
5.  would you like a career with unlimited potential?
 
if most of these things apply to you, then real estate could very well be the career for you.
