eric stone founded hollywood actors studio in los angeles in 1989.
"a sheer passion for artistic expression and freeing the "artist within" is what has motivated me to this day. the foundation of this approach is the privilege of having worked with extraordinary actors and directors: herbert berghof, uta hagen, lee strasberg, stella adler, meisner, michael chekhov..."

"michael checkhov's breakthrough work in freeing the actor through imagination has greatly influenced me and continues to amaze me." eric stone

testimonials & success stories














katherine gamble
professional actor, la


"i have taken all kinds of acting classes throughout my life, including a semester at stella adler's and intensive workshop in london. in two days of working with eric, i understood, for the first time,what an acting technique should look like. and how to use it. i feel as though i've been shown the secret of success, and i can't wait to apply it. if you're serious about acting, it's definitely worth the money. i've found my acting coach!!"

 "great coach! seasoned professional who can spot issues quickly. he provides more than you could learn from a book about public speaking. he stresses the fundamentals while at the same time getting you out of your comfort zone...which is a good thing! eric has a unique way of delivering advice. he really has a knack of understanding his students needs. thought provoking exercises that help you get to another level.

miles davis said that "music is the space between the notes", then the music of your personal success is the space between your everyday behaviors, your moods & attitudes.










the art of speaking is the art of pausing.

every verbal attempt has a rhythm and a tempo, very much like music does.
beyond presence and talent, good speaking is viewed as a verbal art form. elocution, diction, projection and modulation, to only name a few elements, are believed to be the obvious and essential ingredients to a good presentation or performance. so much more goes into good speaking, but it is important to try to pierce the myth of verbal life.

is people-pleasing contagious?

feb 19, 2021
  terry c.

how many times did you say iâm sorry today? in matters of social and professional interactions, over-pleasing can feel like an addictionâ¦audience pleasing, apologising and patronising are very easy traps to fall into when interacting socially, speaking in front of groups or while communicating with people professionally.  so is the need to cater needlessly thinking that being soft spoken is the key to win hearts.
have you ever realised how many times you hear âiâm sorryâ in a day? put it to the test, itâs mind blowing. on the surface, these habits can appear as legitimate forms of expression or harmless ways to handle people. on the contrary, they are powerful enemies and should be avoided at all cost.

do you really know what roles you are playing lately?

and how these roles impact and influence everyone around you? being aware requires time and patience in order to see what is really going on.

subtle or grossly obvious to others or not, the action paths we take are often embedded in our subconscious. after all, being aware requires time and patience in order to see what is really going on. thatâs true for everything like politics, parenting, career, self-acceptance, confidence, etc.
however, we are human beings in a clearly human and extremely fragile world. it means we are all evaluated, scrutinised, and interpreted based on how we present and conduct ourselves in private, professional, public and social circles alike. i like to call it role-playing because admittedly or not, we are always playing a role.
