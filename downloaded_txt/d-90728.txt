what we fight for







our priorities
we don’t see single causes; we see connected movements. the fight for digital privacy is key to protecting abortion access, just as reining in over-policing helps dismantle systemic racism in schools. 
yet our work can be understood through four main themes:




streng­thening democracy







promoting equality







pursuing justice







protecting privacy & autonomy
