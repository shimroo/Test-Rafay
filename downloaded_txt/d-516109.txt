prayer and praise


please pray
it can be difficult to see where god is at work in north korea. pray that he will give christians (inside and outside the country) eyes to see his light in the midst of the darkness.


give thanks
thank god for our safe house ministry in china where north koreans can meet jesus and be strengthened to take the gospel back to their country.
