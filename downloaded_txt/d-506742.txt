a wordfrom our president













welcome and thank you for visiting our fapa website!as president of the florida association of property appraisers (fapa), i am honored to welcome you to our official website. fapa is comprised of constitutionally elected property appraisers from across the state of florida, representing over 80% of the total taxable real estate value and population in our state. our association plays a vital role in working with the florida legislature to support property tax policies that benefit all floridians.our members meet regularly to monitor legislative developments, share expertise with lawmakers, and collaborate with other agencies on critical issues affecting property taxation and valuation. this collective effort has led to meaningful legislative victories. in 2024, fapa helped pass a law that protects the confidentiality of personal information submitted to the clerk of the court and the property appraiser’s office when registering for a recording notification service. in past legislative sessions, we spearheaded the expansion of the total and permanently disabled first responder exemption to include federal law enforcement members and the surviving spouses of the first responders employed by the us government. additionally, fapa helped create and pass legislation making it easier for totally and permanently disabled veterans to receive a refund on property taxes paid for a newly acquired homesteaded property.fapa remains committed to advocating for fair and efficient property tax policies on behalf of the residents we serve. i encourage you to explore our website, learn more about our work, and stay informed about issues that impact property owners across florida.sincerely,ayesha solomonpresident
