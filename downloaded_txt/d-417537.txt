contractor tips - shape govt solicitations and win contract awards with pre-award communications and protests
in federal procurements, the solicitation is the rule book. before you submit your bid or proposal, however, you have a limited opportunity to shape the rules to increase your likelihood of receiving award. through pre-proposal questions and other communications, you can improve the solicitation to enhance your chances of receiving award. if the solicitation precludes you from providing your most competitive proposal, you can also consider a pre-award protest at the agency, gao, or court of federal claims. 

this webinar will address what communications are permitted before the bid or proposal due date and how to effectively use this opportunity and potential protest options at the agency, gao, or court of federal claims. based on extensive practical experience and recent caselaw, this webinar will provide guidance to help contractors successfully navigate the pre-proposal process. 

learning objectives: by the end of this webinar, attendees will be able to recognize unique features of the federal government pre-award process, including the scope of allowed communications, addressing potential past performance issues, organizational conflicts of interest, and other requirements in advance of proposal submission, and, the process for pre- award protests. the webinar will include discussion of lessons learned from years of experience representing clients in these areas.

pricing, sourcing, socio-economic issues, and workshare - session 3 - subcontracting for primes and subs series 2025
successful federal procurement subcontracting - prime and subs webinar series - 2025
title: pricing, sourcing, socio-economic issues, and workshare - can't we just be friends? (session 3 of subcontracting for primes and subs series 2025)

in federal government contracting, government customers are required to purchase their requirements at a "fair and reasonable price". this requirement imposes obligations on u.s. government prime contractors to seek and obtain products, services, research and development, and other deliverables from subcontractors at "reasonable" prices while simultaneously complying with numerous legally and regulatorily mandated socio-economic objectives, such as by subcontracting with small businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran owned businesses, hub-zone businesses, etc.; by paying federally mandated wage rates; by purchasing products satisfying "buy american" and "specialty metals" requirements; and more. these requirements increase costs, complicate performance, and increase immensely the difficulty of dealing with u.s. government customers and their associated prime contractors. this session will explore unique requirements associated with selling to the u.s. government and purchasing from associated prime and subcontractors.

learning objectives: this session will identify and explore challenges associated with the solicitation and award of u.s. government prime contracts and their associated subcontracts.

learning objectives: by the end of this session, students will be able to:
	identify the unique issues resident in procuring artificial intelligence
	areas of negotiation the federal government should consider when purchasing artificial intelligence
	cybersecurity and privacy issues that are areas of particular concern for federal agencies

formation, performance, and disputes - session 4 - subcontracting for primes and subs series 2025
successful federal procurement subcontracting - prime and subs webinar series - 2025
title: formation, performance, and disputes - so i should have read the contract before signing it? (session 4 of subcontracting for primes and subs series 2025)

once a u.s. government contract is awarded and the prime contractor has identified subcontractors who can support the prime contractor's requirements, the fun begins. now the prime must work to satisfy its government customer while managing its subcontractors to ensure their efforts support the prime contractor's efforts to satisfy its customer. meanwhile, subcontractors must find a way to perform in such manner as to satisfy their customer(s), make a profit, and operate a successful business. this leads to challenges relating to inspection, acceptance and warranty; subcontract payments; changes; disputes; terminations; and more. this session will explore important performance issues and address some of the significant considerations and concerns of all three contracting parties (i.e., u.s. government, prime contractor, and subcontractor).

learning objectives: this session will assist participants in anticipating contract performance issues and risks, mitigating those risks, and achieving successful performance.

i liked how the instructor could relate stories from experience to the topics he discussed. it helped with the clarification of the material he presented. he is very good at "teaching." i would recommend this class.
—jill, senior contract manager











the instructor was phenomenal. great instruction amplified by relevant and varied experience, and he was engaging. would definitely like to take a course with fps again. 
—hope, director of contracts











federal publications offerings are some of the best i have ever attended. i attended my first in dc, the basics of government contracting, back in the early 1990s.  fond memories!
