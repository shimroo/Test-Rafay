florida master naturalist program
















what is the florida master naturalist program? 
the florida master naturalist program (fmnp) is an adult education program developed by the university of florida and provided by participating organizations. fmnp training will benefit any persons interested in learning more about florida’s environment, seeking educational contact hours, or wishing to increase their knowledge for use in education programs as volunteers, employees, ecotourism guides, and others. 
our mission
the mission of the florida master naturalist program (fmnp) is to promote awareness, understanding, and respect of florida's natural world among florida's citizens and visitors.  the fmnp teaches those who teach others about florida's unique ecosystems and wildlife. fmnp instructors teach participants about florida's environment using science-based information and interpretive techniques that prepare participants to share their knowledge with others.  in turn, fmnp graduates share their knowledge and foster principles of sustainability, connectivity, and biodiversity to assist others to understand and respect florida's natural world as a community to which we all belong. 
who should participate? 

any adult (18 years of age or older) interested in learning more about florida’s unique natural history
volunteers and employees at parks, nature centers, museums, historical sites, and any facility or organization that provides environmental education programs
ecotour guides and natural resource professionals who wish to enhance their knowledge or programs
teachers and professionals who wish to acquire educational contact hours for continuing education

donate to the florida master naturalist program
we are building a legacy of informed citizens to promote awareness, understanding, and respect of florida's natural ecosystems. please consider helping us keep registration costs down by contributing to our operations funds. also, to ensure we continue inspiring conservation education and action for decades to come, we are attempting to raise a $2 million endowment to ensure the fmnp has financial support for an fmnp program leader in perpetuity. please watch a short video message from dr. main. contact dr. main at mmain@ufl.edu to discuss options for a major gift.
thank you for your ongoing actions to help conserve florida’s environment for future generations to enjoy!
