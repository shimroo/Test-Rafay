about our beerswe are truly enjoying our newest adventure: brewing. opened in 2010, our brewery boasts eight styles of handcrafted beers as well as seasonal batches. in addition, we are in the process of bottling a number of our beers that are currently only available for purchase at the brewery and will soon be available throughout southern illinois.we began making hard cider at the beginning of 2012 and released our first batch in the summer of that same year. paul jacobs, owner of von jakob and maker of the hard cider states, “it has been something we’ve wanted to do for a while. we have the apple orchards, we have the equipment, we already have a jonathan apple wine; so it just made sense.”offering a variety of styles of illinois beer ranging from our crisp, clean, lightly-hopped german pilsner to our rich, dark stout, you are sure to find a beer that delights your palate. or, if you are having trouble choosing just one, we offer flights so you can taste them all. prost!on location pricing1oz 15 cal $2.00 16oz draft 230 cal $5.00 64oz growler refill 910 cal $16.00 32oz crowler 460 cal $10.00 von jakob beers are currently only available on location and in various retails locations (please call ahead).download our beer list.
