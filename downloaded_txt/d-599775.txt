about engineers’ council 



in 1955, just before the dawn of the space age, the engineers’ council was founded (originally san fernando valley engineers’ council) as a mutual benefit society through the joint efforts of the california society of professional engineers, the american institute of plant engineers, the society of manufacturing engineers and the institute of electrical and electronics engineers.the mission was, as it still is today, to 1) advance the art and science of engineering for the general welfare of humankind, 2) advance the welfare of the general public through the creative resources and abilities of the engineering professions, 3) inform the general public of the advantages and capabilities of engineering in advancing human welfare, and 4) provide suitable public recognition of engineering achievement through the coordinated efforts of academia, private sector companies, government agencies, individuals, and technical society affiliates.
