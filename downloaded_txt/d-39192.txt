legalethics.com transition
july 17, 2017 in legalethics.com by peter

i started publishing legalethics.com in 1995. i  transitioned the content from legalethics,com to a new blog called lopisder. lopsider is focused on legal operations, innovation & disruption. you can read more about why i am transitioning to the new website here. all legalethics.com content has been copied to lopsider. i will continue to post occasionally about ethics on that site. the new format should make it easy to locate content. thank you for your interest and support.
