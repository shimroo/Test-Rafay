  on november 10, 2022 doggie central will be moving to our new location in west la!

doggie central has been part of our community for 24 years. in 2015, rigo and holly took over and created an inviting, safe and loving second home for your pet family members. we hope to continue caring for your four-legged companions for years to come in our new upgraded facility.

our new address is:

1901 pontius avenue
los angeles, 90025

due to size restrictions in our new facility, we regretfully will have to close our swimming services. 

we also plan to start a pickup service for our client’s convenience in the very near future.
 

we look forward to continuing to care for your pets.

rigo & holly medrano
