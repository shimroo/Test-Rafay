 we envision a world in which all children thrive in safe, equitable, and nurturing communities. but for many children, maltreatment and trauma deprive them of this most basic promise of childhood. nwcf serves as a community leader and convener in addressing the impacts of childhood trauma and building a brighter future for all children.
