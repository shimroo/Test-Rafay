dhana kāraka one feb 2017: pt. sanjay rath
saturday, 18 feb 2017: sun and moon
sūrya is the controller of rajas guṇa. we learn about sūrya kendra and the position of the four digpāla, especially kubera the controller of wealth in the horoscope. we get to see why some people are truly blessed and have a greater access to wealth resources due to the blessing of kubera.

śrī jagannāth center announces its first workshop in the study of dhana yoga. this workshop shall lay the foundation for the study of wealth and career directions. there are three pivots to the study of life and these are the three charts – lagna, sūrya and chandra chakra. the role played by each of these charts is to be examined in the first day of this two-day workshop. on the second day, we examine the role of devaguru bṛhaspati as the kāraka.
