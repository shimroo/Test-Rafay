great place in del mar/solana beach!
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
               this is really a nice place - especially for an extended stay. very pleasant people at all times at the front desk - smiling and willing to help. easy parking close to the building. two restaurants share the same parking lot - but far enough away that it's not a problem i had a one bedroom unit - full kitchen with stove, microwave and refrigerator. two bathrooms - one in the living room area - and one in the separate bedroom. very nice facilities and very quiet at night. loved my stay!

nice quiet place to stay
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
               my husband and i were very pleased with this hotel. it is so nice to have a working kitchen with a stove, refrig, microwave, dishwasher, toaster and coffee pot. we had a studio which was sufficient. the bathroom was small but the shower was nice with sliding doors. i just wish it also had a handheld spray. my son and his family had the one bedroom unit. it had a nice kitchen area with a table for four. the tv had a bright picture. it was very convenient to have two bathrooms and the king bed was a plus. the bedroom was large and fit a full sized crib. the sofa in the living room was comfortable but they didn't try the sofa bed. although the hotel is older, the suites are very clean and housekeeping is extremely accommodating! love the starbucks coffee! i will absolutely stay here again.

great place to relax and enjoy southern california
 rating: 5 out of 5 stars
               my daughter, her husband, baby and i spent our first 'family vacation' here. it was so nice. they had a great 1 br unit complete with pack and play crib. we spent time in the hot tub, pool, and walking to the great delmar beach. 

thank you so much for a wonderful time with family.
