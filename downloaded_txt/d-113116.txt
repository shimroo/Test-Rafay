who's j.w.m.?
john warwick montgomery (ph.d., chicago, d.theol., strasbourg, ll.d., cardiff, dr. [h.c.], institute for religion and law, moscow) is emeritus professor of law and humanities, university of bedfordshire, england; professor-at-large, 1517, irvine, ca, u.s.a. (1517.org); and director, international academy of apologetics, evangelism & human rights, strasbourg, france. his legal speciality is the international and comparative law of human rights and he regularly pleads religious freedom cases before the european court of human rights. he is a u.s. u.k., and french citizen, the author of some sixty books in five languages, and is included in who's who in america, who's who in france, the european biographical directory, who's who in the world, and contemporary authors.
john warwick montgomery is considered by many to be the foremost living apologist for biblical christianity. a renaissance scholar with a flair for controversy, he lives in france, england and the united states. his international activities have brought him into personal contact with some of the most exciting events of our time: not only was he in china in june 1989, but he was in fiji during its 1987 bloodless revolution, was involved in assisting east germans to escape during the time of the berlin wall, and was in paris during the 'days of may' 1968. dr. montgomery is the author of more than forty books in five languages. he holds ten earned degrees, including a master of philosophy in law from the university of essex, england, a ph.d. from the university of chicago, and a doctorate of the university in protestant theology from the university of strasbourg, france, and the higher doctorate in law (ll.d.) from the university of cardiff, wales. he is an ordained lutheran clergyman, an english barrister, and is admitted to practise as a lawyer before the supreme court of the united states and inscrit au barreau de paris, france. he obtained acquittals for the 'athens 3' missionaries on charges of proselytism at the greek court of appeals in 1986 and won the leading religious liberty cases of larissis v. greece and bessarabian orthodox church v. moldova before the european court of human rights.
to use c. s. lewis's words, john warwick montgomery was brought over the threshold of christian faith "kicking and struggling." the year was 1949. the place, cornell university, ithaca, new york. herman john eckelmann, a persistent engineering student succeeded in goading montgomery into religious discussions. montgomery, a philosophy major disinterested in religion, found himself forced to consider seriously the claims of jesus christ in the new testament in order to preserve big intellectual integrity. after no mean struggle he acknowledged his rebellion against god and asked his forgiveness. dr. montgomery is the author of over one hundred scholarly journal articles and more than fifty books in english, french, spanish, and german. he is internationally regarded both as a theologian (his debates with the late bishop james pike, death-of-god advocate thomas altizer, and situation-ethicist joseph fletcher are historic) and as a lawyer (barrister-at-law of the middle temple and lincoln's inn, england; member of the california, virginia, washington state, and district of columbia bars and the bar of the supreme court of the united states).
