doctorate for shilpa shetty !!





ha ha! fu#$@#@ crap man! it's sad...i dunno my emotions right now so excuse me!she gets a doctorate for "immense contribution to cultural diversity" by appearing on big brother.. a crappy show where a bit of cleavage along with some tears gets the bimbo a doctorate from leeds university !!! for that reason, mallika should be offered bharat ratna for uniting all men across all classes for ogling at her.can someone define achievement please!!now someone would point out i am jealous...yes u fu..moron i am! coz this type of incident undermines our efforts and achievements...purely my perception...now your benchmark is shilpa shetty...holy cow that statement gives me the creeps....

hum honge kamyaab [backward] ek din...





man main hai vishwaas pura hai vishwaas hum honge kamyaab [peechde/backward] ek din....nehru appointed a minister to identify people who could be termed as st. the minister identifies the bhil-meenas and not all the meenas across the state, correctly. but some officer in delhi feels the hyphen is a mistake and replaces with comma, and presto!! all the meenas are now st along with all the bhils...the best part is this is a known fact as per the leading newspaper of the country and no one is bothered to correct it..this can happen only in india...

the path to 9/11 - review





watched on weekend, this fantastic series....================================plot outline: a television mini-series on the events leading up to the us terrorist attacks on september 11, 2001.review from imdb....as someone who finds most television incredibly boring, i have to say i was completely gripped by this mini-series, perhaps because it was so unlike what you normally get on the tube. i loved the gritty film-making style, and i thought the casting and performances were great. david l. cunningham is not a well known name right now, but that should change after this mini-series. too bad he'll probably go on to direct features, because we could use more guys like him on the small screen.in terms of all the political flak this series has attracted, i can't see what all the fuss is about. yeah, the show throws a few barbs clinton's way, but every show has some point of view. if the democrats don't like it, they can always respond to the truth as they see it.congrats to abc on having the guts to show this in spite of all the threats and criticism they received.

vhp and goondaism..





vhp has again done it. by attacking civilians, praying in a church for a sunday mass, it has again proved that it's menace needs to be curbed by the government.it has to be banned like simi and prevent the secular fabric of this country from being attacked further.this is also an attempt to provoke the sonia led government into taking action, so that the vhp can highlight sonia's "religious bias" and unworthiness of being called a indian.if vhp wants votes, they should have targeted those responsible for the nithari and khairlanji killings, atleast for once they would have been appreciated.they are under the impression that they can again play the trumpet of hinduism, but unfortunately such actions will never be accepted by the majority of hindus in this country.

guru by the guru...





saw guru yesterday at cinemax, andheri. maniratnam has made a compromise at last to get himself a hit at the hindi box office. but i am not complaining.i wouldn't be surprised if the movie does the same for dhirubhai ambani, that lage raho did for gandhi.infact there's a dialogue that implies that after nehru and gandhi, there's dhirubhai!!abhishek is in top notch form. ash too. but the best performance comes from our very own mithunda,he is amazing as manik dasgupta [read ramnath goenka], amazing enough for me to want to catch up the movie second time.rahman's music is awesome, specially the background track that chants the name guru. but the yammo song was unnecessary, but i guess mani wanted it to be a real hindi film. the direction reveals that even genuises crave for acknowledgment and acceptance.as an elderly dhirubhai [see? even though the name is gurukanth desai..no one can escapethe similarities], abhishek has surprisingly managed very well.i am sure dhirubhai would have approved, as the movie is surefire hit.a movie on dhirubhai and loss?? no way.catch it now at your neigbouring theatre.
