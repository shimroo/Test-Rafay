          “it's rare to find a leader who is as caring about their team as scott. he helped me transition from corporate life into a remote first role by ensuring there was time both to get to know each other outside of focusing on business. he supported me by finding areas i could challenge myself to learn more, while also ensuring i was aligned with the objectives of the organization. 

what stood out to me most was when i was hit by covid-19 and taken out of work for nearly a month. even though i was not online he still made a point to check in with me every day, see how i was doing, and made sure i knew i could reach out if i needed anything. he would have happily driven across state if i needed, proving just how much he cares about those on his team. 

i consider myself lucky to have worked with him during my time at aha!”
