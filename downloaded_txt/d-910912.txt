karney, already a vibrant part of the bay area's
				alternative rock scene, is branching out to fans
				throughout the west coast and other parts of the
				country through web casts, print and radio coverage as
				well as frequent touring. collaboration is essential
				to karney's recordings; before she released her first
				solo recordings she worked with artists such as linda
				perry of 4 non-blonds, george clinton, almo recording
				artist angel corpus christi, and eric mcfadden as well
				as san francisco bands and cabaret singers including
				mother lode, crocodile tears, musty chiffon, alcohol
				of fame, elvis herselvis, patsy cline and the memphis
				g-spots and many more.
