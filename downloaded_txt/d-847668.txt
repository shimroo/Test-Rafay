papa luigi`s vic, making dreams come true!

yes, dreams really do come true for one local team. not only did they win the league and receive a wonderful trophy, but dreams fc were invited to local photography studio - studio one. our good friend daral brenan who runs studio one held a professional photo shoot to celebrate their stunning accomplishment and we thought we’d send our very own vic curry down and treat the lads to their favourite pizzas.
the shoot was organised by brett phillips, the son of dave phillips who was one of papa luigi’s very first delivery drivers. amazingly, brett has been a loyal customer ordering pizzas since 1983 when papa luigi first launched. the lads loved their pizzas and enjoyed being models for the day, most of them are already regulars and those who weren’t said they would be ordering again!!
well done vic and all our papa luigi shops that are continually interacting with their communities in milton keynes, huntingdon and peterborough.
