welcomewe are a small show kennel with our emphasis being on sound, healthy and happy bichons and löwchen. we invite you to visit our website to see our lovely bichons and löwchen past and present. we are dedicated to the bichon frise and löwchen breeds. we show our dogs in conformation with the akc to “proof out” our breeding program, always breeding to the standard, and to better and advance the breed.  our emphasis has always been on temperament #1 and producing sound, happy, healthy puppies.  we are a proud breeder of merit with the american kennel club in both our chosen breeds, the bichon frise and the löwchen.located on over 6 acres in rural georgia, our dogs enjoy the “southern life” with plenty of room to play and train.  our puppies have multiple areas to play with their toys, each other, and make use of the mini agility equipment.we hope our site will be a source of information and enjoyment to you now and in the future.  come back and visit us often as we continue to update and improve our site and provide you with continuing information on our dogs and the breeds in general.  please do not hesitate to contact us for information concerning planned breedings and available puppies.donna jonesmusicbox
