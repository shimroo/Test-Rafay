the only purpose of breeding is to have puppies!
using this simple system, in one hundred and seven breedings, we have a 93% conception rate, and larger than normal litter sizes. all were vaginal a. i.'s using fresh and frozen semen. how much are puppies worth to you? 



if you want puppies...

never...
breed a bitch on her 13th day just because you think it is her 13th day

 never...
breed naturally just because you think it is easier or because you think you have a better chance

 never...
breed to a stud dog if the quality of his semen is unknown

 never...
waste time and money on transportation unless you believe you will get pups




now you can...

 take out the guessing
know the correct day to breed. eliminate reproductive infections. know the quality of the semen. save time and money. have a 90% chance of having puppies.

 4 steps to breeding success
we use this simple four step method on our farm to eliminate the most probable causes of a missed conception.

 our semen preservation system
the camelot semen preseravtion system has proven to have the highest conception rates, the largest average litter sizes, and is used by more veterinarians and professional breeders than any other system of freezing canine semen in the world.
