dear friends,
            i truly believe if you treat people right, 
            they'll come back to you. i would never take advantage of anyone. 
            i make sure that i keep my clients best interest at heart. we often 
            poke fun at "the golden rule", but it still works today. 
            i am family oriented and realize the strain of selling and buying 
            the family residence. i work hard to ease the transition by helping 
            the children get through the move, find their new school, and help 
            them make new friends. i've lived here all my life and i know a lot 
            about the neighborhoods and how many children live in the area. i 
            can also provide you with any information you need.
