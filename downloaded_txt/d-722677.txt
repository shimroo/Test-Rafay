majestic transformers – uk transformer manufacturer
majestic transformer company was established in 1942, emerging as a dedicated transformer specialist from a group of people doing repairs and service replacements for a wide range of radios, amplifiers and other domestic electrical equipment. from these humble beginnings, we have recently celebrated our 80th anniversary and are still going from strength to strength.
starting out life as a rewinding house for service replacements we have transformed over the years into a leading manufacturer of new electrical transformers, chokes and associated power supplies, custom built to specification. so if you are looking a simple isolation transformer or want a more complex unit then give us a call or drop us an email.
