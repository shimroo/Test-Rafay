operational gage totals


            dupage county stormwater management uses the united states geological survey (usgs) stream and rain gages, as well as a local stream gages. the stream gages show real-time observations of stream height and discharge. usgs compiles these measurements hourly. the rain gages provide information about precipitation totals in the last week.
        

            the following table lists the five larger mechanically operated flood control facilities in dupage county, as well as real-time stream gage heights for the gages involved in those facilities predetermined operating plan. as needed during rain events, staff controls the flood control facilities when river elevations near operating level, or the trigger elevation.
        


                please note, some gages may be reporting incorrect values. staff is monitoring the real current elevations of each stream. the best way to view real-time elevation data is through the cameras page.
