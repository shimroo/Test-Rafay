welcome to the official website of the
uss constellation (cva/cv 64) association

our organization is dedicated to one of
            the greatest warships to ever serve in the united states navy. the aircraft carrier,
            constellation, served gallantly throughout four decades to protect our national
            security and interests abroad while maintaining free passage through the pacific and
            indian oceans in military conflicts from southeast asia to the middle east. 
            our association exists to honor the sailors, marines and the families of those that
            served aboard and to educate, promote awareness and maintain the history of "america's flagship."
