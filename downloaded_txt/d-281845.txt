so i just watched masoom (the shekhar kapur movie.) it was of course awesome.sadly the video quality on the dvd transfer left something to be desired. t-series deserves some brickbats. and no subtitles! terrible.mr. kapur, your art needs a wider audience. and better dvds.

wow that's a long long time between  posts.well, i figure i should start this one slow and easy. with topics that are in my comfort zone like books.i'm currently reading genome: the autobiography of a species in 23 chapters by matt ridley. and shantaram: a novel by gregory david roberts. i'm on chapter one of both books so i'm not sure i can comment with any authority. genome is written in matt ridley's usual easy to understand and yet gripping style (see the red queen.) shantaram is an interesting beast. the descriptions of mumbai are familiar and nostalgic (especially when he reaches colaba. i lived there for quite a while,) but his prose is slightly flowery so the book might start to feel heavy in my hands soon. (it is a heavy book. 994 pages!) interesting both books also have subtitles. i've never quite understood subtitling. must be a publisher driven trend.in vacation news, i've been traveling all over the place. let's write about the involuntary vacations first. a trip to menominee that involved some driving, some bad driver/dongle issues and an almost-bought pasty from schloegels. this was followed by two consecutive trips to philadelphia. both involved 12 hour work days and mysterious driver problems. (stupid multicore processors and stupider driver developers who can't handle multi-threaded programming.)the voluntary vacations were many but all restricted to wisconsin. there was a trip to wisconsin dells and lake delton. this involved time spent at the mt. olympus water park, a drive-in theater, sushi and four missed exits on the way back home! (four!) and a week or so later, lake delton disappeared. no kidding!this was followed by a camping trip to kohler-andrae state park. the water at lake michigan is freezing! but the dunes cord-walk was awesome and so were some of the pictures i was able to take of a red-winged blackbird.after that was a nice long trip to door county. this probably needs a post by itself. it was very eventful and involved trips to potawatomi state park, peninsula state park, washington island (where the wheat for capital island wheat is grown!) cana island light and whitefish dunes state park. (the water at whitefish dunes wasn't that cold!) lot's of pictures of gulls and terns.finally, there was some impromptu camping this weekend too at governer dodge state park. we were pretty underprepared for this one as we weren't expecting to actually get a spot. so underprepared that we didn't even carry a flashlight! of course, smart as we were we ended up purchasing a hand-crank lantern from walgreens instead. it was ridiculous the amount of cranking we had to do for a small amount of light. overall, apart from a spider-bite sustained by red k it was fun. (at least we think it was a spider-bite. if she starts sticking to walls we will know for sure.) we also stopped by at the house on the rock and the frank lloyd wright visitor center but didn't take the tours (of the house and taliesin) as they were prohibitively expensive. (thanks to red k for being my fellow traveler and navigator.)

so there was this guy see. and once upon a time he used to read a lot of comic books and watch a lot of movies and read non-fiction and then he would write about it all, so his legion of readers could live vicariously through him. then he started reading fewer comic books and watching fewer movies and reading fewer books and more importantly writing fewer times.where did the time go? some of it was spent working longer hours and weekends, some of it was spent going out to bars and meeting new people and talking to them and arguing with them. and unlike comic books and movies and books, people were a lot harder to write about. so his blog started being updated a longer and longer intervals. some readers called him out on this. others, their lives equally busy and their blog updates equally delayed, understood. and yet the thought of stopping his blog never occurred to him. i think it was because he was never concerned about his readership numbers (although he did check his stats counter often enough) and he wrote his blog as a record for his future self. anyway, our story pauses there because i have to tell you about what i did.yesterday, with redk and her sister b, i went to milwaukee, specifically the milwaukee public museum to watch body worlds. (don't click on that link if you are easily disturbed.) body worlds is a traveling exhibition of preserved human cadavers in various poses, displaying various aspects of the human body. the bodies are preserved using a process called plastination. all the exhibits had the skin removed so that musculature, bones and internal organs are visible. to display the circulatory system, red dyed plastic was forced through the veins and arteries and the body then dissolved. this was definitely an excellent way to spend 25 dollars and an afternoon. we spent the rest of the evening driving around milwaukee (pretty but boring) and watching after innocence (depressing) and hot fuzz (hilarious and surprising.)tonight, it's time for samba and all you can eat meat for $33.
