"i've 
            been thrilled with the coaching i've gotten from susan allan, as well 
            as with the unusually effective tools she has given me to share with 
            clients and colleagues. susan's unique combination of interpersonal 
            and communication models have supported me through many challenging 
            issues in both my personal and professional life. it has been delightful 
            to find that she has ploughed the road the before me! i have felt a 
            deep connection with susan since the moment we met and our connection 
            continues to be a rare meeting of heart, mind, and spirit." --lisa-marie 
              divincent, therapist and counseling trainer since 1983, oregon 
"susan 
            allan's coaching is making a huge difference in my life.  she is 
            an incredible teacher, cutting to the core of my issues and communicating 
            directly and with great effectiveness.  susan has taught me to 
            listen, to listen to my family and hear their needs.  for the first 
            time in my life i can hear them and i know i'm on the road to a new 
            level of empathic and real communication with my family.  i already 
            see and feel the benefits. she has great empathy, a world of life experiences, 
            a great sense of humor and the perfect combination of intelligence, 
            brains and street smarts.  she is passionate about her work and 
            i consider myself lucky to be working with her.  things about myself 
            that have mystified me are becoming clearer.  the tools she teaches 
            enable me to participate in my own transformation.  in short, susan 
            allan is incredible." -- arnold s. jaffe, esq. santa 
              barbara , ca 
"susan, 
            this session with you has been the most important hour of my life!" --ya, irvine , ca 
"i 
            got more out of these 2 hours with you about saving my marriage than 
            i have from years with my therapist- thank you, susan. i found   
            myself with a broken marriage, 6 figures of debt, a 50 lb.  weight 
            loss (that i will maintain if it's the last thing i do), i found myself 
            with no career and at a dead end with a cliff in front of me.  
            i miraculously found this woman who has so changed my life, her 
            name is susan allan. she is called the divorce coach.  when she 
            started her work she coached people through divorce, but she found that 
            she much preferred helping them put things back together.  her 
            success rate is 100% if she has just one member  of the couple 
            who is willing to commit to the work.  sounds unbelievable? you 
            bet it does. was i skeptical? understatement. will we stay together? 
            don't know yet. but regardless, she has given me back all my power and 
            become my life coach and put me on a path towards getting everything 
            that i have ever wanted.  she has given us both hope and showed 
            us how we were really treating each other. she is so amazing. her energy 
            is life-changing. she has given me a gift, and i wanted to share it 
            on a gigantic scale."  --regards, j b  
              studio city california 
"hi 
             susan! you were so helpful to me when my husband left & i 
            was in so much pain. it's been a year since he left, and i am doing 
            incredibly well. in fact, as everybody said i am stronger, happier, 
            all those wonderful things that you hear will happen. good things are 
            happening all around. that means i am moving on. i am going to get out 
            your stuff that i have and start reading it again. i'm going to pass 
            this email on to a friend who is going through a divorce today. hugs" --l. r. in central florida 
"i 
            felt better after a one-hour phone call with you than i had  in 
            a long, long time. thank you!" l.k. pacific palisades , 
              ca 
"first 
            i want to thank you for the personalized answer.  i never even

no 
              one is ever prepared for a divorce when it happens. the emotions of 
              profound loss, betrayal and abandonment are not only experienced by 
              our conscious minds, these feelings reach deeply into our soul. while 
              some marriages end amicably, some end with bitterness, misery and 
              financial ruin. and more than half of all divorces render one or both 
              partners homeless. in 2001, 60% of all marriages in america ended 
              in divorce. by the year 2005, 70% of all couples are expected to divorce. 
              second marriages are even less successful than the first time around.

divorce 
              healing
healing 
              isn't just going to happen to you and time is not a prerequisite for 
              healing at all. if you have an expectation that you can "give it 
              some time" you may be very disappointed. most of the bitter and 
              angry divorced people have had the time but have not healed. often you 
              suppress pain, thinking that you will deal with it in the future. but 
              for most of us, that makes it more difficult to access and to heal.  more


introduction 
              to divorce coaching & the divorce forum®
the 
              divorce forum™ and susan allan's divorce coaching are components 
              in a paradigm shift in divorce that includes multidisciplinary experts. 
              it is also a new way to heal the soul connection of dealing with the 
              past, present and future by breaking the patterns of old and stepping 
              into a new light. this forum is just one avenue towards healing. it 
              is about taking responsibility and then choosing to move on rather than 
              continue to repeat the past. just as the past is an avenue to the present; 
              the present can be an avenue to the future. in this journey the results 
              possible can be at times miraculous. however, it requires your participation 
              as a co-creator at both the beginning and the end and with everything 
              in between. when you begin the process with susan allan's divorce coaching, 
              it is possible to dissolve, heal and complete the past... but it is 
              up to you. divorce can be the best thing you ever did, and the best 
              thing that ever happened to you, because it frees you to become more 
              than you were before, and it exemplifies the courage you have to move 
              on. it is the acknowledgement of your own initiative that brings you 
              to a place where you can begin a new life with new substance as a new 
              person, a different person, a better person. so, you can look a divorce 
              as an establishment of a new life. it is up to you to embark on a jorney 
              of recovery where you become the hero.
