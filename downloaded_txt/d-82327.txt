unique help for high anxiety, anxiety disorders and depression
discover a better way to understand these problems... one that offers a real cure


anxiety is part of being human, we all have it. and to get anxious in certain situations is normal, everyone does. most people even experience 
high anxiety regularly since things such as tests, interviews, public speaking, first dates and competitive sports can make anyone pretty anxious.

a survival instinct evolved over millions of years in order to protect us, anxiety involves a series of reactions and reflexes in our mind and body 
that help prepare us to avoid or deal with dangerous situations (the fight-or-flight response). and for most of the time it sits quietly in the background waiting to spring 
into action at the first sign of any threat.

anxiety keeps us safe. to be anxious means: "be wary, potential pain ahead". in the examples above (tests, interviews, first dates etc.) the threat 
involves possible embarrassment, shame, ridicule and rejection if we fail – all of which really hurt us.

and so, we all walk around with this inner survival instinct watching over us, sensing danger and letting us know about it by making us anxious (without it we 
wouldn't be careful when we crossed a busy road). usually this is barely noticeable, sometimes we feel it more strongly, occasionally it overwhelms us – it all depends on how relaxed and 
safe we feel.
this is natural, this is normal anxiety.

but for some of us things change... our anxiety grows stronger. it comes out more and more, for no apparent reason, and we begin to get too anxious,
too easily, too often. 

persistent physical symptoms appear. we notice that we get shaky or sweat excessively in public 
or frequently experience things like heart palpitations, breathlessness, dizziness, nausea or blushing – any symptom related to anxiety can develop – and worrying 
about these symptoms only makes them worse for it increases the anxiety.

many people live like this, in a state of high anxiety. they feel nervous often and it can be a daily struggle against negative thoughts and horrible physical symptoms. at this stage (and 
many stay at this stage) the problem is the high anxiety itself and the awful way it makes us feel. 

for some, however, it doesn't stop there. anxiety continues to increase and it can get so bad that it leads to more severe problems such as uncontrollable worrying, panic attacks that come 
out of the blue, obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours, irrational fears and phobias (particularly social phobia) and, in some cases, even severe depression. now it's the extreme thoughts and 
behaviours themselves (driven by the anxiety) that become the main focus of the problem.

why does this happen to us?


today, cognitive (thinking) and behavioural problems involving high anxiety and fear are classed as anxiety disorders. this is based on the medical model, which views these 
problems as mental illnesses, 'disorders' where something goes wrong in the brain and the answer lies in 'fixing' the thing that has gone wrong – often with medication.
however...
take the middle-aged woman (emotionally fragile from early life stress and conflict) who suffers emotional abuse at the hands of her 
partner – abuse that not only scares her but also makes her feel that she cannot do anything right and that everything she 
tries wil fail miserably or is totally worthless. is her generalized anxiety disorder (or severe depression for that matter) simply the result of something 
going wrong in her brain that can be fixed by medication?

what about the man in his early twenties, riddled with anxiety, whose father constantly put him down and criticized him with such venom as a 
child that he's now petrified others will do the same. is his social phobic behaviour truly dis-ordered and irrational?

or the teenage girl brought up by overly strict religious parents that have so drummed the fear of god into her that all she can do to 
obtain relief (from punishment by the lord) is turn to rituals. are her obsessive, fearful thoughts and compulsive behaviours really all down to mental illness?

generalized anxiety disorder, ocd, social phobia, ptsd, panic disorder, severe depression – are any of these problems truly irrational, dis-ordered and mental illness?


how many 'normal' people...
  say "touch wood" so as not to tempt fate?
  repeatedly check doors, windows, switches?
  take a drink before social functions?
  avoid public speaking at all costs?

almost everyone displays behaviours associated with anxiety disorders (such as troublesome thoughts, over-checking, the need for perfection, increased anxiousness, moments of panic and 
periods of despair) to some degree at some time in his or her life – more so in times of stress – for these problems reflect the subconscious ways we humans have evolved to 
protect ourselves.

when we look at the backgrounds of large numbers of people with various anxiety-related problems (ranging from moderately high anxiety to the severest of anxiety disorders) they are often strikingly 
similar in many ways. over-exposure to some form of stressful life experience and subsequent feelings of deep insecurity occurs across the board, with such regularity, that this must play a 
major role in the cause of these problems.

however, it's not just about the effects of suffering frequent high levels of anxiety from over-exposure to threatening/stressful situations that we need to consider. there's something else at 
play... something that's also caused by those stressful life experiences... something that shatters our self esteem. 


anxiety-related problems and self confidence – feeling in some way 'bad' or 'wrong' or 'not good enough'




research shows that over 50% of anxiety issues start before the age of fourteen (it's probably nearer 90%) and many people with long-term anxiety disorders, when asked what they remember 
most about the start of their problem, reply "being too nervous for a long time".

the way we feel about our self in childhood and adolescence can stay with us a lifetime and those who are frequently made to feel insecure and vulnerable when growing up (or later in 
life for some) are surely more susceptible to develop anxiety-related problems down the line. 

if we go through a period in life where we are constantly 'put down', 'picked on' or made to feel threatened in any way it's not surprising that anxiety (our inner self-protection instinct) 
will ramp up and we'll become more nervous –  constantly wary and alert, on the look out for danger in order to protect ourself. 

however, threatening situations not only scare us, they also make us feel bad (upset, hurt, insecure, weak, afraid, small, inadequate, sad, angry, confused... a whole myriad of negative 
feelings). and if we feel bad often enough, for long enough, we can start to believe that we feel this way because there is something inherently 'bad' or 'wrong' or 'not good enough' about us. over time, self 
confidence crumbles.

this highlights a critical component in the development of these problems that hasn't really been given the attention it deserves: the way we feel about ourself deep inside and 
how this becomes linked to being scared. 

it is this, not mental illness, that lies at the heart of most anxiety problems and disorders today. it also lies at the heart of their cure.

and so, all that you read from 'help-for' is based on the premise:

not diseases, disorders or mental illness, anxiety and 
depression problems involve natural survival instincts common to us all – normal self-protective thoughts, feelings and behaviours that become over-sensitive and intensified, 
grossly exaggerated and out of control.
they develop from experiencing too many (or too severe) stressful, negative life issues and events... ones that make us feel weak and vulnerable.

in essence, these problems come from our subconscious trying to protect us when life has made us afraid. and they start, strengthen and grow from our mind's attempts to explain and 
resolve the intangible fear we feel inside.



once we see these problems for what they really are, everything changes and it becomes possible to cure them completely. understanding and acceptance allows hurt to heal, removes self-doubt and 
starves fear of it's fuel. understanding and accepting that your problem is totally justified, given your life experiences, offers the one, true way to fully extinguish the 
smoldering ball of bad feelings inside (the thing that keeps the fear alive) and move beyond anxiety to become the strong, confident, unique, worthy individual that it's your birthright to be.

'goes to the heart of the matter'  (amazon review)

this is a very helpful book for the anxious among us. it is not a cbt or act book. 'calm anxiety' has a distinct approach to anxiety. in fact, the book covers it 
all: the fight-or-flight response, neural connections, upbringing and beliefs, gradual automation, acceptance of feelings and so forth. dixon beautifully ties it all 
together.
most books on anxiety, like the ones based on cbt and act, have 'techniques' as their core. 'calm anxiety', however, goes deeper. it focuses on the way we were 'conditioned' 
to believe we are not good enough. here is were the book goes further than other books. the core feeling of not being good enough is addressed. dixon emphasizes that it is 
important to say to yourself that there are good reasons for you to feel the way you do. this is acceptance and stops fighting anxious feelings. furthermore, you now know 
that you have been conditioned to believe that you are defective in some way. therefore, the anxious feelings do not have the same meaning any more. you always were 
good. this is the central idea in the book, which is elaborated. a highly recommendable read. concise, though all encompassing.
i have had a few therapies and read numerous books on the topic. for me, this one stands out, because it goes to the heart of the matter.

'you can believe this one'  (amazon review)
 
i have found terry dixon's book `evolving self confidence' a real delight and beautifully pitched. i have suffered anxiety, depression and 
confidence issues for most of my life and have sought many different resolutions to no avail. i felt myself to be once again going down in 
my mental state and just through a search engine found this book on amazon. i ordered it and with shredded nerves started to read it when 
it arrived. it wasn't brash or bold. it was like being held and being loved. i had an understanding of psychological issues and the 
physiology and functions of the brain from university. the things i read made sense and were practical but this time they were presented 
in such a way that it wasn't information anymore. it had become the soothing words of someone that cared; the words were instilled in my 
mind and my mind believed. this book can make you believe in yourself again. i have always been sceptical and things have very rarely 
worked for me. i had hypnotherapy that required me to tell myself parrot fashion that i was strong and would be fine to no avail. 
this book makes you believe in you, not another. i guess that why it works and why it feels real, because it is real and the answer is 
you. you just need to work at it with its help - you'll find no better help; thank you terry.
