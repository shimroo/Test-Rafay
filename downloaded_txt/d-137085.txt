testimonial
5 stars - great place for a quick trip or long weekend at the beach. if we are going for the week we usually go to a house or condo with a kitchen. this is our long weekend go to place. it is convenient to myrtle beach and wilmington plus it has a good free breakfast. not a 5 star motel but a super clean and friendly place at a reasonable rate. ~ randy g.
