	 changing to wordpress
	 
    


i thought i would warn my little readership that i will be switching to wordpress very soon. as you can see from the current state of my sidebar, blogger has once again messed up. i've had a fair bit of trouble with blogger this year so i've decided to take my hubby's advice and switch. not sure how soon it will be but at least that strange sidebar will be better. by the way, i deleted those two links that are covering my photo but they are still there for some reason, even though they don't appear on the template! weird.labels: blogger, wordpress

	 photo friday - 'sentimental'
	 
    


i most definately can be sentimental so here's my pf photo:this is a photo of my nanna, my mum and i. i think i would be about 17 there. this photo holds a lot of sentiment for me because my nanna passed away in 1998 and i miss her a lot. she was a hospitable, generous and caring person, all characteristics i would love to emulate. this is typical of us, sitting around her table drinking tea out of china cups, she also wore that colour a lot. miss you nanna.labels: nanna, photo friday
