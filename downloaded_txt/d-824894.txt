about us





the italians and spanish, the chinese and vietnamese see food as part of a larger, more essential and pleasurable part of daily life. not as an experience to be collected or bragged about – or as a ritual like filling up a car – but as something else that gives pleasure, like sex or music, or a good nap in the afternoon.
– anthony bourdain
