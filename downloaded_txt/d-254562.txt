frequently asked questions








            when and where do you meet to worship?
          










we are meeting indoors in our beautiful sanctuary, 2001 santa clara avenue, at 10:00 am. our worship services are available online.








            what can i expect when visiting?
          










you will be greeted at the door by friendly people who are glad you have come to worship with us.








            what should i wear?
          










there is no dress code. be comfortable and casual or wear that brand new outfit you like. all visitors are welcome.








            do we offer sunday school for the kids?
          










we use the godly play sunday school curriculum. children start in the sanctuary with their families. at about 10:15 the godly play teachers take the children to their classroom upstairs in the education building. on the first sunday of the month, children stay in the sanctuary and can join in communion with guidance from their family. during the service they can sit with their family or gather in the children’s play area in the sanctuary to read, play and wiggle.  








            why go to church?
          










these days, as we all attempt to navigate through rough waters, a little bit of quiet time to breath deeply,  reflect and sit in peace helps to sooth our souls. we believe in the importance of worshiping god together in community, including prayer, music, and hearing scripture read and preached. please gather to worship with us.








            how does communion work?
          










communion is celebrated on the first sunday of every month. you do not need to be a member of first pres, nor do you need to be a presbyterian to receive communion. wherever you are on your journey of faith, jesus welcomes you to the table. you may choose to receive a blessing rather than the communion elements if you prefer.








            how long is the service?
          










one hour, give or take.
