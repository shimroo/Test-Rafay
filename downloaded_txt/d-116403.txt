fishing & hunting trips the mississippi river delta is widely recognized as one of the top fisheries worldwide – both inshore & offshore. “north america’s largest river”, the mississippi, is the drainage for 37% of all of north america, which feeds the delta with nutrient-rich freshwater. this creates a massive louisiana inshore fishing nursery for the base food sources that all of the wildlife need that inhabit the delta. because of the unmatched food source, gamefish of all species gravitate toward the delta and some even call it home. our stretch of the delta represents nearly 14% of all us wetlands.

tours the plaquemines parish portion of the delta represents 14% of the entire nation’s wetlands in 1 location. this wide variety that makes up a very large estuary is both a full-time home to many animal species and a migratory, or a part-time home to a vast number of other animals. due to the very rich food source the delta provides, it cultivates massive numbers & species of birds. large numbers of wading birds can be found throughout the delta. thousands and thousands of many duck species migrate to and through the delta for a wintertime home. a large number of fur-bearing animals inhabit the delta with most spending their entire life around the marshes. deer, coyotes, muskrats, otters, rabbits, raccoons, nutria, pigs, and other mammals are a visual bonus when on a tour.
