the tourette syndrome association of australia acknowledges the traditional custodians of country throughout australia and their connections to land, sea and community. we pay respect to their elders past, present and emerging and extend that respect to all aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples today, fostering a shared sense of belonging through understanding and inclusion for all people.

we are committed to providing services and activities that are safe for all children, where child abuse and harm are not tolerated. child safety is a priority for the tsaa and the prevention and reporting of abuse is supported and encouraged. all staff, volunteers and contractors are responsible for promoting the safety, wellbeing and empowerment of children. all children who seek support from the tsaa have a right to feel and be safe. the tsaa recognises that discrimination can harm children and we treat all children with dignity and respect.
