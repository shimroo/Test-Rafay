memory
 

          memory. at the word we think of human memory, and of machine memory. 
          computer memory.  
          memory is a vital part of both machine and animal. without it we as 
          humans would not have any consciousness and the ability to create. 
          animals would not be able to survive.    
            in machines, and especially in computers, memory allows the machine 
            to function in various ways, for example software to be run and data 
            to be saved and processed.



what 
            is memory ? 
 
          memory. something just about everyone could use more of, including 
          your computer. memory is the ability to retain data for a period of 
          time, short or long. this data can be of a complexity including 
          imagery, sounds, sensations, smells and other sensations like human 
          memory, or it can be predetermined data as in computer memory. 
          one of the differences between human and machine memory is that we can 
          program and access machine memory through the use of software, but we 
          cannot access human memory in the same straightforward manner. yet.  

          lets now talk about computer memory.  

          to start with there are basically two types of memory for a computer: 
          storage space (hard drive) and active memory (ram).    
            we will focus on active memory or ram.

            memory - ram
 people 
          in the computer industry commonly use the term "memory" to refer to 
          ram (random access memory).
 

          as your processor cranks on your game, it uses ram to store some of 
          the data needed to make your game work. while all forms of memory work 
          together, ram is considered the main memory since most data, 
          regardless of its source, is stored in ram before it is registered in 
          any other storage device. consequently, ram is used millions of times 
          every second. a computer uses ram to hold temporary instructions and 
          data needed to complete tasks. this enables the computer's cpu 
          (central processing unit), to access instructions and data stored in 
          memory very quickly.   
            computer memory is extremely important to computer operation. files 
            and programs are loaded  into memory from external media 
            like fixed disks (hard drives) and removable disks (floppies tapes). 
            memory can be built right into a system board, but it is more typically 
            attached to the system board in the form of a chip or module. inside 
            these chips are microscopic digital switches which are used to represent 
            binary data. 

          a good example of this is when the cpu loads an application program - 
          such as a word processing or page layout program - into memory, 
          thereby allowing the application program to work as quickly and 
          efficiently as possible. in practical terms, having the program loaded 
          into memory means that you can get work done more quickly with less 
          time spent waiting for the computer to perform tasks. 



 
          the process begins when you enter a command from your keyboard. the 
          cpu interprets the command and instructs the hard drive to load the 
          command or program into memory. once the data is loaded into memory, 
          the cpu is able to access it much more quickly than if it had to 
          retrieve it from the hard drive.  
          this process of putting things the cpu needs in a place where it can 
          get at them more quickly is similar to placing various electronic 
          files and documents you're using on the computer into a single file 
          folder or directory. by doing so, you keep all the files you need 
          handy and avoid searching in several places every time you need them.   
            in general the more ram a computer has the faster the computer operates. 
            why? ram is where all the information is kept just before the computer 
            needs to use it. 
            think of it this way. during a conversation a person can speak without 
            interruption if everything being talked about is in his or her memory. 
            however, if a person does not have enough memory and has to look something 
            up during the course of the conversation, in a book or newspaper, 
            then the conversation stops until the needed information is found. 

          computers are very similar; they can continue processing without 
          interruption as long as all needed information is in memory (ram). 
          when that is not the case, the computer stops, retrieves the needed 
          information from storage (i.e. hard drive, cd, disk) and places it 
          into memory and then continues processing. the more interruptions the 
          computer receives to retrieve information the slower the computer. the 
          more memory a computer has, the fewer interruptions and the faster the 
          computer operates. more memory equates to more speed. 
          these days, no matter how much memory your computer has, it never 
          seems to be quite enough. not long ago, it was unheard of for a pc 
          (personal computer), to have more than 1 or 2 mb (megabytes) of 
          memory. today, most systems require 64mb to run basic applications. 
          and up to 256mb or more is needed for optimal performance when using 
          graphical and multimedia programs.   
          as an indication of how much things have changed over the past two 
          decades, consider this: in 1981, referring to computer memory, bill 
          gates said, "640k (roughly 1/2 of a megabyte) ought to be enough for 
          anybody." 
               
        for some, the memory equation is simple: more is good; less is bad. however, 
        for those who want to know more, this reference guide contains answers 
        to the most common questions, plus much, much more.

          these are 
            some of the memory manufacturers:
