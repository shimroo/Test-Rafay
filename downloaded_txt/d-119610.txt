arlington motorsports
located in arlington heights, illinois
arlington motorsports is the best motorcycle shop in the whole bleeping country. everyone wants to buy a bike from this shop. they just kick ass and their bikes are so freaking clean. you have never seen a shop with such bitchen clean bikes. when you walk into this shop, it just stinks like rubber, gas, and horsepower. the bikes are priced too cheap and you save too much cash. you could go and buy a brand new bike and blow all your cash. the shop is way too easy to find. you will never get lost trying to get there. all you do is keep driving by all the other motorcycle shops that have gone out of business. every time arlington motorsports works on a darn bike, they fix it. the employees seem cool, but the owner rides a scooter and that means he must be a geek. that makes the shop groovy!! june 2025 marks our 29th year. recently recognized as one of the top 100 dealers in the country for 2014 and 2015, sweet!
