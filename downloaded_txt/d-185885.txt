after pikeâs first expedition to the headwaters of the mississippi and during lewis and clarkâs expedition to the northwest, zebulon pikeâs second western expedition through the southwest began in 1806 ending in 1807. it traversed an uncharted region inhabited by numerous indian tribes and in the far southwest, the spanish. pike followed a tortuous route through some of the westâs roughest country in the dead of winter.













based on "the journals of zebulon montgomery pike"â which were published shortly after the explorer returned to the united states and were a popular sensation at the time, this 1 hour semi-documentary follows the small troop of american soldiers as they encounter native americans, search for the headwaters of the red river and eventually encounter spanish forces.as pike wroteâ âalthough they are a damâd set of rascals, yet in the woods they are staunch fellows and very proper for such expeditions as i am engaged in.âgeneral james wilkinson, senior officer of the u.s. army, was a suspect historical character, but he looked with favor on young pike and assigned him to lead the mississippi expedition.the film delves into not only pike, but also the courageous men likeâ doctor john robinson andâ antoine f. baronet vasquez known as âbaroney" who accompanied himâ on this dangerous and historic expedition.the film sets this very human story of exploration into the current state of affairs of its time in american history.two hundred years ago, what began as the 27 year old lieutenantâs second grand adventure soon became an ordeal of survival in the savage winter snows.photographed where these events happened, in the same severe weather conditions the expedition encountered.the film focuses on some of pikeâs encounters with these tribes and documents why and how pike attempted to climbâ âthe blue mountain", which decades later, during the colorado gold rush, became famous as "pikes peakâ as it was the first beacon that the long months traveling across the vast plains were nearly at an end.created with the advisement of experts including pike biographer w. eugene hollon (author of âthe lost pathfinderâ), the military information came from james kochan, the u.s. army historian (for the period 1783 to 1830), andâ donald e. kloster, the smithsonianâs curator of military history who provided the original plans for pikeâs rare uniforms and equipment along with information on the indian tribes and the archaic grand pawnee language which pikeâ encountered.pikeâs uniforms were a transitional uniform between those of the revolutionary war and that of the war of 1812. before "zebulon pike and the blue mountain"â these uniforms existed only as patterns in the national archives, now one of our uniforms is in theâ smithsonian's collection.






masterly narrated by burgess meredith with a sweeping musical score composed by neil argo, which was performed by the denver symphony, "zebulon pike and the blue mountain" is 1 hour in length and now available on dvd below.âââââââââââââââââ"'zebulon pike and the blue mountain'â is the premier film production on pike's amazing exploits, and i have no doubt that it will remain a standard in the future." clive g. siegle,executive director zebulon pike bicentennial commissionâââââââââââââââââpikeâs expeditions were characteristic of what most of this countryâs explorers often experienced, that being very difficult, often unforeseen, and frequently life-threatening situations for which no one is ever fully prepared.pike knew the spanish were in the area and wroteâ âpassed two spanish camps, within three miles of each other. . . this caused us to move with caution; but at the same time, increased our anxiety to discover them."pike wroteâ âat two oâclock in the afternoon i thought i could distinguish a mountain to our right, which appeared like a small cloud; viewed it with the spy glass, and was still more confirmed in my conjecture. in half an hour, they appeared in full view before us. when our small party arrived on a hill they with one accord gave three cheers to the mexican mountains."









pike wrote of one of their indian encounters âwe found them to be sixty warriors . . . our party was sixteen total. in a short time they were arranged in a ring and i took my seat our colors were placed opposite each other, the utensils for smoking were paraded on a small seat before us; thus far all was well.ââââââââââââââââââ"pike entered what is now colorado on nov. 11, 1806, and for the next three months followed a tortuous route through coloradoâs river country, mountains, canyons and high valleys. it began as a grand adventure and turned into an ordeal as the expedition party was terribly unprepared for survival in the winter snow and cold."the mountain mail â â salida, coloradoâââââââââââââââââ






made by colorado native, director john henry johnson who as a boy camping across colorado often heard stories about pike being in this valley or that area and wondered how this could have happened, years later the award-winning film "zebulon pike and the blue mountain" was the result.
native american clothing and facial makeup were directly patterned after images and drawings provided byâ donald e. klosterâ of the smithsonian and from the paintings of george catlin.pike built the first american structure constructed in colorado and probably the first in the louisiana purchase.pike wroteâ âi concluded to put my party in a defensible situation; and ascend the north fork, to the high point of the blue mountain, which we concluded would be one days march, in order to be enabled from its pinical, to lay down the various branches and positions of the country.ââââââââââââââââââ"as arduous as the filming must have been . . . the end result is a feeling of this is colorado as it really was nearly two centuries ago. when the soldiers get cold, the viewer gets cold; when pikeâs men hurt, we hurt."pueblo chieftainâââââââââââââââââpike wroteâ âthe summit of grand peak, which was entirely bare ofâ vegetation and covered with snow, now appeared at the distance of 15 to 16 miles from us, and as high as what we had ascended, and would have taken a whole dayâs march to have arrived at its base, when i believe no human being could have ascended to its pinical.â






on christmas day 1806 pike wrote âhere i must take the liberty of observing that in this situation, the harships and privations we underwent, were on this day brought more fully to our mind. having been accoustomed to some degree of relaxation, and extra enjoyments; but here 800 miles from the frontiers of our country, in the most inclement season of the year; not one person clothed for the winter, many without blankets, having been obliged to cut them up for socks and now laying down at night on the snow or wet ground; one side burning whilst the other pierced with the cold wind.âpike wrote of the dunes in what is now the great sand dunes national park, âtheir appearance was exactly that of the sea in a storm (except as to color) not the least sign of vegetation existing thereupon."the filmmakers thank and are indebted to the many landowners who allowed the film crew access to the places where pike and his men traveled.more than 100 individuals, businesses and agencies helpedâ ensure the film's rich authenticity. from rareâ firearms and costume detailing, to pikeâs hat itself, the filmmakers simply could not have made this window into a long-ago time period without their help.







of the first spanish they encountered, pike wrote âdiscovered two horsemen rising the summit of a hill . . . proved to be a spanish dragoon and a civilized indian . . . they informed me that was the fourth day since they had left santa fe; that robinson had arrived there, and was received with great kindness by the governor.âthough none of his men died during the expedition many lost fingers and toes to frostbite. pike wrote âthey endured thirst and famine; marched over rugged mountains, through snows three and four feet deep; their bodies exposed to every inclemency of weather, for want of clothes, carrying at the same time, packs of 60 to 70 pounds burden."secretary of war henry dearborn, on behalf of thomas jefferson wrote to pike âyou may rest assured that your services are held in high estimation by the president of the united states, and i consider the public much indebted to you for the judicious manner in which you have performed.ââââââââââââââââââwinner: council on lnternational nontheatrical events (cine) golden eagle award
