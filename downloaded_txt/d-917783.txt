a game of skill
placing a sportsbet is a game of skill. the challenge is to gather and analyze as much information as you can about a game, weigh the probabilities of each team winning, and subsequently compare your opinion to the oddsmaker's.
while luck may be a deciding factor in the outcome of any single game, and will inevitably go against the bettor on occasion, it will balance out in the long run.
being a consistent winner in sports betting is not about luck but whether the bettor is prepared to invest the time and effort to become knowledgeable about the sports he bets on, whether he can weigh all the factors in a cool, objective fashion, and whether he adopts a consistent, disciplined, long-term approach to betting.
the bookmaker is simply a middle-man who operates on a small profit margin and, ideally likes to see half the money wagered on one team and half on the other, assuring a profit.
if too much of the money goes on one team, the bookmaker will move the line or point spread to encourage bets on the other team in an effort to balance his book. the person the bettor is attempting to beat is the oddsmaker, and the oddsmaker's views on each team's chances.
just by flipping a coin, bettors will be right 50% of the time. at odds of 10/11, only 52.4% of the bettor's bets have to win for him to overcome the bookmaker's profit and break even, so he only needs a very small edge to become a winner.

so bettors must do their homework and bet selectively. 55% winning bets is definitely achievable and 60-65% is a realistic target. at those levels, the sports bettor will have an extremely profitable and enjoyable hobby.

ufc fight night 251 - cannonier vs. rodrigues: can the killa gorilla stop robocop at the ufc apex?





february 13, 2025 by marc jerbs
the excitement is building as two elite middleweights, jared cannonier and gregory rodrigues, gear up for a high-stakes showdown in the main event of ufc fight night 251 on february 15, 2025, at the ufc apex in las vegas. this pivotal matchup not only marks a crucial juncture in both fighters' careers but also sets the stage for an electrifying clash of styles that promises to captivate mma fans.
jared cannonier, aptly nicknamed "the killa gorilla," steps into the octagon with a professional record of 17 wins and 8 losses. a battle-tested veteran, cannonier has competed across multiple weight classes, transitioning from heavyweight to light heavyweight before establishing himself as a formidable force in the middleweight division. known for his devastating knockout power, he has finished numerous opponents with his precise and explosive striking. however, coming off back-to-back losses against nassourdine imavov and caio borralho, cannonier is eager to bounce back and reaffirm his place among the division's elite.
cannonier vs. rodrigues sports bet odds
gregory "robocop" rodrigues is the favorite to win the match. here are our latest odds:

rodrigues is the favorite and has a money line of -220.
cannonier is the underdog and has a money line of +185.

on the other side, gregory rodrigues, also known as "robocop," boasts an impressive record of 16 wins and 5 losses, with a remarkable finishing rate—10 victories by knockout and 3 by submission. at 32 years old, rodrigues has been riding a wave of momentum, securing three consecutive wins, including notable triumphs over brad tavares and denis tiuliulin. with youth on his side and a well-rounded skill set, he aims to capitalize on this opportunity to further establish himself as a serious contender in the division.
cannonier's success hinges on his ability to dictate the striking exchanges, utilizing his 77.5-inch reach to maintain distance and land powerful blows. his resilience and durability make him a tough opponent, as he has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to absorb punishment and keep pressing forward.
in contrast, rodrigues presents a multifaceted challenge with his blend of striking and high-level grappling. a brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, he thrives in clinch situations and on the ground, where he can leverage his submission skills and top control to neutralize strikers. if he can impose his grappling game and apply relentless pressure, he could wear down cannonier and create openings for takedowns or submissions.
this bout carries significant implications for both fighters. for cannonier, securing a win is essential to halt his losing skid and reaffirm his standing in the division. meanwhile, a victory for rodrigues would be the biggest of his career, potentially launching him into the title conversation.
with the unpredictable nature of the middleweight division, the outcome remains uncertain, adding to the intrigue of this compelling contest. ufc fight night 251's main event promises fireworks, as both competitors seek to make a definitive statement. whether cannonier's knockout power prevails or rodrigues' grappling expertise proves decisive, fans can expect a thrilling, high-stakes battle under the bright lights of the octagon. as fight night draws closer, all eyes will be on the ufc apex, eager to witness how this crucial middleweight clash unfolds.
