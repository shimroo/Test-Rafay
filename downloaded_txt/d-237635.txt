about selah

 









  

“we’ve never done this before!”what could a well-established, veteran group that has sold over 4 million records(including 2 gold albums), won 11 gospel music association dove awards, andhas over 900 million streams across all digital music platforms do for their nextproject to keep things interesting for themselves and their listeners? this was thequestion that todd smith, amy perry, and allan hall pondered as they began work on their 22nd album.allan eventually hit upon an interesting idea that the group realized they hadnever done in their 27-year career: for this album, every song would be written,co-written, or spoken into by at least one group member! the three had certainlywritten songs for selah albums before, but those original compositions werealways accompanied on their album projects by covers of classic gospel andccm songs, original songs by other songwriters, and selah’s own arrangements of powerful hymns ofthe christian faith.the fresh concept resonated strongly with todd and amy and the timing wasgood, especially since the two previous albums had covered selah’s more“traditional” side. in 2022, selah released a long-awaited new christmas album,at this table. it had been 20 years since the release of their first christmasalbum, rose of bethlehem, back in 2002, and fans were excited to have newchristmas music. that same year, selah celebrated their 25th anniversary as agroup. to commemorate the occasion, the trio recorded a simple hymns projectvery much in the style of their debut album from 1997, be still my soul. they feltthe new hymns album, simply titled greatest hymns, vol. 3 would be a nice“bookend” with the first album and a fitting tribute to their first 25 years in the music industry.with the two “traditional” albums completed and released in 2022, attentionturned to the next project and what could be done to differentiate it from theprevious albums. the group decided to head in a more contemporary directionfor the new album, and the idea for every song to be an original sparked strong creativity and energy.the timing of an “all-original songs” album ended up working out well, as eachmember of the group had been walking through various situations in their own lives.the poignant, bittersweet song “the rock is my foundation” addresses how,when life doesn’t go as expected and events turn out differently than we planned,we have a promise from our lord that he is our refuge in difficult times, seeingthe full picture and knowing what’s best for us even when we can’t see itourselves. this song was born out of allan’s profound sense of loss and thestruggle to find hope amidst grief as he dealt with major personal tragedies overthe past four years with the deaths of numerous friends and family, sadlyculminating with the passing of his mother in october 2023.amy and her husband, jake, were on an incredibly challenging foster carejourney — the young child that was placed into their home had severe multipletrauma issues, and after several years of loving on the child and doing their bestto bring love, peace, and healing to him, god revealed to amy and jake that theywould not be his “forever family.” this was devastating to them, and theycontinue to navigate this heartbreaking situation as they trust god’s wisdom andleading. out of this wrenchingly emotional experience flowed the songs “he isstill” and “you don’t leave me,” anchored by amy’s powerful and deeply felt vocal performances.todd, as he kept deepening his study of the bible, was becoming more and moreaware of spiritual warfare and how the topic oftentimes seemed to be “glossedover” or outright ignored in the modern church. todd wanted to write songs thatlet christians know that they are already conquerors because of the power ofjesus christ, and that christians need to root themselves boldly in that fact andact from a place of power and authority in their lives. the songs “victory” and“higher name” in particular speak to this. as always, music would be the avenuefor selah to bare their hearts and souls and invite listeners to join them on thejourney of life — with all of its ups and downs and joys and sorrows.the november 1, 2024 release of the new album, higher name, represents morethan just a collection of songs; it’s a reflection of selah’s journey, both individuallyand as a group. what sets this album apart is the depth of emotion andvulnerability that permeates every note. each track is a testament to life — faith,hope, struggle, heartbreak, disappointment, victory, triumph, joy — all woventogether with the threads of selah’s signature melody and harmony.from personal experiences of love and loss, to the themes of god’s greatstrength, authority, and redemptive power, this collection of new songs speaksabout the journey of life and humanity’s relationship to god in all of its complexityand beauty. the lord jesus christ is the foundation upon which our lives arebuilt, the guiding light that illuminates our path, and our source of strength intimes of trial. he is indeed the “higher name.”
