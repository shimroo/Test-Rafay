about
the center for neurological imaging is a research laboratory at brigham and women’s hospital in boston. we use quantitative neuroimaging techniques to investigate diseases affecting the central nervous system, with particular emphasis on multiple sclerosis and age-related disorders like alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular diseases.
members of the cni collaborate with other departments within brigham and women’s hospital, with other researchers at harvard medical school, with local universities such as harvard, bu and with gifted clinicians, researchers, and engineers throughout the world.learn more
