'boatanchors' - my collection here! 




as my collection and
interests have grown, i have added vintage test gear and heavy
communications receivers - 'boatanchors' - for further interest. 


i know
there are several sites on the web dealing in vintage radio but,
invariably, these are wooden cased mains-driven table or floor
console models. radios have always been portable (even before
transistors made them into a fashion statement) but i couldn't find
much information about valve portables. so, in the finest tradition,
i thought, "why not build a site dedicated to the valve portable
yourself and incorporate all the knowledge and wisdom you have
acquired into an easy to find site?". 

so, here is
the result thus far of my particular choice of esoteria in the
already obscure world of vintage radio. and please note, my moving
to the other side of the atlantic has meant that the focus on british
portables is to be weakened somewhat if the collection is to continue
to grow - sorry!
