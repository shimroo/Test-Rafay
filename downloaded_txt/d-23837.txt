supporting the matthew!



a beautiful ship like the matthew requires a lot of looking after to keep it in tip-top condition and able to sail. as the matthew of bristol trust doesn’t receive any public or private funding, we rely hugely on the generosity of the general public to help us keep the ship afloat! all money raised by charity is used to maintain the matthew so that you can continue to visit it, sail on it and learn about its rich history. your support is appreciated.
