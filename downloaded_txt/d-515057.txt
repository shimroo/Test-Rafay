deborah huling of west chester told the cincinnati enquirer her son was killed while on foot patrol and was ambushed by a man who appeared to be an afghan military policeman. she said huling suffered a gunshot wound to the chest. he was flown to a hospital, where he later died, she said.

"tommy," as many people knew him, leaves behind his parents, his wife, and two young children, one 2-years-old and one 5-years-old according to family friends. the defense department says the paratrooper was killed in ahmad kheyl, afghanistan when enemy forces attacked his unit with an improvised explosive device or ied.

he was a graduate of alameda high school, class of 2000. margie sherratt was his counselor at alameda high when he was a freshman and sophomore. she's now president of the alameda board of education. "i would want his family to know that as the education community, we are very proud of him and he did for us for our country," she said.

sherratt says she found out about fogarty's death at the nearby safeway where his mother worked for 22 years. many employees there watched him grow up. "this is a tragedy and from the bottom of all of our safeway employees hearts, our hearts go out to them, and we just send our love and our prayers. and anything we can do, feel free to let us know," trina carr said.

"my sons were young and i also lost my wife young, but he would always ask me how my family was doing and how my boys were doing. every time i saw him, he was always concerned about me and my kids," philip davis recalled.

fogarty is described as non-selfish and independent. friends say he was on his third or fourth tour in afghanistan and that if he had made it home, he would have soon been leaving the military.

the alameda high school graduate was posthumously awarded the purple heart and the bronze star medal, which recognizes heroic service or meritorious achievement. he will be buried at arlington national cemetery.

navy lt. christopher e. mosko





remember our heroes

navy lt. christopher e. mosko, 28, of pittsford, n.y.

lt. mosko was assigned to combined joint special operations task force, afghanistan, out of explosive ordnance disposal mobile unit 3 in san diego; died april 26, 2012 while conducting combat operations in nawa district, ghazni province, afghanistan. also killed were army staff sgt. brandon eggleston and army sgt. dick lee jr.


christopher mosko, 28, was one of three u.s. troops killed thursday by a bomb in afghanistan's ghazni province. while the defense department listed him as being from the rochester, n.y., suburb of pittsford, his family says they lived there for several years but that he was born in philadelphia and was living in san diego.

mosko was a 2002 graduate of eau claire memorial high school who participated in soccer, swimming and show choir. his family moved away not long after he graduated, the eau claire leader-telegram reported sunday.

"he was a fine young man," said ken de meuse, whose son nick played soccer with mosko from youth league through high school.

"he took himself and the game of soccer pretty seriously," he said. "he was always one of the first on the field to practice and one of the last to leave. he was very dedicated."

de meuse told the newspaper one of his favorite sports memories was of the young men's last soccer season at memorial, in 2001. the team advanced to the state tournament but lost in the semifinal to marquette university high school, which went on to win the state championship.

retired memorial high school choir director george utphall also had positive memories of mosko.

"he was a hard worker. very self-directed. very likable," utphall recalled. "he had a strong sense of community and stick-to-itiveness, of doing his best."

marty hendricks, who coached mosko in youth soccer from age 12 to 15 and whose son chad played on the same memorial team, said mosko was an excellent student and was good at several sports but really loved soccer.

"he was fearless," hendricks said. "he was a team captain for both us and eau claire memorial. ... chris could have done anything he wanted, but he had a passion for the military and followed that dream."

the defense department says mosko commanded an explosives disposal platoon with the combined joint special operations task force. he was based in san diego.

he is survived by his wife, amanda. mosko and  was posthumously awarded the bronze star medal with v for valor in combat and a purple heart.

he is also survived by his parents john and gayle mosko and a sister meredith.

navy lt. christopher e. mosko was killed in action on 4/26/12.

family, friends remember clay county soldier killed in afghanistan
the 12-year veteran had a passion for working with dogs.
by dana treen 

family, friends remember clay county soldier killed in afghanistan
keystone heights - minutes after the memorial service for staff sgt. dick alson lee jr. began, a setting sun dipped beneath gunmetal clouds to warm the football field where he played as a high school linebacker.

lee, 31, a 2000 graduate of keystone heights high school, died april 26 from injuries caused by an improvised explosive device in afghanistan's ghanzi province.

monday, about 500 sat in the bleachers and on the field for the memorial to honor his service and pay respects to his family, including wife katherine and young sons joshua and david. the family had been living in germany.

also killed in the explosion was staff sgt. brandon f. eggleson, 29, of fort bragg, ga., and lee's bomb-detecting german shepherd, fibi.

they died when their humvee ran over the device.

lee, who friends called "opie," had been in afghanistan 23 days and was on his deployment's first mission, an army kennel master told the military newspaper stars and stripes. he had turned down promotions so he could continue to be a dog handler, according to the paper.

it was his fourth deployment in a 12-year military career.

commitment had long been a part of who he was.

chuck dickinson, who coached lee at keystone high, said the winner of the outstanding linebacker award his senior year was reliable and determined.

"if you asked him to do something, you didn't have to worry about it getting done," he said. "sometimes you had to slow him down. he'd go wide open all the time."

dickinson said lee's "4" jersey won't be retired but will be put to special use. though details have not been worked out, the coach said the number may be selected each year to be worn by a player who exemplifies lee's character.

"that way it is an ongoing, every year thing," he said.

dickinson presented a jersey to lee's family.


when he was a senior, lee signed up for the army. he was passionate about working with the dogs, his family told the times-union in late april. he was planning to make the army a career then get a job in police work, his sister, vanessa compton, said then.

he was returned to florida on saturday.

before the service, lee vincent, 68, and betty sue vincent, 64, waited in the crowd. the couple, who traveled from gainesville, lost their 26-year-old son donald wayne vincent, a marine, in afghanistan in 2009.

the vincents said they will likely try to reach out to the lee family at a later date to offer consolation.

"they've joined an organization that nobody wants to belong to," lee vincent said.

lee was assigned to 95th military police battalion, 18th military police brigade, 21st theater sustainment command, sembach, germany.

the memorial followed a motorcycle procession from orange park.

monday, gov. rick scott ordered the flags at the courthouse in clay county and city offices in orange park as well as at the capitol in tallahassee be flown at half-staff today in honor of the fallen staff sergeant.

“he’s always been a leader and dedicated in what he was doing,” steinman said. “he was one heck of a wrestler, a four-time sectional qualifier.

“when he talked, kids listened. they respected him.”

steinman said he was neal’s coach in high school and his friend after neal graduated. steinman is a gulf war veteran, and the two had a lot in common, he said.

army spc. manuel j. vasquez





remember our heroes

army spc. manuel j. vasquez, 22, of west sacramento, calif.

spc. vasquez was assigned to 2nd battalion, 28th infantry regiment, 172nd infantry brigade, grafenwoehr, germany; died april 24, 2012 in margah, paktika province, afghanistan, of unspecified causes. 


soldier with placer county, newcastle ties killed in afghanistan 
manuel vasquez, 22, killed tuesday in paktika province 
by gus thomson, auburn journal staff writer 

auburn ca - the department of defense reported thursday the death on tuesday of a soldier who has ties to placer county. 

spc. manuel j. vasquez, 22, west sacramento, was killed in paktika province, a statement from the defense department said. 

vasquez is the grandson of newcastle residents joyce and bill costa the costas have lived in newcastle for 22 years and often had vasquez over to their acreage during holidays and vacations while he was growing up. 

joyce costa said she learned of her grandson’s death by phone wednesday and shock soon turned to tears as the reality of the situation began to take hold. 

over the phone, she said she learned that vasquez had been shot and killed while serving with his unit. he had reportedly been found in a lookout tower and an investigation is to determine events surrounding his death, she said. 

less than six months ago, vasquez was the center of attention as the family gathered for thanksgiving and he stationed himself at his favorite location – at the barbecue preparing food for others, his grandmother remembered. 

by that time, vasquez had already served 1½ years in the army and had been in afghanistan since early july. 

vasquez grew up in west sacramento but spent most of the past 10 years with his father – costa’s son – in citrus heights. 

joyce and bill costa look at photos of their grandson and see a young man who was quick with a joke or a smile, gravitated toward electronic games like many his age, enjoyed eating and barbecuing, and went too soon. 

vasquez could have joined another branch of the service. 

“but he wanted to be where the action is,” joyce costa said. “at thanksgiving, he was very happy. he loved being up there and the friends he made.” 

bill costa, himself an army veteran, recalled a grandson who was the tallest – at 6 feet 3 inches – in the family and someone who loved to visit and ride on the tractor lawn mower. during his time in afghanistan, vasquez had been serving with a mortar artillery team, bill costa said. 

joyce costa said that vasquez, one of 24 grandchildren, had been on the front line in paktika province, which is located in the southeast of afghanistan, near the pakistan border. 

vasquez was with the 2nd battalion, 28th infantry regiment, 172nd infantry brigade in an isolated area. 

“he had to walk three miles to get to a computer,” joyce costa said. 

the newcastle couple said that vasquez was especially close with two of his brothers – marcus and raymond. all had matching tattoos inked on their arms with their names and hearts. 

the defense department did not provide information on the details of vasquez’s death. joyce costa said that details of vasquez’s funeral arrangements have yet to be worked out but members of his family had traveled to dover, del. on thursday for a ceremony marking his return to american soil. 

costa said she had anticipated that her grandson would be ending his tour in afghanistan in july and returning home. 

“he was a wild and crazy kid and made people laugh,” costa said. “everybody loved that boy.” 

army spc. manuel j. vasquez died 4/24/12 serving in afghanistan.

marine staff sgt. joseph h. fankhauser





remember our heroes

marine staff sgt. joseph h. fankhauser, 30, of mason, texas

ssgt. fankhauser was assigned to 7th engineer support battalion, 1st marine logistics group, i marine expeditionary force, camp pendleton, calif.; died april 22, 2012 at camp bastion, helmand province, afghanistan of injuries received while conducting combat operations. 


san angelo, texas — paul smith, dean of students for mason isd, remembers joseph fankhauser because of the fbi visit.

fankhauser, born in edinburg, transferred to mason high school in 1998 for his junior year and graduated in 2000.

"he was never a discipline problem," smith said. "he was always just a real serious, studious kid."

but then there was the day two fbi agents from the san antonio office came looking for fankhauser. they had received a report that one of the felons on the fbi's ten most wanted list was posing as a student named joseph fankhauser.

"i told the guys i know the kid, he's not on the most wanted list, trust me on this," smith said. "i thought it was a pretty funny prank. they didn't think it was so funny.

"that was the only time he was ever inside the office. he was just a model student."

marine corps staff sgt. joseph h. fankhauser, of mcallen, died sunday in support of combat operations in helmand province, afghanistan, according to a news release from the u.s. marines.

he was an explosive ordnance disposal technician assigned to 7th engineer support battalion, 1st marine logistics group.

he enlisted in the marine corps just weeks after graduating from mason high.

smith's son, cade, tennis coach at central high school in san angelo, graduated with fankhauser.

"we played football together our senior year," cade smith said. "growing up in a small town everybody knows everybody. i remember him talking about going into the military. i remember him giving everything he had at everything he did. he was a good kid."

the marines said this was fankhauser's fifth combat deployment. he was deployed to iraq in 2004, 2006, and 2007, and to afghanistan in 2011.

his wife, heather, in a statement from their home in san diego, said they would have celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary in october.

she said "the love of my life" was killed when a roadside bomb detonated.

"he was 30 years old, known as either fank or bob to his friends and family, had the most unique sense of humor, and would have given the shirt off his back to anyone he considered a friend," she said.


his service awards included the two purple hearts, combat action ribbon (second award), sea service deployment ribbon (seventh award), afghanistan campaign medal (second award), iraq campaign medal (third award), marine corps good conduct medal (third award), armed forces expeditionary medal, global war on terrorism service medal, global war on terrorism expeditionary medal, national defense service medal, navy unit commendation (second award), presidential unit citation-navy, nato medal-isaf afghanistan.

"during the past seven years, we've endured four combat deployments," heather fankhauser said. "as hard as they were and as unbearable as this is now, we would not have changed any of it. he loved his country, and he did what he did so that fellow service members could safely return to their families."

she said that most of her husband's 12-year career had been spent in southern california and they had planned to retire there after he served 20 years.

"i've been trying to figure out how to explain to our dogs that they can stop pacing the door, waiting for joseph to return again," she said. "they jump every time they hear his car alarm.

"i miss him every day, and he will never be forgotten."

cade smith, who said he had not talked with fankhauser since high school, said his heart goes out to the family.

"and we thank him and his family for his sacrifice," smith said. "it's felt by not only me, but the community of mason and the country."

sergeant fankhauser is survived by his loving family; wife, heather, parents, henry and betty fankhauser and mother, mary wyscarver.

marine staff sgt. joseph h. fankhauser was killed in action on 4/22/12.

army pfc. michael j. metcalf





remember our heroes

army pfc. michael j. metcalf, 22, of boynton beach, fla.

pfc. metcalf was assigned to the 2nd battalion, 504th infantry, 1st brigade combat team, 82nd airborne division, fort bragg, n.c.; died april 22, 2012 in ghazni province, afghanistan, of wounds suffered when enemy forces attacked his unit with an improvised explosive device. 


west palm beach — seven-month-old rylee o'keefe was quiet but alert as she rested in her mother's arms wednesday morning.

the infant niece who u.s. army pfc. michael metcalf called "rye rye" was on the tarmac with other family and friends who gathered to welcome him home for the last time. nothing disturbed her. not the roar of jets taking off and landing, nor the buzz of the growing crowd.

then, as the coffin carrying the body of metcalf, her dad's best friend, was removed from the white kalitta charters plane and onto the tarmac, rylee cried.

it was as if she suddenly channeled the swell of emotion overcoming the crowd of about 60-plus waiting to honor the boynton beach soldier who died after a roadside bomb exploded on april 22 in paktia, afghanistan.

rylee grew silent again as the six army soldiers acting as pallbearers carefully placed the coffin down in front of the group.

metcalf's mother, kim, and her boyfriend, matt digennaro, stepped forward. kim metcalf placed her hands on her son's coffin, which was draped with an american flag. she collapsed over it, and digennaro over her.

those gathered on the warm, windy morning for michael metcalf's homecoming service stood silent, observing and respectful.

"i can't believe all the people. my son would he's in his glory," kim metcalf said while tears streamed from her eyes. "he really sees how many people loved him. how many people really adored both of us."

before the plane carrying metcalf arrived around 10 a.m., everyone gathered in the parking lot just outside the tarmac near galaxy aviation.

dixie thiery, whose daughter once dated metcalf, handed out dozens of hand-held american flags. "she did barrel racing and he did bull riding," she said. "he used to call me mama dukes."

good friends of michael metcalf - jaclyn murray, brooke lintner and mandy eichorst - created "welcome home" signs and laid them along a fence. they decorated the signs with hearts, and placed three american flags in between each.

eichorst wore a cowboy hat and tan cowboy boots to honor metcalf, who was also a skim boarder and whom she had known since elementary school, she said.

"he was a class clown. always making people laugh," she said. "i wish his homecoming was a little bit different, but i'll see him again."

while the group waited for the gate to slide open, allowing them to greet their hero on the tarmac, members of the pompano beach-based american legion post 142 riders gathered together.

"it's a sign of respect. when we came home we had no welcome, nothing." said ronald bowlay, a vietnam war veteran . "it's a solemn occasion because the lad is only 22 years old."

just before the plane arrived, metcalf's family and friends were escorted onto the tarmac. palm beach county fire rescue did a water cannon salute as the plane taxied through. after kim metcalf and digennaro had their moment with the body of the slain soldier, kim metcalf invited some of the other onlookers to pay respects.

his comrades saluted him.

the pallbearers gently placed metcalf's body in a vietnam-era huey helicopter restored by a loxahatchee-area veteran, which would later take metcalf's body to the glick family funeral home in boca raton.

while watching, kim metcalf quietly said to herself, "beautiful."

some of metcalf's closest friends, including brandon o'keefe and t.j. fitzgerald, strode up to the helicopter and peered through one of its windows.

with their arms around one another, they said a prayer. they all quietly kissed their hands and gently placed them on the window.

"mike was our best friend," o'keefe said. "he'll always be with us."

before he was taken away, army spc. trenton blanchard walked over to kim metcalf to pay respects.

blanchard was in the same company as metcalf and hadn't left his side since he died.

he said metcalf always had a smile on his face and was always cheerful.

after blanchard told metcalf this, she turned around to her loved ones and said, "he hasn't left michael since the hospital."

blanchard then told metcalf of a time when her son came back to afghanistan after taking a short leave recently. he told the grieving mother that her son showed up in civilian clothes, wearing cut-off blue jeans.

she smiled, let out a contained laugh and said, "that was him."

army pfc. michael j. metcalf was killed in action on 4/22/12.

marine cpl. aaron m. faust





remember our heroes

marine cpl. aaron m. faust, 22, of louisville, ky.

cpl. faust was assigned to 2nd battalion, 9th marines, 2nd marine division, ii marine expeditionary force, camp lejeune, n.c.; died april 15, 2012 in helmand province, afghanistan, while supporting combat operations. 


by thomas mcadam 
louisville.com's the arena section

ken faust and his wife tess were at home monday evening, at their house on bradley avenue—just south of eastern parkway—when they heard a knock on their door and received the news every military family dreads.  their 22-year-old son, aaron, had been killed in afghanistan.

the marine delivering this devastating news could provide the family with only a few details.  according to the department of defense, cpl. aaron m. faust, of louisville, kentucky, died april 15 while supporting combat operations in helmand province, afghanistan.

like his dad, aaron was a member of the okolona veterans of foreign wars.  ken serves as the post’s quartermaster; and also as vfw 6th district jr. vice commander.  aaron’s mother, tess, is the secretary with the okolona vfw ladies auxiliary, legislative department program chairman, and an officer in the ladies 6th district.

the faust family knows the meaning of the words:  duty, honor, and country.

aaron graduated from louisville’s desales high school in 2007, and joined the marine corps the following november.  after serving an overseas tour in japan, he was promoted to the rank of corporal in august of 2010, and was initially a food service specialist.  he had just reenlisted for another four year tour of duty in march, and was being reassigned as a clerical specialist. 

cpl. faust was assigned to 2nd battalion, 9th marine regiment, 2nd marine division, ii marine expeditionary force, camp lejeune, n.c.  his awards include the marine corps good conduct medal, sea service deployment ribbon, afghanistan campaign medal, global war on terrorism service medal, national defense service medal and nato medal-isaf afghanistan.

although the defense department press office indicates that cpl. faust “…died during combat operations on sunday,” the cause of his death has not been released as of today, and the military says that the incident is “under investigation.”

today, kentucky gov. steve beshear recognized cpl. faust’s sacrifice; and will order that flags at all state office buildings be lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset on the day of cpl. faust’s interment, for which arrangements are still pending.

aaron recently posted this, on his facebook page:

what matters is not the idea a man holds, but the depth at which he holds it.  death before dishonor.  family above all.


marine cpl. aaron m. faust was killed in action 4/15/12.

army spc. keith d. benson





remember our heroes

army spc. keith d. benson, 27, of brockton, mass.

spc. benson was assigned to 2nd battalion, 28th infantry regiment, 172nd infantry brigade, grafenwoehr, germany; died jan. 18, 2012 in paktika province, afghanistan, of unspecified causes. 


the norwood transcript and bulletin
norwood —army spc. keith d. benson “was one of the ones you could always count on,” cathy connor-moen said after learning the news of benson’s death.

the 27-year-old was killed wednesday, jan. 18, in paktika province, afghanistan. he was serving as a medic and was assigned to the 2nd battalion, 28th infantry regiment, 172nd infantry brigade, grafenwoehr, germany. the circumstances surrounding his death are under investigation.

benson graduated from norwood high in 2002.

norwood high school principal george usevich said benson was “solid student and a real gentleman in school... he was a true son of this school on the hill.”

usevich said benson found his niche at norwood high as a member of the school’s music program.

“he was a member of our concert chorale for four years, and it was something he loved,” he said. “he really enjoyed being a part of that group.”

the norwood high school director of fine arts connor-moen said benson was as a sweet kid with a great sense of humor who was always willing to help out.

“he was definitely a team player. he, within the group, was one of the ones you could always count on. he was always around and was very reliable,” connor-moen said. “i could see him as a medic, as the type of person you could rely on when you were nervous or scared.”

benson’s neighbor alan bouffard was shocked to hear of the soldier’s death.

“my heart goes out to the family,” bouffard said. “he was a good kid. he didn’t get himself in trouble, he was friendly, and he had close relationships with all the members of his family.”

bouffard said benson took his work seriously, and had plans for when he returned from serving in afghanistan.

“he was very interested in the work he was doing in the service (as a medic), and he was interested in becoming an emt when he got out,” bouffard said.

benson was the son of david benson of mansfield and kathleen benson of norwood, and brother of kyle benson of norwood. bouffard described kathleen as “a good neighbor and good friend” and david as “devoted to the two boys.”

benson’s friends and former classmates at norwood high are also in shock over the news.

“when i got home, i burst into tears. so upsetting that such a nice person, a terrific person has passed away for serving our country,” lisa malinowski said. she graduated norwood high in 2003 “he was one of the kindest people i will ever meet in my life. he was a true gentleman. we always got together to watch wrestling pay-per-views, go to concerts together and just hang out as good friends did.”

army spc. keith d. benson passed away on 01/18/12.

marine lance cpl. kenneth e. cochran





remember our heroes

marine lance cpl. kenneth e. cochran, 20, of wilder, idaho

lcpl cochran was assigned to 9th engineer support battalion, 3rd marine logistics group, iii marine expeditionary force, okinawa, japan; died jan. 15, 2012 in helmand province, afghanistan, while conducting combat operations.


parma — born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, kenny cochran spent his first days in a neonatal unit fighting to survive. for the next 20 years, he didn’t take a moment for granted.

“live life every second, because every second counts,” kenny wrote for an assignment at parma high school on his life goals.

he also wrote that the country he’d most like to visit was afghanistan. he wanted to be a marine, and he thought afghanistan was a place where he could test his body and soul, where he could learn to fight and bring honor to himself and his country.

about 450 people gathered in the parma high school gymnasium sunday to remember kenny. the marine from wilder died in afghanistan jan. 15 at age 20.

in a written statement, kenny’s mother, julia, remembered her son as always on the move. as a child, he zoomed around on a red electric jeep. later, he graduated to a model a pickup go-kart his father built, then a motor bike and finally a camaro.

motoring around, he always shone an ebullient smile, she said.

his uncle, jim howell, recalled kenny as an energetic boy running wild with his brother and sisters. after the others grew tired, kenny would keep playing, alone. he entertained himself with a game: he would knock on a door then jump out of the doorway and laugh out loud, pretending to surprise himself, howell remembered.

as he grew, kenny harnessed his energy.

at 13, he decided to become a marine like his father, george. but he doubted the marines would take him, so he endeavored to become stronger and smarter. he trained with weights and studied from a book of vocabulary words he kept in his pocket.

kenny also developed a love for the written word. he had a hard time talking about his beliefs —  honor, freedom and responsibility — so he spent endless hours creating stories, poems and essays, expressing himself through writing.

“his ideals came from an earlier era of chivalry,” his mother said. “he would have made an exceptional knight during the early crusades.”

his pastor, dale larson, remembered sitting in his pickup truck one day when kenny approached him and started a conversation. the parma high graduate seemed so mature and spoke so eloquently about matters of faith that larson was awestruck.

kenny was concerned about people acting selfishly when there’s so much good work to be done in the world, larson said. he believed that life is about helping others.

“i watched him walk away and thought, there is a good man. he is a good man,” larson said.

kenny also had a mischievous side.

his uncle recalled going over to the cochrans’ home one day, and seeing a police cruiser outside. kenny and his brother, geo, had convinced a neighbor girl that a gorilla was rumbling around in their basement. the frightened girl believed their story and called her mother.

the girl convinced her mother, and the mother convinced the police, kenny explained to his uncle with a satisfied grin.

another time, kenny visited his uncle’s house, which was under construction. after writing his favorite bible verse, psalm 23, on a beam, kenny climbed up into the unfinished rafters and began walking around.

his uncle looked up and expressed concern for his nephew’s safety.

“he told me, ‘i’m going to be a marine. if i fell off, i wouldn’t be a very good marine.’ i had to let kenny go. i had to let him be his own person,” jim howell said.

the cochran family has a legacy of military service. kenny’s mother, julia, is an army captain on active reserve, his father, george, is a retired marine, and his older sister, joyce, is an army specialist.

joyce cochran was also serving in afghanistan when kenny was there. about a week before he died, they spent time together.

kenny showed her around his base and introduced her to his fellow marines. he was happy to be with his sister and proud to be in afghanistan following his life’s dreams.

“he died wearing his marine uniform. he was so proud of it. i can be happy knowing he will be in it until the end of time,” joyce said.

marine lance cpl. kenneth e. cochran was killed in action on 01/15/12.

army sgt. 1st class benjamin b. wise





remember our heroes

army sgt. 1st class benjamin b. wise, 34, of little rock, ark.

sfc wise was assigned to 3rd battalion, 1st special forces group, joint base lewis-mcchord, wash; died jan. 15, 2012 at landstuhl regional medical center, germany, of injuries sustained jan. 9 in balkh province, afghanistan, when enemy forces attacked his unit with small-arms fire.


ark. family loses second son in afghanistan

by tim talley, associated press

the war in afghanistan has claimed the lives of two sons of an arkansas couple who also have a third son in the military.

sgt. 1st class benjamin wise, 34, of little rock, was on his fourth deployment overseas when he was injured during an insurgent attack on his unit last week. he died from his wounds sunday at hospital in germany, the department of defense said in a statement tuesday.

 his brother, 35-year-old jeremy wise, was killed in a terrorist attack on a cia outpost in afghanistan in december 2009. he was a former navy seal working as a security contractor.

their brother, marine corps cpl. matthew wise, is based hawaii but was in germany to be with his brother, his wife amber said. she said she was at benjamin's home in washington state watching his children, but she declined further comment.

the army ranger is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.

the men's parents, dr. jean and mary wise of hope, ark., and their sister did not return telephone messages seeking comment from the associated press. but the family released a statement thanking friends and benjamin's fellow soldiers "for their sincere expressions of sympathy during this very difficult time."

his family described him as a loving husband, devoted father, caring son and selfless soldier.

"the wise family is sincerely touched by the concern and interest all have taken in ben's life, his career and his sacrifice for our country," they said in the statement. "ben was proud of the career he built in the army."

he was assigned to the 3rd battalion, 1st special forces group, joint base lewis-mcchord in washington.

benjamin wise, who entered military service in 2000, discussed his work as a soldier in a september 2004 interview with the hope star newspaper.

"it's something i've wanted to do for a while now," he told the newspaper. "i was in college and i took a break from college and thought i'd do it now while i was relatively young. i wanted to serve my country, and do something that i found exciting."

wise compared his work as a soldier to a job, noting that "there are a lot of frustrating things about being over there, about being with people from another culture and the special circumstances.

"but, at the end of the day, it's a job and we're specialists in the field. the troops are sent there to accomplish a mission," he said.

members of arkansas' congressional delegation released statements of condolence and described benjamin wise as a hero.

"his bravery, dedication and patriotism exemplified what it means to be an american soldier and i am eternally grateful for his selfless sacrifice," said democratic rep. mike ross. republican rep. tim griffin added: "he dedicated his life to serving in defense of our country and has earned the deepest respect of a grateful nation."

sen. mark pryor, d-ark., said wise served in iraq as well as afghanistan.

"while arkansas has lost a great patriot, the wise family has paid an extraordinary price in service to our country," pryor said.


family loses second son in afghanistan

hope, ark. —the family of a local doctor has lost a second son to the war in the middle east.

the department of defense confirmed this morning that sergeant 1st class benjamin b. wise, 34, of little rock, died sunday at landstuhl regional medical center, in germany, of wounds sustained in combat on jan. 9 in balkh province, afghanistan.

wise was an army ranger assigned to the 3rd battalion, 1st special forces group, joint base lewis-mcchord, washington. he was injured during an attack by insurgents against his unit in a small-arms fight, according to the dod.
the assignment in afghanistan was part of wise's fourth deployment overseas, and was in support of operation enduring freedom.

upon completion of basic combat training, advanced individual training and the basic airborne course at fort benning, ga., in 2001, he was assigned to the 520th infantry regiment, 2nd infantry division at joint base lewis- mcchord where he deployed to iraq as a member of the battalion scout platoon from 2003-2004.

in 2005, wise volunteered for the special forces assessment and selection course and was selected to continue training as medical sergeant in the special forces qualification course.

after graduating from the special forces qualification course in 2008, wise was assigned to 3rd bn, 1st sfg (a). during his time with the unit, he deployed once to iraq and twice to afghanistan.

wise’s military education included the warrior leader’s course, the advanced leader’s course, the survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (sere) course, the recon and surveillance leadership course and the basic airborne course.

he was the son of dr. jean and mary wise, of patmos, and is survived by his wife, traci, and sons, luke and ryan, and daughter, kailen.

the wise family issued a statement through the dod this morning.

“the wise family is sincerely touched by the concern and interest all have taken in ben's life, his career and his sacrifice for our country,” the statement said. “ben was proud of the career he built in the army.

“we would like to thank friends and his fellow soldiers for their sincere expressions of sympathy during this very difficult time,” the family said. “your support is appreciated as we mourn the loss of ben who was a loving husband, a devoted father, a caring son and a selfless soldier.”

the family has declined to respond to questions or requests for interviews, according to the statement.

sgt. 1st class ben wise was the second son from his family to make the ultimate sacrifice in service to his country, the first being his brother, jeremy, a former navy seal who was killed in a terrorist attack against a cia outpost in afghanistan in december, 2009.

sgt. 1st class ben wise, in a september, 2004, interview with the hope star, said he was proud to be a professional soldier.

“it's a job,” he quipped. “yes, there are a lot of frustrating things about being over there, about being with people from another culture and the special circumstances. but, at the end of the day, it's a job; and, we're specialists in the field. the troops are sent there to accomplish a mission.

“it's something i've wanted to do for a while now,” he said at the time. “i was in college and i took a break from college and thought i'd do it now while i was relatively young. i wanted to serve my country, and do something that i found exciting.”
