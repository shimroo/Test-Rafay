	 evolutionary creationism?
    


i have found a post about the atheon that provides me with a convenient label for my beliefs on our origin, if you will: evolutionary theology or evolutionary creationism. i have believed in this way for a very long time and its just nice to know that i am not alone in my thoughts and to have a label for it.
it appears that a man named michael dowd pioneered this belief in his book "thank god for evolution"". i will have to pick it up and give it a read.labels: politics, religion, science

	 yoga studio update
    


i have been working slavishly for the past few months on a business plan for a yoga studio that tanya and i want to start in the baraboo area. writing a business plan has been a lot of work and a lot of research, and, wow, does my head hurt. =) the hardest part of writing it is the financial projections. a lot of problem with this step is attempting to pull realistic numbers out of my but. i have not found a place where good statistics can be found for student attendance projections for yoga studio start-ups. on the plus side we have finally decided on a name for the studio. yea! 
we have found the perfect building, now it is just a matter of getting the financing for it. we are trying to find a way to raise a +/- $20,000 and then we can start our dream.
we may have to lease first and then take the time to either raise the money to purchase the building or show that our studio can be quite successful so that the banks do not have to worry about repayment.
if there is anyone out there that is interested in helping us or investing in a yoga studio let us know.labels: business, yoga

	 another reason to vote obama....
    


obama good!
mccain bad!
if you care about civil rights here is another reason to "vote for obama": 
ultra-conservative puritanical religionist republicans of dooooom!
civil rights has a history, (especially under bush politics) of suffering and being violated horribly under a republican regime - i am talking to you patriot act, to which the aclu has had to fight hard to try and fix. who knows how many innocent people's lives have been wrecked with these horrible laws in effect. will these people whose rights have been violated ever be compensated for their governments enforcement of these broken laws? no. they will receive a "my bad!" and then be left tot recover from having their life destroyed by an illegal law.
the next president will most likely have the chance to nominate 2 or 3 supreme court judges. the mccain camp is against gay rights which is very strongly a civil rights issue which he is against from a puritanical and ultra-conservative (save me some votes) standpoint. this way of thinking is one of the greatest problems with the republical party - conservative christian religionism is their hidden mantra.
mccain will appoint judges that will enforce a close-minded backwards-traditional mindset and in an attempt to crush all of cultural progress out of fear, as well as crushing our civil rights in the process.labels: civil-rights, computer, gay-rights, politics, poly

	 500gb maxtor one touch external drive crash...
    


well, this weekend our 500gb maxtor external drive, which is less than 6 months old crashed in such a way as i was getting an error when accessing certain 2nd or 3rd level directories. the error was something like the directory is either corrupted or missing. i ran a check disk on it and it found all of the links to files and directories ok but the data behind it is gone. we have lost a lot of pictures, music and website work. =( this was a sad, sad weekend. i am hoping that i can recover some of what was lost.labels: computer, life

	 back tightness update...
    


so, as i previously mentioned that my back was really not happy with me due to picking up racquetball, and i was in quite the pain all weekend. i went to my wonderful chirpractor, dr. witter, at baraboo chiropractic on monday and he gave me a yoga pose to do called 'cat and cow'.
now i had heard of this pose before, and even performed it while i have, on occasion, practiced yoga with my wife. the doc prescribed this for me and i have been performing it for about 30 seconds - twice a day since then. i played 3 sets of racquetball against my 15 year old and really athletic nephew and i did not have any problems. wow! thanks doc! thanks yoga! labels: health, life, sports, yoga

	 the three party politcal system
    


i am unhappy with the 2 party system that we have currently. with this there is too much
i'm right and your wrong. type politics that goes on. i am predominantly a centrist, at least i think i am, and our political process could greatly benefit from a centrist party to balance out the zealous party devotionary lunacy that goes on much to the detriment of the people. to much stand behind this proposal because it is the  thing to do.
we need a party that is based on pragmatism, balance, and results that can work with and farm the other parties to create legislation that is balanced, well researched, and less biased towards the ideological extremist parties. one party has too much federal involvement the other too much state funded social programs (in some people's opinion). having a majority party with a bend towards balance and pragmatism would be great.
of course this is my (uninformed and ill researched) version of an ideological centrist party.labels: politics

	 my presidential vote....
    


well, presidential voting season is coming up and i think i know who i will be voting for. i have not really been following the polls or speeches or anything. i will try to do that more towards voting time. 
i am more liberal than most and i would really like to see a strong centrist candidate or libertarian candidate step up, but alas the world is quiet. i will most likely vote for barack obama this season. we need a change and i think with hillary clinton in the wings being tempered by barack that great things can come of it. so i hope....labels: life, politics
