      mark's notcast ep 394 : ac/dc's pop-up store in camden, 03 july 2024!

      mark's notcast ep 393 : the bowie ranking! 1966-2016. 1 july 2024
with 29 studio albums, 23 live albums, and about 4,000 best of's and compilations... david bowie was prolific. having talked about every era individually, i now talk through my ranking of his live albums, studio releases, and also pick out one specific unofficial release, one rarities set, and one best of as my favourites. there are some rules : only material bowie himself knew about and / or approved in his lifetime are included. there's a lot of unnecessary compilations in there, and i avoid them all! 01 july 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 392  : the stone roses "garage flower", early years. 27 june 2024.
few bands arrive as fully formed perfection, and the stone roses (britain's most overrated band), certainly took their time, with two singles - one great, one not so - and an unreleased album to mark their evolution into their full potential. the album itself, abandoned when the label ran out of money to release it, was produced by martin hannett, is a fascinating curio of a band in transition with barely a hint of what they would become. here it comes! 27 june 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 391 : random record russian roulette #8. 25 june 2024
"what's in the box?" screams brad pitt. "what's in the box?" well. i don't know, and neither do i... time to look in a bag of goodies chosen by the 14 year old : 1 7", 1 lp, 1 book, 1 cd, 1 dvd and 1 bluray. here we go!  anything embarrassing? let's find out. 25 june 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 390 : pulp on fire, the early years 1978-1991. 23 jun 2024.
pulp's relatively obscure early years, from 1978 to 1991, saw a slow coalescing of like minded freaks and weirdos over three albums - "it", "freaks" and "separations" - and a number of small selling singles (mostly collected into the "masters of the universe" compilation), as jarvis cocker found a gang that formed in sheffield, and, despite hapless record companies who created enormous delays between recording and release, slowly found their place, committed to grasping their one shot, and hitting the target. "separations" is an enormously under-appreciated album by one of the best bands britain has ever had. 24 june 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 389 : iron maiden's "killers" 1981. 13 june 2024.
maiden's sophomore album, "killers" - the last with original vocalist paul di'anno - is a strange beast of old, unused songs and hastily written new ones, with a new guitarist adrian smith adding an extra dimension to the band, alongside some very dodgy lyrics. and then paul got fired.13 june 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 388 : pink floyd's "the final cut" 1982-1983. 10 june 2024.
described as "the final straw" by david gilmour, the final album that roger waters made with pink floyd in 1982-1983, is subtitled "a requiem for the post-war dream" and is about as cheery as it sounds. a dense 12 song concept album about war, politics, and the failure of idealism to defeat  conflict and oppression, it's made of songs that didn't fit "the wall", extra songs designed to stitch the spare parts together, underpinned against the backdrop of the falklands war. propositioned as a solo lp, with the band disintegrating, it's a powerful, but joyless album that painted the band into a corner. 10 june 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 387 : morrissey's "vauxhall and i" 1993-1994. 3 june 2024
morrissey's fifth lp - "vauxhall and i" - is possibly his best solo album, a stunning, delicate, tour de force that explores a new adult identity, with an embedded band, great co-writers, and a lyrical obsession with belonging, nostalgia, loss, betrayal, violence, the relationship between artist and audience, the search for identity and what it is to be a man in a lost britain in 1993. i love this album, and you should too! 03 june 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 386 : a trip to "set to stun", the bbc scifi exhibition in acton! 31 may 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 384 : pet shop boys "nonetheless" / "furthermore" 15 may 2024
pet shop boys 18th* album, "nonetheless" was released on 26th april - and i thought rather than do a quick episode for clicks, i'll let it settle first. preceded by "loneliness" and "dancing star", the album came in a plethora of formats, including a bluray, coloured vinyl, a bonus ep "furthermore", creating a tapestry of songs exploring identity, community, and separation in covid. 15 may 2024.*if you count "relentless", "battleship potemkin", and "the most incredible thing" which i do..

      mark's notcast ep 381 : kraftwerk's "electric cafe" 1983-1987. 30 april 2024.
the tenth kraftwerk studio album - "electric cafe" - is my favourite of their records with a subtle theme about man and technology enabling a global village united by electricity, industry and electronics, and how this transforms human relationships. it's a visionary record about the layers of reality and our inner and outer lives, but also the last one by the 'classic; 1975-1987 lineup. it took 5 years to make, over 750 studio sessions, a bicycle crash, an abandoned lp and tour, a standalone single, a video finished two years before the song was ready, low charting singles, endless remixes and overthinking, creative paralysis, and ultimately resulted in the band fracturing. i love this album though, and it has grown in stature with time. like much of kraftwerk it was ahead of its time, and in many ways, it still is. 30 april 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 380 : blur's "parklife" turns 30! 25 april 2024
blur's third album was released 30 years ago today, "parklife" becoming inescapable, vastly outselling pink floyd and leading the transition of culture from nirvana to the 'britpop' ascent of blur, oasis, pulp and suede. lead by "girls and boys", followed by "to the end", "parklife", and "end of a century", the lightning-in-the-bottle moment saw blur connect violently to the world they were coldly judging, with a slight cruelty in the lyrics alongside a surplus of below par b-sides and a surprising and clear riposte from pulp the following year. gloves off! 25 april 2024.

      mark's notcast ep 378 : flaming lips "oczy mlody" (and more!) 2015-2018. 21 april 
the flaming lips 14th studio album "oczy mlody"* (recorded between 2012-2016) was released in 2017, and i go through this era : the miley cyrus collaboration lp, the remix lp, "the soft bulletin" live album, guest appearances with vessels, two non album singles, the notion of a band [and what is a band anyway?], the ability to self-identify who you are vs. who other people want you to be,  and how the concept of an album has changed over the years.*excluding numerous side projects, aliases, and other experiments which makes it 21 albums.

      mark's notcast ep 376 : iron maiden's debut turns 44 & its old enough to know better! 14 april 2024. 
iron maiden, world-dominating popular british heavy metal rock combo, released their first lp 44 years ago today on 14th april 1980, so it is time to scale the mountain of hairy, misogynist man rock. it sounded ok when i was 15, but um, not so much now i am 50! i also rate the lyrics on the scientifically proven swarm scale of stupidity and offensiveness, and overall, it does not go well. 14 april 2024.

30 years ago today oasis released "supersonic", and ahead of the inevitable britpop nostalgia that will drown us all later on this year, i go into the bands early years, the debut lp "definitely maybe", and up to the end of 1994, with singles "supersonic", "shakermaker", "live forever", "cigarettes & alcohol" and "whatever". 11 april 2024.

thanks to ‪@runoutgrooves274‬  who asks "can you remember the moment when music stopped being background noise and became a way of life?". i can remember the exact song. also ‪@bnhli7190‬  has a question, which gets answered at the end!
