“successfully treated over 120,000 patients, 94% of them go home catheter free!”















the prolieve® transurethral thermodilatation™ therapy (tutd™) offers a unique “thermo+dilatation” treatment for symptoms of enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). prolieve® is fda approved and is the least invasive bph treatment on the market.
with the balloon compressing the prostate, prolieve® is a dual modality therapy simultaneously treating the gland with focused heat and dilatation. with the 5-year patient follow up approved and accepted by fda in 2018,  prolieve® has been proven fast, safe and effective.
94% of the patients do not require a post treatment catheter and the associated risks including retrograde ejaculation and erectile dysfunction are extremely low. majority of patients experience significant and immediate relief, and the treatment results are also sustainable.
the treatment is a 45-minute, in-office, outpatient procedure which is performed and well-tolerated under local anesthesia. there is no need to go to the hospital and patients can return to their normal daily life right after the treatment.
