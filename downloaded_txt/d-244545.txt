sacred
science - creating an advanced
science and awakening
you to your full power and potential.


 


why
is svp important?


"the
science of the future will be based on sympathetic vibrations."
rudolph steiner, 1913

can you really afford to be
left behind? 




"there is a celestial mind-force, a great sympathetic force
which is life itself, of which everything is
composed." john
worrell keely 


  achieving vibratory
rotation
has been and continues to be our chief scientific and engineering
focus. in our replications of john worrell keely's devices (the
dynaspheres) we have already achieved intermittent rotation (and
considerable other etheric/psi effects) but not yet continuous
rotation. our continuing research and experimentation has
yielded considerable understanding of how this ubiquitous and universal
natural rotation occurs. whether that rotation manifests as spinning
atoms, tornados, hurricanes, rotating planets or galaxies.

 over 100
years ago, john
ernst
worrell keely (1827-1898), developed
an advanced
synthesis of science and philosophy. keely
was harnessing sound,
light, heart, mind and will to operate revolutionary new machinery and
to improve life and health. this is a science based on
natural law governing life, hope and love and not death, despair and
destruction. we, at svp, are developing and applying this science today
for a better tomorrow. if you are looking to improve your life or
develop new technologies or awaken your greater consciousness then you
want to know all about this wholistic merging
of feeling, emotions, spirit, intuition, science, music, art
and philosophy
is based on the fact that everything in the universe vibrates and
oscillates. therefore the connecting link between all that there is is
vibration. by studying and applying the principles of vibration we are
enabled to see
beyond material matter (effects) and into the very nature of
the causative forces
of nature operating by immutable natural and
universal laws.
svp empowers you to change and transform your life or develop new
technologies. 


   



 "to
know the mechanics of the wave [vibration/oscillation]
is to know the entire secret of nature." walter
russell 







   




 these
universal principles, laws and dynamics have been well organized and
developed as found in music and acoustic science. the result is a whole
new view into life, science and nature - based on universal laws
instead of misbeliefs, greed or lust for power. it was predicted by rudolph
steiner
in 1913 that the science of the future will be based on sympathetic
vibrations. that is what is being presented on this site. read
the evolving cosmology.

"dale, i encourage others to
search within
to learn and study the basics of svp.you are correct in your statement,
that svp is not just the hard-core facts associated with physics, but
also the heart of things beginning within, of love and understanding.
it is through love and understanding that we experience compassion
through sympathetic association that we are able to honestly begin to
understand what svp represents. without such understanding, the whole
concept is somehow lost. it is like two sides of a coin, each with a
separate picture of representation, yet it takes both sides to make it
complete, whole. this is the same with svp,signature vibrations and
most aspects of life. without your teachings, your work, i would have
never discovered the "other side "of my own work. it is through such
education made possible through svp that has made the difference and
for that i sincerely "thank you!" t
