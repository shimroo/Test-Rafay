	 a long time coming...
	 
    


it's been long over due since i've last blogged. i've missed the ncaa basketball season, even though i was a sports blogger for "our world", i think it just kind of ceased to exist anymore. i had cover everything from nascar to my favorite women's ncaa basketball. but now it's time for me to get back on track with my own blog. will anybody read it. i doubt it, but its for me i guess. i had an great internship this summer. where else could i have been happier working than an sports network. everything was motorsports related, but i loved it. i miss my coworkers and am scared to embark on my new internship. the new one will have nothing to do with sports, but i will be interning with channel 13 in winston salem. i hope everything goes well with that one. this summer i gained great clips for my resume tape and hopefully i will be as successful in my new one. it seems the people around me have more confidence in me than i have in myself. classes have been ok so far, just stressed out now about getting 65 internship hours by midterm. i did attend an extra credit event on campus that will allow me to gain three hours for writing a one page paper on the spike lee documentary, when the levees broke". it was followed by a panel discussion. this gave me what i was looking for to write my speech for my other class. so it's funny how things work together sometimes. i am also looking forward to convergesouth. i had forgotten my joy of blogging until i saw a flier for it. i can't wait to start commenting and posting. but i think this is enough for this entry. time to go search others.

	 vick vs. young
	 
    


of course vince young is not only the better quarter back in this case, he's the bigger man. peter schrager for fox sports put it greatly.http://msn.foxsports.com/cfb/story/5234132?gt1=7643

	 vick at it again
	 
    


http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2285819marcus vick gets arrested yet again. i would think after being dropped from tech, being arrested, and losing his license he would have learned something by now. why do the people who can throw a ball get all the free rides in life?

	 farewell marcus vick
	 
    


http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/bowls05/news/story?id=2282642the hokies finally make marcus vick man up to his problems. he was kicked off the team. from giving underage girls alcohol, to stomping on over players calf. drug problems, hes been there and done that also. any other players or student would have long been kicked off the team and out of the university. why can't newport news or bad newz as those of us who live or lived there call it have one success althete make it and not have a criminal record to go along with it.

	 v-girl
	 
    


what exactly is a v-girl? a girl from virginia according to trey songz with his new single. of course i am from virginia and i heard the song while i was home for break. i like the song. its about time we have a song people tend to hate va. it has break through potential but people probably won't play it outside of this state. but they will rep ga and ny for life and have never been there a day in their life. i like the song so i guess that's all that matters now.

	 lsu starter suspended
	 
    


florence williams a starter for lsu lady tigers was suspended immediately for three games for undisclosed reasons by the ball club. the tigers are ranked number three in the nation. hopefully, my favorite team will not be hurt too much by this supension. williams is one of my favorites on the team. she plays her role well on the team.

dewayne wickham is a editorial writer for usa today, he also teaches at north carolina a&t state university. recently i read one of his articles about suicide and rates spiking at christmas time. i learned that he had lost his parents when he was 8. his father murdered his mother and than took his own life. a tough situation for anyone for to deal with yet a lone an eight year old. suicide needs to be addressed in this country just like poverty.

	 oh no, books
	 
    


the new year has come and its almost time to head back to school. the sad part i'm broke and i haven't even brought books yet. the bookstore of course rips you off. i try to find my books online. typically, amazon.com and campusi.com help me out a lot. maybe books should just be included in the high price of education. if anybody wants to donate to my book and bill fund i would gladly accept.
