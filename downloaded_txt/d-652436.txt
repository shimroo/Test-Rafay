meet the owner 
my name is whitney and i am from kansas city, mo. i played competitive fastpitch softball for over 15 years and received softball and academic scholarships to play in college. i obtained b.a. in organizational communication in 2009 at william jewell college and m.a. in school counseling in 2013 at umkc. i am currently working on my second master's degree in elementary education.
i started gym-style.com in june 2005 as a hobby. i built websites during my spare time throughout college years. due to high demand, i decided to go full-time after i received my master's degree in 2013.
during my spare time, i enjoy spending time with my family and friends, playing with my two crazy dogs, watching kc chiefs, reading, traveling, photographing and hanging out at the lake.
