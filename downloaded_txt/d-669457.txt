welcome
if you find yourself longing to know what river travel in ohio was like or are just looking to spend sometime outdoors, paddle & camp ohio (formerly ohio historical canoe route association) can answer those interests and curiosities for you. 
	

members of paco have found that river travel is an excellent way to capture a sense of ohio's history. joining in on paco events offers an eye-opening look at the natural beauty of ohio. through first-hand experience members get to understand the dependence native american and european explorers had on river travel in ohio. 

            



our history
ohcra was conceived by odnr, chief of the division of watercraft, jim french, in the fall of 1982. the purpose of ohcra was reopening and canoeing the three ohio river to lake erie routes used by the native american indians. now in it's 42nd year of paddling the streams of ohio, ohcra members have fun exploring the water highways of the great state of ohio.
