build the right thing fast, instead of the wrong thing right.


at storytell, we do a lot of user-driven rapid prototyping and learning in public. that process can be vulnerable and messy, because inevitably, we learn from our users who teach us that what we thought was the right answer to their problem was actually just a starting point.

converting starlink to a 12v "always on" system (updated!)


update: sept 2024:

i originally used the starmount system to convert my dish from 110v to 12v. that did not go well, as i outline in this video update:

product led growth
the "rocks vs. ripples" approach to product-led growth


i find product-led growth to be comprised of defining future priorities (qualitative) while measuring past results (quantitative). it's like throwing a rock into water and then reacting to the ripples.
