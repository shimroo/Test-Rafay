mission statement

this is an anthology and encyclopedic reference to canaan/ phoenicia and its people.  (please see introduction: summary).
note: phoenicians,
                      canaanites & punic/ carthaginians are the same people: eastern
                      canaanites called phoenicians by the greeks & western canaanites
                      called punic by the romans. both referred to themselves as canaanite. 

approach to history

 in writing this history, i tried to be open to new and controversial subjects. in some instances; hence, some sections may contradict others in the same site. yet, i would not tolerate blatant, outrageous claims. i categorically affirm that i have  no political, religious or ethnic agenda that promotes or dissemination information about my phoenician canaanite ancestors. suggestions of nationalism, fanaticism or political propaganda are emphatically rejected.â 


                    the history covers the original canaanite phoenicians. also, it covers the various ethnic groups who intermarried with them, over thousands of years. the main stock of these people is canaanite phoenician, which has been scientifically proven by recent studies. they also include others who assimilated by choice or invasion. therefore, the philistines, assyrians, macedonians, mesopotamian, persian, greeks, romans, syriacs, byzantines...etc. that settled in canaan/phoenicia or its colonies and called them their homesâ areâ included in this scope. the site is not meant to be nationalistic but attempts to identify the said people's contribution to the ancient and modern world.â 

phoenicia died out misinformation

many ignorant historians claim that phoenicia ceased to exist in 64 b.c. â that "happened" when it became part of the roman world. but, in 425 a.d. official roman records show the division of phoenicia prima into two provinces:  phoenicia 
                    maritima and phoenicia libanensis. in the early byzantine times, the count of phoenicia governed phoenicia. in 380 a.d., saint jerome wrote: 'damnatur origenes a demetrioâ episeopoâ exceptisâ palaestinae...et phoenicisâ atqueâ achaiaeâ sacerdotibus' since 231 a.d. â this means that he considered phoenicia as a separate entity.â 

                      at the council of nicaea in 325 a.d., eleven bishops were present from phoenicia. they were the bishops of tyre, damascus, sidon, tripolis, paneas, berytus, palmyra, ptolemais, alasus, emesa, and antaradus. saint augustine (400 ad) witnesses to the same account of saint jerome. the church councils of tyre (449 & 515 ad), do the same, as well. and last but not least, the fall of phoenicia to the arabs (640 ad), testify to the continued existence of phoenicia, in the seventh century. finally, church tradition of naming the major bishops of phoenicia, honorary, living title of 'metropolitan archbishop of phoenicia maritima.' lebanese bishops continue to carry this title today (see page 
                      with translation -- mp3 byzantine psaltica chants: bishop 
                      of beirut & bishop 
                    of tripoli)  are a few of many solid proofs that phoenicia and its people live on despite the misinformation.â 

religious books & historical fiction

there is some history in the bible, torah, and other religious writings. using any of these books for historical research and discussions is unacceptable. i am a melkite greek christian and do respect the bible as a book of faith, not a book of history. holy books and their mythological stories are unreliable historical sources. yet, limited historical outlines from the bible may be referenced, in very limited terms. i reject "proofs" of historical or genealogical significance based on religious books. if you don't like my statement, leave this site immediately. heretical fundamentalist (evangelicals) christians, conservative jews or radical muslims, must consider themselves warned. they will be severely dealt with if they badger me with their impudent e-mails. in short, you may not question my opinion on didactic, not a literal interpretation of holy books.â 

the semites -- a name invented in the 1700's

bible fanatics continue to shamefully write to me on the phoenicians. they claim the canaanite phoenicians were "cursed" by god. their silly reason is they are descendent of shem (sam, son of noah), using the bible as supporting "evidence." this claim is completely unfounded. there is no archaeological proof that noah existed. his flood story stolen from the epic of gilgamesh is a travesty. too many people, use the nounâ semite,â as if a race with this name existed. the term semites refers to a group of people who inhabited the levant and spoke similar languages. they were not of the same ethnic, genetical or cultural group. they were arabs, israelis, phoenicians, aramaeans, syriac...etc. many use the expression based on the unfounded, mythical biblical table of nations. i mean the descendants of the fictional character noah and his sons, shem, ham or japheth. the term semite does not have any historical origin. it came into use at the end of the 18th century* and thereafter became a standard technical term. the name semite used without denoting true ethnicity, but speakers of similar languages. the same applies to hamites & japhethites. common mistakes in history happen all the time. today, too many combine all the peoples of the middle east into one pan-arab group.â 
________________
 * the term semite was proposed 
                      at first for the languages related to the hebrew by ludwig schlözer, 
                      in eichhorn's 'repertorium', vol. viii (leipzig, 1781), p. 161. 
                      through eichhorn the name then came into general usage (cf. his 
                      'einleitung in das alte testament' (leipzig, 1787), i, p. 45. 
                      in his 'gesch. der neuen sprachenkunde', pt. i (göttingen, 1807) 
                      it had already become a fixed technical term. the catholic 
                      encyclopedia, volume xiii 

i accuse eurocentrics, judeocentrics, arabists & evangelical fundamentalist for stifling phoenician history                  


it became clear, during my research, that various ideologies affected phoenician history.  historians and archaeologists were quick to credit europeans or jews for phoenician achievements. hellenistic supremacist thought the greeks had exclusive access to knowledge.   they ignored the phoenician connection and credited the greeks, romans or israelites.
comments or correspondence about these points are not open for discussion.  abuse of open dialogue has made this measure necessary. all other subjects are, of course, open for discussions. 


canaanite phoeniciansâ areâ not arabs, israelis, or sub-saharan (black) africans. they originated in phoenicia 10,000 years ago and did not immigrant from arabia or any other place.

canaanite phoeniciansâ areâ not arabs, israelis, or sub-saharan (black) africans. they originated in phoenicia 10,000 years ago and did not immigrant from arabia or any other place. genetic, scientific studies prove this beyond the shadow of a doubt.
minimalists/nihilists reject the five books of moses. they suggest someone wrote them in the seventh century b.c. â  somehow, they claim that the israelites were actually canaanites themselves. this confuses phoenician canaanite history with israeli history (see the page entitled 'stealing'). the same is further confounded by evangelicals, british israelists and the fishy story of the tribe of dan. it is the so-called lost tribe of israel and considered phoenician. also, what precedes is further confused by fiction taught by the latter day saints (lds) church, the mormons.

roman bad press, antagonistic bible writers and fanatics

also, anti-phoenician sentiments were the result of bad press by roman historians. â this appeared after the punic wars and the defeat ofâ carthage. further, antagonistic writers of the bible expressed their hatred of the phoenician religion.  please see examples in the story of jezebel, elijah, and others.â phoenician queen jezebel ofâ israel (a phoenician princess)â brought her paganâ religion toâ israel.â fundamentalists obsessed with the literal interpretation of their religious books made matters worse. finally, the political fanaticism of others with various agendas clouds the truth even further.

arabists' antagonism

many groups of various religious backgrounds from countries, in 
                  lebanon and the levant, pan-arabists or fanatical pan-islamists, cannot tolerate the mention of the phoenicians. â theyâ refuse to hear about them or their descendants in the modern world. â they assume such a mention has political and religious overtones. â theâ same people carry canaanite phoenician dna. â phoenicianâ does not mean maronite christian. â itâ is something which nobody claims but which arabists assume.  further,â there is no reason for them, who sufferâ from this phoenician inferiority complex, to deny their heritage.â such people have no shame and are fools to ignore their great heritage. â atâ the same time, many lebanese, syrians, and westernâ mediterraneans (north african muslim arabs),â including europeans, do not share this opinion. â theseâ groups accept phoenician as their heritage and ancestry. â also, they are proud of this heritage.â please see: testimonial page on 'tunisia'â and the 'am i?'.â  regardless, canaanite phoenicians pre-date the arabs by thousands of years.  finally, for a resounding answer 'no; we are not arab', follow the link.
afrocentrics 

afrocentrism is not without blame in smothering phoenician contribution to the world. â â manyâ fools claim that the phoenician canaanites themselves were  sub-saharan african i.e. black. â thisâ is basedâ onâ unscientificâ biblical myths and some unfoundedâ claims.â theyâ claimâ that the canaanites were hamites, based on ham, the son of noah. â â also,â theyâ claimâ the punic were native, aboriginal north africans blacks.â  in fact, north africans are mostly amazigh/berber whose dna tests proveâ theyâ are eurasian.â this denies canaanite phoenicians theirâ rightfulâ place in history.â hannibal and other famous punics fromâ carthage, spain, portugal,â sicily...etc., areâ the people in question. â â phoenician/amazigh saint augustine testifies canaanite is "our own tongue."â 

the statement does notâ negateâ science.â humans evolved in africa andâ thereafterâ walked out and populated the world.â  see: migration.

warning

repeated notice: â commentsâ about all the above points are not open to discussion.â abuse of open dialogue has made this measure necessary. â so,â make your proclamations elsewhere.â i amâ not interested.â 

all other comments are welcome.
