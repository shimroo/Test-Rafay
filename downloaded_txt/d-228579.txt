the concord review



























welcome 
welcome to tcr.org, the online home of the concord review, inc. we believe that the pursuit of academic excellence in secondary schools should be given the same attention as the pursuit of excellence in sports and other extracurricular activities, and we have found that many students do exemplary work in history.
the concord review is the only quarterly journal in the world to publish the academic research papers of secondary students.
we encourage you to submit your history paper for consideration by tcr.
you may also want to submit papers to the national writing board to be assessed against an independent academic expository writing standard endorsed by harvard, michigan, princeton, stanford, virginia, yale, and 33 other selective colleges and universities.

varsity athletics are celebrated everywhere. we celebrate
