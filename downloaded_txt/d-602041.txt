rory
gallagher his life and
times  
by
marcus
connaughton

 rory
gallagher is a hero and icon of rock music. he inspired guitar players
from the edge to johnny marr, slash to gary moore, johnny fean to
philip donnelly, declan sinnott to brian may. he toured incessantly and
sold over 30 million albums worldwide. in 1963, at the age of fifteen,
rory bought his trademark fender stratocaster. he discovered the blues
when pop magazines and radio were scarce in ireland and later won the
melody maker guitarist of the year in 1972, ahead of eric clapton,
jimmy page and jeff beck. acknowledged as one of the world's leading
guitarists, he collaborated with his boyhood hero muddy waters, played
with jerry lee lewis, albert king and lonnie donegan.
 in this
compelling biography, contemporaries, fellow musicians, film maker tony
palmer and taste drummer john wilson tell stories about rory from his
meteoric rise in the late-1960s with taste to his remarkable solo
career. this is a compelling testament to the musical life of a shy and
retiring working-class hero, distinguished by his check shirts and his
astounding dexterity on acoustic and electric guitar - the guitarist
and blues man who blazed a trail for others to follow.

are trying to get the bbc to
honour rory gallagher by playing his shows on bbc4. i have made a
petition and it also has a facebook page and i would be honoured if you
were to put it on your website and let everyone you know about it, it
would mean the world. it has received the backing of band of friends
which has the sublime ted mckenna and gerry mcavoy and marcel
scherpenzeel. so, big endorsement and we are so grateful. i have
contacted the bbc and slowly but surely i think it will be done.
