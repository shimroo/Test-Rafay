						lies on both chamber and richland creeks just east of corsicana off u.s. highway 287. the dam stands in freestone county but most of the lake spills into navarro county. this y-shaped lake was built for municipal water supply but also provides excellent recreation. the main river arms still have acres of standing timber and brush that has yet to rot. fish habitat abounds. the turbidity varies with an average depth of 25 feet to a maximum of 85 feet.
