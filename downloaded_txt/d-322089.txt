if there’s one thing that takes the stress out of boating it’s easiness at the ramp, and that’s what my float-on boat trailer delivers.

the float-on difference






unsurpassed structure
there are many components that distinguish the quality of a float-on’s unsurpassed structure. our aluminum i-beam frame provides the safest and most durable trailer in the industry, optimal structural integrity, longevity, and resistance to flex and deformation stresses. the innovative aluminum i-beam adds strength to accommodate more weight, ease of loading and unloading and longevity.
 



 




easy on, easy off
we were the first in the industry to produce and provide the innovative float on technology in boat trailers. unlike other manufacturers, our trailers are technically engineered to your specific needs, making it a unique yet perfect fit to provide the best quality performance.















welded
with float-on trailers you can choose a standard i-beam construction or upgrade to a c-channel welded bunk set up, aluminum ladder with handrail plus several other upgrades.





service and parts

tires: inspect tires for wear, cracks, and proper inflation. over or under-inflated tires can cause issues like blowouts, which can lead to accidents.

brakes: if your trailer has brakes, they should be checked regularly for wear and function. this includes inspecting brake pads, brake lines, and ensuring that the braking system is responsive.
lights and wiring: ensure all trailer lights (brake lights, turn signals, and taillights) are functioning properly. check for any frayed wires or corrosion, which could cause lighting issues.
axles and bearings: lubricate the wheel bearings to avoid friction or damage that could lead to trailer malfunction. check axles for signs of wear, cracks, or bending.
frame: inspect the trailer’s frame for signs of rust or corrosion, especially if you’ve been launching in saltwater. regular washing and coating with protective rust inhibitors can help prevent long-term damage.
winch and straps: ensure the winch operates smoothly and that straps or tie-downs are in good condition to prevent the boat from shifting during transit.
suspension: check suspension components like leaf springs for wear and tear. these components help maintain stability during transport.
