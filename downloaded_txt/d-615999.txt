nature kenya—the east africa natural history society (eanhs)—is africa’s oldest environmental society. we were established in 1909 to promote the study and conservation of nature in eastern africa.
our mission is to connect people with nature and take action for biodiversity conservation.

yala swamp communities need your support to prevent the violation of their rights






nature kenya has learnt that the national land commission (nlc) intends to push ahead with the controversial allocation of 6,763.74 ha of yala swamp to lake agro ltd. this is despite sustained objections from local communities and other stakeholders. stand in solidarity with the communities in saying no to this allocation that violates their rights. sign our petition here.
