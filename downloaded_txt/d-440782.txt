gichigami-ziibihomeland of the anishinaabe



at the headwaters of lake superior lies the st. louis river, known to local anishinaabe as gichigami-ziibi ‘the river that flows into the great waters’. for nearly 14,000 years, native people have relied on the river for food, medicine, transportation, sport, and enjoyment. in 2020, the u.s. secretary of the interior designated the st. louis river estuary national water trail, and it is now included in the national parks trail system. this is a major accomplishment that is a result of a river in restoration. however, as more people are drawn to experience the st. louis river, it is more important than ever for us to share the stories of those who have forever called this land their home. as you explore the water trail, we encourage you to learn about and honor the life and lessons that this special place has held.learn more about anishinaabe history along the st. louis river on the onigamiinsing dibaajimowinan-duluth's stories website.

about usthe st. louis river alliance was born out of a group of concerned citizens that helped bring people together to clean up the st louis river. while there is much left to be done, the river is reflecting that care back to us.
