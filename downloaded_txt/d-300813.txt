"i’ve had them do several projects in my home. master closet, kitchen island and built in bar. every piece is unique and perfect. the cabinets are such great quality. and working with their design team is great. they took my ideas and made them even better. i loved going to their beautiful showroom and being able to pick out every piece of my project in one place. that convenience is worth every penny."

"mike made our kitchen dreams come true. he was amazing with design and layout of cabinets. the storage for wine, spices, large trays, pots and pans was well planned. his suggestions for materials for the bar area and back-splash were the icing on the cake! the cabinets are so beautiful and well-built. we are enjoying all the soft-close hinges on drawers and doors. we are so pleased with fairmont kitchen cabinets and mike's designs."
