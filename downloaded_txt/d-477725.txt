“the world has changed.
corporate espionage is the new honest competition.
you need operational privacy to compete.”


murray associates corporate counterespionage consulting services include electronic surveillance detection (tscm), identification of unnoticed information security vulnerabilities, and independent recommendations for enhancing business privacy.
before hiring a technical surveillance countermeasures (tscm) consultant, download our security director’s guide, and visit our free security reports page.

proactive corporate tscm debugging inspections
a corporate technical surveillance countermeasure (tscm) program normally includes quarterly or biannual evaluations to check for the presence of illegal surveillance bugging devices, such as: hidden microphones, transmitters, covert cameras, and recording devices. evaluations also include identifying other methods of information leakage, such as: security hardware failures, security policy violations, and the potential for leaks by normal office technology. the goal is to protect against insider threats and external espionage attempts.
emergency tscm evaluations
murray associates can respond quickly if you suspect there is an active threat. contact us immediately if you are concerned about any suspicious activity. be sure to read our recommendations for what you need to do, right now.
home office residential tscm
if you perform any business from your home office, it is crucial to keep your environment secure. our tscm security consulting services extend to the home office, so don’t hesitate to contact us if you would like an evaluation and recommendations for enhancing your home business privacy.
spy camera detection
detection of spycams is part of our proactive corporate tscm debugging program. however, we can teach you, or your security/facilities staff, how to do this without us on a regularly scheduled basis. you just need to know where to look, and what to look for. training costs less than a good dinner. conducting an inspection can be quick and easy. defending against lawsuits brought by visitors or employees who find a hidden camera in the restroom or changing area is not.

knowledge, competence, trustworthiness, loyalty, and discretion are all important. business and government organizations have relied upon murray associates’ corporate consulting services for all of these reasons, for over four decades.
headquartered in the new york metropolitan area, murray associates can assist you quickly, anywhere in the united states and internationally.
