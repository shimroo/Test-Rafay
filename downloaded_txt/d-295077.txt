frost's interview with johto times [permalink]
posted by jigglypuff on 20 nov 2024 at 9:19am pst
a few weeks ago, frost sat down (virtually) with johto times to talk about psypoke's history, his tcg collection, and more. you can read the interview here, as well as check out their other interviews chronicling the history of pokemon fan sites.we're all very honored that after all these years fans still remember us fondly, and grateful to johto times for inviting us to be a part of their interview series.we're still mostly retired from pokemon fandom these days, but as frost mentioned in the interview, we plan to keep the lights on around here for as long as it's feasible to do so. so whether you've also been around since 1999, or you found us during our mid-2000s heydays, or only just stumbled upon us during our current quiet, thanks for being a part of this with all of us.

crabrawler, sandygast, palossand and stufful debut! [permalink]
posted by frost on 19 aug 2016 at 7:33pm pdt updated on 19 aug 2016 at 7:34pm pdt
pokemon world champions brought us a new trailer today, immediately after yesterday's reveal of turtonator. technically, only one of these pokemon is new to fans who follow online leaks of corocoro: crabrawler (2', 15.4lbs), a fighting-type crab pokemon who has boxing gloves for hands and the abilities hyper cutter and iron fist. the other three new reveals were shown in the most recent corocoro, but now we know their english details. sandygast (1'8", 154.3lbs) and its evolution palossand (4'3", 551.2lbs) are a pair of ghost/ground-type sandcastles who get the new ability "water compaction," which raises defense by 2 stages when hit by a water-type attack. finishing out the video is stufful (1'8", 15lbs), the pre-evolution of bewear, a normal/fighting-type teddy bear who gets klutz and fluffy for its abilities and even has a stuffed animal tag on its butt. <3

new pokemon turtonator revealed [permalink]
posted by frost on 18 aug 2016 at 9:51am pdt
fire/dragon-type turtonator was revealed in a youtube trailer today. it gets shell armor as its ability and learns the new move shell trap, which sets a trap at the start of a turn and deals massive damage if turtonator is hit with a physical attack on that turn. sadly, this was all that revealed in today's video.

three new pokemon and alolan forms [permalink]
posted by frost on 11 aug 2016 at 10:07am pdt
morelull (8", 3.3lbs) is a grass/fairy-type who can learn spore and have illuminate or effect spore for abilities. wishiwashi is a water-type fish pokemon who uses its ability schooling to change between two forms, solo (8", 0.7lbs) and school (26'11", 173.3lbs) forms. finally, pyukumuku (1', 2.6lbs) is another new water-type with a new ability, innards out, which damages a pokemon equal to the number of hp pyukumuku had when it was knocked out.the three new forms are marowak, meowth and raichu. alolan marowak (3'3", 75 lbs) is ghost/fire-type and now gets cursed body in addition to lightningrod; alolan meowth is dark-type and retains pickup and technician; and alolan raichu is electric/psychic-type and gets a new ability, surge surfer, which doubles speed when electric terrain is in effect.

new alola forms, pokemon, trials and z-moves! [permalink]
posted by frost on 1 aug 2016 at 10:08am pdt updated on 1 aug 2016 at 10:09am pdt
this month's sun and moon youtube promo was uploaded this morning:first up, they drop the bomb that several existing pokemon will receive new forms based on the environment in which they're found within the alola region. these include a grass/dragon-type exeggutor (35'9", 916.2lbs) with an extended neck and the frisk ability; ice-type vulpix and ice/fairy-type ninetales with the snow cloak ability; and ice/steel-type sandshrew (2'4", 88.2lbs) and sandslash (3'11", 121.3lbs), who also have snow cloak.next, we get a string of new pokemon reveals! the bulk of the attention is dedicated to the bird pokemon oricorio (2', 7.5lbs), who has several different forms with changing types: baile style oricorio is fire/flying, pom-pom style is electric/flying, pa'u style is psychic/flying, and sensu style is ghost/flying. oricorio's ability dancer sees oricorio copy dance-themed moves used in battle, such as quiver dance, and it gets a new move named revelation dance that matches oricorio's current type.minior (1', 88.2lbs) is a rock/flying-type meteorite pokemon. as revealed with its new ability shields down, the default form of minior is a shield that protects it from status effects, but once minior falls below 50% hp, it will break and reveal an inner form more suited for attacking. minior's core can have up to four different colors.gumshoos (2'4", 31.1lbs) is the evolved form of yungoos and even more suited for the "donald trump pokemon" jokes that its pre-evolution has received thus far; it has stakeout and strong jaw for its abilities. mudsdale's pre-evolved form mudbray (3'3", 242.5lbs), said to be the donkey pokemon, was also revealed, and it too has own tempo and stamina for its abilities.the last two reveals are fomantis (1', 3.3lbs) and its evolution lurantis (2'11", 40.8lbs), a pair of grass-type manti who use plants for synergy and elegance. lurantis is revealed to know the new move grass blade, and both have the leaf guard ability.finally, some game mechanics are shown, including riding pokemon such as mudsdale, tauros and charizard, and the objective of the game is revealed to be "the island challenge" i.e. completing trials for type-themed trial captains officials such as mallow (grass), lana (water), sophocles (electric) and kiawe (fire). it should be noted that kiawe's profile on the official site states his main pokemon is marowak, perhaps indicating marowak will receive a fire-type alolan form. trial pokemon will await the end of each of these challenges.another new feature will be powerful new z-moves that pokemon can use once per battle. the trailer states that there is one z-move for each type, with pikachu using "gigavolt havoc," rowlett using "bloom doom," litten using "inferno overdrive" and popplio having "hydro vortex" in the video.the next news is set to be released august 12!

another youtube video reveals more pokemon [permalink]
posted by frost on 19 jul 2016 at 8:58am pdt updated on 19 jul 2016 at 9:06am pdt
this month's "reveal a whole bunch of new pokemon" contains six new additions, including the two who were revealed about a week ago in this month's corocoro.wimpod (1'8", 26.5lbs) is a bug/water-type with the wimp out ability, which allows wild pokemon to flee from battle if their health drops below half. hopefully, if it evolves, it will not randomly become bug/flying, masquerain. bounsweet (1', 7.1 lbs) is a grass-type with leaf guard and oblivious. it doesn't appear to reveal any new abilities or moves at this time.comfey (4", 0.7 lbs), a fairy-type hawaii lei pokemon, receives flower veil and a new ability, triage, which gives priority to healing moves. ground-type horse mudsdale (8'2", 2028.3 lbs) gets own tempo and the new ability stamina, which raises mudsdale's defense one stage when hit with attacks.finally, mimikyu and bewear were revealed in this month's corocoro. mimikyu is a ghost/fairy-type possessed doll who assumes the appearance of pikachu in an effort to become popular. its new ability disguise has mimikyu's pikachu costume take one hit for it, after which it slumps over. bewear (6'11", 297.6 lbs) is a normal/fighting-type red panda with fluffy and klutz as its abilities. fluffy is a new ability that halves damage from direct contact moves but double damage from fire-type attacks.in possibly the most exciting news for people who have wasted thousands of hours hatching pokemon eggs (like me!), a new feature called hyper training may actually let players raise the ivs of their pokemon? the official site doesn't come out and acutally say "ivs" since that's a fanon term, but the fact that they're hyping hyper training's effect as something that was never before possible seems to indicate this! exciting!!!

a new youtube trailer for sun and moon has revealed seven new pokemon as well as giving information for the previous revealed koala and dog pokemon from last month's corocoro:tapu koko, a rare pokemon to have a space in its name, is an electric/fairy-type with the new ability electric surge (looks like it activates electric terrain upon entering battle) and a new move nature's madness.grubbin's evolutions are charjabug and then vikavolt, both bug/electric-types. charjabug has the battery ability while vikavolt gets levitate.drampa is a normal/dragon-type who gets sap sipper and a new ability named berserker, while bruxish is a water/psychic-type fish that gets strong jaw and a new ability named dazzling (appears to negate priority moves). cutiefly is a bug/fairy-type that gets honey gather and shield dust as its abilities, and alola's pikachu ripoff togedemaru is an electric/steel-type who gets iron barbs and lightning rod as abilities.the official sun and moon website also updated with background information on all these new pokemon as well as komala and rockruff, who were previously only revealed in japan.
