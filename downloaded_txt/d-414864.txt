testimonials






i have never in my life received such understandable friendly and efficient service from any company to this high standard before. thanks again.
andy cumberland, retired


i just wanted to send a quick mail expressing our many thanks for the norbar industrial 5r-n, ¾”, ratchet adjustable torque wrench. the tool itself is a remarkable piece of engineering and fitted our needs perfectly and has even been the envy of our german contractors. the service provided by norbar was second to none, within 5 minutes of speaking with the uk sales manager the torque wrench needed for the job was selected and subsequently ordered and arrived ready for critical maintenance activities. i couldn’t recommend norbar enough to anyone who wants the highest quality equipment with a great service to match.
angus smith, engineer, kohler mira ltd.


i’d recommend the evo tool for doing our job. it’s handy to use, it seems to speed up the job and seems reliable so at the minute we’re happy enough and all’s good.
 
paul parr, crane engineer, lewis tower cranes ltd


i just wanted to feedback on this product. norbar tti20 torque wrench 1/4in square drive 4-20nm sku: nor13830 i bought it a few weeks back as i wanted an accurate torque wrench but it had to be small enough to fit between a bike engine and the frame. also it had to be easy to set up. plus it had to have the right range of torque. it's brilliant! so easy to set the chosen torque, easy to use and a really convenient size. i bought a torque wrench way back for a similar job and i always have to read the instructions again to get it right and it's just too big. this [norbar] product was recommended to me and i can see why. i will pass on the recommendation
 
andrew lambert, motorbike rider and enthusiast


our distributor was overwhelmed by your offer to replace their end-user’s torque wrench with the new generation on even though it was 18 months old – in their words “thank you that was unexpected and a example of how customer service should be.
 
david noon - sales director, sykes pickavant uk


your torque converter is mint, thanks for posting it. i've been looking for a good, easy to understand torque converter for a while, you've nailed it with yours, brilliant.
 
john halsall, twitter user


just wanted to drop you a quick note and say thank you for allowing the team to use your facilities and also for your kind hospitality. feedback from the guys was really good and they all came away very impressed with what norbar do and also how well you all work together.
 
chris millan, head of trade card


thank you again for your help and help of your team. i personally have never had a better customer service in my life. please pass my thanks to rachel.
 
maryia nazarava, spx flow
