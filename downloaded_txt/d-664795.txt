self-drive tours to the somme & ypres battlefields of ww1


























































 

 

 

 



for
the
time
being
we
very
much
regret
that
we
are
unable
to
ship
our
self-drive
guide
material
to
the
united
states,
new
zealand
and 
australia
due
to
delays
being
experienced
as
a
result
all
of
customs
procedures.
we
have
had
several
instances
where
our
guide
material 
has
taken
over
three
months
to
be
received
by
clients,
which
is
unacceptable.
we
are
also
mindful
of
the
procedures
and
challenges
the 
us/australian customs authorities have to address in providing the crucial service they provide. 
we
may
however
be
able
to
ship
your
guide
material
direct
to
your
first
hotel
if
in
the
uk
or
ypres
or
the
somme,
but
this
solution
may
not 
allow
you
time
to
pre-read
your
material
to
formulate
your
travel
expectations.
please
also
see
our
ypres
and
somme
itineraries
so
see 
whether they fit the agenda you have in mind.





“after spending 6 days touring the battle sites in belgium and northern 
france, we cannot praise battlefield tours 'package' highly enough - 
immense detail but easy to follow and customise [with] superb little 
photo illustrations for the navigator’s assistance. . .the package james 
provides is truly outstanding and beyond what we could have expected 
for its detail but practical guidance. . . a really nice chap, providing a 
brilliant service - what more could you ask for?” 
stuart & sue greengrass may 2024 










a
self-drive
tour
where
you
explore
the
battlefields
in 
the
safety
and
comfort
of
your
vehicle,
at
your
own
pace 
and
able
to
stop
whenever
you
please
to
investigate 
whatever
catches
your
eye,
is
perhaps
the
only
way
to 
truly
explore
the
battlefields
of
the
great
war.
most 
importantly
of
all,
you
will
always
have
our
acclaimed 
self-drive
guide
at
your
fingertips
to
take
you
on
a 
journey
to
unraval
and
reveal
the
history
and
legacy
of 
great war beneath your feet.
we
are
one
of
the
longest-standing
companies
specialising
in 
small-group
tours
to
the
somme
and
ypres
battlefields.

having 
taken
over
300
groups
on
tours
to
the
battlefields
of
ww1,
we 
have
now
transferred
that
expertise
to
a
self-drive
format
so
that 
you
can
explore
these
battlefields
on
your
own
or
with
family
or 
friends,
without
being
tied
to
a
coach
tour.
unsure?
maybe
see 
what travellers 
said
 when they returned!
in
a
nut-shell
you
chose
when
you
wish
to
travel
and
for
how 
long.
you
take
your
car
and
we
arrange
your
hotel 
accommodation,
leshuttle

channel
tunnel
crossing
and,
most 
importantly
of
all,
we
provide
you
with
our
acclaimed
self-drive 
somme
and/or
ypres
battlefield
guides
-
your
‘window
to
the 
past’,
including
all
the
directions,
maps
etc
you’ll
need.

no  
other 
self-drive  
guides  
have  
so  
much  
detail  
and  
are  
so  
easy  
to  
follow!

 
we
can
also
arrange
for
a
1:1
personal
guide
to
meet
you
at
your 
hotel
to
take
you,
and
just
you,
to
almost
any
ww1
battlefield
on 
the northern western front of france and belgium.






 


it’s
only
when
you
receive
our
guide
self-drive
guide
pack 
that
you
realise
just
how
different
and
how
detailed
our
self-
drive
guides
are
(a
comment
we
receive
time
after
time
-
see 
our 
trust pilot
 reviews and personal 
testimonials
). 
from
my
personal
experience,
visiting
the
battlefields
of
the 
great
war
is
quite
a
moving
experience,
an
experience
best 
appreciated
in
the
company
of
close
friends
or
family
(or
alone), 
without
any
restrictions
such
as
the
rigid
timetable
of
a
coach 
tour
dictating
the
pace.
it
can
be
quite
frustrating
to
see
the 
battlefields
passing
before
your
eyes
without
being
able
to
stop 
wherever
and
whenever
you
want
to
stop,
and
to
explore
where 
you
want
to
explore.
the
freedom
to
truly
comprehend
the 
impact
of
the
battlefields
at
your
own
pace,
equipped
with
your 
own
detailed
‘then
and
now’
guide(s),
is
what
i
always
set
out
to 
achieve, and perhaps what today sets our tours apart.

than
me
clutter
up

i
tend
to
do),

raved 
about

everyone 
i've
spoken
to
since
my
return 
(and

one
person
who's
definitely 
going
to
book
through
