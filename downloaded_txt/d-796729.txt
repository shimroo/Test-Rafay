college of arts and sciences


computer science






the computer science department at bgsu was the first cs department in ohio when it was established in 1969. for over 50 years, we have prepared many accomplished alumni to work in many capacities throughout the industry, and our program continues to grow. in recent years we saw a nearly 50 percent increase in student enrollment, and we’re working on developing new majors and specializations to attract even more quality students to fulfill market needs.
our computer science advisory board consists of faculty, alumni and it leaders that have a stake in the vitality of the department. our department meets the national standards for excellence and our program is one of few to have received the program excellence award from the ohio board of regents. in addition, the b.s. in computer science is accredited by the computing accreditation commission of abet, https://www.abet.org and the b.s. in software engineering is accredited by the engineering accreditation commission of abet, https://www.abet.org.

news and stories











students mentor young women in programming

bgsu computer science students are coaching the next generation through an innovative program designed to encourage females to study science. made possible by a $10,000 google ignitecs grant plus an additional gift from the widow of a former faculty member, the new program—code4her—provides free computer science mentoring for girls in grades 5 through 8. mentors are students in the bg women in computing (bgwic) organization. participants learn the basic principles of computer programming via lego mindstorms robots. the 32 participants came from 18 communities around northwest ohio.












internships lead to employment at adobe

alumna julia grummel had a dual major in digital arts and computer science and a great familiarity with adobe software products like photoshop and indesign. when she heard about internship opportunities at adobe as an undergraduate, she applied and landed what would become a three-summer internship at its headquarters in san jose, california. a month after graduation, she was offered a full-time job there. “the bgsu computer science program was really valuable because the department is so closely tied to the industry,” she said. “there were so many valuable opportunities that it made the transition from the classroom to corporate life much smoother.”












visually impaired and learning programming

there’s no question that teens love technology, and alex mitov is no exception. in fact, the bowling green high school student, who is visually impaired, not only navigates fluently with his phone and computer, but he also plans to major in computer science at bgsu after graduation. he’s currently working with assistant professor sankardas roy to further his programming skills. alex’s interest in computer science began about two years ago when a peer challenged him to a game of minecraft. in their current arrangement, dr. roy gives him java programming assignments that take a week or two to complete.
