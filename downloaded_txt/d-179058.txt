transcript







opening td logo animation.
we open on a dad in the kitchen. his ten-year-old son stands next to him.
son: hey dad?

dad: yeah, sport?

son: can we talk about your financial plan to pay for my education?

we’re now at a standing dinner party in another house. a friend of the host looks around, enamored with the house, then casually asks about her mortgage, as friends do...

guest: i am loving the new place, heard you got a good mortgage rate.

host: [no vo. giggling reaction from the host.]

we change scenes before she gets too into it. we’re now with a 20-something couple brushing their teeth.
girl: we have to talk about our retirement savings.

guy: i’m convinced that the earth is flat.

super: 55% of canadians avoid talking about money*

legal: *td omnibus survey conducted by maru/blue from november 18th to november 20th, 2022.
girl: no...
recognizable music begins playing.
we cut to see the couple sitting on green chairs across from our recurring female td advisor in a td branch.  the couple looks relieved.

advisor: don’t be afraid of the money talk… we do this kind of thing all the time.

the td advisor shows them the td goal builder on a tablet. we see a longer closeup of td goal builder. cut to advisor and couple at the door.
vo: get a better understanding of your money with our new goal builder tool and the helpful advice of a td advisor.

cut to the new dynamic td end frame with the green chair.
super: book an appointment today.

vo: td. ready to help you move forward.
