history

the history and transformation of palazzo avino
originally built in the 12th century, palazzo avino, like many other buildings along san giovanni del toro, was part of the aristocratic quarter of ravello during the middle ages and renaissance. some original rooms, such as the entrance hall and a small bathroom used as a cellar in the restaurant, remain intact.
the past
the building owes its name to the prosperous sasso family from scala, descendants of san romoaldo, founder of the cistercian order, and san domenico sasso, the successor to saint domenico who created the dominican order. the sasso family settled in ravello around 1710 when domenico diego purchased the remains of palazzo sasso from the noble bonito family and subsequently restored it. in 1756, his son andrea built a chapel dedicated to maria maddalena penitente, which is now the hotel’s lobby. andrea died in 1758 without an heir, leading to the palazzo being abandoned until the early 19th century.
the wealthy camera family purchased the building in the early 19th century. as tourism potential became apparent, the camera family, inspired by other local families, converted the palazzo into a hotel. the first foreign visitors began to arrive in the mid-19th century, including francis nevile reid in 1851 and richard wagner. ravello soon attracted many prominent people, such as virginia woolf, e.m. forster, maynard keynes, d.h. lawrence, and andre gide.
in 1928, the vuilleumier family took over the hotel’s management. known as hotel palumbo during this period, it hosted numerous distinguished guests, including kings, queens, aristocrats, poets, and writers. notable moments include the applause of duchess anna of aosta by the people of ravello during world war ii, playwright eduardo de filippo writing ‘saturday, sunday, monday’ on one of its terraces, and general eisenhower planning the attack on monte cassino while staying at the hotel. former celebrity guests ingrid bergman and roberto rossellini are fondly remembered for their laughter over dinner in the restaurant.
the hotel’s prosperous era was interrupted in 1978 when the vuilleumier family shifted to palazzo confalone, leading to 19 years of abandonment for palazzo sasso.
the present
fully restored, palazzo sasso re-opened in july 1997 to continue its historic adventure. in 2013, it was renamed palazzo avino, finally bearing the name of its founding family. the transformation from palazzo sasso to palazzo avino is a true italian love story filled with passion, beauty, and dreams, all set against the backdrop of italy’s stunning amalfi coast.
“i love the palazzo,” says managing director mariella avino. “i love the location, the views, and every single element. i love it because i grew up here. i know its past through my father’s dedication and effort to create the property, i appreciate its fantastic present, and i’m excited to write its future with my sisters, fueled by our passion, heart, and love.”

ravello 
situated on the cliff-top of the amalfi coast, ravello is a very important historical and cultural center. among the various places of outstanding interest are: villa rufolo, villa cimbrone and the cathedral of santa maria assunta. famous classical music concerts are held on a stage perched over the sea from july through october. for more information and the calendar of concert and other festival events, visit the following websites:
 



amalfi e positano  
amalfi is a picturesque coastal town with a sunny climate and exceptional natural beauty. in the 12th century, amalfi was one of the four great italian maritime republics. positano is regarded as the jewel of the amalfi coast. it’s a very coastal resort, it’s notable for its picturesque, precipitous townscape, built on steep mountain terraces and, in places, almost literally clinging to the rocks. it affords unparalleled views out porto the islands of li galli, which were famously inhabited by the legendary sirens, and beyond to the isle of capri.



capri 
the romantic isle of capri was once the unlikely centre of the ‘civilised’ world when tiberius ruled the roman empire from his 12 palaces built on its towering heights looking over the sea towards the old port of naples. the sublime beauty of the seascapes; its fabled ‘blue grotto’ and rocky shore of coves & beaches; its tangible atmosphere of 3,000 years of history & cosmopolitan cultures, and the traditional warm hospitality of the islanders have combined to draw an endless stream of visitors. there is hardly a writer or artist of note over the last 200 years who has not been enchanted by the unique allure of capri. today, its ‘capital’ town, hardly more than a village, is somewhat like a stage set for an 18th century operetta – a painted pastiche of small, lively squares; boutique shops & pastel or white-washed houses, and a warren of mysterious moorish alleyways no wider than a donkey cart loaded with the rough coral building blocks that over the centuries have fashioned a townscape of extraordinary artistry.



pompeii and  ercolanum 
this is the world famous campanian town of imperial roman times that was buried by a sudden, catastrophic eruption of mount vesuvius on the 24th of august 79 ad. it has been extensively excavated over the last two centuries so that much of the original town has now been exposed. the most fascinating aspect of pompeii is that it offers a walk back into time, back 2000 years, recreating the daily life of ordinary romans. visitors can stroll along the lava-paved roads past rows of shops and private houses, public baths, market squares and temples. pompeii is indisputably one of the world’s most mesmerizing architectural and cultural treasures. just at a few kilometres from pompeii is the town of ercolanu (herculaneum), also buried in the volcanic cataclysm of 79 ad. it’s smaller than pompeii, but in some ways is better preserved and can be more easily taken in on a day visit. driving time from ravello: approximately 1 hour.



paestum 
this is an original landing ground and settlement of the ancient greeks, founded around 600 bc its name derives from poseidon – god of the sea, to whom the town was dedicated. paestum is set in a vast and varied landscape and offers an almost mystic or spiritual experience to visitors taking time to sit and meditate in a quiet corner of a temple to the greek immortals, one of the most historic monuments in southern italy. in the vicinity is the town of velia and the provincial capital of salerno, with a medieval cathedral, dating back to 1085, renowned for its great bronze door from constantinople and a 12th century carved pulpit. driving time from ravello: approximately 2 hours.



caserta 
the city is known as ‘the versailles of naples’ and is home to the royal palace built by the bourbon-french emperor, charles iii. the palace is one of the biggest neo-classical buildings in europe and its park setting is both immense and fascinating. driving time from ravello: approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.



napoli 
naples is the capital city of the region of campania. it has been invaded and occupied over the centuries by a succession of alien nations and cultures, including the french, germans and turks. but it was more the spanish than the rest who have had the most significant influence on the city’s architecture, language, customs and way of life. naples has one of the most important archeological collections in the world housed in the museo archeologico nazionale, a great treasure trove of ancient artefacts from pompeii, ercolano and other historical sites. the modern city itself is full of great churches and other impressive buildings, notably the gesu’ nuovo cathedral, the royal palace in piazza plebiscito, and the capodimonte gallery with its paintings by renaissance masters such as titian, raphael and van dyke. driving time approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.

the music festival finds its starting point in wagner’s visit to ravello in 1880 and in the enthusiasm of the maestro at the view of the villa rufolo gardens, from which he drew the inspiration for the scene paintings of the second act of parsifal. in fact he wrote in villa rufolo guest book “at last i found klingsor’s enchanted garden”.
the concerts at villa rufolo are from march to october. the highlight of the season is generally during the first week of july with the wagner festival.
during the festival world famous artists come to perform such as zubin metha, lorin maasel and placido domingo (placido domingo was the first guest palazzo avino had for the reopening in july 1997). although on the link of the official site for the ravello concert society you will find a calendar of events, the famous performers of the festival are generally announced very close to the concert dates so you may only find minor performances online. the information for the july festival should be available during march/april. the most unforgettable concerts are the ones at the crack of dawn with the sun rising behind the orchestra! the picture says it all.
classical orchestras and modern musicians concerts from april through october.

art in ravello


ode to ravello


palazzo to palazzo 





art in ravello

since 1953 this small town host each summer the ravello festival which have lured the world’s most talented musicians to the self-described “city of music” over the year ravello hosted musicians and orchestra’s directors from all around the world.
wagner found in villa rufolo both the inspiration for the scenery of parsifal’s second act and the ideas to improve the whole musical structure of his last masterpiece. verdi stayed in villa rufolo as well, grieg, during his staying at hotel toro, drew his inspiration from the woods and the caves of ravello for some descriptions of his peer gynt; great musicians and conductors – like bruno walter, arturo toscanini, enrico caruso, bernstein, kempff and rostropovitch – stayed and worked here. ravello has also had the opportunity to host artists such as the brilliant spanish painter mirò, the dutch designer escher, and, at the beginning of the xix century, the english turner painter of admirable views, and ruskin, writer and art critic. for last gore vidal, american writer and public intellectual, was captured by the enchantment of ravello and in 1972 bought a cliffside mansion “la rondinaia” and spent there 25 years.
furthermore the amalfi coast included in the unesco world heritage list since 1997: “the amalfi coast is an area of great physical beauty and natural diversity. it has been intensively settled by human communities since the early middle ages. there are a number of towns such as amalfi and ravello with architectural and artistic works of great significance. the rural areas show the versatility of the inhabitants in adapting their use of the land to the diverse nature of the terrain, which ranges from terraced vineyards and orchards on the lower slopes to wide upland pastures”. “the committee decided to inscribe this site, considering that the costiera amalfitana is an outstanding example of a mediterranean landscape, with exceptional cultural and natural scenic values resulting from its dramatic topography and historical evolution.”
as a family, we are very keen to make the pink palace of the amalfi coast a special location where art, sound, music and beauty can find their blend and substance in various forms year over year.

art in ravello


ode to ravello


palazzo to palazzo 





ode to ravello

ode to ravello is a project promoted by palazzo avino that aims to create a dialogue between contemporary art and music. in the first edition of ode to ravello, in 2019, the american composer and artist charlemagne palestine, presented “””strummingsssss per i misteriiiii dell’infinito”””, a sound work for the piano he has conceived for the thousand year-old church of san giovanni del toro in ravello.
charlemagne palestine has been the first artist invited to take part in ode to ravello, selected by a committee made up of fabio agovino, collector; mariella avino, managing director of palazzo avino; cloe perrone, curator; laura valente, president of the fondazione donnaregina and of the madre museum in naples, and andrea viliani, artistic director of the madre museum in naples.
the history of ravello is marked by many artists who have fallen in love with it, from  boccaccio to leonard bernstein: from giuseppe verdi to edvard grieg, arturo toscanini to leopold stokowski; theodor adorno, robert capa, truman capote, e. m. forster, andré gide, joan mirò, guido piovene, paul valery, gore vidal and tennessee williams,  but also contemporary artists such as mimmo paladino, francesco clemente and sandro chia, michelangelo pistoletto and giulio paolini, or tony cragg.
and richard wagner that in the 19th century theorized the revolution of the theatre as a total work of art, and who would appreciate that in the village perched high above the amalfi coast – which  impressed him so much that he exclaimed:  “the enchanted garden of klingsor has been found!” (in the visitors’ book of villa rufolo, 26th may 1880) –  an idea of contemporary trends which very much resembles the man who is at the centre of his artistic narration that is still practised today: a man who is investigated in his totality of mind, feelings and sensory nature, responding to a “theatre” which has to use all the forms of expression. the exact term that wagner uses in the artwork of the future (1849) is gesamtkunstwerk,  i.e. “unitary work of art”, a technique of composition that has also been applied for over 40 years by the maestro charlemagne palestine.
according to wagner’s theory of the total work of art, all forms of expression (poetry, music and dance but also architecture, painting and the figurative arts) are positioned in a relationship of comparisons and exchanges (which also recall the other concept dear to wagner of “organicity”), the only ones that are capable of expressing the most intimate essence of a man in dialogue with his time.
charlemagne palestine has created installations, works and performances since the 1970s, becoming recognized as one of the greatest precursors of the 20th century, and one of the greatest contemporary artists. his works dialogue in general with holy places and cultural architectures, to increase and intensify their “magical mysteries and sacredness.”
the prestigious venues that have hosted works by the artist include, to mention only a few:  cathedral sé, lisbon, portugal; church of saint-eustache, paris, france; santa maria in chiesa rossa, milan, italy; cathedral of saint-pierre, geneva, switzerland; cathedral saints-michel-et-gudule, brussels, belgium; basilica of san martino maggiore, bologna, italy; the pyramid of the louvre, paris, france; villa medicea, artimino, italy and villa borghese, rome, italy.
the opera-performance by charlemagne palestine at the church of san giovanni del toro in ravello has been filmed by a troupe.
charlemagne palestine was born in brooklyn, new york in 1947. he is a “gesamtkunstler”, an artist of sound, a composer, an artist, a filmmaker and an installation artist. … as a composer-performer, he originally qualified to be a cantor and then a carillonneur; he has always performed his works as a soloist. electronic sonorous continuums were his first pieces; then he discovered the  bösendorfer imperial piano of vienna and started to transform pianos into electronic acoustic synthesizers of sound using a special technique called strummminggggsss where each string of the instrument has a voice of its own and the rapid alternation of notes, accords and registers merge to become a physical spectrum of echoing sonorities which interact in the space with sacred architectures and magical atmospheres to carry listeners away on a flying carpet.

palazzo to palazzo 

palazzo avino launches its 2024 season by spotlighting female artistic expression with “palazzo to palazzo,” the inaugural exhibition project curated by umberta gnutti beretta. this visionary entrepreneur, philanthropist, and art collector has been invited to share her unique insights into contemporary art by orchestrating an art takeover within the spaces of caffè dell’arte, a cherished gathering spot for guests and international travelers exploring the amalfi coast.
in the lounge bar with a terrace overlooking the tyrrhenian sea and the surrounding mountains, guests are enveloped in a richly layered ambiance. historic details like moorish arches and terrazzo floors infuse the space with character, setting it apart from the sterile environment of traditional, white-walled galleries. here, artworks seamlessly integrate into the surroundings, encouraging visitors to savor each discovery at their own pace.
a sketch on paper, a pair of photographs, but predominantly, paintings: these artworks capture a glimpse of contemporary life through the lens of emerging female artists from europe, the united kingdom, the united states, latin america, and asia.
 
as a lifelong aficionado of the arts, umberta beretta views this invitation as an opportunity to expand her philanthropic pursuits in conjunction with her role as honorary director of palazzo monti, an artist residency established by edoardo monti in 2017. situated within an ancient palace in the heart of brescia, palazzo monti has made active promotion of artists, both during and after their residency, one of its hallmarks of excellence.
beretta and monti are united in their commitment to nurturing the development of young talents by providing them with opportunities for recognition. consequently, all chosen artists – including sara birns, lidya blakeley, diane dal-pra, daria dmytrenko, alice faloretti, olivia sterling, tarin, michaela yearwood-dan, and chloe wise – have previously participated in residency programs or exhibited their works at palazzo monti. the majority of the artworks are part of umberta beretta’s private collection, which is permanently showcased at spazio almag in roncadelle (bs) and at the fondazione palazzo monti.
thus, from palace to palace, the journey unfolds.
in the feminine soul of palazzo avino, owned by mariella, attilia, and mariavittoria, there’s a vibrant sense of joy. the three avino sisters inherited the business from their father, shaping it into a graceful and refined symbol of female empowerment. here, femininity is celebrated through emotion, creativity, exploration, color, and inclusivity – themes that echo throughout the artworks showcased in this nurturing and vibrant space.

the pink closet

the pink closet, the powder-pink boutique cum wunderkammer designed by cristina celestino and opened in 2019 a few steps from palazzo avino, extends the narration of the pink palace to a dimension of discovery, with an exquisitely italian and feminine trait.
curated by mariella avino, the pink closet is the story of a journey told in a layering of memories, souvenirs, pieces of clothing and objects. it is a spontaneous and personal curation of emotional pieces, as collected during the course of a vacation following a very personal point of view. eclecticism is the key: in defining the space as in selecting the offer. each piece is carefully chosen, to inspire and be admired, in an intimate and feminine dimension.
the pink closet is a dream, made real.  it follows a logic of its own, made of beauty as pure emotion.
