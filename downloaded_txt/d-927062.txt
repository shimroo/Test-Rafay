venetian plaster

venetian plaster is an architectural coating applied with a trowel to the walls or ceilings.  it is a multiple step finish which traditionally is burnished to a high shine.  venetian plaster has a rich history, yet works well in settings ranging from rustic to ultra-modern.  luxe walls makes no secret that authentic italian / venetian plaster is our favorite fine finish.





decorative finishes

luxe walls offers a variety of decorative paint and plaster finishes, often called faux finishes, from the subtle to the very ornate.  faux finishes can be smooth or textured.  because of the many options available, luxe walls will provide a free color consultation to help you select the right finish.

“if you want your house to look like a million bucks hire carl from luxe walls, he was a consummate professional. i had both bathrooms faux painted and they look amazing. carl also painted my master bedroom. he did a brown ceiling with gold and bronze glaze on it and my ceiling looks like something you would see in a million dollar house. carl also helped me pick out paint colors and everything we picked out looks amazing! carl was always on time and he was very clean and cleaned up everyday. i will definitely hire him again for some more work that i need done.”
