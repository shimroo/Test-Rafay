what is coram deo?the name coram deo is latin for "in the presence of god." our community is devoted to trying to live all of life coram deo. everything we do aims to bring jesus to the center and remove the false division between a secular and sacred life. our corporate rule of life is composed of three spaces: communities, gatherings, and trainings. our rhythms invite participation and life-on-life discipleship. coram deo is part of the 24-7 prayer movement. we place ourselves historically at the merging of the charismatic, contemplative, and missional streams within the broader body of christ.
