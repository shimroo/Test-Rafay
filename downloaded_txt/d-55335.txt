antiwar, current affairs, global balance, u.s. corporate media

syria, u.s. policy, u.s. thinktanks



now comes (yet another!) book by one of the hordes of nation-security technocrats who dominate west asian policymaking in democratic administrations here in washington. in this case, it is grand delusion: the rise and fall of american ambition in the middle east, a recent book by steven simon, a guy who has worked as first … continue reading an intriguing but frustrating window into obama’s west asia policy →

u.s. military, ukraine


 


my distinguished colleague and friend melvin goodman has had some terrific pieces up at counterpunch recently, including great, searing critiques of pres. biden’s rehabilitation of eliott abrams, and of david ignatius’s latest piece of compacent lunacy regarding ukraine and russia. so imagine my surprise when i read goodman’s latest piece there, in which he proposed … continue reading a crazy idea (or two) to deal with the ukraine grain “crisis” →

nonviolence, ukraine, war


 


the history of world war 1 continues to be eerily relevant today. in 1928, the leftwing british war resister arthur ponsonby published a book titled falsehood in war-time, containing an assortment of lies circulated throughout the nations during the great war. its lessons have massive relevance, that continues until today. in 2001, a leftwing belgian … continue reading how to play ‘war lies bingo’ →

britain, current affairs, imperialisms, military spending


 


when i was growing up in england in the 1950s and 1960s, we were all pretty proud of the nhs. it really did a lot to define “british-ness” at a time when the empire that had done that for previous generations was being unceremoniously sloughed off. at least our generation could be quietly proud that, … continue reading britain once swapped an expensive empire for a national health service… today–? →

over the new year’s break, north korea’s military test-fired some short-range (350-400 kilometer) ballistic missiles, while the country’s news agency reported that it was testing a new 600 mm multiple rocket launcher system capable of carrying nuclear weapons. on saturday, the often erratic-seeming north korean leader kim jong-un expressed his commitment, “to respond with nuke … continue reading is north korea china’s israel? →

crypto, philosophy, u.s. politics



on december 13, the house financial services committee held a long-awaited hearing into the collapse of the ftx crypto empire. ftx’s disgraced former ceo sam bankman-fried could not, as he had hoped to, testify there in person because he was sitting, as inmate 14-372, in a jail in the bahamas. instead, the committee heard an … continue reading the egregious arrogance of sam bankman-fried (& his ilk) →
