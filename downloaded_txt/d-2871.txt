god's work ministry










   








        
    






welcome
      to god's work ministry.  this is a site that is here to encourage and
      inspire you.  we also have a salvation area where one who hasn't
      accepted the lord as their savior can learn about salvation and make that
      choice to open their hearts to the lord jesus christ and receive him as
      their personal lord and savior.

      we have worked hard to make this site easy to use and get around in. 
      we know that if you get lost or stuck in a certain area you probably
      wouldn't be too happy,  so there are navigation and tool bars on
      every page for you to get around with.

            we currently have over 1,900 pages available so please feel free to read as many stories,
            poems and testimonies as you like.  i hope
      you are blessed by your visit to godswork.  all the praise, honor
            and glory belongs to the lord for the things he is doing.  god bless you, and
      have a great day.

      truly yours,
      dwayne savaya
