we love to serve our customers 


















						delicious food and great outdoor balcony with a beautiful view of the city. we ordered a fried chicken sandwhich and fish and chips. it was some of the best fish we've had! it is local beer night on tuesdays and drafts are only $3. check them out, you won't be disappointed!
