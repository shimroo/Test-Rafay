learn more



bdd and addiction
there is a common misconception that individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (bdd) are merely preoccupied with vanity or are excessively concerned with their looks. this oversimplification can lead to a misunderstanding of the complexity of bdd and may contribute to the stigma surrounding mental health issues.
learn more

learn more



depression and addiction
in this comprehensive guide, we delve into the complexities of depression and addiction. when they occur together, the need for support becomes even more crucial.
learn more



grief and addiction
grief, unfortunately, is a natural part of life that all of us go through at some point. some can cope with grief in their own way and emerge successfully, but this is not always the case for others.

learn more



schizophrenia and addiction
today, our understanding of schizophrenia has progressed significantly from the 20th century when individuals with the condition were often stigmatised as simply ‘crazy.’ many people with schizophrenia now lead fulfilling lives through effective management.
learn more



self harm and addiction
self-harm issues are incredibly challenging for anyone to navigate, and when compounded with addiction, life can become even more complex. however, effective treatments are available to help you overcome this dual diagnosis.
learn more



stress and addiction
regrettably, many individuals resort to substance abuse as a means of coping with stressful situations. this is a significant factor contributing to the prevalence of dual diagnoses involving both stress and addiction.
learn more



suicide and addiction
more than 700,000 people pass away due to suicide every year. this number doesn’t take into consideration the attempts either, which are, unfortunately, in the millions. heartbreakingly, many of these suicidal actions are paired with substance abuse, which shows a clear connection between suicide and addiction.

addiction treatment and recovery







addiction treatment has three crucial steps: addiction, detox, and rehab. the addiction phase involves acknowledging and addressing the harmful habits and dependencies that have taken hold. detox follows, where the body is cleansed from the toxic substance, and withdrawal symptoms are managed. finally, the rehab stage focuses on comprehensive therapy, providing individuals with the necessary tools to overcome addiction and rebuild their lives.
connection, compassion, responsibility and processing all link together to enable successful addiction recovery, and you can explore a range of rehab options and insights below.

our promise








at ukat, we recommend our 90-day treatment option for individuals seeking comprehensive and lasting results. our most extended programme offers an extensive three-month journey towards recovery, providing essential elements such as medical detox, holistic group therapies like dialectical behavioural therapy (dbt), meditation, recovery workshops, and one-on-one sessions with a therapist. furthermore, you will receive guidance through the 12-step literature, with sufficient time to complete three to four steps in the supportive environment of our rehab.
we understand that transitioning back to everyday life can present challenges even with these tools. that’s why, if you successfully complete our 90-day inpatient treatment programme but encounter a relapse within 30 days of leaving, we promise to welcome you back for a complimentary 28-day treatment to help you get back on track towards lasting recovery.
