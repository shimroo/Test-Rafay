sea across the sky

we strive to deliver seafood such as norwegian salmons and canadian lobsters, which are normally unavailable in korea, to korean consumers as fresh as possible
on the other hand, we export korea-exclusive seafood such as korean oyster and flatfish to other countries in the world, spreading the sea across the sky.
