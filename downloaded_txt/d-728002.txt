an old granary stands again the odds in the palouse near colfax, washington. 
 ”ron king’s art in all of its forms reveals an instinctive emotional reflex that lies beyond simple vision or hearing. reflected in both the man and his work is the artful bridge between reality and what his unique vision sees just beyond.” 

anne volmering – art critic 
what others have said:
holy smokes!!!  i just looked at your website and your work took my breath away!  it is extraordinary!  some people make lemonade out of lemons in life but you turned your lemon into champagne!!!”  l.m.  (the lemons comment was her response after reading my bio.)
“ron is very innovative and unique in his approach to photography. i love his work because he completely reinterprets original scenes to a depiction that is very moving and dramatic.”
“magical eye candy, visually sweet, melts like chocolate in your brain.”
“i am mesmerized by the emulsification of shapes and colors, just gorgeous.”
“it’s osmosis, the transfer thru a permeable membrane, eye to brain.”
