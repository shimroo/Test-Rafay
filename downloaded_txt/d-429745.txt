juggling - passing clubs - the origins of jim's 3-count 



rate diabolo tricks from 1 to 10


- preface -
within this site are diabolo tricks i have acquired from several 
  mid-us juggling festivals. also included are tricks from my e-mail associations 
  from other countries. some tricks show a 'source.'  sources are where i 
  first saw or who i first learned of the trick from.  i've tried to keep 
  some sort of standard for terms and relative direction and rotation. at this 
  time the terms page has several explanatory 
  animations of basic moves. your view of the animations is as if you were standing 
  behind an invisible diaboloist while he/she performs the trick or as you would 
  see yourself perform the trick. the close-up animations are your view from above. 
  the right stick handle near end is darker. the string end of the sticks 
  are marked in green as seen in the over-the-arm, minetti whip, and a few other 
  tricks.  the over-the-arm  will show an 'arm slice' and the under-the-leg 
  will show a 'leg slice' which is where the string touches the body in those 
  tricks. it is very possible there is an error within some of these explanations. please e-mail me if you find one or have a suggestion for a confusing step. 
  some questions about diabolos and animation are answered on the frequently 
  asked questions page. also send along any tricks you would like to share. 
  i still have several tricks to add here, but hope soon i can add new tricks 
  as they come in.

hope you see something new,

jim 
 special thanks goes to shane geiger.  without his contributions of web space and information, this site could not 
  be where it is today. sadly, shane passed away in 2011. the memory of shane geiger will always be with us. it seems like jugglers should never die, yet shane is probably this moment, up there juggling the universe and the heavens for us. thanks shane, for all the computer help and your juggling inspiration.

 special thanks to mark wilkening who has contributed 
    much in html and flash, instruction and ideas. 
  

   mark is the founder of the performing group, throwing picassos, an avid juggler/slack roper, occasional juggler of 7 balls, and a fine pizza cook.
  

e-mail 
  jim with corrections, additions, or for added help.
