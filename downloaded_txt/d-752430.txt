empowering people to discover their potential
since 1894, mokan goodwill has been a pillar of support for the kansas city community. the goodwill name brings to mind our iconic thrift stores, but our mission reaches beyond the clothes and household wares. when that gently-used shirt or pre-loved planter gets sold, it helps to support funding of career advancement programs and services that help change lives.
