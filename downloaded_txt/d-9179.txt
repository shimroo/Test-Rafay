primitive technology, traditional skills and hand-made tools








"primitive
    (first) skills are our shared inheritance.
    it is the shared thread which links us to our prehistory
    and binds us together as human beings."
quote
      by steve watts
knowledge is not complete until it is passed on.
    but, the knowledge that is passed on must be complete.
