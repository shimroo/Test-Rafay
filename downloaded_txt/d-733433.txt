          medtech leaders
recruitment is your competitive advantage.
your process determines your success!

speed and precision matters.

a streamlined process keeps you on the front-foot.

especially when you are asking high-level professionals
to find 3-5 hours+ in their manic schedules
over a 2-4 week+ window, with multiple firms

not every firm get's a shot!

the decisive leader who knows how to take action, with clearly defined timelines will always come out on top over the unsure leader lacking agility.

it's an easy market for you to get ahead of the competition with so many firms dragging out processes and going through the motions (yes some firms have 6+ stages)

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗵𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀:

1. make recruitment a business critical priority
2. commit on stakeholder availability early
3. have a clear criteria for ideal candidates
4. reduce lead-time between stages
5. make a decision within 24 hours

nothing fancy...

just do the basics incredibly well.

          getting patients to write reviews about your practice is probably the furthest thing from your mind, especially since your focus is on caring for patients, learning new procedures and dealing with day-to-day operations.

however, online reviews are important, especially positive ones. a study by invesp shows that 92% of users will use a local business if it has at least a 4-star rating. and online reviews don’t just impact potential patients/consumers but job candidates as well. a harvard business review study found that a bad reputation costs a company at least 10% more per hire.

          when it comes to staffing ambulatory surgery centers (ascs), locum tenens staffing is the way to go.

anesthesiologists and crnas who are searching for work-life balance have found their homes in ambulatory surgery centers (ascs). working at an asc provides the mds and crnas the opportunity to start their work days earlier, which allows them to pick their children up from school or get home earlier to their families, for example. and because there are no on-call duties in ascs, providers report having more flexible schedules, which they appreciate. 

additionally, ascs are ideal for providers when they want “a change of pace” in their careers. when you work in an asc, you have the opportunity to work with lower acuity and less complex cases. this results in a more even, steady workflow and consistent pace than in other healthcare environments. 

ascs are in persistent need of anesthesiologists and crnas, so there are plenty of available shifts for locum tenens throughout the united states. 

read what francesca mathewes reported in her latest article, “5 things to know about staffing at ascs,” in becker’s asc review – in which mathewes outlines the reasons there’s a shortage of staff in ascs.

and remember, consilium helps connect ascs with locum tenens physicians and practitioners every single day. so reach out to me today if i can help you find your next placement, physician, or crna.

          humans are meant to do hard things. there are few greater rewards than overcoming obstacles and achieving a difficult goal.

richelle marting jd, mhsa,rhia,cpc,cemc,cpma could have made for a terrific coder or him director, but she pushed on with one more exam: the bar. we talk about that in the clip below, and in greater detail on the podcast (see link to full episode below in the comments). said marting of the experience:

“the bar exam was as awful as you’d expect, it was a multi-day, total of 16-hour exam. so really as much a test of stamina and endurance as anything else.

“but if you prepare, you’ve got it.”

that last bit is the key. marting worked hard, studied long hours, and achieved something meaningful that propelled her career into a new and exciting direction.

when you combine an rhia, coding credentials, and a jd, you have a unique skill set that puts you in demand.

the most meaningful professional achievements are typically the hardest.

the next off the record is queued up for wednesday and i’ve got a guest on from a profession i’ve never covered on the show or served in any prior role. but it’s one i discovered makes a big impact on hospital quality, patient outcomes, and indirectly (in some limited cases, directly) on organizational revenue.

i spent the show learning and suspect you will as well.

          "quick access to supplies and equipment minimizes any treatment delays, and that also improves patient outcomes. that said, the professional environment, a well-oiled machine doesn’t work as well if the gears aren’t where they should be. a well-organized hospital creates more of a professional and a reassuring environment which, for their patients and their families, can really go a long way. but hospitals aren’t exclusive. a library runs a lot better when it’s organized. a restaurant, a law firm, everything works better when things are where they should be and there’s no surprises."

          💡why partnering with an outside sales recruiting firm is key to success 

in the fast-paced world of sales, leaving a territory vacant can be costly—both in lost revenue and missed opportunities. while internal talent acquisition teams work hard, collaborating with an outside sales recruiting firm can solve your hiring challenges quickly and effectively. here’s why:

🚀 access to hidden sales talent: external recruiters have deep networks of top sales professionals, including those who aren’t actively job hunting. they know how to engage high-performing reps who can deliver results in your market.

⏱️ minimize vacancy costs: every day a sales territory sits vacant is lost revenue. external recruiters are laser-focused on filling those positions fast, ensuring your team gets back to full strength and your market share doesn’t slip away.

🎯 industry-specific expertise: outside sales recruiters know the ins and outs of your industry. they can quickly identify the right candidates with the skills, experience, and drive to hit the ground running in your open territory.

📊 fresh perspectives: an external firm brings an unbiased, outside perspective, helping you avoid internal hiring delays or misalignment. this ensures you find top talent who aligns with your sales strategy and company culture.

💸 reduce the high cost of vacancies: vacant sales territories mean lost deals, unmet quotas, and strained teams. partnering with an outside recruiter means those roles are filled quickly with high-quality candidates, so you don’t lose momentum.

🤝 a strategic partnership: sales recruiting firms invest in understanding your company, your sales goals, and the unique challenges of your territories. together, we can build a salesforce that drives your business forward.

don’t let open territories cost you valuable revenue—partner with an outside sales recruiting firm to fill your team with the right sales talent, fast. 🔍💼
