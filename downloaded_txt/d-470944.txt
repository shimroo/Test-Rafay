                newsguns and growth: the economic consequences of surging defense spending14.02.2025
                    increased defense spending could significantly boost europe’s economic growth and industrial base if outlays are targeted at high-tech, regionally made armaments. a new kiel report by the kiel institute shows that gross domestic product (gdp) could increase by 0.9 percent to 1.5 percent per year if governments raised annual defense spending from the nato target of 2 percent to 3.5 percent of gdp and shifted from buying weapons designed and mainly made in the usa to home-grown innovations.

                newsukraine support after 3 years of war: aid flows remain low but steady - shift towards weapons procurement14.02.2025
                    over the past 3 years of war, donor countries have provided a low but continuous flow of support to ukraine, with a value of about eur 80 billion per year. european donors have been the main source of aid to ukraine since 2022, especially when it comes to financial and humanitarian aid. at the same time, we observe a shift towards weapon procurement. in the initial phase of the war, military aid to ukraine mostly came from existing arsenals of donor countries, but these have emptied over time. today, the large majority military aid is newly produced weaponry from western defense industries—with a small but growing role of multilateral weapon procurement initiatives. these are the findings of the latest update of the ukraine support tracker, which tracks aid up to december 2024.

                newsglobal economic challenges: why a new german government must think and act european10.02.2025
                    pursuing a european approach to international trade policy—the agenda of the kiel institute calls for a robust eu response to geopolitical tensions, protectionism, and economic uncertainties. china's dominance in key industries, the looming threat of u.s. tariffs under donald trump, and europe’s waning competitiveness require a unified european strategy. a strengthened single market and a strategic trade policy—one that fosters openness, liberalization, and new partnerships, e.g. with africa—are essential to bolstering germany’s and the eu’s resilience while maintaining parity with the u.s. and china in the long term.
