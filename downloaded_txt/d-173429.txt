    customer testimonials
   


 
     "shamona watty provided excellent guidance and research to assist with my fabric purchase to upholster living room furniture. she consulted with the paint dept to advise on colors, and was generally a pleasure to work with."


  "i write to describe how wonderful richard ober in the windows department was. both when he came out to the house to measure for a replacement andersen window, and after i came and picked up that window and was installing it, he was incredibly knowledgeable, timely and reliable, kind and courteous, and helpful that was way beyond what anyone could have expected. i felt so lucky to have him working on this - which was surely to him just a small nuisance job. but he treated me with respect; like this was the most important job in the world."


  "kelly ranstatler's response was not to transfer me again, but simply say that she would take care of the problem and call me back! this was a first. you have one employee who is quite exceptional and speaks well for the company."


  "dan (albodobar) found exactly what i was looking for. we always say mhc ‘has everything.’ added to the list of ‘everything,’ is the most patient and helpful employee imaginable."

  marine home center stopped accepting orders for major appliances last year on september 25, 2023. it has completed honoring all customer orders, and has continued to provide after-sale
service and repairs.
as the company continues to focus on its core business, marine home center has reached agreement with yale appliance to acquire its appliance service operations effective october 1, 2024. yale is one of the largest and most service-oriented appliance companies in new england.
we believe yale shares many of the same positive values of marine home center, especially how they treat their employees and their customers. the agreement includes marine home center leasing to yale its current appliance service office location at 5 bayberry court.
marine will work with yale to ensure a smooth transition to provide continuity of appliance repair services to its nantucket customers. customers who purchased major appliances from marine home center in the past and require service should call yale appliance at 617-822-5360 - option 1.

a statement from yale appliance vp of operations, leo goncalves

“ we at yale applance are excited to be joining the nantucket community and taking over on-island appliance sales and service from marine home center. we have retained every marine
home center appliance employee, and are committed to continuing the excellent service that marine home center has provided its employees and customers. it is our priority to ensure that
these strong relationships continue. we will put our best foot forward to serve the island.
yale is eager to become a part of the community and looks forward to building on marine home center’s legacy. after converting the marine appliance service space at 5 bayberry court, we look forward to opening our nantucket sales showroom in spring 2025.

  the festival of trees is an annual holiday tradition that transforms the whaling museum into a winter wonderland for the month of december! marine is the lead sponsor again this year. 
opening in 1944 as a lumberyard, the business expanded and in 1973 changed its name from marine lumber to marine home center. the theme of our tree is, “marine’s 80th anniversary”. 
the centerpiece “80 years serving nantucket”, is made from wood and stained to highlight the roots of marine lumber company. many wooden 80’s hang from the tree in gold, silver and white. 
thank you ciara mcauley and linda mcandrews as well as shamona watty, jacqui mathers, jeannette oubre, and lainie o’brien for making a beautiful tree this year!

  marine home center will no longer be accepting orders for major appliances effective september 25, 2023. all customer orders processed prior to that date will be honored. marine will continue to provide repair service support to its major appliance customers. the company will re-allocate its employees and resources to its core business. there will be no layoffs associated with this decision.

over the past few years, marine home center’s appliance business has experienced significant change. the lingering effects of the pandemic on the supply chain, long order lead times, inflation, lack of warehouse storage space, limitations in our boat reservations, scarcity of year-round housing, and a shortage of employees, have adversely impacted our major appliance business. 

marine will continue to sell room air conditioners, dehumidifiers, televisions, compact refrigerators, countertop microwaves, and garbage disposals.
