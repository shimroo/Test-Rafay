rolling stones guitar chords "brown sugar" and "angie"





two cracking songs to rework today, as i move on to my rolling stones chords page.

first up is probably my favourite stones song, "brown sugar", but it's a song i always struggled to play on acoustic guitar.

the song is actually in the key of c - i had previously chorded it in d, but when i tried transposing the chords, they seemed pretty tricky.  so, i transposed the whole thing to a, and put a capo on 3rd fret to bring it up to c.

when i tried playing along with angie from my old transcription, it just didn't sit right, so i spent quite a while painstakingly listening to the song on youtube, nailing a chord or two, rewinding, double-checking, until i finally arrived at a chorded version of the song i'm happy with.

actually - "rewinding", that probably isn't even a word anymore!  comes from the days when i'd tape songs from radio to cassette tape, play, stop, rewind, pause, play, stop....  oh the pain of it all!   but, that was the only game in town back then, it's so much easier now that almost all songs are available to play along with, which was the main reason for my undertaking this exercise in updating and correcting my song chord transcriptions.
  

the converted and updated pages with these songs are at the links below, and videos for both songs have been embedded. the songs are chorded in the correct key for playing along with the video.


"brown sugar" chords ( relative to the capo on 3rd fret ) are -   esus4   e   a   asus4   c   f   g   d - a much easier set of chords than my previous version  ( see guitar chords for brown sugar  )

"angie" chords  are:   am   e7  g   f   c  dm  c/b   -  again not too tough a group of chords for beginners  ( see guitar chords for angie )


these new versions are now available on my rolling stones guitar chords page, along with another dozen or so, i will get around to the others as time allows.    you can find all of  my rolling stones songs guitar transcriptions at the link below:

guitar chords - creedence clearwater revival: up around the bend & long as i can see the light





it's a lotta fun, this blogging lark - yesterday i was 'up the junction' with squeeze, today i'm going 'up around the bend' with creedence clearwater revival!!

i'm reworking two of the classic songs on my creedence guitar chords page - "up around the bend" and "long as i can see the light"

first thing i discovered was that i had both songs in the wrong key.  these would have been worked out in pre-youtube days, back then i was just working the keys and chords from my memories of the song, it's so much easier now that you can listen to pretty much every song on youtube while working out the chords.

there were also a few endline 'filler' chords i'd omitted, which make the song sound more complete.  i converted the text files to web files, added links to the parent and home page, and embedded the videos to play along with.


the converted and updated pages with these songs are at the links below, and videos for both songs have been embedded. the songs are chorded in the correct key for playing along with the video.


"up around the bend" chords are -   d  a  a7  g  and f#m, a nice easy set of chords for learning guitar players.  ( see guitar chords for up around the bend  )

"long as i can see the light" chords  are ( relative to capo on 2nd fret )  a  e  d  and f#m, also a handy enough bunch of chords for beginners  ( see guitar chords for long as i can see the light )


these new versions are now available on my creedence clearwater revival guitar chords page, along with another 10 or so, i'll be revisiting the page to 'fix up' these songs asap.    you can find all of  my creedence songs guitar transcriptions at the link below:

chords and lyrics for squeeze "cool for cats" and "up the junction





still working through my artist pages and updating and correcting the song transcriptions.  today it's the turn of squeeze, and their two major hits from 1979 "cool for cats" and "up the junction".

only a few small changes, but i've converted them from text to web files, included links back to the home page and the squeeze chords page, and embedded the youtube videos of the songs  so you can play along with the originals. 



the converted and updated pages with these songs are at the links below, and videos for both songs have been embedded. the songs are chorded in the correct key for playing along with the video.



"cool for cats" chords are - g  g/f#  em  c  am  eb  cm,  a  ( see guitar chords for cool for cats  )

"up the junction" chords  are e  a  c#m  g#m  f#m  b  d  am  gm  f  d  and bm  ( see guitar chords for up the junction )


these new versions are now available on my squeeze guitar chords page, along with just a few more, i'll get around to these as soon as possible.   you can find all of  my squeeze songs guitar transcriptions at the link below:

chords and lyrics for neil young "harvest" and "harvest moon"





today's attention is drawn to my neil young page, and i've taken two of my many favourites, both to listen to and play - "harvest" and "harvest moon",  validated and corrected my transcriptions, converted them from text to website format, and embedded the youtube videos of the songs in each new web page. 

no major transcription changes, both songs are in native d major.  slight doubt about the endline of the verse and chorus of harvest "... promise of a man", which i had chorded with d  and a, but as i listen to the song, neil seems to remain on the d for all of the end of the line.  i've notated it as d  (a), as i find it more natural to play the a chord myself - try playing it both ways yourself, see which you think sounds better for you.


the converted and updated pages with these songs are at the links below, and videos for both songs have been embedded. the songs are chorded in the correct key for playing along with the video.



"harvest" chords are - d   a   g   bm  and e  -  a nice easy set of chords for learning guitarists  ( see guitar chords for harvest )

"harvest moon" chords  are d  d/b ( 004232 )  dmaj7  em7  g  a7sus4 (002030) and a7  ( see guitar chords for harvest moon )


these new versions are now available on my neil young guitar chords page, along with a bunch more which will be tackled later..  you can find all of  my neil young songs guitar transcriptions at the link below:

guitar chords for lou reed "perfect day" and "satellite of love"





once again, venturing back into the prairies of songs on my site, replacing the text files with web file, embedding videos, correcting chords and lyrics where appropriate, and transposing to the key of the original song on video, to make it easier for learning guitarists to pick up the song by playing along with the original artist. 

it's like meeting old friends at times, songs i've always loved, but haven't gotten around to playing myself in a long time.  my site is deliberately eclectic - i had the choice at the beginning ( 15 years ago! ) of accepting submissions from everyone and building the site as a 'warehouse' of songs, or only including songs i like and enjoy playing, and where i have worked out the chords and lyrics myself. 

i opted for 'eclectic', and while you won't find every song ever written ( or every artist ), i have a wide enough taste to ensure that most visitors find chords for at least a bunch of songs they want to play, among the 2,000 odd i have available. 

working on the lou reed page today, and i have re-transcribed two of my all-time favourite songs "perfect day" and "satellite of love".   neither of the songs were in the original key ( i had transcribed them to suit my own voice ), so i've changed "perfect day" from a minor to bb minor, by the addition of a capo on the first fret, and for 'satellite of love', which i'd always played in g, but which is actually in f, i transcribed it to d, indicating a capo on the 3rd,  as playing in f would have led to some tricky chords.


the new pages containing these songs are at the links below, and videos for both songs have been embedded. the songs are chorded in the correct key for playing along with the video.



"perfect day" chords ( relative to capo ) are - am   g   c   f   dm   e   a   amaj7  dmaj7  d6 and f#m  ( see guitar chords for perfect day )

"satellite of love" chords ( relative to capo ) are d  e  g  a  bm  and em - a nice easy set of chords for beginners  ( see guitar chords for satellite of love )


these new versions are now available on my lou reed page, along with a bunch more which i will get to as soon as i can.  you can find all of  my lou reed songs guitar transcriptions at the link below:

guitar chords for the pogues "dirty old town" and "fiesta"





forging on with my website upgrade,  today i'm moving on to my pogues guitar songs page, and giving the 'makeover' and health check to two of my favourite songs of theirs, "dirty old town", and "fiesta" .  "dirty old town" is an old classic ballad by ewan mccoll ( father of the late and sadly missed kirsty ), covered by many artists, but the pogues version has always been my favourite.  "fiesta" is a riotous mariachi band pastiche that always brings a smile to the face.


the new pages containing these songs are at the links below, and videos for both songs have been embedded. the songs are chorded in the correct key for playing along with the video.



"dirty old town" features chords - g   c   d  and em,  but for the harmonica intro the key is changed to d, so the chords here are  d  g  a  and bm.  for a later instrumental part, on uileann pipes,  the key changes to  c, so the chords here are  c  f  g  and am  ( see guitar chords for dirty old town )

"fiesta" has chords  -  g   d7  and  c,  with a g#o ( xx3434 ) and a cm in the closing chords ( see guitar chords for fiesta )


these new versions have been added to the other pogues on the page.  i'll be tackling these on my next pass through. you can find all of  my pogues songs guitar transcriptions at the link below:

guitar chords for blur "country house" and "parklife"





i was fortunate enough during the 'britpop battle' between blur and oasis in the 90s to actually really like both bands, so i have blur and oasis song chord pages on my website.

the blur page is the subject of today's attention, i have coverted the text pages for "country house" and "parklife", in the process correcting some errors and omissions, including patiently placing the chords in the correct places for the spoken-word  parts of "parklife".

the new pages containing these songs are at the links below, and videos for both songs have been embedded. the songs are chorded in the correct key for playing along with the video.



"country house features chords - a  e  bm  d  c#7  c#  e  and e7  ( see guitar chords for country house )

"parklife" has chords  -  e  a  bb  b   g  f#  d  and c ( see guitar chords for parklife )


these new versions have been added to the other blur songs on the page, which i'll be reviewing at a  later date, you can find them all at the link below:

guitar chords for randy newman "jolly coppers" and "my old kentucky home"





continuing with my improvement and audit project for the older songs on my website pjs guitar chords and lyrics ,  today i'm taking two songs from my randy newman page, "jolly coppers" ( from the "little criminals" album ) and "my old kentucky home" ( from the "12 songs" album )

you can check out the updated pages with these songs, complete with embedded videos of the songs to play along with, at the links below.

note:  for "jolly coppers", i've chorded the song in the key of g - in the video randy plays it in f#.  this would lead to a really complex set of chords, so i figure most learning guitarists would prefer to play it in g, just a semitone higher.  this means that to play along with the video, you will need to tune each string on your guitar down one semitone, i.e.  eb ab c# f# bb eb ( or put a capo on the 11th fret! ).  in this case it would be best to just listen to the song, learn the rhythms, strumming patterns and vocal nuances, and then pick up the guitar and try to play the song in g, having learned how the song should sound and 'feel'.    



"jolly coppers" features the chords  g  d6 ( x00230 ) cmaj7  am7  em7  bm7  c and c/d ( 030210 ) ( see guitar chords for jolly coppers )

"my old kentucky home" can be played with just the chords g  d7 and c ( with capo on 2nd fret ). you could play without capo, using chords a e7 and d, but i thing the song sounds better played in the key of g, see guitar chords for my old kentucky home )


i've added these transcriptions to the other randy newman songs on the page, which will be updated later, you can find them all at the link below:

guitar chords and lyrics for the kinks "lola" and "waterloo sunset"





i created my website pjs guitar chords and lyrics 15 years ago.

things were a lot different then, pages loaded very slowly, images, videos etc. were a huge overhead for a web designer trying to make their pages accessible for their visitors.  my approach to this was to create web pages for each artist and genre on my site, with a list of the songs i've worked out, but with each song page being a plain text file, which loaded very quickly, and could be printed easily.

i'm now about 1/3 way through a project to convert these text files into web pages.  this allows me to include links back to the artist and main pages, and also to embed videos of the songs, so that you can play along with the originals while you learn the songs.

initially i looked on this as a 'chore', but by only taking two songs at a time from each artist, i managed to keep it interesting, and 'dug up' some treasures i had almost forgotten about myself.  i'm checking out each song by playing along myself, to catch any 'doozers' and also to make sure i have the song in the original key ( or have transposed it, and shown which fret to use the capo on)

so today's artists are the kinks, and i've given the 'makeover' to two of their most popular songs, "lola" and "waterloo sunset", you can check them out at the links below.

i've also embedded the video links for the songs, so you can play along with the original and get a good feel for how the song should sound, guitar strumming patterns etc.


"lola" features the chords  c  d  e  a  asus4 ( x02230 ), b, f#m, b7, c#m and g#m ( see guitar chords for lola )

"waterloo sunset" can be played with a7, d, a, g, em, g, b, e, e7 and a7 chords ( see guitar chords for waterloo sunset )


i've added these transcription to the other kinks songs on the page, you can find them all at the link below:

guitar chords for "people are strange" and "riders on the storm" by the doors





i was saddened to hear this week of the passing of ray manzarek, keyboard player with legendary 1960s/1970s band the doors.

i hope that, as well as radio stations playing their great songs, that amateur guitar players will learn them, and include them in their sets for open-mic nights, sessions with friends etc., to ensure that these songs endure and be enjoyed by future generations.

i have transcribed two of my favourites for easy guitar playing, "people are strange" and "riders on the storm", you can check them out at the links below.

i've also embedded the video links for the songs, so you can play along with the original and get a good feel for how the song should sound, guitar strumming patterns etc.

my transcriptions won't make you sound like the great doors themselves, but even if you are a learning guitar player, you should be able to carry off your own version of at least one of these songs.

"people are strange" can be played with just em, am and b chords.

"riders on the storm" can be played with just em, am, d and c chords, although you can experiment with playing a 'am-bm-c-bm' riff for the am part, to try to capture the sound originally created by the late ray manzarek on keyboards.


i've added these transcription to the other doors songs on the page, you can find them all at the link below:

ed sheeran is a rising star in the 'singer-songwriter' genre, one of the few areas i can draw on for good guitar-based music these days.i first heard of ed sheeran when i heard him perform "a team" on "later with jools holland", about 8 or 9 months ago, and it was obvious that this was a new talent about to burst upon the mainstream.  sure enough, ed released his debut album '+' in september last year, with 'a team' as the lead single hitting the uk charts at number 3.this was closely followed by the second single "you need me", which entered the charts at #4 - this one was a total change of pace, with ed having fun with a catchy little rap number, unfortunately not one i would attempt to work out guitar chords for!the lovely, whimsical "lego house", 3rd single from the album reached number 5 in the uk charts, and with the album + reaching number one in the album charts, a new star was born.i will make a point of getting hold of the new single "drunk" and having a close listen, and hopefully working out the chords.  in the meantime, i have worked out easy chords and lyrics versions of both "a team" and "lego house".you can find my chords and lyrics interpretations at the links below ( both songs are on my pop songs guitar chords page ) :a team~~~~~~guitar chords and lyrics to "a team" by ed sheeran ( play along with the video below or on ed sheeran "a team" on youtubelego house~~~~~~~~~~guitar chords and lyrics to "lego house" by ed sheeran ( play along with the video below or on ed sheeran "lego house" on youtubelego house~~~~~~~~~~guitar chords and lyrics to "lego house" by ed sheeran ( play along with the video below or on ed sheeran "lego house" on youtubeyou can check out the ed sheeran album and singles at cd universe - ed sheeran albums and singlesif you're looking to improve your guitar playing, check out my list of cool and useful guitarist resources on ( where else! ) my online guitarist resources page i also have a 'guitarsongs.info' facebook page - click on the link below and on the like button to join in the guitar buzz!follow guitarsongs.info on facebook enjoy your music!p.j. murphywebmaster: pj's guitar chords & lyrics - http://www.guitarsongs.info/guitar chords blog: http://www.guitar-chords.blogspot.com/guitar tips blog: http://www.guitar-tips.blogspot.com/squidoo lens: http://www.squidoo.com/guitarsongs/facebook page: guitarsongs.info on facebook

noel gallagher "death of you and me" guitar chords and lyrics





i was a huge fan of oasis in the mid-90s, once again thanks to the good taste of my lovely daughters!  as a result, there are obout 30 oasis songs on my oasis guitar chords page.i kinda didn't keep up with the later albums, but since hearing the first few songs from the debut album, simply titled "noel gallagher's high flying birds", i have been re-converted.  noel and his new troupe of musicians combine the best of the melodic side of oasis, without being 'oasis-light' - there is still a rocky edge to the sound.  delighted to hear that the new tour ( currently in ireland ) is really kicking up a storm, with fans and critics alike.i've worked out the chords and lyrics for the first single from the album "death of you and me", which for convenience i have posted to my oasis page (see above).  click on the link below to go straight to the page for the song:guitar chords and lyrics to "the death of you and me" by noel gallagher play along with the video above, or on youtube at noel gallagher's high flying birds "the death of you and me" on youtube you can check out the noel gallagher album and singles cd universe - noel gallagher albums and singlesif you're looking to improve your guitar playing, check out my list of cool and useful guitarist resources on ( where else! ) my online guitarist resources pagei have recently created a guitarsongs.info facebook page - click on the link below and on the like button to join in the guitar buzz!enjoy your music!p.j. murphywebmaster: pj's guitar chords & lyrics - http://www.guitarsongs.info/guitar chords blog: http://www.guitar-chords.blogspot.com/guitar tips blog: http://www.guitar-tips.blogspot.com/squidoo lens: http://www.squidoo.com/guitarsongs/facebook page: guitarsongs.info on facebook

death cab for cutie "codes and keys" guitar chords and lyrics





death cab for cutie are one of the bands who have been recommended to me by my daughters and their friends, but which i never seem to get around to having a good listen to.i did get a chance to have a listen to their new album "codes and keys", and was really impressed.  comparisons to coldplay, keane, snow patrol are inevitable, particularly with many of the songs being keyboard driven.  but they acquit themselves very highly in this company.i was particularly taken with the title track,  "codes and keys ( duh... ) and have worked out the chords and lyrics for it, which i've posted to my rock songs guitar chords page, or you can just click on the link below:guitar chords and lyrics to "codes and keys" by death cab for cutie.playing along with the video above, or on youtube at death cab for cutie "codes and keys" on youtube just a throwaway piece of info for the anoraks - the band got their name from a really funny song by the great 60's outfit "the bonzo dog doo-dah band".  just sayin'..!go to cduniverse to browse the album and singles from death cab:   death cab for cutie albums and singles at cd universeif you're looking to improve your guitar playing, check out my list of cool and useful guitarist resources on my online guitarist resources pageenjoy your music!p.j. murphywebmaster: pj's guitar chords & lyrics - http://www.guitarsongs.info/guitar chords blog: http://www.guitar-chords.blogspot.com/guitar tips blog: http://www.guitar-tips.blogspot.com/squidoo lens: http://www.squidoo.com/guitarsongs/facebook page: guitarsongs.info on facebook

bruno mars "the lazy song" guitar chords and lyrics





i've already worked out chords and lyrics for "just the way you are" and "grenade", the first two singles from bruno mars' chart-topping album "doo-wops and hooligans".  i really like his upbeat mix of pop, reggae and just generally "feelgood" music.i recently worked out and posted my interpretation of the third single from the album, "the lazy song", and posted it to my pop songs guitar chords  page, at the link below.  the original song is in the key of b major, which means that the song chords would be quite tricky for learning players.  i have transposed the song down four semitones, to the key of g ( every beginner's favourite! ), so the transposed chords are g, d, c, b7, am, bm and em.  just put a capo on the 4th fret to bring the song back to b, if you want to play along with the original. the song is available on my website at:guitar chords and lyrics to "the lazy song" by bruno marsplay along with the video below, or on youtube at bruno mars "the lazy song" on youtube  go to cd universe to check out bruno's album and singles -   bruno mars music at cd universeif you're looking to improve your guitar playing, check out my list of cool and useful guitarist resources on my online guitarist resources pageenjoy your music!p.j. murphywebmaster: pj's guitar chords & lyrics - http://www.guitarsongs.info/guitar chords blog: http://www.guitar-chords.blogspot.com/guitar tips blog: http://www.guitar-tips.blogspot.com/squidoo lens: http://www.squidoo.com/guitarsongs/facebook page: guitarsongs.info on facebook

aloe blacc "i need a dollar" chords and lyrics





aloe blacc is yet another artist i'd never heard of before this song hit the airwaves with a vengeance - but it would seem he has been performing and recording since the mid 90's.  "i need a dollar" was taken from his eight album, good things.the song is a pretty simple, straightforward r&b ( that's rhythm and blues folks! ) song, which maybe accounts for it's universal popularity.  although the song is in the fairly tricky key of g# minor, i have transcribed it down four semitones to e minor - put a capo on the 4th fret if you want to play it in the original key.  after transcription, the chords i've worked out are: em, d, am, and b7 for the verse/chorus, with the 'bridge' being bm, em and am.i've posted the chords for "i need a dollar" to my pop songs guitar chords  at the link below:guitar chords and lyrics to "i need a dollar" by aloe blaccyou might enjoy playing along with the video above, or on youtube at aloe blacc "i need a dollar on youtube you can buy aloe blacc's music at cd universe - aloe blacc albums and singlesif you're looking to improve your guitar playing, check out my list of cool and useful guitarist resources on ( where else! ) my online guitarist resources pagei have recently created a guitarsongs.info facebook page - click on the link below and on the like button to join in the guitar buzz!enjoy your music!p.j. murphywebmaster: pj's guitar chords & lyrics - http://www.guitarsongs.info/guitar chords blog: http://www.guitar-chords.blogspot.com/guitar tips blog: http://www.guitar-tips.blogspot.com/squidoo lens: http://www.squidoo.com/guitarsongs/facebook page: guitarsongs.info on facebook

adele "set fire to the rain" guitar chords and lyrics





yes, it's another adele song, who'd have thought?!  in fairness, she has just brought out a bunch of really good songs in rapid succession, so when looking for songs to add to my website, she's a godsend!!another power-ballad, with nice melodic verse and bridge building up to an anthemic and memorable chorus.  the original song is in the key of d minor - i have transcribed it to a minor to create an easier set of chords to play, so you would need to put a capo on the 5th fret to play along with adele's version.i've posted my transcription of "set fire to the rain" to my pop songs guitar chords  page at the link below:guitar chords and lyrics for adele "set fire to the rain" you can have fun playing along with the video above, or on youtube at adele "set fire to the rain" on youtube adele's albums and singles can be browsed at cd universe - adele music pageadele's official website is http://www.adele.tv/ if you're looking to improve your guitar playing, check out my list of cool and useful guitarist resources on ( where else! ) my online guitarist resources pagei have recently created a guitarsongs.info facebook page - click on the link below and on the like button to join in the guitar buzz!enjoy your music!p.j. murphywebmaster: pj's guitar chords & lyrics - http://www.guitarsongs.info/guitar chords blog: http://www.guitar-chords.blogspot.com/guitar tips blog: http://www.guitar-tips.blogspot.com/squidoo lens: http://www.squidoo.com/guitarsongs/facebook page: guitarsongs.info on facebook
