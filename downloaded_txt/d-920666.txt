pop lovein the unlikeliest of placesclarityin a singable songas you drive the route usedto drag your toddler into nap.or taped to a wall in a neighborhood bistro:we will all wake up together.words tumblespark as they fitfill corners of the room.this time the heart liesin a safe roomundetectable by armiesof skeletal trees in moonlight.the myth of first love tugsat the compass needlebut true north is not swayedfor longcannot be tricked by scenery.you should definitely be able to livewithout being swallowed up.shooting stars do not slingfor anyoneor two.they are long burned out(we are told)copies of copieslike us.turn off the pop songthe quiet is enoughto wake us.~j.b. rowelllabels: love song, poem

	 hi squirrel
	 
    


      in the redwood grovebehind the school,where my two oldest settle in,i teach my youngest how to say hito the squirrelsto help him not be afraid.i think about how almost 20 years agoi was caught talking to a squirrelon my way down the dorm steps"hi squirrel!"i said cheerily,and looked up to seeyou walking toward.i was sure you would laughor think i am a loonor bothbut you smiled,like he smilesas he takes coins from my pocketand puts them in his ownand runs off.~j.b. rowell

	 just keep sweeping, just keep sweeping, sweeping, sweeping
	 
    


      i stare into the window of the empty house next doornotice a door openthat wasn't open beforeor maybe it's a new angle ofsunlight finding the way  spiders claim sills beneathour own windows reflectedwe keep sweeping webs away while that other houseslowly becomes encased in a feast of emptiness~j.b. rowell

	 nature experiences with children
	 
    


      first there's the planning.before or after nap?what to pack in the bag?how much snack and water?reminders to layer; load up the minivan.then there's the drive. whoever said that it's all about the journey didn't have kids.arrive.park in the shade, walk in, read the sign,learn what to do if we encounter a mountain lion:#5 "do all you can to appear larger."we act out just how that might be done.#7 "fight back if attacked."we pick out good fighting sticks.begin our hike,stop, wait for a striped snake to cross.wonder if it's poisonous, notice how much faster it goes in grass than on the paved path, talk about how it moves like a dragonin the chinese new year's parade.wait and watch until it disappears into the trees.walk 15 minutes . . .stop for snack, complain about the snack, remind them not to drink all of the water so soon.decide to head back on the upper trail.we've had enough already.the youngest has been screamingbee! bee!every time something that is not a beebuzzes his ears.remind them to listen to nature . . .  . . . the oldest announcesthat her butt itches, the middle thinks a mosquitogot into his pantsand is right next to his pickleand points.remind him to call his parts by their real names. remind them all to look up at the redwoods, whoa . . .back to trudging eyes downwith frequent warnings from themabout poop and poison ivy just ahead.finally,back on the main path, our tiny hiking loop is almost closed. follow the momentum of yellowtailsto the parking lot, remind them not to bring nature in the minivan, the sticks stay.~j.b. rowelllabels: children, hike, poem
