(published
continually since 1998, "news you can use" was a blog before the word
"blog" was  even invented! it's intention has been to help inform
the
football coach and the intereted football observer on a wide variety of
topics, usually - but not always - related in some way to coaching or
leadership.  it contains news and views often (trigger alert!)
highly
opinionated but  thought-provoking.  subjects cover but
aren't limited
to coaching, leadership, character, football history and current
football happenings, education, parenting, citizenship and patriotism,
other sports, and even, sometimes, my offense.)   go to news you can use
