about smartshare


a different kind of timeshare company!
we were the 1st timeshare company licensed by the state of washington that deals exclusively in the secondary market!
we get our inventory from several sources… clients that have gone through a change in lifestyle because of age, marital status, finances, etc. another source of inventory is from foreclosures or failure to maintain maintenance fee payments. we only sell properties that are free and clear or assumable! 
all of our properties are part of the rci or interval international exchange system, giving you more than 5000 resorts worldwide! 

















featured resorts
we sell all types of timeshares. we deal with all the different developers like marriott, hilton, westin, hyatt, diamond, vacation internationale and more.
we specialize in worldmark… we sell several hundred worldmark premier contracts every year and it is the only timeshare that we give a money back guarantee on!! give us a call for more details.

happy clients





bill, thank you for getting my transfers completed so quickly! you have done everything you said you would and more. i definitely will buy more credits from you in the future.

benjamin, hastings, ne




wow! we just bought our worldmark contract from marc and saved over $5000! thank you for explaining the benefits of buying timeshare vacations on the secondary market. your knowledge, insight and guidance helped us make the right decision. we are excited to book our first trip.

john and elena, huntsville, al




we were so impressed with smartshare.com and with the ease of purchasing one contract through them. after only one year we purchased a second contract. we enjoy our vacations very much, and will be buying again, in the future.

kathryn, caldwell, id




we stayed at a great place called sun club. we met so many nice people from all over the world. we went on the cruise “bora bora”. we went snorkeling, and hiked to a waterfall. on a different day, we went marlin fishing, but only caught a yellow tail. the restaurant at the resort prepared our catch, and we ate it for dinner. we love our timeshare!

roger and darla, waterville, me




marc and bill were a real god-send when my husband and i made the decision to sell our timeshare. they had incredible product knowledge and were so patient with our questions about the selling process. we certainly recommend their services to anyone wanting to buy or sell a timeshare package.

earl and lorraine, winnipeg, manitoba, canada




i would recommend smartshare.com and marc as broker for the selling of your timeshare ownership. the sale happened exactly as he said it would. the price was more than reasonable, and the closing process was streamlined and not confusing. the sale of timeshare ownership is a very special market which marc and his staff has perfected. if you are wanting to sell your timeshare, you can depend on smartshrae.com to give you an accurate prediction as to the length needed to process the transaction, and the value of what you want to sell.

werner and janice, salina, ks




i want to express my appreciation for rachelle, for the efficient and attentive service she provided for the recent sale of my timeshare. once i decided to sell, she took care of all the paperwork and answered all my questions. i can see she is a great asset to smartshare.com.

tom & suzy, toledo, oh




thank you for a great vacation. this was our first rci exchange, and a dream come true. a blue week in the bahamas, such a deal. had a great time night shark fishing.

mike and judy, lancaster, pa
