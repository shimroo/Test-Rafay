when posting to rukind



introduce yourself first!  we think of each other as being part of a community, and want to know who you are.  use this as an opportunity to honestly represent yourself and why you are here.
be respectful of others when posting: there is a lot of leeway of what is acceptable here, but, your point should be able to be made without humiliating, hateful words, witch-hunts, ganging up, bullying, name calling, threats, or violence. (the types of things that you wouldn't find acceptable at a dead show.)
be kind: a good rule of thumb when interacting on this site is to ask yourself: are you kind?
