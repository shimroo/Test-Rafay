how the department of geography launches your career“students are told they need to go to college to get a degree, but rarely told how to translate their experiences into a career. i’ve spent several years working to bring career readiness to geography students, providing career advising and developing a course to help students translate their experiences into something that sets them up well for both a career and to be an effective global citizen. one of the most rewarding parts of my job is seeing a student who thinks they have no skills transform into someone confidently speaking about what they can do.”—leslie mclees, undergraduate director




our degree programsundergraduate and graduate programs in the department of geography feature courses that span the range of the discipline, but allow students to develop a depth of knowledge in their interest areas. courses offer topics that range from political economy and cultural analysis to climate change and water systems that help examine the depth and breadth of human-environment relationships in the past, present, and potential futures. we have a range of courses that focus on the concepts and technology involved in geographic analysis, including gis, remote sensing, and cartography.undergraduate degreesbachelor of arts or science in geographybachelor of arts or science in spatial data science and technologyminor in geographyminor in climate studies graduate degreesmaster of arts or science in geographyphd in geography applydeclare or change majorvisit uo





 









learn from experts in the fieldour world-class faculty regularly publish in high-quality journals and bring funding to support their research, including student assistants. geography faculty are passionate about the subjects they teach because, like any geographer, when they look out at the world, they want to understand the change, inequality, and injustice that shapes our experiences. our connections to our alumni and local organizations help students visualize the many pathways open to them.research faculty directory





 









get real-world experiencewe offer a variety of ways for students to understand and apply the ideas they develop in their coursework to the world. we strongly support internships and study abroad; we offer positions in labs; and we offer ways of interacting with recent alumni through geography club. many of our courses have a fieldwork component, and in others you will get experience asking and answering questions like a geographer through independent course projects.experiential learning
