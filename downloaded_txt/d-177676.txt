history of the 
cigar store indian, wooden indians, shop figures and wood statues used as commercial advertisement signpost's for retail and tobacco shops throughout early america . 
our research begins with the discovery of tobacco and the development of early colonies in both north and south america. we explore old world artisans as they immigrate to the new world bringing the crafts required to produce the cigar store indian. 
until recently, a great mystery surrounded the history and origin of cigar store indian, wooden indians, shop figures and wood statues that are a part of american folk sculpture. in nearly all instances, these wooden statues are associated with tobacco shops and when rare exhibits are offered we find that the sculpture is often labeled (artist unknown.)

mayan indians, tobacco, christopher columbus,
 language, marketing, independence, wooden sailing ships, sidewalk restrictions, pocahontas, merchants, cigar-store indians, and much more as we
 investigate this elusive legend.         tobacco a catalyst for colonial growth & dynamics  
       tobacco is native to the americas, and the practice of inhaling the smokeof the dried plant material was first documented
 in the mayan indian culture more than 2,000 years ago. the mayans moved northward from central america through the aztec empire and eventually took 
 their customs to north american indian tribes.         the arawak indians of the caribbean smoked tobacco; christopher 
 columbus, during his 1492 voyage, found them smoking "loosely rolled cigars". men returning from inland expeditions reported with incredible tales,
 including stories of indians with "smoking heads". first, christophercolumbus in 1492 and later, the spanish conqueror hernando cortes in 1519 
 took tobacco seeds to europe. less than 50 years later, in the mid-1500's, tobacco had become a valuable commodity in global trade.   
       where in 1561 jean nicot gave the plant its' generic name, nicotiana. sir walter raleigh began the popularization of pipe smoking 
 in great britain in 1586, and the cultivation and consumption of tobacco spread with each voyage of discovery from europe.      
   while at this time we see the birth of professional wood carving in three-dimensional form evolving from this medieval period with single figures 
 and groups for major altarpieces and for niches in large architectural screens. during the 16th century these figures assumed a grace of poseand realism,
 of detail, that represent a high point in the art of wood sculpture.         discovery of the new world brought about a 
 revitalization of europeanculture, which would lead to the industrial revolution and the pursuit ofraw materials and markets, which in turn 
 would lead to worldwideeuropean colonialism on a grand scale. the americans' contribution toworld culture was tobacco as its first cash 
 export crop.         john b. rolfe 1585, was one of the first permanent english settlers in virginia and the first
 tobacco plantation owner in the virginia colony. located at jamestown around 1610 and is credited with developing the strain of tobacco that became
 virginia's staple crop.         in 1614 he married the indian princess pocahontas, with her father'sapproval the 
 union symbolized a growing trend of indian submission, colony independence and tobacco as a commercial crop. john rolfe remained a successful
 tobacco planter and the following eight years of peaceful indian relations stabilized the tobacco production in the colony.    
     the origin of the wooden indian dates back to england in 1617, when small wooden figures called "virginie men" were placed on counter tops 
 to represent tobacco companies. these "virginians" (the local english renditions of indians) were depicted as black men wearing headdresses and 
 kilts made of tobacco leaves.         commercial transportation for tobacco cargo from virginia and immigration transportation
 to virginia was contracted sailing vessels for the long oceanic crossing. often identified by the brightly polychrome or gilded wooden figurehead, 
 perched prominently on the front or bow of the vessel, under the bowsprit.         wood carving, or wood sculpture, 
 is one of the oldest and mostwidespread forms of art. because of the near universality of trees, the relative simplicity of the necessary technology,
 and the relative durability of the product, wood carving has been practiced in almost all cultures from the earliest times. 

        professional carvers often paid for transatlantic voyage by carving or maintenance of previous carved ship figurehead and 
 mast during the crossing. from approximately 1760 to 1880, however, these figures were often life-size human forms, either realistic portraits of prominent
 historicalfigures or mythical ideal types, carved to stride, point, or look forward with serious mien.         the great
 sailing clipper ship along with professional wood carvers profession would soon be in jeopardy. the first transatlantic passage by a steam powered vessel was made
 in 1827.         as steam ships brought about the decline in sailing vessels the professional carvers turned their attention to 
 new marketing enterprises. most cigar-store indians were carved in eastern seaboard or midwestern cities by artisans who might never have actually encountered a
 native american; the figures look like white men in native garb. "in retrospect experts believe that the population of original cigar-store indians made 
 (said to be approximately 100,000 or so around the turn of the century) is now about several thousand or less."         
 the cigar-store indian crosses the atlantic ocean for two reasons:        economics and sociology. in the american
 entrepreneurial spirit, some innovative tobacco sellers sought unconventional images for their trade signs to set them apart from the more established 
 merchants.         the merchant customer often remembered the quality look and feel of specific wooden indian over the
 products of the merchant. these indians would enhance the flavor of high class cigar friendly smoking rooms, increase the appearance of fashionable
 hotel lobbies or go nicely on thesidewalk of the local tobacconist shop. 

        at the same time, since the carvers were all competing among themselves for the tobacconists' business, each tried
 to out-do the other in individuality, versatility and depth.         artists like the skillin family, john cromwell
 (most noted for his v shape headdress), thomas brooks (leaning statues) and samuel robb (indian maiden) operated full time studio's, employing staff carvers
 and painters to meet production demands. they put out catalogs of their product lines and frequently updated and expanded them.      
   from the mid-18th to the early 19th century the skillin family of boston produced preeminent carvers in wood. ship figure-heads, architectural details,
 ornamental garden figures, and pediment figures of mahogany came from their shops.         simeon skillin, 1716-78, reputed to be
 america's first sculptor, received important commissions, primarily for ship carvings, but also for shop signs and portrait busts. most notable was the shop
 established by john skillin, 1747-1800, and simeon skillin, jr., 1757-1806, which enjoyed a nationwide reputation. their works testify to the contemporary
 enthusiasmfor allegorical abstraction and graceful neoclassical forms. the brothers' training and example influenced the style of subsequent wood carving 
 in the united states.         the american-made cigar-store indian were clothed in fringed buckskins, draped with blankets, 
 decorated with feathered headdresses and sometimes shown holding tomahawks or bows, arrows and spears. their facial features rarely resembled members of any 
 particular american indian.         cigar-store indians were designed to capture the attention of the people walking by, informing 
 them that tobacco was sold inside. it is said that the average cigar smoker in america in the late 1800s couldn't read the words "tobacconist shop". 
        america was quickly becoming a social melting pot of people with diverse origins. the average nineteenth-century american 
 resident lacked a shared common language, and so the sidewalk cigar-store indian was vital for business.         visual trade 
 signs were essentially stand-ins for written sign-posts that might have been incomprehensible to potential customers, many of them immigrants.  
       the carvers sculpted indian chiefs, braves, princesses and indian maidens, sometimes with boarded papooses. most of these displayed
 some form of tobacco in their hands or on their clothing.         today in the late 20th century the best of the wooden cigar-store indian
 antique sculptures sell for as much as $500,000.         the value of any one cigar-store indian is determined by its condition,
 the artistic integrity of the form and the quality and intricacy of the carving in that order. the decisive factor is the condition of the wood finish. 
        a cigar-store indian with its original paint is a almost impossible treasure to find and receives top dollar. original cigar-store 
 indian paint finishes are extremely hard to find because the sidewalk statues were repainted on a regular basis as a routine maintenance and marketing measure. 
        as marketing "sign-posts", they were meant to appear fresh and welcoming, not peeling and faded. the original paint was applied
 in the sculptors workshop using a poly chrome paint utilizing softer brush hairs than found on modern hand-brushes. the technique has produce a lookand feel 
 of satin with an almost translucent glow. the essence of the over-all statue is lighter and more elegant than imaginable.        
 throughout the years of ownership most cigar-store indians experience replications by itinerant painters with a variety paint that had a completely different
 texture, finish and appeal. all collectors classify finding an original cigar-store indian with original paint as being very unlikely.    
     determining the artistic integrity of a statue is as subjective as judging any piece of sculpture. each artist has a unique style. since most 
 of the statues are unsigned, they can be attributed to a particular artist or his shop by identifying characteristic modeling techniques or body positions. 
        some artist elicited creations from quartered ship masts. constricted by the diameter of the wood, the statues are often spindly.
 by turning them upside down, you can see the wood's straight grain and count the rings of the log to measure the age of the tree.      
   a few artists did used native americans as models. thomas brooks wasassociated by the name "leaners," wooden indians resting their elbows on log
 posts, barrels or over-sized cigars. john cromwell's trademark was a distinctive v-shaped headdress. french canadian louis jobin tended to place his cigar-store
 indians with the left arm at chest level holding a robe and grasping a bundle of cigars in the right hand.         the man who
 probably made more statues and perhaps most well known of all sculptors in new york was samuel anderson robb. his attendance of art school laid the ground work
 for gainful employment lasting for 60 years from 1864 until 1924.         after his first wife died, sam robb began fashioning sweet-faced
 indian maidens holding roses similar to the kind he designed for his wife's tombstone.         where are all the elegant cigar-store 
 indians made by the american sculptors." the value of these sidewalk signs of yesteryear is rising like the cost of cigars themselves because of the passion for
 cigars and related collectibles.         many of these pieces have survived; attributed to the fact that after the first world war,
 when production stopped and many had been "brought inside" as a result of the 1910 urban-sidewalk-obstruction laws. countless indian statues were sold from the 
 commercial streets and slowly disappeared. as america survived the depression most wooden cigar-store indians were broken and burned as firewood.

an enterprising 19th-century merchant who could afford the purchase price - which
 could run up to several hundred dollars - would invest in a shop figure to promote his wares 
 
. while some shop figures were counter top models, the most convincing of these silent
 hawkers stood just outside the door, and were often mounted on wheels so that they could be rolled in and out. such full-length figures date to the 1700's, but had their
 heyday in the mid-to late 1800's; they began to disappear after the turn of the century as electrified signs made them increasingly obsolete.
the products of woodworking shops, these large sculptures
 were often made by shop carvers who turned their hand to other types of carving as their own trade declined. different figures signaled different wares - a jaunty sailor
 was likely to stand in front of a ship's chandlery, for example, while a chinaman might appear by the door of a tea emporium. 
the most common type of shop figure, however, identified the tobacconist's. these figures, initially inspired by the american indian - who had introduced the exotic
 weed to european explores - originated in 17th-century england. in america, however, indian figures were not made in quantity until the mid-1800's. they generally
 depicted sterotypical chiefs and squaws - with plumed headdresses, tomahawks, or bows and arrows - but as the use of the indian figure became widespread, carvers
 turned to more novel subjects, like the clown character, punch or uncle sam, appropriately shown with a bundle of cigars, a snuffbox, or a pipe.
the trade signs and shop figures that merchants customarily placed
 outside their stores enticed customers to spend their money on an ever-increasing range of goods during the 1800's. when the century opened, the american mercantile
 system was a specialized one. since there was no wholesaling, merchants both in cities and in small towns generally made their own wares, and thus concentrated on a single 
 product. the hat-maker crafted and sold hats, for example, while the apothecary purveyed the drugs and remedies he mixed. one exception to the specialized shop, however,
 was the rural trading post, where farmers bartered their excess produce for necessities ranging from bullets to molasses.
by the mid-1800's, the development of factories and mills,
 as well as improved transportation systems, enabled manufacturers to distribute products on a national scale. city shops became retail outlets for manufactured goods,
 and the trading post developed into the bustling emporium known as the country store, which now stocked food delicacies, toilet soap, paris ribbon, and brussels lace, 
 as well as more ordinary basics. the keeper of the country store often served as banker and postmaster, and his place of business also might double as a meeting lodge
 and social club, where townsfolk could gather to discuss politics or play checkers at the ubiquitous cracker barrel.
shop figures were not the only form of advertising
that was used in early america; no sooner did business become established in this country than did trade symbols begin to appear over doorways and windows. these large,
 three-dimensional sculptures, the outgrowth of a european tradition believed to have originated with the ancient romans, were initially intended to catch the attention
 of a predominantly illiterate public by offering visual, rather than verbal, messages. bold and self-explanatory, an oversize cutler's knife or a giant locksmith's key
 could be "read" instantly by any potential customer - even one passing by quickly on horseback or carriage.
 
most trade symbols were commissioned by business owners from hand craftsmen. those carved from wood were generally made by the same workshops that produced ship carvings
 and shop figures. metal trade symbols were produced by smiths working in tin, iron, and copper, and beginning in the mid-19th century, metal trade symbols were manufactured 
 in factories that specialized in ornamental cast iron and zinc. tradesman wanting to advertise their particular talents also craft signs for themselves; it was only
 natural, for instance, for a farrier to hammer out an enormous horseshoe that he could hang outside his own forge. 
their exaggerated forms and the simple logic of their straightforward
 symbolism endow these overblown sculptures with a peculiar appeal. the references were intentionally obvious: scissors indicated the services of a tailor, a pocket
 watch a jeweler, a shoe a shoemaker, a gun a gunsmith. an oversize tooth was the chilling, yet immediately recognizable sign of a dentist, while a mortar and pestle
 identified an apothecary. sometimes the design came from a long established symbol, like the striped barber's pole. new forms might also develop with the arrival of
 an industry; the image of the sheep, for example, became a standard symbol for the numerous woolen textile mills that began operation in 19th-century england. 
while many trade symbols were simple sculptural forms, some were quite elaborate, featuring a variety of mechanical contrivances and moving parts. a 
tin teapot displayed above the doorway of a tea shop, for example, might be plumbed with steam pipes so that puffs of steam would waft from its spout in cold weather.
 in an equally novel approach, the bespectacled eyes that frequently appeared over opticians' shops 
 were often illuminated with gas lamps in the late 1800s, and then later,
 as technology developed, with electric lights.
as the form of a trade symbol was generally sufficient to convey information, lettering was seldom added. at the most, a sign might include the name of
 the proprietor. but while this could be advantageous for a business owner in a busy city-where there might be more than one hatter or one butcher in the same neighborhood-it was
 hardly necessary in a rural community. in small towns, competition among shopkeepers seldom existed, and proprietors were generally already known by name.

 museum quality testament to 19th century history. they specialize in native american art and 19th century western sculpture. their cigar store indians and totem
