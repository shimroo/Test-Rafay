we make independent living possible.
since 1997, we've helped hundreds of people with developmental disabilities achieve and maintain independence.
our programs are designed with the individual in mind, providing personalized skill-building experiences, social activities and independent living support to make the journey to independence an easier one.
learn more about our five programs here.








new independence-building program coming this summer!
new this summer, we're launching the independence prep residency program. if you're looking to take the next step in your journey towards independence, this program is for you!
participants will take part in the summer camp weekdays from july 7 - 25, and in the evenings will stay in an omo apartment (going home for weekends). students will experience independence and practice the skills they're learning at camp in a practical, real-world setting each evening. omo staff will provide evening support. space is limited, so early registration is highly encouraged!
for more information, visit the independence prep program page.

the application period for the 2025-26 independence college academic year is open.
this two-year residential college-style experience is for students 18+ who are looking to improve and practice their independent living and vocational skills.
applications are due march 1. for more information, please visit:  independence college.
