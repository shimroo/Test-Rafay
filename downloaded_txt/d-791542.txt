susan mohammed led the development of the pennsylvania state university team science toolbox 







susan mohammed led the development of the pennsylvania state university team science toolbox (https://ctsi.psu.edu/research-support/team-science-toolbox/), which features evidence-based team interventions to support team leaders and members dealing with the complex challenges of forming, launching, and managing teams. the toolbox is specifically tailored to team science novices who desire ready access to practical, pertinent team knowledge addressing specific team needs. toolbox content highlights team interventions supported by science to help identify and select the right members, aid teams in getting off to a good start, and help members foster effective team dynamics. as such, an array of tools are featured to support diverse teams throughout their life cycle from team formation (e.g., team assembly, team composition), to team launch (e.g., kick-off meetings, ice breakers, team ground rules, team goal setting, team charters) to team maturation (e.g., cohesion, psychological safety, conflict resolution, vertical leadership, shared leadership, team building, team meetings, team debriefs). check out the toolbox at: https://ctsi.psu.edu/research-support/team-science-toolbox/.
