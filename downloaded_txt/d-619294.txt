   adventure, friendship, & growth




 since our inception, whitewater voyages' motto and continuing goal has been to foster an environment where "adventure, friendship, and growth" permeates our trips. "adventure" is naturally and amply supplied by the nature of the beautiful stretches of river we run. whether newly formed, rekindled, or reinforced over the course of a river trip, "friendship" is one of the key element of all of our trips. our rafting trips provide a wonderful venue to bond with family and friends as well as meet new people and form new relationships. "growth" is the natural by-product of a shared experience and is an essential element of a full, meaningful life. whether you join us for a two hour, class iii lickety split trip, or a three day, class v trip on the forks of the kern you can be assured that your experience with whitewater voyages will be rich with
adventure,
friendship and growth!
