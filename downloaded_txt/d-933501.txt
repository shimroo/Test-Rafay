armor bearing protection 



bearing failure accounts for a large majority of industrial mechanical failures. rbi bearing now offers armor bearing technology and protection to reduce bearing failure and extend the bearing life, which means less downtime and reduced repair costs.

product quality 



we know consistency is key to keeping your production line moving. all bearing series must be consistent in terms of dimensions, materials, grease, performance, etc. if one shipment of bearings is inconsistent with the previous shipment, that could lead to safety problems, equipment breakdowns, increased cost, and unnecessary headaches.

we❤️our customers 











				we needed tapered roller bearings asap. rbi came in clutch and stayed after hours fulfilled my order, dropped off the shipment at ups for overnight/saturday delivery direct to our plant. the downtime was minimal, we were back up and running saturday afternoon.			

rbi customer, primary metals










				i don't have to call or send in a release for my blanket orders. my rbi account manager calls me. he's on top of it.			

rbi customer, industrial distributor










				i place stock orders every few months and rbi has the local inventory to fulfill the entire order every time. they are quick to restock the part numbers that i order regularly.			

rbi customer, industrial distributor










				our engineer worked with rbi bearing on a design for a custom bearing. the response time and attention to the details was on point.
