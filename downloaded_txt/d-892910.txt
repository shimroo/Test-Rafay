center for infertility and reproductive surgery




the center for infertility and reproductive surgery (cirs) at brigham and women’s hospital is one of the premier infertility and reproductive medicine programs in the country. our renowned team has one of the highest numbers of physicians in the nation that are certified by the american board of obstetrics and gynecology in reproductive endocrinology and fertility services.
cirs offers all available procedures and services to treat infertility, including in vitro fertilization (ivf), pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, in vitro fertilization (ivf) with donor eggs, and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi) with assisted hatching. we also perform minimally invasive and robot-assisted gynecological surgery for reproductive disorders including myomectomy (fibroid treatment), endometriosis treatment, and tubal ligation reversal. our specialized expertise and access to the latest therapies and technologies in reproductive disorders and reproductive gynecological surgery enable us to tailor treatments to meet your individual needs.
we have our own nationally-certified, full-service laboratories, capable of performing an array of sophisticated tests and specialized capabilities including embryo freezing. in addition, the center has been a leader in research that has advanced ways to improve reproductive health and maximize the chance of a successful pregnancy, while minimizing risks of triplets or greater multiples which can place mother and child at greater risk.
our physicians see patients in convenient locations throughout boston. we also offer early morning or evening appointments.
