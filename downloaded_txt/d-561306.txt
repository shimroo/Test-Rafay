about us

the assembly of manitoba chiefs was created in 1988 by first nations in manitoba to coordinate political action and technical work on common issues. it is a product of political and social developments that have been underway for decades.
faced with the domination and assimilation policies of canadaâ€™s department of indian affairs, first nations have long recognized their common interests and the strength to be found in solidarity.
