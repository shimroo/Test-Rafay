fred rogers institute
in addition to being one of the most beloved figures in the history of children’s television, fred rogers was a close friend of saint vincent college. today, the fred rogers institute carries on his legacy in the fred rogers center, right here on campus.
the institute is home to one of our honors communities, the fred rogers scholars. it also hosts incubator 143, a research and development lab for undergraduate and graduate students. beyond students, you can find the fred rogers archive along with a permanent exhibit of mr. rogers’ life and work, while projects like the educators’ neighborhood and an annual conference bring his work and legacy to the broader community.

winnie palmer nature reserve
just across the street from campus, the winnie palmer nature reserve allows students to explore nature, take a relaxing walk, or put their environmental education and science learnings into action. the 50-acre reserve is filled with more than two miles of trails, meadows, gardens, an environmental learning barn, the historic lochry blockhouse, a pond, and more.
the reserve was first established in honor of winnie palmer, the late wife of renowned golfer arnold palmer and a strong part of our community. today, it is a popular spot for not just our students, but members of the local community as well.

honors community
imagine a scholarly community that values your personal life as much as your academic life. what would happen if, through that approach, six distinct honors programs were integrated into one tightly knit honors community?
welcome to the honors community at saint vincent college – an intellectual community of high-achieving students who aim to put their skills to use in the real world. programs include our aurelius scholars, fred rogers scholars, step scholars, wimmer scholars, benedictine leadership studies, and honors scholars. from an enriched experience to financial assistance, each of them is designed to help our students succeed.

beyond campus
saint vincent college is nestled in the heart of the laurel highlands, surrounded by some of the most beautiful nature pennsylvania has to offer. still lakes, ski resorts, hiking trails, and state parks are just a short drive away from campus and a regular destination for college-led student trips.
our neighboring city is latrobe, the birthplace of both professional football and the banana split. here, you’ll find restaurants, boutique stores, and coffee shops. a few minutes west, the city of greensburg has even more shopping opportunities and eateries and of course, the bustling city of pittsburgh is less than an hour’s drive away.





global experiences
make your college education a springboard to exploring the world. every year, nearly 100 students study abroad in more than 10 global locations. you can also take credit-eligible courses with professors that incorporate learning outcomes directly into guided study abroad trips such as benedictine mission trips to senegal, literary travel to ireland, and leadership experiences in portugal.
our partnerships with faith-based communities worldwide can broaden your horizon during study abroad and international service trips. immerse yourself in another culture while fostering meaningful connections to explore not only what is unique about other cultures, but also what is universal about our human experience.





saint vincent archabbey
saint vincent college and monastery were founded in 1846 by boniface wimmer, a german monk striving to educate immigrants in the region. today, saint vincent archabbey has grown to become one of the largest monasteries in the world, and its impact is still felt every day by the college it sponsors.
benedictine monks teach as professors and work in in offices across campus, from our president father paul taylor to our director of campus ministry father maximilian maxwell. they embody benedictine values like community, humility, and love of christ and neighbor that drove boniface wimmer on his mission to america.
