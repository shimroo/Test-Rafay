ancient chinese proverb





an organization is like a tree full of monkeys, all on different limbs at different levels. some monkeys are climbing up, some down.

the monkeys on top look down and see a tree full of smiling faces.

the monkeys on the bottom look up and see nothing but monkey hindquarters.
