a monet masterpiece now on viewa very special new addition is on view in our monet gallery: water lilies, reflections of weeping willows (about 1916–19) is a large-scale work of the style that defined the last years of monet’s career. on loan from a private collection, the painting features a deep jewel-toned color palette and captures the expressive power of the artist’s increasingly abstract later work. don’t miss your chance to see it in a fully reimagined gallery display.
