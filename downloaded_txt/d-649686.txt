“such a fun trip on a scenic railroad!”



tripadvisor reviewer




i had a wonderful ride on the frostburg flyer while in the area for a weekend getaway. the train ride was relaxing, the staff was amazing, and the views were incredible. i will definitely be back!

“seeing the 1309 running is worth the price of admission alone.”



tripadvisor reviewer




what an amazing trip. i'm glad we waited for the weekend to ride the steam powered train. seeing the 1309 running is worth the price of admission alone. the conductor was very friendly and answered a ton of questions for us. he and his wife actually own two of the cars that they lease to wmsr. you can tell he cares deeply about preserving the heritage of the railroad. we bought deluxe seats, but were free to roam about the train. spent a bit in the open air cars, and the disclaimer is true. it is loud and dirty, but so cool!

“the polar express crew did an excellent job!”



google reviewer




the polar express crew did an excellent job!  we had a group  of 10, nana, papa, two sons and 6 grands. everyone had a wonderful time. a gentle ride to the north polar to pick up santa and then santa entertained us on the way back home. loved the old steam train. a beautiful ride through the mountains and we were fortunate enough to get some snow!  we will do it again!

“not only was the train a wonder to behold, the staff were wonderful as well.”



jacqui f




we took a ride on the polar express, and we were seated in the upper level of the ocean view car. the ride was driven by their steam locomotive. not only was the train a wonder to behold, the staff were wonderful as well. the station is beautiful, as well as the restored downtown area surrounding it. we will definitely be back, not only for the polar express but for scenic rides as well.

“‘hands on the throttle’ of a 2250 hp, quarter-million pound locomotive? absolutely fantastic experience!”



brian s




it was a superb time, and worth every penny to experience operating a locomotive of a vintage similar to those my grandfather ran prior to his retirement. david really enjoys his job, and it shows. carol and i had a great time, and encourage anyone thinking about wmsr's hott to stop thinking and make a reservation!

“great food, train ride and customer service”



phil p.




we went up to catch the murder mystery train and were not disappointed. getting tickets was a breeze, boarding, food and their customer service was outstanding. the evening murder mystery was fun and the actors were interesting and funny. we highly recommend you give one of their events a try. it will be worth the time and money.

“great way to see the fall leaves!”



gmc507




had a wonderful time riding the train from cumberland to frostburg, then riding our bikes back down the mountain. booking, check-in and loading the bikes was very easy. lots of parking at the station. the conductors and people who load and unload the bikes could not have been more patient and helpful. the train ride was beautiful, comfortable and fun.
