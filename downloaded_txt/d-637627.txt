a family tradition from dresden
in dresden, germany, friends and business associates have long exchanged stollen bread to celebrate the holiday season. when irmgard maron came to the united states in 1938, she brought a cherished recipe for stollen from her native dresden. she began baking for friends and relatives during the holidays, and at their urging, started a small bakery business. eighty-three years later, dresden stollen bakers continues as a family business dedicated to baking this deliciously rich german bread once a year to celebrate the holiday season.
happy holidays from our family to yours,  the maron family bakers


					dresden stollen bakers only produces stollen bread once a year.
