our sweet sweet sovereign





not sure if everyone knows, but in february of 2009, we bought a 62 acre farm.  over the past 6+ plus years, we've also added two more kids.. we're at 5; 4 boys and a girl... the boys are currently 14, 12, 8, and 6... with our only girl rounding out the pack at just over 2 years old.   with the farm, the numerous farm animals and the kids, it's been hard to get out on the road for a vacation..so we've been doing alot of 1 overnighters usually within an hour or so from the farm.. we get chores done, drive to our destination.. spend the night relaxing, and then spend the net day taking our time on our way home exploring.. we get home and do chores again... or we just camp up on our hill that i keep mowed as our own personal campsite.. here are some photos of the spot on the hill! oh - i'm also including a bunch of sotr interior shots too, along with one of our latest addition to the farm, our own jersey heifer calf.  enjoy!

a sweet soverign little trip





ok, we pulled the trailer over to bowman lake state park on thursday night, where we stayed after doing thursday night chores. we got up early friday morning, towed home and did the morning chores ( goat milking, watering all 100 + animals, hay to the sheep and goats, chicken feed to chickens and fed the dogs). we then got underway headed for the herkimer ny koa, where we were taking the boys to the herkimer diamond mines to do a little treasure hunting. we had a blast. we arrived at 1pm, got set up and were in the mines around 230pm or so. 30 minutes later, my left index finger was gushing the red stuff... after miles and miles of telling the boys how careful they needed to be.. it was i, that ended up needing stitches.. well - we just glued it together... and a band aid!! deep cut!! we went back to the campground and walked down to the river to crayfish island. later that evening, we did the koa wagon ride, zoe' started the fire, then the kids had the 2100 candy hunt by flashlight.up this morning, zoe' made bacon and eggs, hooked up and rolled for sharon springs, where the farm market and the beekman mercantile were on the list of "things to do". we made it and it was a blast.we slowly meandered back home via state routes 20 and 12, stopping for ice cream and food along the route.what a great and albeit short family outing in sophia - our sweet, sweet sovereign of the road!  one of stops this weekend was here in richfield springs, ny. it is at the petrified creature museum and the boys have always wanted to stop. i've got a nice vintage impko water decal for this place, so we stopped in today to earn the decal for the door of the airstream.   woah - i think we spotted the bounder buddy here at the diamond mines. could it be?  looked in the back seat this afternoon, around 4pm, and finn was falling asleep... a quick turn off the route 12 heading south and we landed in north brookfield at the king's mills general store. a really neat place.. like stepping back in time!  the rig parked out in front of the beekman 1802 mercantile.   at the tunclif creamery, richfield springs, ny... a great ice cream stop!  the boys hard at work sifting for treasure.   a short break munching of popsickles  great fun! great memories.

sweet hall of fame 2011





here's the sovereign of the road as it departs the old hyde estate in cooperstown, ny. it was part of a party friday night for the chairman's event at the baseball hall of fame induction weekend. that's the gate house in the backdrop.the sweet sovereign sitting above otsego "glimmerglass" lake in cooperstown, here on the old hyde estate.  the event was a "diner's, drive-ins' and dives" themed event. below is one of the props for the event... above was the main feature and according to the chairman - sensational!!upon pickup on saturday, jane presented me with an old grand dad trailer.  this is now one of my prized possessions... signed by the 2011 baseball hall of fame class - roberto alomar, bert blyleven, and pat gullick... priceless!!
