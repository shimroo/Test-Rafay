what our clients say about us

						my wife, tall son of 20 and myself have been very satisfied with the rental of a pacific horizon premium 4-berth motorhome from auckland down south to wellington, end of this month.

we had a tiny trouble with the onboard screen but your team fixed it out very fast.  finally, this was our first holiday driving and living in a campervan and we enjoyed very much to discover your beautiful country this way.

thanks for having provided us with tips and advice to make sure our travel would be the best experience.
