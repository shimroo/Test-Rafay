this is a collection of paintings with color and composition that reflects the spirit of the southwest. the beauty of the landscape and the heritage of it's people. a life time of travel and wonderful memories put on canvas ."my paintings are usually done on canvas in oil or acrylic. this is painted in a studio from sketches or photographs. pastels on paper are used when i am on-site and need to save the fast moving light and shadows. this also helps to capture the feel of the subject and it's surroundings. rain, wind, sun, cold or hot translates into color."Â
