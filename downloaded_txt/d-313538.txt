welcome to sunleaf nursery, llp












	hello to all of our long-time friends and customers,
	 
	how to even start this letter???
	 
	after a very successful, fulfilling, prosperous, learning, grateful, friend 
	making and yes, at times extremely trying nursery career, we (bob & carol) 
	have chosen to find out what the next adventure is that life has to offer 
	us. we are closing sunleaf nursery llp after this fall season. with over 85 
	years between the two of us in the nursery industry, we have decided that 
	now is the time to move on and to be able to enjoy all of the other 
	opportunities that are available. this has been a bittersweet decision for 
	us to make, but now we know that it is the right avenue to take.
	 
	iour committed, long-time co-workers, katie, mark, rollie, and rafael will be 
	with us to the end, so you know that you will still be taken care of for 
	your plant needs. we are eternally grateful to these people for their 
	dedication, trustworthiness, and devotion to help us take care of all the 
	loose ends that come with closing the nursery. without them, we would be 
	lost!
	 
	we 
thank 
	all of you for loyalty and support over the years and wish everyone 
	continued success with your businesses. the friendships that we have because 
	of this industry are true and everlasting, for this we are extremely lucky 
	and grateful.
	 
	please dont hesitate contacting us with questions for concerns.
	 
	who knowsmaybe well show up on your doorstep in a winnebago for a visit, 
	dogs & all?

	happy trails,
	bob lyons & carol lyons
