volunteers are welcome!!!
we love parent volunteers coming into the school to help.  please make sure that you have completed the volunteer orientation prior to your first volunteer time in the classroom.  check with the office staff to know how to become a volunteer! 





our school nurse is jill hansen. she has put together a  newsletter with information about when to keep a child home from school, and more.




we are pleased to announce a great new reading program at our school called “bikes for books.” st. george masonic lodge has generously donated 13 bikes to our school to encourage reading. 


  the counselor’s corner is the website for our school counselor. it includes resources for parents and permission forms for small groups.
