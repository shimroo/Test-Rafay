**a 
new concept in guide services**

sea level family fishing 
charters is a flats fishing guide service dedicated to teaching 
the family 
how to realize 
the joys of shallow water flats fishing. we specialize in teaching your
spouse and children the 
fundamentals of fishing. when the family learns how to fish as an outdoor unit 
the more likely they will enjoy the outdoors together and more often. years of 
experience has proven to us that those who always seem to have the best outdoor 
flats fishing adventure are those who have either never fished before or those with 
the least amount of fishing experience. all to often dads and moms are reluctant 
to take their children fishing because of their lack of knowledge or because 
they feel intimidated by the guide experience itself. consequently, the children 
are denied the opportunity to learn the art of flats fishing from an experienced 
professional teacher and guide. come aboard, enjoy the day, and let us 
teach your spouse and children how to catch fish. we prefer not only the 
avid 
fishers, but also "the family".

  whether 
a semi-pro or novice, you should 
know:

sea level family fishing 
charters and guide service consists of only four professional, u.s. coast guard 
licensed, insured, and u.s. coast guard safety approved captains. each captain 
is a member of the "action craft" boat company's professional guide team and has 
been officially selected by action craft via applications and interviews. our 
guide team has met the standards of the finest flats skiff manufacturer in the 
fishing industry, as advertised in "florida sportsman
magazine". we take pride 
in that kind of endorsement. we have fished with the best of the best. come on 
down and take us out for a try.




our 
purpose:

the purpose of limiting the 
number of captains to four is to enable better communications between the guides 
as to where the fishing has been hot and where it has tapered off. it is the 
goal of the "guide team" to help one another and their clients produce fish 
through cooperation and the sharing of information on a regular basis. in short, 
it is in the best interest of each guide to insure the others success. who 
benefits? obviously, everyone. especially the "paying customer". with larger 
guide services, that book literally dozens of captains, the elements of 
"cooperation" and "team work" are lost.                                                           
 
 where 
will you fish?

we saltwater backcountry flats fish the 
waters of southwest florida's lee island waterways. specifically, the
calooshatchee river, the flats and keys of pine island sound, 
blind pass, redfish pass, matlacha pass, 
captiva pass, famous boca grande pass, charlotte 
harbor, near gulf of mexico waters, and ding darling national wildlife sanctuary. 
southwest florida waters are by far some of the most under fished waters in the 
state. the diverse wild life and estuaries are something to see. the beauty of 
fishing around sanibel island, captiva island, 
cayo costa island, pine island 
and the countless smaller keys and island sanctuaries 
cannot be put into words...


it 
can only be experienced!

what 

will 

you 

catch?

good 
flats fishing is based on many, many 
factors. migration and feeding patterns, 
seasons, weather conditions, water clarity 
and temperature, tides, and daily fish 
behavior are just a few contributing elements that affect different fish 
species in different ways. however, catching fish is not difficult in our 
pristine waters due to the number of varied fish species and your guide's 
knowledge. in short, something is always biting. snook, 
redfish, spotted sea trout, local and boca grande 
tarpon, cobia, tripletail, snapper,
grouper, spanish mackerel, sheepshead,
permit, pompano, shark, flounder,
jack crevalle, black drum, and ladyfish 
are all accessible to fishermen on our flats and in our passes throughout 
the year.





hop aboard and go backcountry flats fishing, shelling 
or photographing the beautiful waters of pine island sound, sanibel 
and captiva island and the rest of the lee island coast of southwest florida. 
the flats fishing is as good as it gets and your 
flats fishing guides are the best 
in the business. the shelling ranks third best in the world 
and our diversified estuary wildlife abounds. bring your 
family or group. you don't have to be a pro to enjoy our waters. 
our guides will teach you, your spouse, friends or your children the art 
and joy of fishing. each of us have children of our own and have had the 
pleasure and fun of teaching them how to fish.
