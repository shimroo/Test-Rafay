“you can have diverse interests, and you can let yourself go in multiple directions. no one way is less valuable or less valid than any other. it just makes your understanding of that topic so much richer, and i think that makes me a better person and a better historian every day.”liz torres melendez – class of 2018assistant site manager at the charlotte hawkins brown museum
“thanks to the mccullough fellowship, i was able to partner with the food justice planning initiative to conduct research and analysis on communication around food work in western north carolina. i would love to go to graduate school for journalism and continue learning about community-partnered research and reporting.” addison wright – class of 2024mass communication / political science double major
“being at a small school, i’ve really valued having such a great relationship with my professors and so much one-on-one support. i really love and value that here.”gabbie moneymaker – class of 2023biology major
“after i graduate from unc asheville, i plan on going to graduate school to pursue mycological research. i’m really glad i got this opportunity to work on something that i’m passionate about!”ari puentes – class of 2024biology major, barry goldwater scholarship winner
“almost all of my professional development happened while i was at unc asheville. the academic environment the professors fostered was so welcoming that i had the time to not only do school, but also do some more extracurricular, professional building. all of the education there really was just top notch. i feel like i’m well prepared and really well connected moving forward.”evan fisher – class of 2023atmospheric science 
“i tell people this all the time, and i really mean this: one of the best decisions that i ever made was to go back to school and to do it at unc asheville.” shawn winebrenner – class of 2019bachelor of fine arts and teacher licensure alumnus, elementary visual arts teacher
“unc asheville, especially the political science department, will always have my heart. it’s a great program filled with great professors who want to see you succeed, and it’s been very valuable to me to have professors support my path through college.”jessie frank – class of 2023 political science major, student athlete, associate editor of dignity – undergraduate human rights journal
“i was at [another school] for my first year, and it was 33,000 people versus 3,300 here, and 300 people lecture classes versus 21 person classes here. i’ve made a lot of great relationships with professors.”jacob diehn – class of 2023economics major, environmental studies minor
“having small classes and being close with my professors, that was definitely one of the positives here. i talked to other people from big universities, and they just didn’t have the same experience.”veronika mojik – class of 2023biology and chemistry double major
“i knew coming out of high school i liked engineering, but i didn’t exactly know what industry i wanted to work in. this work gave me a glimpse of the future. it helped affirm for me that i want to apply engineering to something that benefits the world. using engineering to better the environment seems like a noble way to spend your life.”trevor goldston – class of 2025mechatronics engineering major
“when you have a humanities program, when you have ethics classes, every student in every discipline is being taught that big picture aspect they have in what they do and the effect it has on the world. when that is always front and center in the curriculum here and in the community’s engagement with the campus, that changes the dynamic.”karen brinson bell – class of 1996executive director of the nc state board of elections
“the biology department here is pretty amazing; it’s small enough to make it a close knit learning environment but we also have so many resources to get hands-on experience, which is a big deal for undergraduates in science.”michelle paredes – class of 2024biology major
“i really like the way the education program was mostly focusing on getting a math degree with the licensure part added on to it as opposed to education focus with math on the side. i wanted to have my math degree to fall back on. that was part of why i chose unc asheville. it’s also small, i do better within a smaller school, so it’s perfect.”mikayla wright – class of 2022math and teacher licensure alumna, buncombe county beginning teacher of the year 2024
“everyone in the department takes the time to get to know you and goes the extra mile in supporting you. i had professors go out of their way to help me with my grad school applications, from zoom calls over the summer to weekly office visits. i wouldn’t be going to the university of georgia to get my masters without the foundation i’ve built here at unc asheville!” emily jacquez – class of 2024
