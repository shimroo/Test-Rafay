aquazone's legacy of files and programs

aquazone the legacy

the original aquazone files are located at aquazone.me which is how this site came about.

back in the day it was aquazone and creatures 1, 2 and 3 along with docking station. somewhere between simulation and virtual life games.


games
 aquazone deluxe i & ii with guppies was an aquarium back back in 1999. it started the interest in simulation and virtual life games.
we also have spp files, from the game that was cancelled by google.
check out my favorite sites links about/with game software.
