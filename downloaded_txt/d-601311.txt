cultivating  followersof jesus at  the margins

as an order, we are a family of jesus followers whose lives are bound together by common rhythms, commitments, and values.we have the joy of living among some of the world's most disenfranchised people.motivated by the love and gratitude that comes from walking with god, we cultivate disciples of jesus and develop local leaders who are marked by merciful action, transformative contemplation, and prophetic justice.together, we seek to follow scripture's command "to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with our god."

jointhe journey

the apostle paul wrote to the ancient church in thessalonica: because we loved you so much, we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of god but our lives as well. (1 thess 2:8)as we enter into community with our neighbors and reflect on the bible together, relationships grow and we see god at work: in our neighborhoods, and ourselves.
