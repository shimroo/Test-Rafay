for those that have a calling and a heart for rehab, resna is the place that gives you roots. the networking is so important, and it goes so deep. you realize that it’s not all up in your head, that there are all of these people out there. resna has kept me in the field, has given me focus, and has been a steering force in my career as a rehabilitation engineer. ---casmir usiatynski, rehabilitation engineer and resna member
