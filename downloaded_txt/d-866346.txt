dear lesley, andy and staff,i have been a customer of yours since at least the year 2000. after my first encounter with you, i have refused to let anyone else work on my boat’s engine or mechanical problems. you have gone out of your way to find the necessary parts needed, have argued with manufacturers on my behalf (and won) and have, in general, been good friends. you have always found the time to answer my questions, search for information or parts for me and take care of my boat issues. you have treated me squarely, honestly, and professionally. you have gone out of your way to take care of my problems through phone calls and personal visits. i cannot speak highly enough of all of you to come anywhere near my appreciation for you and your excellent, knowledgeable, competent, professional – and friendly – staff. i cannot say enough good things about pee wee and preston who tirelessly fix my boat problems. there is no one else i will trust with my boat’s problems other than this entire crew. if anyone has mercury or mercruiser products, they can go nowhere better than to lesley and andy gurkin at dandy haven marina.  thank you all for the past 15 years of friendship and service.frank h., jr.
