academics
a catholic school of excellence
we believe that academic challenge and care go together and that the best measure of a curriculum is the quality of a school’s teachers. we have an outstanding, highly accomplished faculty who challenge students, inspire them to a life of learning, and prepare them to excel both here and also in high school, college, and beyond. we offer academic rigor with care and support for each child, understanding that every learner is unique and that relationship is at the heart of learning.
