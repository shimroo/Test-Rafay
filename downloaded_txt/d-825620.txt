our mission



we, god’s people, gathered with our bishop and the diocese of shreveport, embody the universal mission of the catholic church. in developing a christian life we are called to praise god, to proclaim and teach jesus christ, his life, his work, his word and in the power of the holy spirit, we are called to serve as a sign and instrument of christ’s liberating and healing presence in the world. as church, we in the 16 civil parishes of north louisiana challenge and support persons in their efforts to live as christians, to understand sacred scripture and tradition, to share with the poor, and to participate in a faith community.
