posted on june 20, 2024july 4, 2024 by admin — leave a commenthorse races and traditional sports events: what’s more popular? 

horse racing and traditional sports events, while both fabulous in their own rights, offer very different experiences to their spectators. sure, there are a lot of common factors in both fields, like the well-organised fan clubs who watch the performances together, or the vast world of betting where traditional sports fans use the betwinner bonus code to bet while horse race enthusiasts use other types of promos and bonuses, but there are still key differences that allow these events to hold a unique place in the hearts of fans worldwide. let’s delve into the history, spectator experience, betting culture, and cultural impacts of horse races and traditional sports events.
history and tradition
horse races
horse racing is one of the oldest sports, with origins tracing back to ancient civilisations such as greece, rome, and egypt. the sport evolved significantly over the centuries, becoming a formalised event in britain during the 17th and 18th centuries. the royal ascot, established in 1711, and the epsom derby, first run in 1780, are iconic races that epitomise the rich tradition and prestige of the sport.
traditional sports events
traditional sports like football, cricket, and rugby also boast deep historical roots. football, with origins in medieval england, formalised in the mid-19th century with the establishment of the football association in 1863. cricket, similarly, dates back to the 16th century and became a structured sport with the formation of the marylebone cricket club in 1787. rugby’s history is traced to 1823, credited to william webb ellis’s legendary action of picking up the ball during a football game.
spectator experience
horse races
attending a horse race is a social and often glamorous affair. iconic events like the kentucky derby and the royal ascot attract not only sports enthusiasts but also celebrities and fashionistas. the experience is characterised by vibrant hats, elegant attire, and a festive atmosphere. the sight of powerful horses thundering down the track is thrilling, and the races, although short, are packed with suspense and excitement.
traditional sports events
traditional sports events, on the other hand, offer a different kind of camaraderie and excitement. the communal experience of cheering for a favourite team, the electrifying atmosphere of a packed stadium, and the display of athletic prowess provide a continuous thrill throughout the event. from the meticulous strategies in cricket to the high-paced action in football, the engagement lasts for hours, fostering a deep connection with the game.
betting and gambling
horse races
betting is an integral part of horse racing culture. the anticipation of placing a wager adds an extra layer of fun for many spectators. the tradition of betting at the tracks is longstanding, with enthusiasts enjoying the challenge of predicting the outcomes based on various factors such as the horse’s form, jockey’s skill, and track conditions.
traditional sports events
while betting is also prevalent in traditional sports, it is often less central to the experience compared to horse racing. fans may place wagers on match outcomes, scores, or individual performances, but the primary focus remains on the sport itself and the performance of the athletes. betting in traditional sports is more about enhancing the enjoyment of the game rather than being a central feature.
athletes vs. horses
traditional sports athletes
athletes in traditional sports are celebrated for their physical prowess, strategic thinking, and endurance. their training regimes are rigorous, focusing on skills specific to their sport, physical conditioning, and mental preparation. athletes are often public figures, admired and followed for their achievements, personalities, and dedication.
racing horses
in horse racing, the ‘athlete’ is the horse, trained meticulously by skilled trainers to reach peak performance. the relationship between the horse and jockey is crucial, with communication and trust playing vital roles in their success. horses are celebrated for their speed, stamina, and lineage, with famous racehorses often becoming legends in their own right, much like human sports stars.
cultural impact
horse races
horse racing has a significant cultural impact, particularly in regions with a rich equestrian history. events like the melbourne cup and grand national are national spectacles, drawing immense media attention and public interest. the cultural significance is also evident in fashion, social gatherings, and traditions surrounding these events.
traditional sports events
traditional sports have a profound and widespread cultural impact, often acting as unifying forces within communities and nations. football world cups, the olympics, and cricket matches can bring entire countries together in shared celebration or collective sorrow. sports heroes become cultural icons, influencing societal values and inspiring generations.
conclusion
horse racing and traditional sports events each offer unique experiences and hold distinctive places in the world of sports. while horse racing is steeped in tradition and glamour, with a central focus on the thrill of the race and betting, traditional sports provide a continuous and immersive experience of athletic excellence and strategic gameplay. both, however, share the common thread of passion, excitement, and a deep cultural impact, enriching the lives of their spectators and participants alike.

posted on december 15, 2023june 20, 2024 by admin — leave a commentwhy we must cherish our equine friends 

as a lifelong horse lover, i’ve always been captivated by these magnificent creatures. horses are not just animals; they are loyal companions, symbols of strength and grace, and essential partners in many aspects of human life. in this article, i’ll share why it’s so important to care for horses and why we must ensure they never face extinction.
the bond between humans and horses
a history of partnership
horses have been our partners for thousands of years. from carrying us across vast landscapes to helping in agricultural fields, their contributions have been invaluable. they have been our companions in war, work, and play, forming a bond that has shaped human history.
companionship and therapy
today, horses continue to enrich our lives. many people find a unique sense of companionship and joy in their relationships with horses. equine therapy has proven to be incredibly effective for individuals with physical, emotional, and psychological challenges. the gentle nature and sensitivity of horses make them excellent therapists, capable of forging deep connections with those in need.
the importance of proper care
physical well-being
caring for horses involves ensuring their physical health. this includes providing a balanced diet, regular veterinary check-ups, and ample exercise. proper care helps prevent diseases and injuries, ensuring that horses can live long, healthy lives.
mental and emotional health
horses are intelligent and sensitive animals that require mental stimulation and social interaction. providing a stable environment, regular training, and companionship from other horses or humans are essential for their mental well-being. a happy, well-cared-for horse is more likely to form a strong, trusting bond with its human caregivers.
the threat of extinction
loss of habitat
as urbanisation and industrialisation continue to expand, natural habitats for horses are diminishing. wild horse populations are particularly vulnerable, facing threats from habitat loss and human encroachment. protecting these habitats is crucial for the survival of wild horses and maintaining biodiversity.
genetic diversity
preserving different horse breeds is important for maintaining genetic diversity. each breed has unique characteristics and qualities that can contribute to the overall health and resilience of the equine population. conservation efforts and responsible breeding practices are essential to prevent the loss of these unique genetic traits.
the cultural and economic impact
cultural significance
horses hold a special place in many cultures around the world. they are celebrated in art, literature, and folklore, symbolising freedom, strength, and beauty. ensuring the survival of horses helps preserve this rich cultural heritage and the stories that have been passed down through generations.
economic contributions
the equine industry contributes significantly to the global economy. from horse racing and riding schools to therapeutic riding centres and breeding farms, the economic impact of horses is substantial. by caring for and protecting horses, we support an industry that provides livelihoods for millions of people.
what you can do
support equine charities
many organisations are dedicated to the welfare and conservation of horses. supporting these charities through donations or volunteering can make a significant difference in the lives of horses in need.
advocate for horse welfare
raise awareness about the importance of horse welfare in your community. advocate for laws and policies that protect horses from neglect and abuse! educate others about the proper care and respect that these noble creatures deserve.
adopt or sponsor a horse
if you have the means, consider adopting a horse in need or sponsoring one through a reputable rescue organisation. providing a loving home or financial support can help ensure that horses receive the care and attention they need.
conclusion
horses have been our faithful companions and partners throughout history. their contributions to our lives, both practically and emotionally, are immeasurable. by taking proper care of horses and working to prevent their extinction, we honour their legacy and ensure that future generations can also experience the joy and wonder that these incredible animals bring to our world. let’s cherish our equine friends and commit to protecting them for years to come.

posted on april 15, 2023july 12, 2022 by johannes — leave a commentnative african horse breeds! 


the african horse breeds are a group of horse breeds that originate from africa. they were originally developed in the african continent and are not descendants of european horses.
there are many african horse breeds and they come from different parts of africa, such as the north african arab, the arabian, the barb and the somali horse.
desert horse (arabian horse)
the arabian horse is a breed of horse known for its stamina and courage. the breed originated in arabia, which is why they are also known as arabians or desert horses.
the arabian has a muscular build, and they are known to be very fast runners. they can outrun some modern cars! in fact, the fastest horse ever recorded was an arabian called man o war who could run at speeds up to 60 miles per hour!

arabians are also known for their intelligence and loyalty and these qualities make them great riding horses because riders feel comfortable around them. because of this intelligence and friendliness, many people keep arabians as pets instead of using them as workhorses like other breeds might be used for such tasks such as pulling plows or carrying heavy loads on carts across rough terrain (although there are some exceptions). on top of all that talent we’ve already covered here today about how amazing these animals really are… did you know that some people even ride these beauties into battle? yes indeed—the mighty steeds ridden by ancient warriors such as alexander the great himself were actually arabian horses!
cape horse
a cape horse is a south african breed of horse that originated in that country, but today it is also found in other places. the breed is a heavy horse that was used as a carriage horse until the advent of motor vehicles. today, these horses are still used for riding and driving, but they are also valued for their speed and agility.
bambara pony (mali)
the bambara pony is a horse breed originating in mali, west africa. there are two subtypes of the bambara: the short-legged variety and the taller variety. the ponies are commonly used for riding, driving and packing. they have also been bred for use as draught horses on small farms or in towns and villages where there are not enough people to do all of this work themselves.

they were named after an ethnic group who live within their native region. it is believed that these groups have been caring for them since ancient times; however, documentation does not exist before the 19th century so it’s impossible to confirm if this is true or not! even if it isn’t though…the breed has surely been around before then anyway!
bambaras were brought over into europe by french colonists during their 19th century conquest of mali (then known as french sudan), so many people here don’t even know much about them at all except maybe what they’ve seen in movies like black stallion returns.
swazi horse (swaziland, south africa)
the swazi horse is a small, sturdy breed that is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region. these horses are known for their endurance and ability to carry heavy loads. the swazi horse is often used for riding and pack animals.

posted on march 23, 2023july 12, 2022 by johannes — leave a commentbasic horse care: here’s how to properly take care of your horse 


your horse is an animal that requires proper care: they require vaccinations, have to be groomed regularly, and have specific feeding needs. often, caring for your horse can seem really complex, but if you keep learning and stay informed on all of the things you need to do for your horse, you can get your horse stable and healthy. keep on reading to learn more about basic horse care!
feeding

there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to how many times you should feed your horse. it all depends on the type of horse, their age, and their activity level. for example, some horses may need to be fed twice a day while others only need to be fed once per day. if you have more than one horse in your stable, it’s best to divide up the food so that each gets an equal amount.
when it comes to food, there are several different types available for sale at most pet stores and online retailers. some owners choose to feed their horses packaged pellets while others opt for hay or other types of roughage that can be purchased from local farms or from online stores.
grooming
brushing your horse’s coat every day will help distribute natural oils throughout the hair and keep him well-groomed and looking sharp. it will also help keep dirt from accumulating on his coat and keep him clean while he’s outside in the elements. you should brush him at least once per day, but if he has been sweating or rolling around in the dirt, you should brush him more than once per day until he is clean again.
brushing your horse’s teeth helps prevent tartar buildup and bad breath (and if you have ever had a toothache, you know how important it is to take care of your own dental hygiene). your vet can tell you what kind of toothpaste to use for brushing your horse’s teeth—just make sure it doesn’t contain any alcohol!
hooves

this part also falls into grooming, however, i wanted to dedicate more attention to it. hoof care is one of the most important aspects of horse ownership. it’s also something that can be a little bit scary for new owners. but there are some basic guidelines you can follow to make sure your horse always has clean, healthy hooves.
first and foremost, you should always have at least one pair of good quality clippers on hand—and make sure they’re sharp! dull clippers can cause more damage than good here, so make sure you check them regularly and replace them if necessary.
next, you’ll want to get yourself a hoof pick or other hoof cleaning tool, depending on what kind of surface your horse has. some horses’ feet are smoother than others, so if yours falls into this category, a simple hoof pick will do the trick. if your horse has a rough surface or is prone to getting mud stuck in his or her feet, however, you may need something more aggressive such as a wire brush or even a brush with metal bristles.
you’ll also need some kind of disinfectant—preferably one that doesn’t irritate their skin but still kills germs effectively—to wash away any dirt.

posted on march 5, 2023july 12, 2022 by johannes — leave a commentwhat breeds of horses are participating in horse races? 


with the popularity of horseracing on the rise, it’s important to know what horses are racing. while harness horses and thoroughbreds are still the most popular, other breeds are gaining in popularity. if you’re a fan of horse racing, you may have heard the names thoroughbreds, standardbreds and quarter horses. these breeds of horses are the most famous types in racing today.
thoroughbreds
the thoroughbred is a long, slender horse breed with a high-strung temperament. originating in england around 17th century, the breed has been used primarily for racing and is known for their speed. they require lots of exercise and are high-maintenance animals that can be very expensive to keep because of their breeding needs. they are also extremely intelligent and fast animals that make ideal partners for racing.
thoroughbreds are generally considered to be the fastest breed of race horse on earth. their speed is due to their slender body type and long legs – both excellent for running long distances quickly! 
they’re also known for being intelligent and possessing a certain amount of athleticism and gracefulness when they run; this makes them fun to watch!

standardbreds
standardbreds are known for their high speed and endurance, which makes them ideal for long-distance races. they are often called draft horses because they were originally bred as workhorses that pulled carts or wagons called drags. while today’s standardbreds do not pull drags anymore, they still possess many traits from their ancestors such as being large with thick limbs which help them pull heavy loads easily when walking forward at slow speeds but also keep these same animals moving faster than other breeds when required by hitting them on their rumps with whips while running around tracks instead!
quarter horses
quarter horses are known for their speed. what makes them special is that they are bred to be fast, and have a lot of endurance. the quarter horse breed is also the most popular breed of horse in america, and they make up over half of all horses participating in horse racing.
quarter horses are known as sprinters due to their high energy level which enables them  to run fast bursts over short distances without tiring quickly—a trait which made them perfect runners during races where each competitor ran only once per heat before passing off his spot behind another rider who had been waiting behind him during those first few seconds spent lined up just outside his starting gate

appaloosas
the appaloosa is a breed of horse with a spotted coat. it is known for its endurance and speed, making it a popular choice as a ranch horse. appaloosas are also intelligent, with good temperaments. in fact, their intelligence makes them easy to train. even children can ride an appaloosa without much difficulty.
paints
paints are a breed of horse that originated in the united states. they are often used for racing, but they are also used for riding and showing. their characteristic coat patterns make them especially popular among horse lovers of all ages.

posted on february 16, 2023july 12, 2022 by johannes — leave a commentbest groundwork exercises for your horse 


groundwork is when you work with your horse on the ground, teaching him to become more submissive and responsive to your cues. groundwork can help you develop a better relationship with your horse and can assist in building a solid foundation of training. 
the hand walk
the hand walk is a good warm-up exercise for your horse and can be used to build up muscles. it’s also a great way to improve your relationship with the animal. the purpose of this exercise is to get the horse walking forward when you call on it, either with or without a bridle, depending on how far along in training you are. it’s important that you know how much your horse can actually do when doing this exercise, so make sure to pay attention and learn how much effort they’re putting into it. you should also remember that some horses may need more time than others before they’re ready for this particular exercise!
the hindlimb lift

the hindlimb lift is a great move to teach your horse and reinforce the training from the other exercises. 
to begin, have your horse stand in a corner or close to a fence with his front feet turned out 90 degrees and his hindquarters facing you. start by holding onto one of his reins and reaching through his neck as if you were going to grab him by it. then pull him away from the wall or fence while keeping hold on that wriggling head! once they’ve gotten used to this movement, try switching between pulling directly down on both reins at once (to make sure they’re balanced) or just one hand at a time (for variety). lastly and most importantly, make sure that each session ends with praise!
the pick-up and turn-around
the pick-up and turn-around is a fun exercise, which helps to improve your horse’s balance and flexibility. it also helps to improve his attitude towards new things. 
the pick-up and turn around starts with you turning around in the saddle as you move away from a fence or wall. as soon as you’ve done this, ask him to pick up one foot when it touches down on the ground so that he stands on three legs instead of four during this phase of the exercise (the fourth leg should be lifted). tell him ‘pick up’ before doing anything else so that he knows what’s expected of him!
backing up

backing up is a great exercise for teaching a horse to be calm and relaxed. it will also help your horse be obedient and confident, as well as brave. the best way to start this exercise is by using a lead rope or halter strap so you can guide your horse from behind. start with your horse standing still, then walk beside him until he becomes accustomed to moving backward without any pressure from you. when he’s comfortable walking backward, start leading him along gently while saying “back up” as you do so, don’t pull on the lead until he starts walking away from where you’re standing!

horse chat
if you’re looking for an easier way to connect with other horse owners, this is one of the best equestrian apps available today. horse chat allows users to connect with people all over the world who have similar interests in horses through live chat rooms.
what3words
if you’re not familiar with what3words, it’s a system that divides the world into a lot of (well, actually 50+ trillion!) 3m x 3m squares.
this means that wherever you are in the world—whether you’re at home or on vacation—you’ll never have to worry about getting lost again.
and it works for horses too! if you want to take your horse on a ride through the woods, find them a field where they can graze freely without ever having to worry about getting lost or running into other horses (or people), you can do that with the help of this amazing app.

posted on january 20, 2023july 12, 2022 by johannes — leave a commentsome tricks you can teach your horse 


whether you have a miniature horse, a clydesdale-style horse, or something in between, there are many tricks you can teach your horse. these tricks range from simple to complex and each trick has sweeping benefits for both your horse’s mental and physical state. here are some of the most fun tricks.
counting (with your foot) and reaction acumen 
counting with your foot is a great way to teach your horse how to count, and it’s also a good way to teach your horse how to react to commands or words.you can do this by stomping  a number of times with your foot and have your horse respond to that number.
to begin this trick, you’ll need some treats that are easy for the horse to eat like carrots or apples. 
start by showing the horse one treat and saying “1.” then show another treat and say “2.” keep repeating this until you get up to 10, then start over again at 1 again.
back up trick

backing up is a good trick to teach your horse, and it’s fun too. to back your horse without a lead rope, start by walking forward with him on the right side of you. next, when he reaches the end of the lead rope, pull it upward while turning to face him. you may need to walk backwards in order for him to realize what you want from him. if so, keep walking until his nose meets yours and then stop walking backwards so that he can look at you and figure out what comes next in this game!
bow trick
if you want to teach your horse to bow, first make sure that it’s an appropriate behavior for the situation. for example, if you’re at a show and someone is going to groom your horse, it is generally okay to ask your horse to bow so they can reach those hard-to-reach places on the back. however, if there are no people around who need access to its backside don’t ask your horse to bow just because. horses should only be asked or encouraged to do things when they’re useful or fun!
play dead

if you want to teach your horse this trick, make sure that you are not too close to their head and also make sure that you are not standing in a position where you could fall over. 
often times the horse will think of playing dead as just laying down on the ground without any other purpose. this can be confusing for your horse if it doesn’t understand what you want from them so make sure they know how important it is for them to play dead when asked.

posted on january 3, 2023july 12, 2022 by johannes — leave a commentwhat to know about triple crown horse races  


the triple crown of thoroughbred racing is one of the biggest events in the world of horse racing. the three races that it includes, the kentucky derby, preakness stakes, and belmont stakes, are all on their own fun and exciting. but together, they capture the attention of people who wouldn’t even consider themselves fans of horse racing in any other context.
there’s a reason for that: the triple crown can be hard to win from a logistical perspective, and horses really have to earn it. if you’ve ever wondered what goes into winning this legendary event or why it has such an outsized reputation as an accomplishment, check out these great facts about it.
triple crown – a high title
it’s been around since 1875 when it was first awarded as a prize for any horse who won those races in the same year. as the original name of the title was too long, in 1890 it was renamed as “triple crown” during a newspaper dispute between two papers over which one had rights to publish news about racing. 

the associated press (ap) claimed that it owned all rights to stories about racing and would not allow others to publish them unless they paid ap money for doing so. however, some newspapers refused to pay this fee because they felt they had their own sources within racing circles who could provide them with information without having to rely on ap journalists who were writing largely biased or inaccurate articles at times due to their lack of knowledge about certain aspects related specifically towards horse racing itself.
here’s what it takes to win the triple crown
you have to win the kentucky derby, belmont stakes and preakness stakes in the same year. the first two races are held within a week of each other, and the third race is a month after them.
horses must qualify for the triple crown races
to qualify for these prestigious horse races, horses must complete a long qualification process that includes being nominated by their owners and trainers.
as you can imagine, this is a very difficult task for racehorses to achieve. 

the first step in qualifying is for an owner to nominate his/her horse by sending in paperwork with signatures from both the trainer and jockey (if applicable). then it’s up to the racing committee at churchill downs in louisville, kentucky to decide which horses will be allowed into each triple crown race based off of their records at previous competitions.
once you’ve made it through those steps, comes perhaps the most difficult part: actually competing in these events! these races require several hours of running at high speeds while maintaining stamina throughout their entire journey—so it really pays off if your horse has proven himself capable before even entering one event!
winning the triple crown is pretty hard!
only 13 horses have ever accomplished winning the triple crown. the first winner of all three triple crown races was sir barton in 1919 and the last horse to win it was justify in 2018. so it’s definitely true that winning this triple crown is not easy.
even if you don’t know anything else about horse racing (or sports in general),i hope that this article was interesting enough so that maybe next time there’s a big race on tv you give it a watch!

posted on december 22, 2022july 12, 2022 by johannes — leave a commenthow and when did humans domesticate horses?  


there are many theories today on how the process of domestication for horses happened. even though horses, well, actually, the drawing of them appeared in 30,000 bce, we share an opinion that they were wild – definitely not domesticated.
horses have been a source of power, transportation, and companionship for humans for thousands of years. but it wasn’t until relatively recently that humans began to domesticate horses. most historians agree that the first horse was domesticated in the middle east around 4000 bc. however, there is a lot of debate about when and where the first horse was tamed.
so when did it happen for the first time?
horses were first domesticated around 4,000 years ago. they were tamed by humans and used for riding, pulling carts and ploughing fields. domesticating horses was a long process that took many generations. 
the earliest evidence…
the earliest evidence of horse domestication comes from kazakhstan where horse milk bones and teeth were found in an archaeological dig.

this is what led scientists to believe that botai people were the first to domesticate horses because they would have been the only ones who would have had access to horse milk at that time.
the botai were able to domesticate horses because they had access to large pastures with plenty of water and other resources that horses need. horses also needed humans to take care of them because they are prey animals who have evolved to avoid predators by running away from them. humans provided food and protection for their herds so that they would not have to run away all the time.
or is it?
however, genetic evidence suggests that botai horses are not the ancestors of modern domestic horses. apparently, the use of horses spread across the eurasian continent for transportation, agriculture and warfare. scientists linked the success of domestic horse breeding to the observed genetic changes. they speculate that a stronger back (gsdmc gene) and greater obedience (zfpm1 gene) may have made the horse more suitable for riding.
how did we manage to domesticate them?

scientists found that one method of domesticating a horse might have been by keeping individual foals as pets, while adult horses are slaughtered for meat, since the foals are relatively small and easy to handle. it is known that horses behave as herd animals and need companionship to thrive. it’s been proven by historic evidence that foals can and will bond to humans and other domestic animals in order to meet their social needs. so it just might have been possible that domestication started with young horses being kept pets over time.
