welcome to your genealogy gateway
for years genealogy gateway acted as a conduit to genealogy information 
  online. as the years passed, however, the backend of the site became 
  restrictive to further development, making the old genealogy gateway obsolete. 
  today, i've created a new web 2.0 design and interface, with a clear mandate 
  to once again become your gateway to genealogy online!
tired of the same old sites, with the same old links and information? 
  gengateway will be built with the following goals in mind:
1) daily updates.
  genealogy can become stale to most online researchers... i'm dedicated to 
  providing daily updates on the newest genealogy sites and data online. 
  to quickly access this data, just visit this page daily and look at the "new 
  genealogy" below... 
2) genealogy help
most researchers just want data... and a lot of it. but what do you do 
  with that data once you find it? how can that data help you in your research? 
  it's not just about collecting names, it about recording your heritage! and 
  putting all the pieces together in the right place requires a skill set... 
  visit this area when you hit a brick wall in your research!3) uniqueness
  what can i do to set myself a part from the other genealogy portals available 
  online. how can i present the genealogy data online in a user friendly and 
  interesting manner? those two questions will be the backbone of how this site 
  is setup and presented to you. please enjoy, and come back frequently!
