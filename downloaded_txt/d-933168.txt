amid recent financial industry news, we want to assure you that we are a well-capitalized mutual savings bank with its only priority to serve our customers. eastern connecticut savings bank has been  dedicated to serving the local community since 1915, and we continue to do so  today.
at ecsb, our business model differs from those  making headlines, as we do not specialize in services such as cryptocurrency or  venture capital. we are not beholden to stock investors. we reinvest locally by  providing a mortgage to your neighbor or a loan to the small business just  around the corner. 
we want to remind you during this time that we  are fdic insured and that no one has ever lost a dime of fdic-insured deposits.  we are here to support you and answer any questions you may have regarding fdic  coverage, and urge you to visit https://www.fdic.gov/ for more information. thank you for choosing  eastern connecticut savings bank.
