a centaur is rising
ancient man, walking on his own two legs, first saw a human on horseback
        and regarded the two as one being.  ancient man called the being a “centaur”.
even now, in the 21st century, we can use the power of this “one-being” connection
        to –

prevent the abuse, neglect and misunderstanding of horses.
give youth the structure, confidence and community to rise above
          whatever might tempt or trouble them.
develop awareness, compassion and patience to assist humanity as
          a whole.

centaur rising offers youth
        programs, horse riding lessons, horse
        camp and adult equestrian education        in the rocky mountain foothills above denver, colorado.
give the gift of horses!
