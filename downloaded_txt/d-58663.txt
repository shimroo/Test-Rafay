teak is an ideal material for outdoor furniture. exceptionally strong and durable, teak can last for generations in a wide variety of climates with zero maintenance. this is due to the high rubber and oil content of teak wood that leave it impervious to rain, weather, and pests, making it virtually immune to rot. teak will last for generations without extra finishes or treatments. teak furniture begins with a warm, golden color, eventually fading to a silvery gray patina as it is left outdoors over time. no matter how old, teak can be cleaned to bring back its golden color. from its durability to longevity, read more about the many benefits of selecting teak wood for your outdoor furniture.
