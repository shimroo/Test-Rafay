in september of 1965
                        a record was released on the dynavoice label
                        that was to become an international, all-time
                        classic. "a lovers concerto" by "the toys"
                        entered the charts and in just six short weeks
                        surpassed luminaries the likes of "the beatles,
                        the supremes, elvis presley, the rolling stones,
                        the four tops, stevie wonder" etc.. the song
                        reached  number one , becoming
                        a million seller. the voice singing lead, was
                        that of
                         .


as a piece of trivia, she also sang one
                        of the background parts in the harmony. the
                        success of "the toys" carried barbara to
                        countries all over the world. england, holland,
                        germany, japan, australia just to name a few.
                        after recording several other singles and an
                        album entitled the toys sing














                            "a lover's concerto" and "attack",
                        which has just been re-released on cd, on the
                        sundazed label), barbara left the group, had a
                        family and raised a total of seven children.
                        while raising her family she never stopped
                        singing. married to a musician, ken wiltshire,
                        they continually played in small local groups
                        whose styles ranged from jazz, to blues and
                        r&b. 





 








in 1986 the original "toys" reformed
                    and for two years did concerts, night clubs, and
                    oldie shows. although they no longer work together,
                    they have maintained their friendship over the
                    years. afterwards barbara continued to sing with her
                    local band, "rhythm&babs". she regularly
                    performs the meadowlands singing in mr. richard
                    nader's shows, and westbury music fair in mr. dick
                    fox's shows with mr. joe rivers as johnny of "johnny
                    and joe" a fifties duet. she did background work at
                    several local studios, and lead work for some up and
                    coming song writers. 
  



                      barbara never liked to be tied to one style of
                      music, which is what made her local band so much
                      fun. each night she performed 20 to 30 songs and
                      did gospel, blues, r&b, rock, and pop. 








 





 that was
                        barbara then.




this is "barbara














                            now"





 





hi!














                            i'm barbara, and i just want to tell you
                            that this is truly the high point of my
                            musical life thus far and a true labor of
                            love. i co-produced and arranged the
                            entire project . i also wrote all but two of
                            the songs, and i'm just thrilled. 


                            my journey has taken me through gospel,
                            blues, r&b, rock&roll, pop and
                            jazz.  the sum of all this is the
                            barbara i am now. i hope you can hear all
                            the musical influences of my life in my
                            music.



  






 












barbara has
                            just completed, what she considers to be the
                            pinnacle of her musical life's journey thus
                            far.
                            she has just released her first solo cd
                            entitled 
                              barbara now

when an artist
                          with legendary status like barbara
                          harris 
                          totally removes herself from the sound that
                          brought her worldwide fame,and creates a work
                          so perfect in mood, joy, and magic, it gives
                          jaded critics an opportunity to run to the
                          typewriter and write volumes about the value
                          of artists who aren't afraid to take risks.
