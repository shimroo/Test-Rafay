iâd like to welcome you to our award-winning website. as exalted ruler for 2023-2024 i have planned numerous great activities. this is all part of my motto for the year is âlift up your voices for elkdomâ how do you get new members? ask them? the activities we have planned for the year will help spread the word of elkdom further out in the community. 
â  
our charities are very dear to us as elks. we reach out to veterans, youthsâ groups, and kids with disabilities. fire and police departments and many other local community groups. you too can be a part of this great movement we call elkdom!

â  
while you are at our website, check our calendar page for upcoming events such as in august 12th was is our western night with an amazing dinner prepared by our very own sherri chefâs. we have raffles, auctions, dancing to the music of the very popular ârun away trainâ all proceeds of the night will go to o the scholarship fund. august 19th is the purple pig dinner, all donations piggy banks, checks cash everything is accepted, recurring donors are encouraged. all proceeds will go to the major projects to help our theme child to walk, talk, run & play. 
â  
in september i am hosting a members appreciation dinner with guest speakers. we have karaoke, dances, luau, lamb bbq, the holidays are filled with events for the children in the community. stop by for a visit and meet our great members and officers and enjoy our facilities. there is always someone here to sign you into the lodge guest book.
we as elks promote and believe in brotherly love, justice, charity & fadelity. these are the cornerstones of our benevolence. after all we are the benevolent and protective order of elks. it is a great honor to be this yearâs exalted ruler of the finest lodges in the inland district.
we are growing in strength in each new member joining our family of caring and giving people. i look forward to seeing you this fraternal year.

                fraternally yours,
marcy simily
                  exalted ruler 
public relations  our public relations chairman this year is bob monaco. officers and committee chairpersons who have things that need to be advertised and promoted need to submit them to bob. his email address is bmonacoelks@gmail.com if you want to promote an event, function, or fundraiser, please forward the information to bob so he can insure we get this information into the newspaper, on tv, on social media and into our website. if you have a flier or pictures, include them as they can be very useful in promoting who we are and what we do. promoting elkdom is a necessity. this is how the public knows who we are along with the work we do. it is also another way in which we can increase our membership. increasing our membership numbers is vital to the success of our lodge.
