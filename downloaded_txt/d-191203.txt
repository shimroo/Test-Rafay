the st.  lawrence river - 
your journey begins 



the st. lawrence river has its source from the largest collection of fresh water lakes on the globe, and among all of the big rivers of the world, it is the only one whose volume is not greatly affected by the elements. this river, which sir j.m. lemoine called "the noblest, the purest, most enchanting river on all god's beautiful earth," for miles upon miles acts as a natural boundary between the good friends of canada and the united states. 








 












relax and enjoy the st. lawrence seaway
