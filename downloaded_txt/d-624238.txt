news



dear orchid friends,
for australian dendrobium fans, we  are beginning to see spikes, including on the speciosums.
for travelers, long weekenders,  and day-trippers, we will be open 2 extra sundays and mondays over the martin  luther king and presidents’ day holidays.   
martin luther king day:
                friday january 17th, 2025:  open 10am-2pm  
                saturday january 18th, 2025:  open 9am-3:30pm 
                sunday january 19th, 2025:  open 10am-2pm  
                monday january 20th, 2025:  open 10am-2pm:  martin luther king day
presidents’ day:
                friday february 14th, 2025:  open 10am-2pm:  valentine’s day
                saturday february 15th, 2025:  open 9am-3:30pm 
                sunday february 16th, 2025:  open 10am-2pm  
                monday february 17th, 2025:  open 10am-2pm:  presidents’ day
new list: cattleya bicolor  divisions/seedlings:  a beautiful  selection of tepal colors, lip colors (pink, albescent, alba), and bulb heights  of this brazilian bifoliate.  the  long-lasting flowers, contrasting colors between tepals & lip, and tall,  thin, stately pseudobulbs make this a favorite at sboe.  beginners are drawn to the radical difference  from the familiar lavender unifoliates.   collectors appreciate the wide variety of color types.  plants are temperature tolerant (can  withstand 34f for 2 hours), but require protection from winter rains.  twelve plants offered in total.  prices range from $65-$165.  list made 11/12/24.

note 
                on pictures:
although we try to represent the 
                        flower color as accurately as possible, due the inconsistant nature 
                        of computer monitors, and the various difficulties of digital photography, 
                        the colors represented on our website are not always exact. please 
                        consider these pictures approximations, and give us a call if you 
            would like a verbal description of the flower.
