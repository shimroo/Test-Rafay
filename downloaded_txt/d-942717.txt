5 fun children’s activities for christmas 
december 7, 2022december 7, 2022 by nicholas flores, posted in children’s activities  

1. make your own christmas eve box
why wait until christmas morning to get unwrapping, when you can start the night before! christmas eve boxes are becoming increasingly popular, and with good reason.
inside this very festive box is everything you need to enjoy a cozy, fun, and festive evening before santa makes his way down the chimney. you can fill them with whatever you love! pajamas to snuggle in, that classic christmas movie on dvd, some delicious cookies, hot chocolate, and marshmallows, perhaps even a game to play or something to put out for santa too!
kid-friendly things to do in st paul can help decorate the boxes, and everyone in the family can write a wish list of what goes into it!
great christmas fun!

2. go caroling
caroling is a lost art, but one that brings festive cheer to the neighborhood. why not use it as an opportunity to teach kids about giving? it’s christmas after all!
pick a local charity in the area that is special to your family or what your kids are passionate about, and use this fun activity as a way to raise much needed donations for them.
allow each child to pick their favorite carols, invite some of their friends to join in, and make your way as a family around some nearby houses, allowing kids to really show off those vocal chords!
it’s not only a fun way to spend time together, but gives the children a completely selfless activity that will bring them even more joy knowing they are doing it for those less fortunate.
3.start a new tradition
why not get together as a family before christmas, and come up with a new tradition that is unique to you as a family. it’s a memory that kids will take through to adulthood, and even to their children!
it might be you decorate the tree together to a certain song, or you bake gingerbread people on christmas eve and each take turns in decorating. perhaps you might write your own christmas song together each year, or make up your own game to play!
there are so many ways you can make christmas your own, and it doesn’t have to be complicated, but the joys of having a family tradition will become one of the most treasured memories for children as they get older.
4. make your own christmas cards
crafts is always a great way to include kids in the christmas preparations. buy some blank cards, and a stack of crafting goodies such as glue, glitter, stickers, paper, crayons and felt.
work out your christmas card list ahead of time, and tell the children they need to make a set number of cards. then, put on some carols, lay down a tray of cookies, and let those creative juices flow!
it also is a great way to keep the children occupied when you need to prepare the house or kitchen! kids will also delight in seeing their incredible work shared with friends and family who are closest to them. they can even include their school teachers and friends in the list!
5. take homemade gifts to school
celebrating christmas at school is always fun growing up. whether it’s receiving a christmas card from a friend, or helping decorate the classroom, so why not share the excitement!
spend a weekend with the kids baking their favorite treats. they will love to get their hands messy and of course, lick the bowl afterwards!
try a new fudge recipe, or little christmas cupcakes, whatever they love.
then, along with those classic candy canes, share the christmas cheer around school the weekend before the holidays, where they can learn the gift of giving is the best part about the festive season!
so have a very merry christmas this year, and make the festive season a truly special one with the family!
say hi to santa from us!

drainage system: surface drain vs french drain 
may 10, 2020may 10, 2020 by nicholas flores, posted in drainage  

providing proper drainage for your land, commercial, or residential, is one of the most critical long-term preventive maintenance steps that you can take.  insufficient drainage can cause water to create basements, garages, and floods, and can cause significant damage to the foundations of the house. without proper drainage, under the base of your home or commercial building, water will build up in the soil, causing the soil to swell. the expanding soil can cause the foundation to buckle and break when this happens, resulting in costly and time-consuming repairs. a broken base greatly reduces the value of your home or business estate, and it can cost up to $10,000 to fix foundations. with these costs, it is essential to ensure that your property has sufficient drainage.

surface drains or french drains are the two types of drains that are most widely used to fix excess water issues.  it’s important to find the right drainage system for your property.  let’s discuss the differences. 
construction
 although models have varied over the years, traditional french drainage systems usually feature a trench in which a perforated pipe is laid and then filled with gravel. the perforated piping material is often easily broken, so when installing and working around the drain, care must be taken. the construction of a french drain takes time and requires a lot of considerations in terms of work and design.  
in contrast, surface drains are drains with a metal grating that is flush with the surface to drain, providing a safe and easy drainage system. installation is easy and surface drains are resistant to corrosion and breakage because they are made of metal. like french drains, surface drains can be used to collect water in concrete areas such as parking lots or garages.
surface drains vs french drains: purpose the design purpose of surface drains vs french drains is an important consideration in determining what best suits your drainage requirements.
french drains are used mainly to drain groundwater from gardens and around the building foundations. french drains are designed to move water trapped in or out of the ground into an area. we are best used in soil that is vulnerable to rain or flood recurrent saturation.
a variety of commercial and residential uses use ground drains. they are used in a short period of time to store and divert large amounts of water. these are often placed at the bottom of sloped driveways or similar surfaces to collect and drain water runoff from homes, garages, and houses.

surface drains vs french drains: 
french drains are active in removing over-saturated soil moisture. the slope of the soil, however, must be considered to allow water to drain gradually through it and into the drain basin. designed for restricted use, french drains are usually not good at removing large amounts of water in a short time and are often overcome by flooding conditions and heavy rainfall.
in addition, french drains, as they are underground, are susceptible to frequent clogging, and roots from trees and shrubs often displace and damage the piping. normally these model disadvantages allow the drain to last just a few years before it has to be replaced. tyler sprinkler or another local sprinkler specialist can help if you need some advice.

septic tank pumping and maintenance 
august 3, 2019 by nicholas flores, posted in septic service  

septic tank pumping
if your septic tank is not only used for the bathroom but includes the disposal of wastewater from the entire house, keeping it in the proper working condition is crucial.
septic tank pumping is sometimes needed before any work can be performed on a septic tank.  which can be an underground tank connected to a house drain pipe. it has an outlet that passes under the yard to the field pipes. it operates by maintaining the solid waste material and allowing the liquid to flow into the subterranean soil through the field tubes. if there are remaining waste materials, they will be totally broken down by the anaerobic bacteria.
locating your septic tank
there are few measures you can take to find it if your septic tank is not physically noticeable or buried deep underground. they are generally situated at least five feet from the construction. but to be sure of its precise place, use your land platform that you can take advantage of from the environmental office in your town. it will indicate your yard’s place. you can test with a thin metal rod the moment you understand the particular place. but be very careful so the sprinkler system, drain pipes, field pipes, and other things won’t be damaged.
you should get your septic pumped
on average, taking into account the size of the tank and the number of people living in the house, you need to have your septic tank pumped every 3-5 years. if your bath begins to drain slowly, or your toilet backs up after flushing, then something may be wrong with the sewage, or the septic tank may be close complete. if you can avoid it until the experts have identified and solved the problem, contact a septic tank service and do not use too much water or facilities too much. the issue will not get worse this way.
tips on how to keep a septic tank
septic service
remember that it will go to the tank if you use too much water and fill it quicker than it should be. a toilet paper that is biodegradable is best for the toilet. never flush toilet diapers, feminine napkins, cat litter, condoms, cigarettes, oils, petrol, paint, and other chemicals. basically, the bathroom is just for your pee, poo, water, and smooth toilet paper. also, don’t construct anything on the top of the septic tank or field lines above ground. do not plant near or on the septic tank or field lines trees, shrubs, and vegetation.
even if the tank has been effectively situated, you can dig around it, but do it thoroughly so that nothing can harm it or its surroundings. but don’t try to solve any issues it causes. if you notice a lag in any of the drains in the house and the toilet doesn’t work as quickly as it used to.

septic tank pumping
everyone always dreads septic pumping due to the costs involved. if you take a second to think that you only do it once every three years, then it’s really no problem.
how often do i need to do it?
septic tanks are a significant piece of some private sewage frameworks. these tanks are normally developed from concrete or plastic and gather sewage and wastewater from the house. septic tanks are generally introduced where city sewer lines are not accessible, which implies they frequently serve provincial property holders or homes that were worked before city sewer lines were laid in the zone.
given the way that septic tanks can hold a limited measure of sewage, it’s normal for mortgage holders to ask how regularly these tanks ought to be discharged. the appropriate response: it fluctuates. this depends on how big your tank is and how many people live at that house. septic tank pumping can be needed every two to three years usually.
when should a septic tank be discharged?
when in doubt, you should in a perfect world void out your septic tank once every three to five years.
be that as it may, the real recurrence will change contingent upon utilization and what number of individuals live in your family unit. you may need to siphon out a tank all the more much of the time in bigger families, for example, while a solitary individual living alone in a house might almost certainly go ten years without having the tank siphoned out yet a group of seven may need to siphon at regular intervals.
sporadically siphoning out the septic tank is basic for its solid activity. a septic tank that isn’t working can present issues for any family unit, for example, sewage backing up into family empties or sewage rising out of the ground around the septic tank and parallel field.
septic-tank-pumping
to maintain a strategic distance from costly fixes and potential wellbeing risks, roto-rooter prescribes that you analyze and make note of your family unit’s septic tank siphoning interims to help make a siphoning plan going ahead. for instance, ask yourself to what extent you held up before already discharging the framework and if that implied you were managing flood issues. you may likewise chat with your neighbors with comparatively estimated families to show signs of improvement feeling of how regularly you ought to have your septic tank siphoned out.
for what reason does the tank should be discharged?
over-burden is one of the fundamental reasons why septic tanks should be exhausted all the more every now and again. because you’ve never encountered any serious issues with the tank doesn’t mean you should disregard your obligation regarding keeping up it legitimately.
discharging a septic tank is significant in view of the tank’s fundamental reason. by structure, heavier substances settle at the base and in the long run structure a slime layer. in the event that the slop develops to larger amounts than permitted, increasingly strong substances will advance into the dirt ingestion framework (horizontal field). as parallel field channels become stopped up, fluids are kept from coursing through and out of the funnels to retained into encompassing soil. the last piece of this arrangement of occasions includes unsanitary water advancing back to the surface in light of the fact that the septic framework has turned out to be over-burden. at the point when this happens, you and your neighbors will smell it before you see it.







marketing agency: what’s your business growth style? 
april 19, 2019 by nicholas flores, posted in marketing  

marketing agency: what’s your business growth style?
marketing agency
know your business growth style to decide on better choices. we all have one life to live and how we choose to live it matters down the road. would you like to travel in jamaica… or choose an island close to jamaica? know your business growth style to decide which way you will travel.
way of life versus value type business growth
when i was in school a classmate of mine presented me with the idea of a lifestyle business versus an equity business—what i call your business growth style:
way of life (ls) organization: you will probably maintain a gainful business to subsidize an agreeable way of life. this is the “default” for the business plan of action.
value (eq) office: also known as a “high-development” business, you will probably sell the office (or, irregular for offices). normally worked around making very versatile items, however possible in the organization plan of action on the off chance that you settle on the correct choices (and execute well) en route.
this encourages you settle on better choices, in light of the fact that glad office proprietors commonly settle on business decisions that are predictable to their business growth style on the lifestyle (ls) versus value (eq) continuum.
test: do you lean toward a lifestyle or equity organization?
all in all, which way do you lean… and which one would you like to be in case you’re not there now?
way of life agency: put personal satisfaction first..
you presumably need (or have) a “way of life” organization on the off chance that you:

wish you could decrease your hours
love that working for yourself implies you can go to your children’s soccer matches
need an upper white collar class way of life, with cash for pleasant getaways and a decent retirement
need to work with other people who buckle down however who have needs outside the workplace
make an above-showcase pay and sensible benefits, yet don’t require colossal appropriations every year

seem like you? you presumably lean toward owning a lifestyle (ls) office. you’ll structure your office around amplifying personal satisfaction, while letting benefit boost slide… a bit.
running a lifestyle office implies making arrangements for the future, at the end of the day living for now.
value agency: maximize valuation first

you most likely have (or need) an equity (high-development) office on the off chance that you:
try not to mind working extended periods… however wish you were utilizing them all the more proficiently
love that working for yourself implies you can put resources into developing the business, such as making an item that will profit while you rest

wish you could manage the cost of a personal jet, to travel to your very own island*
need to work with other “buckle down, play hard” types, and much of the time associate with colleagues outside of work
are ok making a medium-sized pay now on the off chance that it implies having cash to reinvest in the organization so you can offer it for a great deal of cash in a couple of years
seem like you? you likely lean toward owning an equity (eq) office. you’ll structure your organization around expanding organization valuation, while possibly giving personal satisfaction a chance to slide.
remember that you may not get the procurement value you need, or the last terms may not accommodate your objectives; all things considered, you may later lament the penance.
* reality check: selling an office ordinarily doesn’t deliver enough cash to bear the cost of purchasing a personal jet or a private island.
so which business growth style is better?
think about it. one is not “““better” than the other. when i work with customers, my recommendation is dependably inside their qualities. deciding which growth style was best for my marketing agency helped allow me to find importance and assemble the things i needed to coincide with that plan.
pick the business approach (lifestyle versus value) that gives you the existence you need, and after that assemble everything else to help that.
a great many people are vary in the range between the two and can be hard to decide which is best. take your time to decide which you lean more towards.
most organization proprietors are stuck in the middle of the growth style continuum—inclining toward either lifestyle or equity, yet needing parts of both.
i tweak my recommendation to every office proprietor’s values, goals, and resources—so i can decide which i lean toward- lifestyle or equity. this likewise implies on the off chance that you’ve coincidentally fabricated your organization around a model that is inverse your own qualities.

9. get instructed
to have a decent comprehension of anything, you have to consider it and comprehend its specific circumstance
to have a decent comprehension of anything, you have to consider it and comprehend its specific circumstance. tees have left every subculture wonder that has ever existed, regardless of whether it’s music, skateboarding, road workmanship, game or general popular culture.
get some answers concerning them and have gratefulness for everything. one great book for reference is vintage t-shirts by lisa kidner.
10. be on top of things
be propelled by what the most recent patterns are, however, don’t duplicate them. odds are when you’ve seen that t-shirt created, different originators are moving onto something different away from public scrutiny.

sprinkler system repair
sprinkler repair
i have the worst luck when it comes to sprinkler systems. i have had every problem you can imagine occur. i have a rainbird sprinkler system that is quite old in all fairness. it close to twelve years old. when it works, it functions great. however, when it’s that time to break down again, it can be problematic. i spent several thousand on getting it installed, so i am trying to avoid buying a new one. i have had any problem you can imagine from leaky pipes, clogged sprinkler heads, soggy spots, sick sprinkler heads, broken sprinkler controller, and few sprinkler heads replaced. most of those problems i mention occur naturally with time and age of my system. lately, it seems to be more of a regular occurrence. the sprinkler controller was replaced. the sprinkler heads were cleared of obstruction or replaced. the leaking sprinkler piping was fixed. currently, the new problem is when i run my sprinkler system, all zones work except one zone. it seems to bypass the entire zone, whether i am in manual mode or running the system all the way through.
i called and asked a sprinkler company if they think i needed a sprinkler system repair or if he could troubleshoot with me over the phone. he mentioned sometimes the inactive zone is due to a lack of voltage to the terminals that send electricity to the zone. so it may not be getting enough juice. he said if this was the problem i may be looking at getting a new controller altogether. i told him i had the controller recently replaced and perhaps that wasn’t the problem. he had me look to ensure the controller wires weren’t loose or disconnected. of course, that wasn’t the problem, so he continued to troubleshoot with me some more. he told me to check the solenoid on the valve. he said sometimes that can be faulty and may need to be replaced if it wasn’t the controller. i didn’t know what a solenoid was and actually still don’t. he described it to me so i could locate it. that wasn’t the problem.
lastly, he had me assess the valve to see if it was the problem. he asked me to take it apart and clean the diaphragm. i did as he had asked pulling the little guy apart and cleaning. i reassembled it. then he asked me to turn off and on the sprinkler system. he said to run the sprinkler system completely through. i ran from zone to zone. it actually fixed my problem! i am so grateful! this sprinkler company is so amazing to spend so much time with me on the phone to find the problem. i didn’t want to take any more time off from work. this guy walked me through step by step on how he would have assessed a non-working sprinkler zone. now i know what to do next time. clean the sprinkler valve!

when you spend the money to buy a septic tank, you know you need to take care of it to make it last. they do cost a lot of money upfront, but you can get decades of use out of it and even a lifetime if you care for it correctly. if you have appropriate maintenance on your septic tank, you can extend the life you will get from it while saving money on septic problems and ensuring quality water.
most houses produce close to 90,000 gallons of wastewater per year. that is several hundred each day!
that’s a lot of wastewater used daily. all that wastewater has to go somewhere right? it will reach the septic tank if you don’t have a sewer system in place. from there the wastewater is filtered in the septic tank or sent down a sewer line. in a septic tank though, your wastewater is filtered separating scum and solid particles. it also pretreats the water in the tank. then, it is sent out to the drain-field for purification. this takes about two days to complete the entire process.
we talk about maintaining your septic tank because this process can get messed up or even stop all together causing contamination, illness, and odorous water where it shouldn’t be. if you miss a septic maintenance appointment or neglect it altogether, this is where you begin to have costly septic mishaps. you can have groundwater pollution and property damage all due to a failed system. groundwater pollution can affect many people if it reaches nearby streams, lakes, or rivers. you definitely don’t want that. this can be avoided and prevented if you maintain your septic tank.
so how does a homeowner with a septic tank prevent these costly problems?
it’s really simple. a septic tank will fill up depending on the number of people in a household and size of your septic tank in a about three to five years. smaller septic tanks require more frequently septic pumping than larger septic tanks. if you have a septic professional remove your waste every three to five years, the drain-field will never overflow and cause any damage. you can continue to flush your toilets and wash dishes. no contaminated waters in the ground. no stinky smell lingering where it shouldn’t. you can continue to with your daily tasks without notice to your septic tank. yep, so you won’t have to experience any of the problems expressed above if you just have your septic tank pumped when it needs it.
septic tank pumping near me
in some rural areas, homeowners have a difficult time trying to find a septic company that is willing to travel to their location. i always suggest searching for septic tank pumping near me for the most accurate companies. this way you are sure to find a septic professional that is willing to service your area. if you aren’t sure if they service your area, it is best to give them a call. some septic companies are willing to travel outside of their normal service area for a service that will give them several hundred dollars. be sure you find someone before you need the service. it is so much easier to for a homeowner that way.

what happened to the septic service near me?
septic service
my sister moved into a home down the street from me. i was so happy she did since we lived far apart previously. she is still unpacking boxes and what not. we live in a really amazing rural area. it is very peaceful. i can hear the sounds of the rooster in the morning as the sun is coming up. i usually start my mornings than with a cup of coffee and the daily newspaper that i received the day before. my husband is usually at work about this time. he doesn’t sleep in ever for reasons i cannot understand. he is always up around four in the morning.
anyway, i was enjoying my cup of coffee this morning, when i see several missed calls. it was my sister. i tried returning her call but was unable to reach her. she didn’t leave me a message, so i didn’t know what was going on. being the good sister that i am, i wanted to see if she needed my help. i wanted to be sure it wasn’t an emergency. i get over to her home and knocked on the door. she yelled for me to come in. i could smell a foul odor coming from the bathroom. my sister informed me she has a plumbing problem. i asked her if i could help her, but she didn’t know if i could or how to fix it. i asked her the last time the previous owner had your septic system worked on. she didn’t know and didn’t think to ask before she bought the home.
septic
i told her after attempting to use her plunger in her toilet that we need to get a septic guy out here. i informed her of the importance of septic pumping and tank cleaning. i called the closest guy i knew near me. no answer. it didn’t even get to the voicemail. i then had to google for a septic service near me. i found one ten miles away. he said he could get to her today. hours later, he fixed her septic system and informed her of the buildup sludge reducing the effective capacity of my sister’s septic tank. he informed us it was clogging our pipes causing the problem. he left her with a toilet that could flush and the foul odor eventually went away.
she learned after this emergency visit that she needed to ask important questions like last maintenance on the system to know when she needed to clean the system next. when i move into a home with a septic tank, i will definitely ask those questions. that odor was horrendous.







 


5 sure signs it’s time for tree removal 
march 20, 2019march 24, 2019 by nicholas flores, posted in tree services  

tree removal
trees do not just add aesthetic value to a home, park, or any other establishment, for that matter. more than their beautiful green leaves, trees offer shade, conserve energy, produce oxygen for cleaner air, and reduce the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. of course, you have to do your part in ensuring that the trees are kept healthy and strong. otherwise, you may end up spending more than necessary.
here are 5 signs that mean it’s time to take that huge tree down by tree removal.
the branches have become very weak.
when a tree begins to decay, it also loses its previous strength since the branches are not given enough nourishment to grow. as soon as you see thinning or weakening branches, consider it as an alarming situation that needs checking out and further inspection. you may also want to check the branches for insect infestation.
the trees are damaged by harsh weather conditions.
strong winds and heavy rains can cause massive damage to trees, especially during the worst storms. mature trees, for example, may tend to grow over your home or property, which may eventually fall over and cause a huge problem. for areas that are prone to snow and hurricanes, it is recommended to have old trees removed as a preventive measure.
the bark cannot produce new layers.
tree bark is more than just a part of the tree, it actually works to protect the trees from getting harmed by the forces of nature. normally, a tree bark can replenish itself from time to time, with the old bark falling off and revealing a whole new layer. if the bark can no longer produce a new one, then it means that the tree’s health is deteriorating.
there is an existence of harmful fungi.
tree services
the presence of fungi is one of the surest signs of tree trouble. basically, there are different types of fungi that can affect trees, and most of them can eventually lead to tree diseases that may not seem apparent at first. take the root and butt rot disease, for instance. this particular disease eats up the tree from the inside causing decay and instability. if left untreated, the tree will fall off on its own leading to property damage.
the tree is suffering from decay.
when a tree becomes injured, it can cause cavities that are relatively connected with the declining health of a tree. if the cavity becomes large enough to fit objects or even small children, it needs to be filled out immediately. if the cavity has become too large that there is a possibility that the tree might topple over, then it is recommended to have it removed. the key here is to have the tree checked out by a specialist to avoid further damage.
removing trees is not easy and may pose as a huge disadvantage to both the people and eh environment, but when safety is being compromised, there’s nothing more to do but to let it go. a huge decaying tree can cause extreme damage to property, and sometimes, create a danger to the lives of the people near it. tree removal may just be the only feasible solution. find out more ways to remove a tree.
