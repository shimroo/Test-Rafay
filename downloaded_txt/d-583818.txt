joseph says




                            i use wright tools on pressure transducers for aerospace testing. i use them because they are made in the usa, and as we know, american tools are the best. the manufacturing philosophy and quality of this company is right on the money, which helped me make my decision to purchase wright tools. they perform flawlessly. the hand feel of the wrenches is perfect and a product that comfortable to grip gives me the confidence in high pressure (psi) applications.

tim says




                            i work in aviation, mostly on the oxygen systems. there is very little room to work on these systems and even less room for error. i could not ask for a better tool. when my 1/4" ratcheting torque wrench stopped ratcheting, i called wright's customer service and they went above and beyond, as this tool is irreplaceable. i chose the wright wrench, which is compact, precise, and adjustable. it outperforms the "truck" torque wrenches hands down.

jeff says




                            i'm creating a tool room for our locomotive machinists. i learned of wright tools when i was doing on-site engine over-hauls in the power generation industry. i needed a ¾” drive ratchet that was fine tooth and could break main bearings free that were torqued to 740 ft-lbs. i purchased #6425 instead of the equivalent of another brand. the wright tool exceeded expectations. i am a certified ase master diesel technician and a licensed aircraft mechanic, and i have used everything. i'm now a mechanical training manager at a railroad. if there's anything i can do with respect to trying new tools or offering advice for new tools please don't hesitate to ask. i'm a major advocate of keeping americans working and prefer to see american money supporting american jobs.

matt says




                            i love this company! they are the epitome of what a great american tool company should be. every socket i own is made by wright, at least half of my ratchets and all of wrenches. in the years i've spent as an automotive and motorcycle mechanic, i've never once been disappointed by my experience with these tools.

                            quality usa made products with good accuracy. some of the wright torque wrenches come with calibration certificates and compare favorably to expensive brands. update: their wrenches and sockets are top notch too (just got the 3xx, 466, 467, 915 and 958 sets).
