“la grotta seems fortified against the competition in this town, and that has as much to do with the generations of devotees—many of them old school atlanta royalty—as it does with its reliable, often superlative food.”

— rebecca cha, simply buckhead

faqs








            do you have a dress code
          










we do. at la grotta, we pride ourselves on being one of the few places in atlanta where our patrons can dress up and have a night out on the town. for this reason, we do not allow patrons to wear baseball caps, beanies, sports attire including t-shirts, tennis shoes, shorts, or jeans with holes in our dining room. business casual attire is fine but feel free to get as fancy as you’d like. jackets are preferred for the gentlemen but ties are optional. 








            do you have valet parking? 
          










complimentary valet paring is offered in front of the peachtree house for the convenience of our guests. 








            can i purchase a gift certificate?
          










gift certificates can be purchased by calling the restaurant at 404.231.1368. certificates can be sent via email or mailed via ups. 








            do you offer private dining?
          










 while we do not have a private dining room, we do host groups exclusively on our courtyard patio (weather permitting). we also have restaurant buyouts and corporate luncheons privately for groups up to 110 seated.
