usa:toward a 21st-century "new deal" for public transport

 



												as the usa faces massive economic crisis, leading mainstream economists as well as many public transport advocates are strongly recommending various alternatives for economic stimulus and stabilization.
												calls have become more urgent for a major public works initiative – in effect, a 21st-century version of the 1930s-era "new deal" – with particular emphasis on addressing america's dire infrastructure crisis involving bridges, urban utilities, railways, public transit, transportation electrification, and other aspects of critical infrastructure.
												proponents of such a program argue it can bring jobs and economic uplift – as well as providing crucial alternatives to petroleum dependency – but it must include public transportation investment at its core.
												this webpage provides a listing of recent articles on the light rail now! website that address some of the most critical issues involved. ...

austin, texas: city's urban rail plan needs major overhaul 
 


												the city of austin is proposing a 16.5-mile urban rail plan, based on light rail transit.
												but a group of pro-rail critics argue that the plan fails to serve the central city's heaviest traffic corridor, instead focusing much of its service (and expense) on a development area with no perceptible congestion. 
												and there are other problems with the plan.....

nearly 3/4 of surface transport terror attacks involve personal motor vehicles – so us security officials focus on ... trains? 



											several high-profile incidents have sparked a frenzy of official "security" measures targeting rail transit.
											but does the factual evidence actually suggest that rail passenger operations and facilities are higher-risk targets, or preferentially utilized in terrorist attacks?
											as this analysis indicates, the proportion of rail-related incidents is extremely small.
											thus, with rail services and facilities implicated in only a tiny percentage of total terrorism incidents,
											why are rail passenger services being singled out for special security crackdowns – especially
											when nearly 3/4 of all incidents involve private motor vehicles, which nowhere are being subjected to such measures? ...

											growing interest in electric rail transit seems to have got road warriors in the motor vehicle and highway construction industies seriously bent out of shape and really running scared, leading them to mount a ferocious and massive public

											contrary to a widely held notion among the public that rail transit systems, such as light rail transit, are weighted down with substantial heavy capital expense,
											while buses are more or less "free", bus systems incur sizable capital expenses, too, as well as rail, with typically much higher operational costs – and
											often, when you add up all these costs, account for the relative life of the components, plus the work performed, you may find that rail actually gives
											amazing "bang for the buck" ... as this case study of bus vs. rail in st. louis suggests...
