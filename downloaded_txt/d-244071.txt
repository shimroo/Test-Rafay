warning: people with poor bladder control should enjoy with extreme caution !!!!!bio: question: what is god’s gift to clean and funny?              answer: rocky whatule… rocky has a unique style of high-energy comedy that reaches every one. having fun with audiences of all ages is a god given talent that rocky has mastered. a former hollywood personality with appearances on tbs, “friends”, mtv showtime, and former host of the tv show, and the radio segment “the hollywood rockin’ wrap-up” this eighteen-year veteran of television and stage will keep everyone in stitches, with humor from all walks of life. he pokes fun at everything from single to married life, from friends to family, from observations to experiences, from preaching to his martial arts ministry. rocky whatule is an all around great entertainer. “…once rocky has your attention you will never want the show to end.”  “it’s like going to church… except you laugh more and you don’t fall asleep” although being a much-credited entertainer, an award winning martial artist and sensei, rocky says the god given talent that he cherishes most is the ability to make anyone laugh. he has performed across the country in front of tens of thousands, bringing laughter to every one he has ever met. now he brings his testimony and message of god’s love through laughter, touching hearts not just funny bones. the bible says a joyful heart doeth good like a medicine. and rocky is just what the doctor ordered!
