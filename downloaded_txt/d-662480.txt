montana travel and tourism information
montana is diverse in history, heritage, scenery and culture. from 
				    spectacular glaciers and the going-to-the-sun highway in glacier 
				    national park to geysers and wildlife in yellowstone national park.
travel through ghost towns and historical landmarks to museums 
				    and shakespeare in the park. montana has adventure and fun for 
				    every traveler. it’s a vacationers’ paradise from fishing, boating, 
				    camping and world class golf in the warm summer months to 
				    playing in the snow during the cool winter.
montana is famous for big mountains, great snow and uncrowded 
				    slopes with over 14,000 acres of powder.  fantastic downhill 
				    skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling abound throughout the big 
				    sky! you can also strap on a pair of snowshoes and take off cross 
				    country.
excitement isn’t just on the slopes in montana, you can find it on 
				    the ice as well. glide over the ice at 90 miles an hour on an ice 
				    boat or try your hand at snowkiting. another thrilling way to keep 
				    the blood pumping while playing out in the cold.
