about  idc
imaging dynamics company ltd.
idc utilizes technology similar to that used by nasa in the hubble space telescope and the mars rover. the proprietary configuration of the charge coupled device (ccd) detector has synergized high resolution direct digital imaging for x-ray purposes. the creation of technology such as the xplorer radiographic system and the digital flat panel detector (fpd) has permitted expanded product variability for our customers. the digital radiography products we offer include medical ccd detectors, medical flat panel detectors, multifunction x-ray machines, veterinary x-ray machines.
