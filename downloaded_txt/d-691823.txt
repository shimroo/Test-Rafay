destination recreation 



activities at nakoma 




					as much a state of mind as a place on the map, the lost sierra is just 45 minutes from truckee-tahoe and reno, but a world apart. jump in one of dozens of shimmering alpine lakes, lure a trout from the wild-and-scenic middle fork of the feather river, spot a bald eagle in the sierra valley, or bag a peak along the pacific crest trail. the lost sierra offers wilderness that brings out the adventurer in all of us.
