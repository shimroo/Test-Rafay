point of sale
a quick and convenient program which allows the
user to both prepare estimates / work orders  and print invoices from a single
screen. estimates / work orders are stored for future use so they can easily be
retrieved and reviewed. the estimates / work orders can either be printed as an
invoice or updated.  
inventory and service pricing is automatically calculated as well as
the final total of the invoice. this saves time from having to
manually calculate the invoice and prevents calculation errors.
the inventory is automatically adjusted to reflect the parts used
for each invoice. a special "link" function assists in
the preparation of the  invoice and work orders further reducing the
processing time.
