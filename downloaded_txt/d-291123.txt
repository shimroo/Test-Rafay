why choose adb home as your new home builders?







as affordable new home builders, adb homes, llc has built over 1000 homes from naples to north port. our smallest home is an 1100 square foot 3 bedroom 2 bath starter home. our largest home is an estate home over 3800 square feet. it is a split plan that has 4 bedrooms, 3 baths, a living room, family room and a dining room. it also has a large lanai and entry.

 

all of our homes are concrete block construction with a full formed and poured 8” x 16” tie beam. we don’t use a tiny bond beam with only 1 piece of steel like all the other builders. our homes have wood frame interior for better sound proofing, more wall rigidity and ease of decoration or customizing after the purchase. we use custom corian window sills for a more finished look than the carrera/marbelite of our competitors. we use 30 year dimensional shingles for better curb appeal and longevity.

 

our home prices include everything and our homes are truly move- in ready. we include all of the site preparation, fill, grade, water system and septic system. if the lot you choose is on water and sewer, the budget for the water system and septic can be used to offset the cost of hookups. most of our homes come with tile everywhere except in the bedrooms. we have wood cabinets and granite tops in the kitchen and all baths. we have a full range of color selections to fit any taste with all of our finishes.

 

we will help you through the entire home building process starting from finding a lender to picking your colors and closing. we will inspect your lot before you purchase to make sure that there aren’t any issues that need attention before construction. we will always let you know if there are any problems associated with your lot choice prior to finalizing your contract. we strive to make your home building experience as easy as possible.

 

we are a family owned and a second generation florida builder with over 35 years of experience in the southwest florida construction industry and we are breaking in the third generation to carry the torch. we have been through the good times along with the bad times and we are still here for the long haul. there were a lot of years that were very bad in our industry but we stuck it out through thick and thin. this goes to show that we will be here for the long haul. we welcome the chance to be your affordable new home builders.
