it’s all about appearances





burgum goes full pyongyang on fox & friends: "watching president trump in the beast, leading the pace car, leading the field of the most talented drivers in the world, kicking off the entire nascar season for america, when he was doing that it reminded me of how he's actually leading the world right now."   pic.twitter.com/wcfq8r33gw— aaron rupar (@atrupar) february 17, 2025

president’s day 





emptywheel:wrt stripping appropriated funding, musk is reneging on contracts. without contracts you have no capitalism.   
this order, from amir ali, really gets to the core of what is happening: the government is, wholesale, canceling existing contracts. 

no republican should endorse this. neither should they try to pretend something else is happening. 
https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336/gov.uscourts.dcd.277336.21.0_7.pdfactually the suits are based on breach of contract . what’s clear is that neither musk nor trump give a wet snap for the sanctity of contracts.and they don’t understand how fundamental contracts are; and not just to capitalism. the covenant between god and israel (and by extension, in judaism and christianity, with all of humanity) can be likened to a contract. the non-religious idea of social order (one not founded on humanity’s relationship with god) is, metaphorically, a “social contract.” the concept of contract, of a reliance on agreement the other party is likewise bound to, is fundamental to business and social relationships.and there’s the root of the problem with having trump and musk in power; or in government at all.

clowns at least serve a purpose 🤡 





new from me: the trump administration has reversed the firings of all but 28 of the nuclear weapons workers that @doge blindly cut last week. one of the hardest hit plants was pantex -- near amarillo, texas -- where 30 percent of the cuts took place. the nuclear weapons role of those workersa and the feds who oversee it is one of the most sensitive missions in the us.  https— tara copp (@taracopp) february 17, 2025 i knew this before i looked it up.pantex is the primary united states nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility that aims to maintain the safety, security and reliability of the u.s. nuclear weapons stockpile. pantex has been there since 1942. of course, that’s too long for these young kids elmo has set loose, to know anything about. these people are absolutely, dangerously stupid, and too ignorant to know just how ignorant they are. which is what makes them so dangerous. and stupid.it would appear they are not accessing sensitive secrets, but man! are they stupid!

“thou hast committed fornication…”





"but that was in another country":the controversy began when brennan said of vance, "well, he was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide, and he met with the head of a political party that has far-right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. the context of that was changing the tone of it. and you know that. that the censorship was specifically about the right--"if you read the article, you’ll notice the responses shoot the messenger, and offer no insight into how vance’s intemperate and idiotic speech was received. that’s convenient because it shuts out any information from the countries beyond the sea, an old american practice dating back to the 19th century when america self-isolated from europe and built its own self-serving narrative about what europe thought and even how they lived. dickens’ martin chuzzlewit gives an excellent example of what dickens encountered on his tour of america. martin is told by an american he’s just met, what life is really like in england (the american has never been there, martin has just come from there), and what’s wrong with english government, and right with america and its government.all the responses play on that ignorance, even as we have better communication with europe since the 19th century, and a radically altered relationship with them.also, the argument drowns what vance said (you won’t find out in those responses) in favor of what they say brennan said. and she didn’t say the holocaust was caused by the “weaponization” (can we stop using that ugly neologism yet?) of free speech. she summarized the critique of vance’s speech by (especially) germany: free speech was used, through lies and disinformation, to gain despotic power, which was then used to justify the holocaust.which is quite a different kettle of fish than attacking vance and musk and trump “ad hitlerium.” (an even dumber neologism than the other, but not mine. it’s one of the cited critiques.) the attacks are literally in defense of what vance said, without ever really citing any of his statements, or appearing to defend him.nice work, if you can get it. but it’s clearly meant to cover up vance’s message (it’s no accident it was delivered overseas) so they can keep spreading it. and they never have to explain why vance met with the neo-nazi afd.“and besides, the wench is dead.”

“humankind cannot bear very much reality”





there’s an immigrant taking people’s jobs… his name is elon musk. he’s snatching farms, government jobs (even those in which they manage our national security), and definitely those whose jobs are to root out fraud (inspector generals), & those that are keeping us safe (faa),meals on wheels workers, head start, and the list goes on, so i’ll be the bigger person and admit to maga that i was wrong when i said immigrants wouldn’t take our jobs. you were 1000 percent correct.  — jasmine crockett (@jasmineforus) february 16, 2025 
don’t call for your social security, medicaid, medicare, passport, irs refund, worry about the planes falling out or the sky,complain when the ebola cases just found in ny spread like wildfire killing people, nor be upset when there’s no cancer medications because research has stopped, dare have a uniquely abled child because there will be no services for said child, complain about the cost or the lack of safety around our food, and def don’t complain when our enemies attack us… i could go on but you won’t care until something you care about ceases to be available and well that day is coming. it’s fafo season… so we will wait for the rest of y’all to catch up.    — jasmine crockett (@jasmineforus) february 16, 2025 the teaching of christianity is that the best way for us all to live is to take care of each other, whoever we are. “the first of all will be last of all and servant of all.”this is supposed to be a christian nation. but few who claim to be christians really want to live that way. selfishness is so much easier.

 flu good!new: the cdc is currently removing all the influenza resources from their website during the worst flu season in decades.vaccine bad!on friday night, hhs ordered cdc to take down all flu vaccine campaign materials from its website. materials are starting to come down. 
for example, a campaign explaining that flu shot can reduce flu severity from "wild to mild" is now offline. didn’t rfk promise he wouldn’t do this?oh, well. i’m sure somewhere a republican senator is concerned. so that’s something. besides this is gonna save $2 trillion, right?or at least lower the price of eggs.* 🤷🏻‍♂️ *remembering now when trump said if we just stopped talking about covid, it would go away. everything new is old again.

the fire next time 





the irony of donald trump saying our founding fathers are "spinning in their graves" when he's installed the richest man in the world to run our government, and is writing unconstitutional executive orders while actively disregarding the judicial branch. our founding fathers… pic.twitter.com/wewkjzxwdc— art candee 🍿🥤 (@artcandee) february 16, 2025 well, he’s trying hard to get there.this is how the non-originalist commerce clause argument against obamacare based on the activity/inactivity distinction, invented from whole cloth, started. it won before scotus. this will give judges and justices cover to adopt the absurd trump administration view of birthright citizenship. the wurman/barnett op/ed is the next step in normalizing the frivilous birthright citizenship argument. in a few months, conservatives will contend that the only reason liberals didn't take the argument seriously is because of their blindspots. by then, judges will feel comfortable endorsing it.it’s an argument. certainly legal hackery is always a possibility, especially in the highest court in the land. but dobbs only undid roe, loper only undid chevron, and trump v us instituted a ridiculous policy that will be damned hard to implement since the central tenet, “official duty,” can’t be determined without a string of presidential criminal prosecutions. which, yes, trump may have inspired, but it seems unlikely. so it’s even more unlikely the supremes will soon have to weigh competing opinions on what the pivot point of their ill-begotten doctrine means. so is it bad? yes. is it functional? not really.oh, trump thinks it makes him invisible and bulletproof; but that’s an accident of history. he’s an old man. there won’t be much appetite to prosecute him again in four years. and unless he steals documents again (a live option, admittedly) or sponsors another assault on congress, there won’t clear grounds to. (and stealing documents is not even arguably an “official duty”).all of which is to say, unraveling wong, or inventing grounds to rescind jus soli citizenship for one class of persons, introduces massive problems to constitutional jurisprudence. problems like creating a category of “outlaw” for which some constitutional provisions don’t apply. (and a huge constitutional contradiction, as it has been pointed out that many slaves were brought to this country illegally, and were, by the pre-14th constitution, never citizens anyway. the 14th explicitly made them citizens, however their ancestors arrived.) you really can’t slice that baloney so thinly it only has one side. not without also discarding the late 20th century legal doctrine that race is a pernicious category. because clearly the argument against the 14th is that it shouldn’t apply to non-whites.nobody calls people like elmo “illegal immigrants.” i mean, white people may overstay their visas, but that doesn’t make them “illegal,” does it? certainly not according to tom homan (who, btw, is a dumbass.)adopting the argument of trump or maga would set off a bomb in constitutional jurisprudence that would wipe the infamy away from dred scott. not to mention call into question the real legitimacy of the court: to make rulings that have even an arguable basis in law.even as i type that i realize that, still, it could happen. but i think at worst it would be a 5-4 decision, with the 5 upholding precedent, and denying maga its constitutional napalm.but, as the old curse has it: may you live in interesting times.

“outlaw” is no longer a concept of law 





 the argument here is that “illegal immigrants” (the term used in the opinion piece) are “outlaw.” both the lincoln administration and the congress that proposed the 14th amendment held this allegiance-for-protection view, with this difference: in england, the allegiance expected of a subject was obedience to the sovereign monarch in return for his protection. in the american republic, where the people are sovereign, the allegiance expected of a citizen was obedience to the laws.it’s an old concept, unrecognized in american jurisprudence, that people can be outside the law’s protection. the other end of that legal spectrum is that the sovereign is likewise beyond the law.  but in that case the sovereign is the law (and the law is not subject to itself. which, yes, obviates the concept of “unconstitutional laws”), and so not subject to it. but the sovereign is protected by that status (and by holding society together with the protection of the law), while the outlaw has placed himself beyond the law. the consequence for the outlaw is that the law will not protect him. he is prey to fraud, assault, even murder.  even under slavery, slaves were never outside the law’s protection. they could be treated cruelly, but to kill a slave deprived the owner unlawfully of his property. yes, that’s morally and legally indefensible, but that’s the point. an outlaw could be killed with no consequences. that was the status of  “outlaw.”as i say, it’s never been recognized in american jurisprudence, and it never should be.the concept of “outlaw,” in fact, arose from the idea of allegiance to the king. one who so violated the law (literally by taking the king’s property, be that royal grounds or the king’s subjects) that he had voided his allegiance, became an outlaw. allegiance was presumed, not proven by words. it could only be voided in extreme circumstances.violating the administrative law of undocumented entry is hardly such an extreme.according to the quoted paragraph, an “illegal immigrant” (an undefined term but one usually applied only to non-whites) is not entitled to protection of law, or to u.s. citizenship. what, then, of the case of elon musk? he entered the country on a student visa, but failed to comply with its terms. later, while here “illegally,” he applied for citizenship. he acted illegally again, misrepresenting his legal status in order to earn citizenship. is he not-entitled to citizenship because of his fraud? is he actually “outlaw”? he is by the quoted argument.
this is how they present the basis for wong kim ark, which they recognize as the fundamental case on birthright citizenship:in wong kim ark, the leading case on birthright citizenship, the supreme court explained that “jurisdiction” referred to being born “within the allegiance” of the sovereign. the court held that a child born of parents with a “permanent domicile and residence in the united states” was a birthright citizen. wong kim ark’s parents, as persons who came in amity, had entered into the social compact and were entitled to all the benefits of that compact, including not only the protection of the laws but also the benefits of citizenship for their children. under the common law, the court observed, “such allegiance and protection were mutual.”but this is how the wong court presented the issue:the question presented by the record is whether a child born in the united states, of parents of chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the emperor of china, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the united states, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the emperor of china, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the united states by virtue of the first clause of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution.the op-ed has to misconstrue the case, in other words, to make it fit their argument. that argument is further undermined by the analysis of the law in wong, which begins with this premise:the fundamental principle of the common law with regard to english nationality was birth within the allegiance, also called "ligealty," "obedience," "faith," or "power" of the king. the principle embraced all persons born within the king's allegiance and subject to his protection."subject to his protection” is the key point. all persons within the jurisdiction of the united states (as those within the borders are), are subject to the laws protection, as well as its judgment. wong did not even tacitly accept the concept of “outlaw” in american law, but the op-ed can’t make its argument without it.“subject to the jurisdiction” is also the qualification for birthright citizenship in the 14th amendment. the op-ed tries to rewrite wong by ignoring the extensive discussion of jus soli citizenship. but since the op-ed chooses a citation to british law, here is a citation from wong:“by the common law of england, every person born within the dominions of the crown, no matter whether of english or of foreign parents, and, in the latter case, whether the parents were settled or merely temporarily sojourning, in the country, was an english subject, save only the children of foreign ambassadors (who were excepted because their fathers carried their own nationality with them), or a child born to a foreigner during the hostile occupation of any part of the territories of england. no effect appears to have been given to descent as a source of nationality."the opinion in wong rests on such analyses. note there is nothing there about parental “allegiance.”this is a hodgepodge argument with no real connection to the law. but the authors are constitutional law professors. which indeed gives omri marian the right take:i don't assume he's wrong. i know he's wrong as a matter of fact. i also think you both are intellectual hacks who don't belong anywhere near a university classroom.i’m only sorry they won’t get to make this argument in court, where it could be properly shredded.intellectual hackery is far from unknown among my brothers at the bar, and frequently displayed by those on the bench, so the ultimate decision in this matter remains to be seen.agreed. and why i said it “could be” shredded, not that it would be. certainly it should be.nothing, after all, is certain but death and taxes.  and intellectual hackery, eh?

there is a lot trump doesn’t know 





 the golden child works from home.she worked in an office until covid. she commuted almost an hour, one way, to work there. she shed that burden happily. eventually she moved several states away from, but still works for the same office in the same company.after covid, the company decided workers should return to the office. many, like the golden child, simply couldn’t. some had sold houses and moved to where the cost of living was much lower. but more importantly, the company had dropped leases and couldn’t force employees to move back to their offices, and didn’t want the massive reorganization of moving employees to new offices. computers make it easy for the company to organize workers without regard to geography. the company got used to that, and didn’t want to undo it.but returning workers to the office space physically near them proved to be impossible. there simply wasn’t enough workspace for all the employees, not in every office the company had around the country. so workers come into the office at least one day a week. they grab a desk, plug in their computer, and go to work. it isn’t efficient, and it certainly isn’t effective in restoring an “office culture.” the same people aren’t in the office on the same day, and the people in any one office may be working with people in several other cities. which, as i say, is how the company wants it. (the golden child oversees a team scattered across several states.) so what, really, is the point of being in the office? or, for that matter, paying rent for office space for every employee in the company?that’s the question with the federal government, too:
with trump demanding all workers whose jobs haven't been put in limbo show up at federal buildings, the post is reporting, "a u.s. navy department employee in virginia, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said he was ordered to return to the office monday. but because of a lack of space, his team has been spread among four buildings, some of them separated by 30 to 40 miles. 'i’m making a 15-minute drive to get paperwork routed,' he said. 'some people are making a 45-minute drive.'" 

another federal employee told the post her office has 40 people attempting to share 14 desks and therefore, "they take turns at the desks and spend the rest of the day killing time and chatting in the halls." she has been forced, at times to sit in an auditorium with no computer access and no work being done. 

another worker who has been told to return after working remotely, "if i’m in an office space, i don’t work with anybody in the office. my bosses are in a different location, our team is all over the west, and it has been that way for decades. it’s not that people don’t want to go to work. there’s just no place to go.”this was predictable, at least by people not as clueless as trump and musk. in the name of “efficiency,” a word they no more understand than they do the component words of dei, they have created great inefficiencies.whether they know it or not.  reality doesn’t give a shit what they don’t know. but we need to.

saturday night’s alright for fighting 





it turns out we all should have read the wapo article, instead of posts about “what happened.”i quit a job once on “principles”. nothing grand; mostly the principle was it was a lousy place to work. i can report that principles don’t pay the bills. if you can leave the job for another, rather than walk out the door, you’re probably better off.we may all have congratulated those unknown lawyers for their principles, but it wouldn’t have paid their rent.

elmo wants to replace government workers with ai





sure, why not?a crash involving a tesla cybertruck in self-driving mode this week has sparked worries about the reliability of the company's software that powers the feature, days after ceo elon musk said he would roll out a paid robotaxi service this year. the pickup, the latest model in tesla's lineup, failed to merge out of a lane that was ending, hit the curb and crashed into a pole in nevada's reno city while on its full self-driving feature, which still requires a human in control behind the wheel.  “don't make the same mistake i did. pay attention. it is easy to get complacent now - don't," the driver jonathan challinger said on social media platform x tagging musk. "spread my message and help save others from the same fate or far worse." the driver reported that there were unknown mechanical issues that caused the vehicle to leave the lane and hit the pole, according to a police report seen by reuters. 
tesla has for years faced criticism and investigations over the safety of its advanced driver assistance software following several crashes, including a fatal one. 
but musk late last month said people skeptical of the technology should try it now, touting the "immense improvement" in the safety profile of its latest iteration called version 13.and how is that working out?
unlike other automakers, which use redundant technologies for safety, tesla's approach relies only on cameras, making it cheaper but also riskier in challenging visibility conditions, such as heavy rain, snow or fog, according to experts.and remind me to stay out of austin this summer:musk said tesla will start testing paid ride-hailing service by june in austin, texas - a state with almost no regulatory requirements for autonomous vehicles - followed by california and other u.s. regions by the end of the year.oh, yeah; why elmo is so interested in ai (and unconcerned with tesla sales?)

a successful deployment of robotaxis is crucial for tesla as it grapples with a broader slowdown in demand for its aging lineup of evs, while investors bet heavily on musk's pivot to robotics and ai for future growth.elmo is not interested in business. elmo is only interested in the next shiny thing. the next shiny thing, and government contracts. government contracts have been very, very good to elmo. if he can turn government over to ai, and also supply the ai, who needs to worry about car sales?it’s 1972, and we’re stuck in that dc parking garage, having to hear hal holbrook say the same thing again and again and againi didn’t know that we’d ever left.

who needs allies when there’s business to be done?





multiple lawmakers here in munich told me the u.s. congressional delegation presented zelensky with a piece of paper they wanted him to sign which would grant the u.s. rights to 50% of ukraine’s future mineral reserves. zelensky politely declined to sign it. #msc2025— josh rogin (@joshrogin) february 14, 2025 
2/2 in today’s meeting with u.s. lawmakers, zelensky was telling them about this paper, which many of them didn’t already know about, not the other way around. z said he could not sign it because it didn’t contain any security guarantees for ukraine. apologies for any confusion.— josh rogin (@joshrogin) february 15, 2025 lawmakers didn’t know about this? how was this supposed to become a binding agreement? by executive order?  or was the deal for trump? did he think it would survive putin running roughshod over ukraine?indeed, who needs anyone who knows how government actually works?trump administration officials fired more than 300 staffers thursday night at the national nuclear security administration — the agency tasked with managing the nation’s nuclear stockpile — as part of broader energy department layoffs, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. 
sources told cnn the officials did not seem to know this agency oversees america’s nuclear weapons. 

an energy department spokesperson disputed the number of personnel affected, telling cnn that “less than 50 people” were “dismissed” from nnsa, and that the dismissed staffers “held primarily administrative and clerical roles.” 
the agency began rescinding the terminations friday morning.   
some of the fired employees included nnsa staff who are on the ground at facilities where nuclear weapons are built. these staff oversee the contractors who build nuclear weapons, and they inspect these weapons. 
it also included employees at nnsa headquarters who write requirements and guidelines for contractors who build nuclear weapons. a source told cnn they believe these individuals were fired because “no one has taken anytime to understand what we do and the importance of our work to the nation’s national security.”hang on, it gets worse:“congress is freaking out because it appears doe didn’t really realize nnsa oversees the nuclear stockpile,” one source said. “the nuclear deterrent is the backbone of american security and stability – period. for there to be any even very small holes poked even in the maintenance of that deterrent should be extremely frightening to people.”yes, congress can act on trump’s actions without holding hearings, passing legislation, or going on social media. but also, the new leadership of the doe doesn’t know the doe is the successor to erda ( which succeeded the aec).the people who did this had no fucking idea what they were doing.political officials at the energy department told its non-political hr administrators to cite poor performance personnel files as a justification for firing the employees, the source said. frustrated by the pressure from political appointees, two of those hr employees submitted their resignations on friday. 
a doe spokesperson declined to comment on the poor-performance rationale for the firings. cnn has reached out to the two employees who resigned. 
in addition to overseeing america’s nuclear weapons, the nnsa also helps secure nuclear material nationwide. sources told cnn it’s a critical mission, pointing to the russian drone attack on a chernobyl power plant reactor in ukraine on thursday. 

“nnsa maintains sensors in ukraine to help track nuclear risks, whether intentional or unintentional,” a source said, adding the layoffs are “frightening.”no fucking idea in the world. “the wing’d with awe/inviolable.”not that anybody in the white house knows what they’re doing, either.

next: bringing back polio and smallpox!





trump signs an executive order that prevents federal funding from going to schools that require students to be vaccinated for covid-19.trump: that solves that problemreporter: does the department of education have to handle that?trump: yes pic.twitter.com/7jj4j9ciev— acyn (@acyn) february 14, 2025 uhh...(doesn’t he want to dismantle doe?)and does he want another covid pandemic?besides, vaccines are a matter of public health law, i.e., state law. schools individually, or as districts, don’t require vaccines. they do so as a matter of applicable law. trump can’t withhold federal funds because he doesn’t like state laws. congress can (that’s how they forced states to reduce their speed limits to 55 in the ‘70’s). but trump can’t.mostly because of art. i and the apa, which bars such arbitrary orders. so this is just keeping more lawyers employed.
duffy: as a father of nine, i thank you. we should have the parental freedom to decide what vaccines our kids take as opposed to school systems and governors.. trump: great. pic.twitter.com/kbk4fmphse— acyn (@acyn) february 14, 2025 and the parental freedom to decide which diseases our children are exposed to? funny nobody ever puts it that way.i don’t mean to be cruel, but is there a betting pool on how many of duffy’s kids survive childhood?the measles outbreak first reported in gaines county, texas, has doubled to 48 cases since a count released  earlier this week, the texas department of state health services said friday. the first two cases were identified in late january and the numbers have been rising since. 
forty-two cases are reported in gaines county. surrounding counties have also reported cases, three in terry county, two in yoakum county and one in lynn county. with the contagious nature of the disease, the state health department says it expects more cases will be reported in gaines county and the surrounding areas. all cases are in unvaccinated people or those who have unknown vaccination status. most cases are in children age 5 to 17 years old. all the cases experienced an onset of symptoms in the last three weeks. among the 48 cases, 13 have been hospitalized. measles is a highly contagious airborne illness that can cause rash, fever, red eyes and cough. severe cases can result in blindness, pneumonia or encephalitis, swelling of the brain. in some cases, the illness can be fatal. 

coverage of the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine is particularly low in gaines county, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year did not get the vaccine. the 18% vaccine exemption rate for the county is one of the highest in the state, according to data from the texas health department. .... 
there were 285 cases reported in the us last year, the most since 2019, according to the us centers for disease control and prevention. this year cases have already been identified in texas, alaska, new mexico, georgia, rhode island and new york city. 

a record share of us kindergartners had an exemption for required vaccinations last school year, leaving more than 125,000 new schoolchildren without coverage for at least one state-mandated vaccine, according to data published by the us centers for disease control and prevention in october.the good news there is that, with 48 cases and rising, 80 people in the affected area have been vaccinated.  as mike tyson said, everybody’s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.sean duffy is a fucking idiot. anyway, it’s reassuring to know the president is well and reliably informed:
trump: i thought jd vance made a brilliant speech. i thought his speech was well received. i have heard good remarks. pic.twitter.com/z8neu1rp5x— acyn (@acyn) february 14, 2025 
his entourage clapped…and no one else. from leader to pariah in just three weeks. https://t.co/fvx1nhrqmg— fred wellman (@fpwellman) february 14, 2025 
he’s also up to date on what’s happening in the doj.
reporter: the lead prosecutor in eric adams' case resigned today. trump: i am not involved in that but.. these are mostly people from the previous administration so they were not going to be there anyway. pic.twitter.com/jymkdyex2b— acyn (@acyn) february 14, 2025 that can be true for ausa’s. seldom true for career people. he’s also well informed on foreign policy:
trump: china… i don’t even know that they’re a member of brics pic.twitter.com/937vdsvw4v— acyn (@acyn) february 14, 2025 brics—brics is an intergovernmental organization consisting of ten countries—brazil, russia, india, china, south africa, egypt, ethiopia, indonesia, iran and the united arab emirates. it is considered to be a counterpart and alternative to the g7 bloc of the world's largest economies and combined represent nearly half of the world's population.then again, he thinks nato is a country club (!) to which members pay dues.

fight the future anyway 





 not unexpected.from reuters: career federal prosecutor to sign motion to dismiss adams case after pressure from acting deputy attorney general-sourcesnot really falling on the hand grenade:acting deputy attorney general emil bove assembled doj's remaining public corruption prosecutors this morning and gave them an hour to find someone to sign the eric adams dismissal. 
one of them agreed to do it, to spare the others from potentially being fired. 
https://www.reuters.com/world/us/federal-prosecutor-will-sign-motion-dismiss-adams-charges-bid-save-colleagues-2025-02-14/i spent too much of my adult life involuntarily unemployed (it doesn’t take much to be “too much”), and i would not advocate someone putting themselves in that position for my sense of umbrage or ethics.but it would have been nobler for the roomful of lawyers to just walk out with middle fingers raised. because this is the future of the doj:in 2 years time the average prosecutor will be a liberty university graduate who just got their law license and will spend half their day getting dressed down federal judges. they'll spend the other half of that day yelling at their senators to impeach said judges.from one of the best places to work (civil and criminal), the doj will be one of the worst. it will turn out, the guy who saved their jobs didn’t save them from anything.and we will all suffer for it. it will be the texas ag’s office, on a national scale.more and more i see, in government, that as goes texas, so goes d.c. that is not a good thing. and this is cold comfort:"somehow i doubt that bove’s blunderbuss blundering will put the department of justice in good stead with chief justice roberts, justice kavanaugh, or any other justice," whelan concluded.that’s not going to make the doj anymore effective in bread ‘n’ butter criminal and civil cases.  besides, thomas and alito would probably happily sign off on it. i’m not even sure roberts won’t find some reason to “protect the presidency” again, if only in hopes everyone would finally understand what he meant in trump v u.s.

fire at will 





 which one’s will?doj leadership has put all  public integrity section lawyers into a room with 1 hour to decide who will dismiss adams indictment or else all will be fired. sending them strength to stand by their oath, which is to support the constitution, not the president’s political agenda. 🇺🇸the former lead prosecutor calls the decision to dismiss “clearly pretextual.” and furthermore:"no system of ordered liberty can allow the government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives," he argued. 
he closed his letter [of resignation] by delivering a scathing assessment of the ethics of the lawyers currently serving in the trump administration. 


"any assistant u.s. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way," scotten wrote. "if no lawyer within earshot of the president is willing to give him that advice, then i expected you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward to file your motion. but it was never going to be me."and they still aren’t hiding it (there’s a reason nixon did it on saturday night):
tom homan basically admits to a quid pro quo on fox & friends for dropping the corruption charges against mayor eric adams in exchange for assistance with enforcing donald trump's immigration and mass deportation plan. "if he doesn't come through, i'll be back in new york city and we won't be sitting on the couch. i'll be in his office, up his butt, saying 'where the hell is the agreement we came to?'"

vile. pic.twitter.com/riwkziruhu— art candee 🍿🥤 (@artcandee) february 14, 2025 doj lawyers should go on a mass nationwide strike.maybe that would get somebody’s attention.
this is just sheer brazen criminality by doj. adams gets federal corruption charges dropped not because there isn’t overwhelming evidence, but because he agrees to help homan round up migrants. and homan says the charges will be refiled if adams doesn’t “come through.” https://t.co/hxt7zrw9ao— ron filipkowski (@ronfilipkowski) february 14, 2025 🤦‍♂️ (that’s for me. slapping my forehead because this was so obvious…)well, now i understand why they won’t just give adams a pardon. they need him on a leash. again: duh. 😒 the hits just keep on coming:if pam bondi wants to dismiss the eric adams indictment, she can just do it herself. she is the attorney general, she doesn’t need to have a line prosecutor do it for her. but they want to be able to say a career person did it.professor vladeck shines light in dark corners;on monday, the acting deputy attorney general,1 emil bove, directed the new york federal prosecutors to drop the charges, offering a series of reasons that … fail to persuade. but what was most striking about the first bove memo was footnote 1: 
your office correctly noted in a february 3, 2025 memorandum, "as mr. bove clearly stated to defense counsel during our meeting [on january 31, 2025], the government is not offering to exchange dismissal of a criminal case for adams's assistance on immigration enforcement."
there’s an old twitter meme about how “my ‘not involved in human trafficking’ shirt has people asking a lot of questions already answered by my shirt.” (or, if you prefer, “the lady doth protest too much.”) that was my reaction to this footnote—the need to put in writing that dropping the prosecution was not in exchange for “assistance on immigration enforcement” sure seemed to strongly imply that actually … it was. 
fast forward to a letter sent yesterday to attorney general bondi by danielle sassoon, the interim u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york (i.e., the top federal prosecutor in manhattan).2 sassoon’s letter is … stunning. (and the new york times has helpfully annotated it to provide additional background.) not only did she vigorously defend the decision to indict adams (and the strength of the indictment); she also wrote that, during the meeting that bove’s memo mentioned in footnote 1, adams’s lawyers had indeed “repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that adams would be in a position to assist with the department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed.” 
the letter goes on to methodically pick apart all of the arguments the bove memo made for dropping the case against adams, and requests that bondi reconsider bove’s memo in light of its analysis. as sassoon concluded, “i cannot fulfill my obligations, effectively lead my office in carrying out the department's priorities, or credibly represent the government before the courts, if i seek to dismiss the adams case on this record.” if bondi wouldn’t reconsider, sassoon offered her resignation as interim u.s. attorney. 

that would all have been scandalous enough, but then there’s the eight-page letter bove sent to sassoon today—purporting to accept her resignation (that’s actually the attorney general’s job, but we’ll skip the formalities), and accusing her of “insubordination.” as bove writes, this decision is based on your choice to continue pursuing a politically motivated prosecution despite an express instruction to dismiss the case. you lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the department of justice by suggesting that you retain discretion to interpret the constitution in a manner inconsistent with the policies of a democratically elected president and a senate-confirmed attorney general. 
bove then noted that he’s placing two of the assistant u.s. attorneys who assisted in the adams case on administrative leave, and is transferring the adams case to the justice department’s public integrity section—which, he explained, will seek dismissal of the prosecution under fed. r. crim. p. 48. shortly thereafter, the top lawyer in that section (and the acting head of the criminal division) resigned—followed a few hours later by three other attorneys. in other words, six senior justice department lawyers resigned rather than carry out bove’s directive to drop the adams case. in case you’re scoring at home, that’s twice as many lawyers as were fired/resigned in the original “saturday night massacre.” what’s striking about this is not just how transparent what’s actually happening is; it’s bove’s candid admission, in today’s letter, that “the policies of a democratically elected president and a senate-confirmed attorney general” take precedence over a justice department lawyer’s oath … to the constitution. it would be one thing if bove argued that the president’s (or attorney general’s) interpretation of the constitution takes precedence over that of an interim u.s. attorney. but that’s not even his argument. rather, it’s that sassoon (who, although it shouldn’t matter, is a republican who clerked for justice scalia) had no business raising to the attorney general her view of what the law required in a case in which it conflicts with the political preferences of the president—indeed, that it was “insubordinate” for her to do so. 
so we have what sure as sh*t seems like a quid pro quo on doj’s part (dropping the adams case in exchange for adams using his powers as mayor to assist federal immigration enforcement efforts); a principled, republican doj attorney raising concerns about the whole situation and asking for a meeting with the attorney general; and the acting deputy attorney general describing those efforts as “insubordination” while accepting her resignation—without any word from the attorney general herself. 
there’s still, of course, the matter of actually dismissing the prosecution. the district judge (judge dale ho) may have very little discretion to deny a rule 48 motion to dismiss. but i suspect he’s going to have some choice questions for whoever shows up from doj (and, perhaps, bove himself if he’s summoned) before signing off. in the meantime, this all redounds to the detriment of the justice department’s public reputation—not just for the deal it appears to have made, but for the way it has treated and is treating the lawyers who had enough principles to object. and all of this to twist the arm of one allegedly corrupt mayor into cooperating with immigration enforcement. 
yikes.emphasis added.

everything is connected 





trump: they are not working at home. a lot of them have second jobs. how many of these people are getting checks and working from home but they’re not working because they have second jobs and even third jobs? pic.twitter.com/rwusrzfgz3— acyn (@acyn) february 12, 2025 i knew he got his nonsense from someone:report on musk long enough and you start to see him say the same things over and over. 
he agreed to buy twitter then made sweeping accusations about fraud and bots to try to break the deal. he also accused twitter of harboring "ghost employees" who took paychecks. 
https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/11/us/president-trump-newstrump just found a new puppet master. or just a kindred soul.trump never provides any evidence for his outlandish claims, either. funny how seldom the nyt mentions that.just to state the obvious, trump works at home and unapologetically spends a lot more time on his second job--enriching himself personally--than doing the job he swore to do (faithfully executing the laws of the united states, in case we've forgotten).prob’ly shoulda led with that, huh?🤔

saturday night massacre ii: electric boogaloo 







    acting us attorney for sdny, danielle sassoon, says in her resignation
    letter to attorney general pam bondi that u.s. deputy attorney general, emil
    bove, offered the disgraced nyc mayor eric adams a quid pro quo to drop his
    corruption case in exchange for immigration enforcement…
    pic.twitter.com/iexijkieys

  — art candee 🍿🥤 (@artcandee)
  february 13, 2025

will stancil:
  do people not understand what’s happening with the eric adams thing? the memo
  instructing the prosecution to be dropped explicitly said it was because he
  was carrying out the president’s agenda. it was “you’re working for me, so
  we’re letting you go.” it was an explicitly corrupt bargain

saturday night massacre.
on thursday.

  valor danielle sassoon, acting u.s. attorney for sdny - refuses to drop adams
  charges and resigns 


  john keller, acting head of doj public integrity section - refuses and
  resigns 


  kevin driscoll, acting head of doj criminal division - refuses and resigns

trump’s people
don’t want to do trump’s work.

  as is being noted, the acting heads are not random people. they were selected
  by the trump administration. even they are resigning.

there’s a letter explaining the refusal to dismiss.


the tl;dr:

    in addition to being brave and the right thing to do, sassoon’s letter
    points out that the emperor has no clothes — it demolishes the utterly
    fatuous, transparently corrupt excuses for dismissing the adams case.
  

emil bove wrote back.

comments followed:
    imo bove has gone off his rails (in part bc i think he senses he's losing
    the house). now he's on the record that every doj employee will be subject
    to non-reviewable "weaponization" judgments w/no due process. 
  
that'll have an interesting follow-on effect.  
did he get stupider arguing b4 cannon?lots of comments:
    as you're reading bove's outrageous letter, remember that all the
    representations in there about how unfairly eric adams has been treated come
    from elon musk's personal attorney, alex spiro. bove just blindly
    regurgitated everything that spiro said, while accusing career prosecutors
    of misconduct.
  update: we now know that bove got mad at the line prosecutors for taking notes during his meeting with spiro, and then had separate discussions with spiro without the line prosecutors present. 

totally normal for the #2 doj official to do this, and totally unrelated to a quid pro quo.  george conway: 
  this letter is almost psychotic.
people are being suspended:

    one of the ausas put on administrative leave by this letter is hagan
    scotten, my former hogan lovells colleague. i am not surprised that he would
    risk his job for his convictions; he has some of the strongest personal
    integrity of anyone i've worked with.
  
saturday night nassacre ii: electric boogaloo.

    in the modern history of the justice dept., there has never been such a
    thug-like, ruthless perversion of the rule of law to serve political
    interests. kudos to the prosecutors who stood tall, faithfully fulfilled
    their oath to the constitution, and refused to bucklethe original had knock on effects i didn’t expect at the time. (even then i was cynical. 🤨) history is repeating itself. why shouldn’t it go all the way?i don’t think much of elie honig usually, but he’s right this time: “we thought maybe it would be a pardon for months now," honig continued. "i will tell you in the sdny circles that i sort of dwell in, people have been rolling their eyes at this for a long time, saying, oh, he's definitely going to get out of this somehow. he'll get a pardon. but the way this all happened makes it even worse. the fact that emil bove instructed sdny to do it. and by the way, when danielle sassoon refused to do it — and you're right, by the way, to note that she's a conservative. not only was she a federalist society member, she penned an op-ed against joe biden a few weeks ago, just sort of gratuitously criticizing joe biden's pardons." 
"but when bove told her to do this, to dismiss the case, and when danielle sassoon refused, this part is really chilling to me, emil bove then fired back with a letter ... that said, fine, everyone around you is going to be put on administrative leave too, and now we're going to investigate you not criminally, but through our inspector general, which is the in-house ethics watchdog," said honig. "so that is sending an unmistakable and, i think, chilling message, which is get on board with the political agenda here or be punished." 

"and it's amazing because she was prosecuting an allegedly corrupt democrat who is kissing up to trump," added tapper. "it's really remarkable. you couldn't write this. if you put this in a screenplay, people would be like, that's too broad, that would never happen."

you have to be this stupid to work for trump





kevin hassett, economic adviser to donald trump:it's just false that it's necessarily bad for consumers," hassett asserted. "and a way to think about it is imagine right now we did the estimate that last year. u.s. companies, u.s.-based companies paid foreign governments $370 billion in taxes. meanwhile, foreign companies paid the u.s. $57 billion in taxes. so, we mailed foreign governments $370 billion in taxes. and those taxes are being paid for by us citizens. and so if you think that that asymmetry is something that could be addressed and improved upon, and if we did that, it would be good for us citizens." he continued, "is it good for us citizens to mail $370 billion to them, while they're sending $57 billion to us? and are we supposed to keep doing that because of some economic model that doesn't have the whole real world in it, that says that we're better off because of inflation if we keep sending $370 billion to foreign governments? it just doesn't make sense. and so if you'd like, we could go to the blackboard and talk about the economic modeling and the elasticity of supply versus demand and all that stuff. but i usually save that for ali velshi."u.s. based companies like apple or tesla do business in foreign countries the same way those countries have companies doing business here. all such companies are subject to taxation in other countries. so nobody is “mailing” money from america to foreign lands. those companies are incurring the cost of doing business overseas, just as they do here.and “foreign countries” in his example covers a lot more real estate than the single country of america, so it’s no surprise taxes here (assuming arguendo he’s not just pulling numbers out of his ass, like trump or musk or anybody in the current administration) don’t aggregate to the same amount as taxes from almost all the other countries in the world.taxes and tariffs have nothing in common. taxes are the cost of having a government to supply a stable economy and currency and banking system and laws for commerce and contract , and generally to make doing business possible. tariffs are trade barriers to protect domestic markets that worked so well in the 19th century that the century, in this country at least, was almost an endless cycle of economic disasters and major recessions, the likes of which would prompt civil unrest in the 21st century. as they did in the 19th and early 20th. one of the major concerns in the early years of the great depression was that a violent overthrow of the government and the economic system was a distinct possibility. and tariffs were one of the many causes of that recession.and this guy is an economist? allegedly. is he really this stupid, or does he play this dumb for trump? all i can say is, when you think you’re smarter than all the other experts on the planet, it’s a sure sign you don’t have a clue.

a babbling baboon is our potus (o canada version)





trump: "canada has been very bad to us on trade, but now canada is gonna have to start paying up ... they think we're gonna protect them, with our military, which is unfair. canada is gonna be a very interesting situation because we just don't need their product ... canada is… pic.twitter.com/vuy0gtodac— aaron rupar (@atrupar) february 13, 2025 “nice country you have there. be a shame if anything were to happen to it.”trump on canada: "i spoke to governor trudeau ... they don't have military protection, and you take a look at what's going on out there ... people are in danger ... they need our protection." pic.twitter.com/mdlj4zje2s— aaron rupar (@atrupar) february 13, 2025 canada is part of nato.
trump: canada is just about the lowest payer in nato in addition to everything else. canada has really been taking advantage of. if they had to pay just something modestly fair, they wouldn't be able to succeed as a country. that's why i feel they have to become a state. pic.twitter.com/lygg5ig7ao— acyn (@acyn) february 13, 2025 i would happily bet all i have trump can’t accurately state what canada pays, or what the budget of nato is. he doesn’t even know what the u.s. pays. but u.s. foreign policy is not a protection racket.and grandpa shoutypants is starting to sound like a dementia patient with this “canada must be a state” nonsense. if he were talking about a woman, we’d call it “stalking.”funny he doesn’t want mexico to be a state. it’s contiguous, too. maybe too many brown people?meanwhile…president musk meets with indian pm modi. pic.twitter.com/uvyxogxbjn— ron filipkowski (@ronfilipkowski) february 13, 2025 musk even sits like trump. must be a narcissist affect.

🍒 💣 





trump: they are not working at home. a lot of them have second jobs. how many of these people are getting checks and working from home but they’re not working because they have second jobs and even third jobs? pic.twitter.com/rwusrzfgz3— acyn (@acyn) february 12, 2025 "working from home" means you are working on a computer, where even your keystrokes are recorded. if no work is being done, a supervisor should know it immediately; or at least shortly.trump is as ignorant as a stump, and happily so.  “how many of these people are getting checks and working from home but they’re not working because they have second jobs and even third jobs?” isn’t it your obligation as president to nail that number down? find out exactly who, if anyone, is doing this (if it’s being done?)? there are procedures for this. but trump just alleges this as an excuse to eliminate the department of education, a department created by law and which he can no more eliminate than he can dissolve congress and declare himself a monarch. he can’t be bothered with process. he’s been the boss all his life, his every decision law. why should it be different now?
trump: "when you're looking for fraud, you're look at items. hundreds of items. and you'll find one or two, maybe, if you're lucky. here's something where you look at they're all fraudulent. you know just by looking at the topic. they're all fraudulent." pic.twitter.com/pw0usxl4ha— aaron rupar (@atrupar) february 12, 2025 “they’re all fraudulent” because he says so. that’s enough, isn’t it? judge, jury, executioner. who needs a legal process?
trump on federal spending: "i say it in front of our attorney general -- there's no chance that there's not kickbacks or something going on." pic.twitter.com/rngkjycdkv— aaron rupar (@atrupar) february 12, 2025 
we sure don' need no steenkin’ evidence!
pressed to provide evidence of fraud that musk has discovered, leavitt waves around "screenshots of contracts" that go "against the president's policies" (going against trump's policies is not fraud) pic.twitter.com/g3wi4a0eyb— aaron rupar (@atrupar) february 12, 2025 
joe mccarthy had a list of communists in the state department. he never showed it to anyone. and contracts are legally binding unless set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction providing due process of law and equal protection to all parties to the contract. trump prefers to eliminate both and declare the courts unconstitutional. again: the potus has no such power.
trump: "like on tractors that can handle anything from hurricanes to lightning to anything. they use magnets. it's a new theory -- magnets. they're gonna lift the planes up. and it doesn't work." pic.twitter.com/j06rxnwku8— aaron rupar (@atrupar) february 12, 2025 
what the actual fuck?and the cherry on the shit sundae:trump got a little caught up talking about himself again and forgot to swear in tulsi gabbard at tulsi gabbard’s swearing in ceremony. https://t.co/sqcmvz8pde— ron filipkowski (@ronfilipkowski) february 13, 2025 of course he did.

the politics of doge





 mark cuban has the right ideas:it's not about lobbyists.   it's about the politicians on this platform deciding to neuter doge by doing a better version of what doge wants  to do.  legislatively. the issue isn't the goal of efficiency and savings.  that's important.  

the issue is the process to get there.also, too, as well:imagine if  @aoc @sanders.senate.gov , every dem, simultaneously held town halls where they allowed grant and contract recipients to explain to the country what it is they do and why it's important invite all media. including rw podcasters. @spaces   flood the zone 
call it a day of transparency   
let there be unlimited q&a.   if the recipients are in red areas, have it there.   those local republicans would have to respond.or we could follow this guy’s lead:
casar: "you know what elon musk doesn't seem to be looking into? his own contracts ... we're not looking into elon musk's $8m a day. this subcommittee chaired by marjorie taylor greene and the house republicans is looking into your grandmother's $65 a day." pic.twitter.com/u0sekgjqe8— aaron rupar (@atrupar) february 12, 2025 one guy gets $8 million a day, but he’s upset that grandma gets $65 a day. pretty easy to understand in those terms.

rage against the machine truck 





 i am not condoning threats. but i do want to see elmo spin this as a positive for tesla:dr. kumait jaroje said someone put a profane sticker on his gold cybertruck back on february 7 in worcester. when he posted a photo of it on social media he told police he started getting threats online. jaroje said the hate is having an impact on his family and his business, so he filed a report with worcester police. they are now investigating the threats. 


"anxious and nervous about our safety and my kids' safety as well," jaroje told wbz-tv tuesday. his wife found the sticker friday morning. 
"she was horrified. she was, like, crying, screaming out of her throat, 'i will never drive that cybertruck anymore,'" jaroje said. 
when he posted what happened on social media, jaroje said even more hate and debate flooded his page. he told wbz the harassment started after tesla ceo elon musk endorsed president donald trump. musk is now the head of the president's department of government efficiency (doge).

threats are reprehensible. but then, so is tesla:jaroje was so worried he tried to trade in the cybertruck, but with no luck. he said he received a call and a text from a tesla representative saying the company can't take the truck back, even after sending them the hateful sticker. 
"he confirmed with the text message that tesla is not accepting cybertruck trade-ins at this moment," jaroje said. he hopes the community will set aside judgment and be open to differences.the doctor is right:"it's not just about what happened to me. it's about everyone in this country. if you disagree, don't retaliate. don't be violent. don't try to hurt your neighbor. we're all human," he told wbz.but i had no idea the tesla brand was so toxic. i’ve seen cybertrucks and thought they were stupid cars. but then, i feel that way about raised four wheel drive pickups with cast iron bumpers and shiny mudflaps and ornately off-road tires that…never leave the road or get within ten miles of a ranch or a farm. i don’t run either on of them off the road so i can flip off the driver (the owner of the cybertruck says that happened to him). at this point i’d say musk is about as popular as cancer. (which means alyssa farrah griffin’s analysis of musk in the oval office presser is right: trump was letting the unpopular musk be the heat shield, the person responsible for what people don’t like about what trump is doing.)no wonder tesla stock is tanking. i’m not sure a boycott is needed to express rage at musk. pretty sure that rage is already being communicated. (also pretty sure musk is about to tank, and trump is pushing him out of the airplane.)

i’m not a mathematician or anything, but it seems like this adds up to republicans dramatically increasing the deficit while the wealthy pay a lot less in taxes. no wonder trump wanted to eliminate the debt ceiling during his presidency. pic.twitter.com/xuiquo7cct— ron filipkowski (@ronfilipkowski) february 12, 2025 
 75% of federal spending (according to the secretary of the treasury) goes to 5 areas, in descending order:social security defense healthnet interest medicare the rest is about $1 trillion of the $6.75 trillion in federal spending; income security; veterans benefits; education and training; natural resources; transportation; “other.”so what do we cut? transportation? (no more air traffic controllers? no ntsb to investigate accidents? no more highway funding?) va? natural resources (abandon all the national parks and public lands? what, then, of “drill, baby, drill”?) eliminate every bit of it, and you still don’t hit $1.5 trillion. so, what, the interest? default on government bonds? how ‘bout public health? cutting that would be popular.iirc, social security is part of government spending, but not of the budget, as it is funded by the social security tax, independent of any other government income. so that really can’t be part of the budget reduction. although the house still might want to claim it as part of the spending reduction (see clay higgins, below). yeah, that’ll happen.back, then, to the six categories and the other $500 billion. cut it from defense? fat chance. medicare? they don’t call it the third rail for nothing. i can’t be sure,  but i don’t see how agriculture subsidies fit into one of the five categories. that means those have to be eliminated, along with the entire department of agriculture, just to get to $1 trillion. i don’t see that working, anymore than i see katie britt voting to eliminate health research funding (which i assume would have to come out of “health”).in other words, i don’t see this house budget plan surviving its first encounter with reality. and the republicans will, as ron says, end up doing what they always do: increasing the deficit. while making the rich richer, richer.in the meantime, speaker johnson needs all the votes he can get:clay higgins is pissed off at mike johnson tonight. pic.twitter.com/9peelekyoh— ron filipkowski (@ronfilipkowski) february 12, 2025 🍿**yes, i’m aware higgins thinks $1.5 trillion is not a big enough cut. that just means johnson can’t get there from here. or johnson saw higgins’ post and  accommodated him. but $1.5 trillion is certain to lose gop senators, as well as some gop house members, whether or not it keeps higgins. 😈

if you ain’t hirin’ white, you ain’t doin’ it right 





 the gop hangs out the “whites only” sign:in the lawsuit filed tuesday in federal court, missouri attorney general andrew bailey accused the international coffee chain of violating federal and state laws prohibiting race discrimination. bailey said in a news release that he was filing the suit “to halt this blatant violation of the missouri human rights act in its tracks.” “starbucks’ commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (dei) is mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination,” bailey wrote in the 59-page lawsuit that leans on employment data from 2020 to 2024. 

he added: “in other words, since 2020, starbucks’s workforce has become more female and less white.” 
bailey is asking the court for an order compelling starbucks to immediately stop what he said amounts to “discriminatory patterns and practices.” 


“with starbucks’ discriminatory patterns, practices, and policies, missouri’s consumers are required to pay higher prices and wait longer for goods and services that could be provided for less had starbucks employed the most qualified workers, regardless of their race, color, sex, or national origin," bailey concluded in his complaint.

only white males in missouri can perform the complex physical task of pulling an espresso shot and of steaming milk, and the intellectually challenging task of getting the right coffee into the right cup.points for implicitly referencing the commerce clause (in a vain attempt to establish an injury that would give the court jurisdiction. it’s not really a commerce clause claim (no interstate commerce issue is raised), but the civil rights act of 1964 is based on discrimination impacting interstate commerce. it’s neither accidental nor mercenary capitalism. the congress was worried about the courts repealing it if it was based on human rights (which the congress is not explicitly authorized to regulate. yes, it is an argument for amending fundamental portions of the constitution, putting it more in the service of persons rather than mercantilism. no, that’s not going to happen.)it’s not even a lawsuit. it’s a stephen miller set of talking points with a thinly veiled racist and sexist (a two-fer!) claim for damages that should get the complaint tossed instanter on the grounds racism in the law is a pernicious category, and the only way to grant this claim is to legally enforce racism. making a judgment on this claim itself a violation of law.you see the problem.i’m no fan of starbucks, but they shouldn’t have to spend money defending a claim like this, especially from a government agency. although i would enjoy the missouri ag trying to present evidence to refute this:starbucks pushed back and defended its hiring practices. 

“we disagree with the attorney general and these allegations are inaccurate,” starbucks said in a statement to fox 2 st. louis. “we are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful. our hiring practices are inclusive, fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.”i mean, what does missouri do when their allegations come down to: “trust us, your honor! white men could do it better! and that needs to be the position of the law! any other result is discriminatory!”yeah, that’ll undermine the civil rights act. which goal is the only explanation i have for what they’re going for here.next: costco’s prices would go lower if they hired only white men

elmo’s statements need to be corrected 





the fed is absurdly overstaffed— elon musk (@elonmusk) december 23, 2024 twitter is crashing in part because elmo fired so many employees. and a) according to a report in bloomberg, the federal reserve board in washington and 12 regional reserve banks across the us employed about 24,000 people last year — significantly less than comparable institutions. in the eurosystem, which comprises the european central bank and the region’s 20 national peers, the central banks of germany, france and italy together had more people on their payrolls.

not enough? then:b) "what jerome powell said was fed employees are overworked and the agency is not overstaffed," said tapper. "and then he explained that the fed is primarily self-funded through the interest it earns. in other words, cost-cutting measures such as laying off employees would ultimately not save taxpayers much money. so these are not the $2 trillion you are looking for. and all you’d really do is crash the economy.

"there are a bunch of reasons why the fed is potentially in trump's crosshairs, and really don't want to be. they want to be politically independent," rampell continued. "they have historically been politically independent. and that independence is crucial to their ability to continue to do their job, i.e., to get inflation down. and just to remind people, inflation has come down quite a lot in the past few years. it's not where it needs to be, certainly, but the fact that we have made as much progress as we have without tipping into recession, as many economists feared, is largely a credit to the federal reserve and its ongoing independence." 

"so picking a fight here, whether elon musk is doing it or trump is doing it, will end quite badly for the economy writ large," rampell concluded.ignorance may be bliss, but it’s still ignorance.
