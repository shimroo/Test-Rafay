living truth, beauty, and goodness

we always come back to this point, to square one. it's about your heart, your intention, and your journey. you each have different life experiences, different ways that you've thought about things. this lineage is about serving your aspiration to be fully alive, to fully align yourself with authenticity.- patrick sweeney, trim√© lhawang
