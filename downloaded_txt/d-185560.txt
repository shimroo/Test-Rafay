				they took the warthog with them on a strange and wonderful 
				journey to razzmatazzmania to find out! you know razzmatazzmania---it's 
				past the w.c. fields, under the lloyd bridges, and beyond the 
				veronica lake.

rense columns:

this is who we are



                                                                      
				july 8, 2022
				excerpt:
				mental illness? this country is a stinky, heavily tattooed 
				recluse hiding in the basement, staring fish-eyed at a computer 
				screen, scratching his or her billions-served belly, farting 
				through old underpants, swilling diet pepsi and canned 
				cocktails, masturbating to porn that would have disgusted 
				caligula, ar-15 close by to deal with deep state stormtroopers, 
				heathens, minorities, women, gays, nancy pelosi. either that or 
				throwing asinine, sanctimonious pink pussy hat weekend parties 
				in the streets, carrying impotent signs about repignicuns and 
				regulate dicks, conflating lascivious sexual behavior with 
				rights and liberation, turning every issue into identity 
				politics, and diversity and "inclusion" into code words for 
				quota systems and discrimination worthy of the china cultural 
				revolution. 






the karen vs. caruso


                                                
oct. 25, 2022
 excerpt: bass thrives on the make-nice 
				consensus building partnering coalition-making 
				bureaucratic no-mans-land lingo on which most government 
				inefficiency, stagnation, constipation, is built. remember, this 
				is a person who said she would need two mayoral terms to have 
				any impact on the cataclysmic problem of homelessness in l.a.. 
				talk about a ploy. talk about setting your sights low.

new!
				









the 
				long-awaited sequel to ltsewh! you read them in the awful 
				l.a. times, san francisco chronicle, airline magazines, even 
				this website! you even bought the original ltsewh book! now, 
				fifteen years later, here it is---this time spectacularly laden 
				with profanity!---less than satisfying encounters with humanity 
				ii! inane and insane encounters as only rense can experience, 
				and relate. the decline and fall of civility---including the 
				author's---in this, the horrific 21st century! three hundred and 
				twenty pages' worth! illustrated by rense himself! (well, 
				everybody's got to have a hobby. . .)
