i’m a queer neurodivergent mom, childbirth educator, doula, patient advocate, bellydancer, tiny home builder, event producer, food forest gardener, herbalist, animal lover with our dog, cat, and goat family members. i have ehlers-danlos syndrome, dysautonomia, mast cell activation syndrome, diagnosed after decades of searching in 2016, and suffered from long covid on top of frozen shoulder in the early 2020s.each aspect of my life in which i received amazing support inspired me to support others, from gardening, to self advocacy, to learning dance and more. i personally had a great childbirth education class and birth doula for the birth of my child and i can’t imagine what my life might have been like without that support. the diagnosis for my disability finally came when i found community to share experiences with.  i want to ensure others feel just as supported in their choices as i did. i’m here for you no matter what aspect you need support in, let’s do this!




hello fellow weirdos!feel like the odd person out with your ideas about how you want your birth to go? struggling to put into words what is going on with your body so that docs don’t think you are weird? tired of being gaslighted at medical appointments because you don’t fit into a standard diagnosis?i specialize in people that don’t fit the regular mold either because of bodily autonomy choices, disability, trauma, queerness, intersectional position in society…or all or some of those all together.as a fellow weirdo i specialize in ways that people with unique needs get those needs met in a trauma informed way.

“i would classify the things i learned in this class as “things i didn’t know i didn’t know, but am so glad that i do now.” ~hillary s. 2nd time parent













“i am so grateful i had ziah during my pregnancy and labor - she presented so much great information and resources to inform the decisions i was going to make about my birthing plan. ziah was amazing support during the birth and i couldn’t have imagined it without her! she will be your best advocate and create so much comfort in your space.”— chelsea c.

masked care worker

i mask full time in public to protect my health because i am such an active person. i build tiny houses, tend a food forest, and teach dance…on top of my advocacy and doula work. i value my active lifestyle which was impacted when i had long covid back in 2021. i know finding community and health care workers that mask isn’t always easy, i can help find support if that is something you need.
