welcome 
              pit bull fanciers









we
               would like to take this opportunity to say thanks to mac bur who
                runs the  american
                 pit bull terrier faq  
            for the copy of the photo above, and for the most comprehensive faq 
            to be found on the net today concerning this great breed.


we
                 are the longest established site on the net that is solely dedicated
                
            to the game bred american pit bull terrier, and we are still
            offering you the largest information resource on the net today
            that deals exclusively with the game bred american pit bull
            terrier. 
            hundreds of sites have come and gone over the years, but no site
             has been as dedicated to this breed as we have.


we
               are also home to the the journal magazine. the journal 
            is the #1 magazine that is solely dedicated to the game bred
             american pit bull terrier. visit the journal web site for
             more  information, and ordering details here: the
              journal.


we 
            also support the efforts of some of the finer pit bull rescue 
            groups in trying to place this breed, and those that are working hard 
            against breed specific legislation (bsl) that specifically
            targets the american pit bull terrier. this is a world problem, not
            just a local problem, and we encourage all our visitors to speak
            up
            against this type of discrimination based solely on a well marketed
            campaign of fear of this breed. try to educate your local spca on
            the positive nature of the american pit bull terrier, and hold the
            media accountable for their poor reporting practices, that have only
            served to line their pockets. the name pit bull is a generic 
            term used by most media outlets to profit from inaccurate reporting. 
            it's a buzz word in their industry. they are the true exploiters of 
            this breed, and all for the sake of profit.
