land acknowledgement
the history center in tompkins county and all of our programs occur on the traditional and contemporary lands of the gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ ˀ nation (cayuga), one of the six nations of the haudenosaunee confederacy (sometimes called the iroquois confederacy). it is important for each of us to understand the long-standing history that has brought us to reside on this land and to seek to understand our place within that history, including the history of forced relocation and disenfranchisement experienced by the gayogo̱hó꞉nǫˀ (cayuga) who remain a sovereign nation and continue the stewardship of their traditional lands to this day.
