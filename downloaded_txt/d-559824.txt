                                    stages, using a small loom and a spinning wheel and the "linus blanket" project. stay tuned for more information and keep turning in your dino's slips.

west of the seven mile linea history of glocester (episode 1)
                                        now available on dvd
three years in the making, this documentary covers over 300 years of history and tells the story of the native people and early settlers. it describes 
                                        the area when it was just a wild land called the outlands or the land "west of the seven mile line" and how it evolved into a thriving center of 
                                        commerce when the great country road was built (rt. 44). it shows how the people were affected during the revolutionary war and how the eyes 
                                        of the world were on chepachet during the dorr rebellion. it also takes an in-depth tour through the villages of glocester. written and produced by betty and carlo mencucci, log cabin studios.
