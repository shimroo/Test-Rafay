                                 sauna – the relaxing ritual with
											healthful benefits
       the benefits of a sauna 
the main benefit of sauna is that it opens the pores
												and flushes out the body’s toxins and
												impurities. it is the deepest cleaning bath in the
												world. the sauna soothes and relaxes tired muscles,
												helps maintain clear, healthy skin, provides a
												cardiovascular workout, burns as many as 300
												calories in a session, increases metabolic rate and
												improves circulation.  sauna – why it is so beneficial to your
													body   sauna – how to really enjoy it       
sauna – a healthy ritual
 
saunas are relatively new in the united states.
												early finnish and swedish colonists made their own
												saunas right from the start of this country but
												sauna usage did not grow much beyond those
												immigrants until the late 1950’s and
												’60’s. whether early finns knew it or
												not they had discovered a very healthy ritual.
												saunas were rediscovered in america for their
												relaxation and many health benefits.  sauna history
