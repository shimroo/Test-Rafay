this is what we dowhat clients say

 

“michael, with twiddy realty helped me buy my condo and he was fabulous! he was very knowledgeable of the different areas that offered what i was looking for and was extremely patient with me in finding exactly what i was looking for. he also was very helpful with the entire search, purchase and closing. i felt like i had someone by my side for the entire process. highly recommended!”— alexandra brooks  i  buyer

 

i wouldn't recommend anyone else for renting or buying in new town.— charlene yackanich  i  renter

 

“mike does a great job taking care of his customers”— brendon mooney

 

“i worked with michael youngblood jr on finding the right property in williamsburg. he was patient, knowledgeable and very helpful throughout the entire process. he found just what i was looking for at a great price. they made buying a house a smooth, easy and fun process. working with twiddy realty was a great experience and i strongly recommend this company!”— sam wallace  i  buyer



we’ve been working with twiddy realty (new town) for one year now and they’ve been exceptional. they are williamsburg locals who know the ins and outs of williamsburg. their local insights were very beneficial to us in both renting and buying a home. initially, we found and rented a townhome through nancy leach. we completed the transaction from another city, but nancy knew what we were looking for and kindly and professionally helped us to navigate the rental process from a distance. next, christian leach completed the initial walkthrough and also successfully managed our rental. christian was always very professional, courteous, and responsive if anything came up. nancy and christian made renting from twiddy a breeze. finally, we recently bought a home with amber spivey. amber is truly the kindest and most genuine realtor with which we’ve had the pleasure of working. this is our 5th home purchase so that’s saying a lot. amber’s sincerity and professionalism set her apart. we feel so fortunate that we received a recommendation to call amber. she was perfect throughout the entire arduous home search/buying process. amber hustled and was in constant communication with us over many months. she always devoted 110% and found us our dream home! we are very grateful for her commitment to us. best wishes to you on your home search!— cjl   i   renter & buyer

 

“after having a terrible experience with another rental/property management company in town, we turned to twiddy realty and i wish we had come to them first! we were able to tour the rental property, apply and have our applications reviewed/accepted, and sign the lease within a week or so. nancy was wonderful throughout the entire process, always available to answer any questions. now we wouldn't rent through anybody else!”— stephanie lauterbach  i  renter

 

“my husband and i moved to the new town area about 2 months ago now, and we have loved living here. the area is extremely safe, calm, and inviting. we rent a property managed by twiddy realty, and they have been great: all of our lease/misc. questions and concerns were answered promptly and always with respect prior to move-in, our move-in walk through was reassuring, agreeing on a pet addendum when we adopted our new dog went smoothly, and every maintenance request has been dealt with quickly and effectively. so far, twiddy realty has been very good to us!”— amy hughes  i  renter
