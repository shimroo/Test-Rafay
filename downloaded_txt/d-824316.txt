lately i can't stop thinking about you.   it's been 5 and a half years since i woke up beside you, and it's not gotten easier.  every day is a new struggle.  my food has no flavor.  the world has no color, and though it pains me to admit it, the will to continue is leaving me.  i've searched for every trivial reason that i could reach out to you, and none of them actually overcome the plain old fear i have of texting you and being left on read, again.and the worst part of it is that i've done all the things that normally work.  fuck someone else.  date someone else.  throw myself at a hobby.  throw myself at therapy.  advance my career.  complete my degree.  i've searched high and low, all the good and the bad in the world, and i've found nothing that replaces you.  yesterday i went back to our place.  it was new years eve, and i was alone.  it was a warm night, 50 degrees, raining, hard.  there was some fog on the water.  i was wearing my ecko hoodie, the one you always hated.   i walked in the rain, got soaked through.  i didn't care.  i didn't feel it.   i crossed over the bridge and walked to the spot where you first told me that you didn't want me to leave.... the picnic tables are gone now.   the swingsets are all broken.  there's cameras setup all over the park now with night-vision, i use the same ones at home.  i was so numb.when i was walking back over the bridge i noticed that the water was still frozen over from the abnormally cold weekend we had, and i remembered that one time, taking pictures of you on the bridge.  you might've been 19 or 20, the water was iced over, and you looked amazing.   it was at that moment that my brain realized the tragedy of the entire moment.   it's not that we'll never be together again, or love again, or have sex again.  it's that i'll never make memories like that with you again.  i think that's what i miss the most.  not just the person i wanted to marry, but my best friend.   i've cut ties to basically everyone and everything in this world at this point, since none of it nourishes me.  i'm surviving off of empty calories.  so yeah, be well i guess.  you'll always be fluff in my memories, even if that person has long since been replaced by the person you've become.   to quote nine inch nails on this one: "you are someone else, i am still right here."stay well, six-shooter.

i missed you so fucking much.i can finally breathe -- but i think to myself of the old nin line that i'd whisper into your ear."without you,without you everything falls apart,without you,it's not as much fun to pick up the pieces"--perfect drug.

"also... i know you. in a few weeks you'll be fucking other girls, tons of them, and forgetting that i exist. i'm not sticking around to watch that."i fucking wish you were right.i've found my shoes parked at the end of more beds than i can count in the 2 years since i last felt your skin.  i've fucked, sucked, kissed, licked, and bit nearly every girl that's come across my path that was willing.  i've tried so fucking hard to forget you.  i have tried to bury my feelings and kill off the emotions i have for you, but much like the curses you said to me -- you lingered.  every single fucking morning i wake up, missing the smell -- black opium mixed with whatever you smelled like 12 hours after your before-bed shower. missing your smile when you realized you woke up next to me again.  i've never struggled to let go of anything, this time i'm choking, gasping for air and you're the bone lodged sideways in my throat, while simultaneously sucking the air from my lungs.  "time heals even the deepest wounds", i said that shit when i was younger; platitudes, because sometimes, wounds fester."the only thing you're even slightly right about is that i miss the way things were. i miss the person i thought you were. and i love the person i thought you could be. but i don't love the person you actually are. i don't want to be with you. and i will never trust you."i miss the person you thought i was too.   i chased down the feelings that you inspired with me to dark places.  dimly lit rooms; or hotels, with girls whose names i scarcely knew -- because there was no tomorrow for them.  or me.   much like a day moth i buried that person at the end of the night.  nameless, faceless, hurting and just trying so fucking hard to remember what it was to fucking feel at all.  no matter how much fucking time passes, it doesn't get any better; i relive the thoughts of you in my arms and dream of you coming home one more fucking time; dreaming of one more chance.  i'd drop everything.... but life doesn't work that way."i just wanted to love you and spend my life with you. i was ready to give up anything for that. and you weren't."i'm trapped thinking about this.  like a bad song on repeat-1, you loop through my head endlessly.  i stop and wonder if you ever think of me -- and how?  i wish i could forgive myself for how this shit went; so i could wish the best for you selflessly.but i'm a selfish liar.  i've fucked up and now i'm alone; and i'm not sure that i'll ever be truly "with" someone ever again.i'm positive that you've moved on, forgotten all about me, fucked someone else, and given up everything that we had -- or maybe you buried it.  maybe you killed off all the emotion; who knows how you killed off all those memories...i tried.  i tried so fucking hard.i'm still an addict.  i'm still fucked up.  i'm still bleeding so many pints and quarts and gallons of blood onto the floor; grasping with my fingers to pick it all up to give to you as consciousness fades to black-- asking "is this enough to make you love me again" as i offer you my insides.  "please take it, i have no use for it".  my beating heart spills more blood onto the ground. what a fucking mess. what a fucking mess."i've lost my best friend, my home, and the guy i thought i was going to marry."i still have no best friend.i still have nowhere that feels like home.i'm still single.nobody can replace who you are, how you made me feel, or the emotions you stirred in me."i truly don't want to see you."and you haven't, and you won't.  never again.  but maybe in some alternate universe we figured this out.  or maybe i died when i overdosed.  i'd rather have died a hero in your eyes than live long enough to become your villain.

i thought about something today and it made my blood run a bit cold.  a normal thought ran through my mind.  suicide.  no longer existing.  exiting this world. i imagined slicing through the veins in my wrist and writing "i'm so fucking sorry" on the wall in my blood before everything faded away.  i wondered about if they would know who it was to.  and if they found you would you care?  then i thought about what you'd say, perhaps out of being polite or perhaps out of obligation "i wish he'd reached out" you would say.   because you don't want me dead.  but you also don't want to talk to me under any circumstances if i'm alive.  so what if you were the only person who could save me from myself?  should i call or shouldn't i?  would you care or would you push me off my ledge? how can i be in this paradoxical state where you'd care about me if i was gone.  why would you feel responsible and wish you did more, but wish for even less now...i miss you every fucking day, and i regret each passing day without you.   some days it's too much to bear.  if you knew how dark things were and understood the truth of my situation now... you'd either run to me, or run from me.  i can't figure out which.  i don't want to know.

back to the pad again,empty hands and empty mind,empty hear and empty soulempty since you left my life.searching for the words that will make sense of my paini search in my mind, deep, broad... it doesn't matternothing that comes to mind makes this any better.there's no words to fix this.i died on the day that you left.i died every time you said something awful to me.i died every time you told me that you fucking hated me.i died because i deserved everything you said.couldn't let it go.couldn't let you go.couldn't get past it all.and you threw it all away.i was wrong:wrong about youwrong about mewrong about uswrong about happiness.i'm deeply damageddeeply and profoundly broken.i wish i could be something complete for youi wish like hell that i could be someone that mattered againi wish i could see you smile    the way your lips would curl up at the edges    how you'd smile when you were really happy    when you'd laugh at my insanity    i was crazy, but it was crazy in love.i wish i could wake up next to you    the warm sunlight hugging you as you slept    you were my angeli wish i could feel your arms around me    my problems faded away    mind was sweet oblivion    you were always warm.. alwaysi wish i could lay next to you again    just one more time.    and listen to you breathe.    wake you up with sweet nothings    bring you food to wake you on a weekendthere's only 2 tragedies in life, not getting what you wantand getting it.i got you.

we're breaking up.  


dear blake,this is going to be a lot.  this is going to be a mess.i know that this post will never reach your eyes, but it's time i told you that i can't love you anymore.  you may think that i'm losing my mind, and i might agree with you.  we broke up 9 months ago, give or take a few days.  since then i've hardly gone a few minutes without thinking about you.  there's not a day that goes by where i don't silently wish that things could / would be different.  there's not a day that goes by where i don't stop to think about how much i fucking miss you.  there isn't a day that goes by where i don't think about how i'd rather be without anything else other than you.  that i'd trade everything to have you back.  my living, my career, my mind, my money... nothing matters without you here. everything i build, every relationship i cultivate and every conversation i hold feels so fucking hollow.  i've held on to the idea in my head that someday we'd be back together.  i kept the mr/mrs coffee mugs, in case you came back.  i know my problems and my shortcomings, and i can hardly count them all... and but despite those i fell on my sword repeatedly so you could have some modicum of relief in the chaos that i unleashed upon us.you have shown me absolutely no fucking quarter.  you've given me no rest.  you've brought 2 cases against me, made me lose my job, and told anyone that would listen that you're afraid of what i would do, when you know damn well that i'd sooner harm myself than you.  your indifference or malignancy has caused me anguish and suffering that will take me years to shake...and yet every time i come home, i remember how it felt differently when you were here.  i recall your smiling face.  it kills me to think that i may never see you again in person.  serendipity brought us together, all the way up until the end...even on the night when i told you i wanted to talk i just happened to see your red coat slipping into the darkness of kilby street on my way back from a tinder date.  nobody looked like you.  nobody filled the hole that you left in my heart.  nobody could.  there's a million things i regret about our friendship / relationship that i'd do anything to fix.  i'm so fucking sorry for all of it.  i try to fix everything...and i couldn't keep up with myself.  i fell into a trap and i hurt both of us... we were so close to figuring things out.  but now we never will, and i need to walk away from this and stop hurting myself.  i need to put some miles between myself and the road that lead me here so i can stop ripping off these scabs.  i need to take care of myself and build myself into the person i'm capable of being and i cannot do that with you in my life.  we had so many good fucking memories.  i look back at them all the fucking time.  the videos we sent to one another.  the insane things we'd do to get the other one to laugh...the love in each others eyes and voices--there isn't even words for it.  the way you'd look at me like you wanted me to always be with you and never leave.  i remember how you touched me, how you held me, and how you made my life better in every measurable way.  i was cocky... and didn't appreciate you for what you are.  i took for granted the most important thing i had, and i have to live with that... but i have memories... and i believe that even with all the horrible shit that came after -- on both of our parts... it was worth it.  in 32 years i felt more emotion in the time i knew you than the rest of my life combined, and then some.  i think i've cried about ~8 times in my adult life, and of those 6 were when i was with you, and once was because of you while i was with someone else after the fact.  there's too many things to talk about without posting pictures of them here.... and there's a lot of them.hey blake, remember that time i flooded the kitchen to get you to laugh?or that time when we went to the zoo and you wanted me to buy you a camel -- so i did...or how about that time when, we went up to the white mountains and you took a selfie of us kissing in front of the beautiful foliage and posted it to instagram because of how happy you were.  we were always happy and zany as fuck when we were together.and i was there for the bad times too... i wouldn't leave your side, no matter what.and that's what's made this whole thing so hard.  for me the term "visiting hours" didn't apply.  i didn't care about work the next morning, or what my obligations were, you came first in my book every time.  i was loyal to you in every way except the one that mattered most to you.  i fucked up with my body ... but my mind was always with you, sickness, health, stomach aches, headaches, cysts, or whatever came next... i would've been there through thick and thin. you said things to me that i feel like you've never said to any man in history...we made everyone jealous of us... we were so obnoxious about how much we loved one another... every day we'd tell jessie about our life, or john, or someone.  we dyed our hair, worked out, watched movies, wrote music for one another -- though i never showed you or performed what i made for you... i wish i could go back and open up more.  maybe you wouldn't have left.... and despite all the good times, there were bad times.  i threw a potato once... and there were other things that were worse depending on how you look at it.  we were so passionate that things would get out of control... but we'd always make up, meet in the middle, talk, apologize, cry, and love each other with reckless abandon.i miss you... but after today... i won't open the door for you if you show up on my doorstep.  my heart has spilled too much blood over you.  i've been so weak, for so long.  i can't keep doing this.  so.  go live your life i guess.  i hope that the next guy will remind you of me in the best of ways and will be better than my shortcomings.  i hope he makes you tea, and rubs you.  i hope he knows how you like your steak, knows when to let you win, or when to fight you.  i hope he knows how to fuck you, and how to love you.  i hope he likes the way the light hugs you in the morning.  i hope he appreciates how your hair frames your face.... i hope that he's just like me.  i hope that he's just different enough that you never need to think of me again... because i still think of you all the time... but not after tonight.i love you.  i'm sorry.  it's over.

it's you  


i've decided that if you were to walk through the door right now, with a pill that would kill me 5 minutes after i took it; but for the last 5 minutes of my life you'd forgive me completely and things would be like they were... i'd take the pill without a regret in the world.for the last 5 minutes i'd ask you to play with my hair and hold me like nothing ever happened.  i'd die so happy that i don't think heaven or hell would actually accept me.i wish you could hear me.

help, i've done it again....i've been here many times before.hurt myself again today,and the worst part is there's noone else to blame.be my friend.hold me, wrap me up.unfold me, i am small and needy, warm me up, and breath me....i don't know that i'm ever going to be accepted, and gods i'm lonely.... every day actually feels like i'm going insane.  i can't help but think that my life is slipping away from me.  i wish it was 2014 again and we were friends... when i had someone to cry to when i needed to let this shit out of me...now i cry alone... i do everything alone.  i am alone.
