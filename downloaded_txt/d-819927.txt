social 
      and philosophical foundations of education
what 
      does it mean to study the "social and philosophical foundations
      of education"?
foundations 
       of education courses aim to develop in teachers and other school professionals 
       such as administrators, counselors, and psychologists the ability to interpret 
       knowledge within its historical, philosophical, cultural, and social contexts. 
       the aim of interpretation is to produce clear normative and critical perspectives 
    on education both within, and outside of, schools.
the 
       council of learned societies in education (clse) has provided definitions and 
       standards regarding foundations of education on behalf of its twenty member 
       societies. representatives of clse and its member societies serve actively 
       on the advisory boards of ncate, and provide ongoing input into ncate standards.
