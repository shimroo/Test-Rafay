you define reality by what you know, what you believe, and what you do about it. transactional analysis is a theory of personality and a systematic psychotherapy for personal and professional growth and change.





transactional analysis (ta)

tells us that our personality is made up of 3 basic parts called: ego-states
the 3 ego-states are: parent – adult – child.
these are different from real parents, real children and real grown-ups. ego-states begin with a capital letter to show the difference between a parent ego-state and a parent raising a child, or adults running a business.

an ego-state is defined as  a coherent system of: thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
