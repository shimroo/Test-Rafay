autism is a life-long
                  developmental disorder that prevents individuals from properly understanding what they see,hear, and sense. it results in
                  mild to severe problems of social relationships, communication, and behavior. the cause of autism is still unknown. some research
                  suggests a physical problem affecting those parts of the brain that process language and information coming in from the senses.
                  there may be some imbalance of certain chemicals in the brain. research also points to a possible genetic connection. environmental
                  reasons are also of concern. autism may indeed result from a combination of several "causes". statistics now show 1 in 68
                  children have autism.  please go to this link for a very good article.

autism/pdd . . . is a collection of responses which must
                                    be viewed in context, and observation is always more productive than labeling. across the wide spectrum of the autism/pdd
                                    syndrome, individual variations on several key features can be recognized. reciprocal social interactions, both verbal and
                                    nonverbal, are unusual in quality and generally difficult to synchronize and to carry out.
 
impairments of the central nervous system typically result
                                    in over-reactions, under-reactions, or inconsistent responses to various sensory stimuli. because sensory input is difficult
                                    to organize and control, the individual's activities and interests may appear restricted in their nature and repertoire, frequently
                                    involving significant repetition and a need for predictability rather than change. 
it is important to view the behavior of people with autism/pdd as meaningful adaptations and to take a positive,

autism
                                    is a developmental disability that appears during the first three years. autism is the result of a neurological disorder that affects
                                    the functioning of the brain.
 
how many people have autism ? 
as well as the 5 per 10,000 with classic autism or kanners syndrome, it is estimated that 15 in every 10,000 have
                                    what are called, in north america, other pervasive developmental disorders. current statistics tell us that approximately
                                    every 1 in every 500 persons in the u.s. alone has some form of autism. and sadly, as we all know, this number is
                                    increasing daily. in addition, perhaps 71
                                    in every 10,000 have a milder form of the disorder, mainly affecting social relationships rather than communication and language.
                                    about half of this larger number (36 in every 10,000 of the population) is thought to have aspergers syndrome. these figures
                                    add up to 91 persons in every 10,000, nearly one per cent of the total population. throughout the world, it has been estimated
                                    that 48 million people have some form of autism.
 
an interesting and important question is: "is the prevalence
                                    of autism increasing?" some have described the increases in diagnoses of some form of autism as an "explosion".  perhaps
                                    this reflects greater awareness of the distinctive impairments by professionals and parents, as well as the expansion of criteria
                                    to include those who combine autism with some other disability. perhaps there has really been an increase in the numbers and
                                    proportions of affected people, possibly related to environmental factors, viral infections, vaccinations and over-use of
                                    antibiotics.
 
autism
                                    is four times more prevalent in boys than girls and knows no racial, ethnic or social boundaries. family income, lifestyle
                                    or educational levels do not affect the chance of occurrence. 
autism interferes with the normal development of the brain in areas which control verbal and nonverbal communication,
                                    social interaction, and sensory development. children or adults with autism may exhibit repeated body movements such as hand
                                    flapping and rocking, show unusual responses to people or attachments to objects, and resist changes in routine. in some cases,
                                    aggressive and/or self-injurious behavior may be present. 
autism is often referred to as a spectrum disorder, meaning the symptoms and characteristics of autism can present
                                    themselves in a wide variety of combinations, from mild to severe. although autism is defined by a certain set of behaviors,
                                    children and adults can exhibit any combination of the behaviors in any degree of severity. two children, both with a diagnosis
                                    of autism, can act very differently from one another. 
several old theories about the cause of autism have been proven false. autism is not a mental illness. children with
                                    autism are not unruly kids with a behavior problem. autism is not caused by bad parents who gave their child too little attention.
                                    most importantly, no known factors in the psychological environment of a child have been shown to cause autism. 
it is conservatively estimated that 400,000 people in the u.s. today have some form of autism. it's prevalence rate
                                    now places it as the third most common developmental disability - more common than down's syndrome. yet, the majority of the
                                    public, including many professionals in the medical, educational, and vocational fields are still unaware of how autism affects
                                    people and how to effectiively work with individuals with autism. 
persons with autism may possess the following characteristics
                                    in various combinations in varying degrees of severity: ~ inappropriate laughing or giggling ~ no real fear of
                                    dangers ~ apparent insensitivity to pain ~ may not want cuddling ~ sustained unusual or repetitive play ~
                                    uneven physical or verbal skills ~ may avoid eye contact ~ may prefer to be alone ~ difficulty in expressing needs-may
                                    use gestures ~ inappropriate attachments to objects ~ insistance on sameness ~ echos words or phrases ~ inappropriate
                                    response to sound ~ spins objects or self ~ difficulty in interacting with others

asperger's syndrome is part of the autism spectrum and is
                                    characterized by specific delays in social, communicative, and cognitive development. it is a life long condition and the
                                    attributes will change with different stages of life. the most prominent characteristic of the person with asperger's is their
                                    inability to read and respond to social cues. they usually lack the ability to read body language and facial expressions.
                                    they have difficulty keeping eye contact. their conversations seem to be one sided, often focusing on their obsessions. it
                                    doesn't enter their minds that the other person may not be interested. their conversations often speak of facts, rather than
                                    actual social conversation. studies suggest that asperger's is dominate among males. it has been suggested that this
                                    may not really be true; that, in fact, girls just have a better ability to blend in and often are never diagnosed. please

treating children with high functioning autism
 
autism is one of the most commonly diagnosed developmental disabilities
                                    in children. it is a lifelong disability that is usually diagnosed before the age of three. autism can interfere with a persons
                                    ability to process information, interact with others, and learn common tasks. autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that
                                    there are varying degrees of it, from the very profoundly affected, to high functioning (aspergers syndrome). 
 
certain types of high functioning autism are often diagnosed as pervasive
                                    developmental disorder or pdd. symptoms include delayed or absence of speech, the inability to appropriately relate to others,
                                    repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, and an insistence of a routine. if a child is suspected of having autism, they
                                    should be tested and diagnosed by a reputable professional, such as a pediatric neurologist, or child psychologist who is
                                    familiar with the disorder. with the correct intervention, the higher functioning autistic child can learn to overcome his
                                    difficulties and eventually be mainstreamed into a regular classroom. however, there are some recommendations and guidelines
                                    that must be followed when training and treating these exceptional children. 
 
once a child has been diagnosed with autism, seeking treatment as soon
                                    as possible is crucial. in the u.s, each school district is mandated to offer intervention programs to assist children with
                                    this disorder. establishing an individualized educational and therapy plan is the first step in treating children with this
                                    disorder. since autism is not a disease, there is no single solution to addressing it. rather, a series of therapies must
                                    be mapped out for the affected child. these include development of social, behavioral, communication, and motor skills. an
                                    individualized educational plan, or iep is formulated through teacher, specialist, and parent inputs. it is this plan that
                                    lays the groundwork for the childs necessary therapy and academic training. 
 
one of the biggest misconceptions of high functioning autistic children
                                    is that they are unable to accomplish or learn many tasks if they have low testing iq scores. this is not the case, since
                                    measuring the iq of such children cannot be done with any degree of accuracy. many factors, such as distractions in the testing
                                    environment as well as their level of hyperactivity may interfere with the test taking. quite simply, the child with high
                                    functioning autism may just require more time to respond along with some visual input to help clarify a question. this is
                                    especially true since people with autism tend to think in more visual terms than most people do. as a result of these discoveries,
                                    special education teams have come up with a series of approaches to successfully teach these children in the public sector.
                                    
 
another tool often used in helping these children, is that of a schedule.
                                    because many autistic children resist changes and disruptions in their routines, it is important to provide them with a plan
                                    so they know what activities are first, next, and last. if they are unable to read, then a picture schedule can be provided.
                                    these children also need advanced notice of impending changes. for example, using the phrase in five minutes, were going to
                                    put away the puzzles, and read a story will assist them in transitioning to this next activity. 
 
in addition to special academic training, the high functioning autistic
                                    child may require additional therapies in speech, and language. despite the fact that these children can be quite verbal,
                                    sometimes additional work is often needed to correct specific letter and word pronunciations. if necessary, language skills
                                    are addressed so that the child learns how to respond appropriately to certain phrases and questions. this type of therapy
                                    is often administered on an individualized basis, by a speech and language therapist during the course of the school day.
                                    
 
many children may also require some degree of occupational therapy for
                                    motor skill and sensory integration problems. these sensory problems may cause children to be overly sensitive to certain
                                    textures, noises, smells, and sounds. an occupational therapist that is specially trained in this field can treat the child
                                    with sensory issues. if the child has problems with fine motor skills that interfere with writing and other necessary tasks,
                                    therapy is used to address these problems as well. as in speech and language therapy, the child can often receive occupational
                                    therapy at school if he or she has demonstrated a need for it. 
 
some aspects of autism may interfere with the childs inability to focus
                                    or behave appropriately, despite all attempts of behavioral modification. if this is the case, medication may be needed to
                                    help control any anxieties, hyperactivity, and obsessive behaviors. physicians experienced with autism, such as pediatric
                                    neurologists, should be consulted before deciding on such a treatment plan. 
 
through early
                                    testing and intervention, these children can learn to overcome their difficulties and grow up to become successful and productive
                                    members of society.

"all kids are gifted. some just open their packages earlier than
                  others." ~ michael carr 
 
"parents have become so convinced that educators know what is best
                  for children, that they forget that they themselves are really the experts." ~ marian wright edelman
 
"i am autistic, and i can assure you, there is no "normal person"
                  inside of me, nor is there one inside of any other autistic individual.  the myth of the "normal boy trapped inside the
                  shell of autism" is just as inaccurate and just as damaging, as the myth of the "refrigerator mother."  if i could offer
                  one piece of advice to all mothers everywhere, it would be to love your child for who they are, instead of mourning for who
                  they are not." ~ anonymousnobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal. ~ albert
                  camus the worst possible fate for such a child is to be placed in a program for troublemakers. when that happens,
                  he says, a perfect victim is surrounded by perfect victimizers. ~ fred volkmar our children may not remember anything

                  later you're going to realize, just as i did, there's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path... ~ morpheus,
                  from the movie "the matrix" i wanted a perfect ending. now i've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme,
                  and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle and end. life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment
                  and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next. delicious ambiguity. ~ gilda radner be yourself.
                  no one can ever tell you you're doing it wrong. ~james leo herlihy you may have to fight a battle more than once to
                  win it. ~ margaret thatcher use what talent you possess: the woods would be very silent if no birds sang except those
                  that sang best. ~ henry van dyke once we know people's stories, we feel compassion instead of judgment. today, practice
                  remembering that everyone has a story.~ mary manin morrissey unless school districts and other providers of early
                  intervention 'get on the bandwagon' and start offering effective early intervention (which has been known for years now) rather
                  than forcing parents to fight for effective intervention(s) one at a time, greater awareness will not lead to "more effective
                  early intervention and improved outcomes." ~ author unknown michael maloney (teach your children well) refers to the
                  public schools' failure at teaching our children well as "academic child abuse." all truth passes through three stages.
                  first, it is ridiculed. second, it is violently opposed. third, it is accepted as being self-evident. ~ arthur schopenhauer
                  normal is in the eye of the beholder. ~ whoopi goldberg 
 
not being able to speak is not the same as not having anything to
                  say. ~ author unknown
never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people
                  can change the world. indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. ~ margaret mead there's only one person in the world
                  like you. if you think about it for a moment, there has never been...and there never will be--in the history of the earth--another
                  person just like you. ~ mr. fred rogers don't walk behind me, i may not lead. don't walk in front of me, i may not
                  follow. just walk beside me and be my friend. ~ albert camus in the depth of winter i finally learned that within
                  me there lay an invincible summer. ~ albert camus don't limit a child to your own learning, for he was born in another
                  time. ~ rabbinical saying children seldom misquote you. in fact, they usually repeat word for word what you shouldn't
                  have said. ~ author unknown children need models rather than critics. ~ joseph joubert a baby is god's opinion
                  that life should go on. ~ carl sandburg you cannot catch a child's spirit by running after it; you must stand still
                  and for love, it will soon itself return. ~ arthur miller the test of the morality of a society is what it does for
                  its children. ~ dietrich bonhoeffer any child can tell you that the sole purpose of a middle name is so he can tell
                  when he's in trouble. ~ dennis fakes if you can give your son or daughter only one gift, let it be enthusiasm. ~ bruce
                  barton being a full-time mother is one of the highest salaried jobs... since the payment is pure love. ~ mildred b.
                  vermont a good mother is worth hundreds of schoolmasters. ~ george herbert a mother understands what a child
                  does not say. ~ jewish proverb my dad has always taught me these words: care and share. that's why we put on clinics.
                  the only thing i can do is try to give back. if it works, it works. ~ tiger woods my father gave me the greatest gift
                  anyone could give another person, he believed in me. ~ jim valvano fatherhood is pretending the present you love the
                  most is soap-on-a-rope. ~ bill cosby children are poor men's riches. ~ author unknown 



children with autism are heroes, when you think about
                  how hard they must work, just to get through each day.  ~ author unknown


all snowflakes are formed according to a master theme and
                  so they all are much alike.  but as they grow, they execute a multitude of variations on this theme so that each becomes
                  a thing of individual beauty, uniquely set apart.and so with children, who while very much alike are subtly different
                  - each with his or her own personal expectations, his or her own specific capabilities and interests, and his or her own particular
                  needs, doubt and frustrations.  different in ways that well might shape the world, if we who guide them respect their
                  differences.  ~ author unknown ~

some of you that have frequented my site may remember the fighting autism clock that was in this spot. it's come to my attention,
                     thanks to a very nice mom i met via the internet, that this is found to be very offensive to many people on the autistic spectrum.
                     i cannot tell you how terrible i feel about this. i had no idea. i've taken it off and would like you to click on this text
                     to see why.
