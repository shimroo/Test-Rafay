critter cove has everything for your ultimate fishing adventure, whether you have your own boat, or would like to use one of ours.


nootka sound is a destination fishery, meaning thousands of salmon return to nootka each year to the conuma fish hatchery.  many popular fishing spots are right by the lodge in the protected, calm, inside waters.  for those who prefer some open pacific fishing, the entrance to nootka and the pacific beyond, is a short run of 8 miles away.
