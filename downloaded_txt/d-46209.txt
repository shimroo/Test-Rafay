welcome!
thank you for visiting the shakespeare resource center. you'll find here collected links from all over the world wide web to help you discover william shakespeare. there are millions of pages that reference shakespeare on the internet. this site aims to make it a little easier to find the most useful ones.
the e-mail policy of the shakespeare resource center is simple: the src will not provide answers to questions about homework, paper topics, interpretations, etc. the purpose of this site is to provide links to aid you in your online shakespeare research; it's not meant to provide you a personal research assistant. but for the most burning questions, why not ask the bard?
you can also follow the shakespeare resource center on facebook and twitter for daily updates of news, pages, and other timely items of interest. and if you're in need of a book, movie, or other shakespeare-related merchandise, your amazon.com purchase helps support the site. enjoy!
