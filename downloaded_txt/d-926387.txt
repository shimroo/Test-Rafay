about shaool managementin the beginning ben shaool was a small homebuilder who purchased a couple small lots and built his first spec homes. shortly afterwards, he built and leased up his first commercial apartment housing project with 74 units... and the formula for success was set in place.
today it takes a large team of talented staff to do all the things ben used to do. that team is shaool management and we continue to strive to live up to the ben's attention to detail and customer satisfaction.
