what our patients are saying








you are great!Â  we almost want to come to the doctor ðŸ™‚Â i would like to thank all of you for your great service. as a new momÂ sometimes i may have silly questions. everyone on the phone, and inÂ person have always made me feel like every question is important and iÂ have always received a great answer to my question. i will continue toÂ refer my friends and family to your practice. we are very happy and hopeÂ to add more of our own little patients to your practice.we are so grateful that we found an awesome group to take great care ofÂ our son.Â  he actually asks when can we go to see you guys.Â  you must beÂ doing right when my son wants to go to the doctors.










i really appreciate dr. pappas taking my calls in the middle of theÂ night when my daughter is ill. it is a relief to know that i haveÂ someone to contact when she has a high fever or emergency situationÂ after hours.Â  thank you!










as a working parent, i totally appreciate the late night on mondays for well visits!
