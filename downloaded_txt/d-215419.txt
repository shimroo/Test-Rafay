caliescaliyou are about to reas me favorite: musical group, television show, movie, and why i like them. enjoy!my favorite musical group is coldplay, their type of music is alternative. i like coldplay because they are just like everyone else, having fun with their lives and just wanting peace. i love their music because i think its very realistic and lifelike. theri music helps me relax and take my mind of things.my favorite television show is that 70's show, its about a bunch of older teenage kids living their lives. i like the show because its funny, they are always joking around with each other. i like the show so much that i wish i could be in it.my favorite movie is moulin rouge. i like that movie because its a beautifull sad musical. another reason why i like it is because it teaches you a lesson in life. seeing that musical helps me imagine and dream things.

caliescaliim terribly sickughi yelled at some kid yesterday for calling my friend nameslost my voice therei dont usually yell at people for being mean but at the time i was in the mood i guess.mom said that she'll get me some guy to help me with my writing scince i so desprately want to be an authorbut i want to be an actress too and i will try for it as soon as im going to turn 16.i need to stop reading for at least an hour, its become a drug to me and its getting me a little scared there,like once dad couldent take me to the bookstore because he didnt want to use so much money on books and becuz he didnt have the time.i went crazyi had to read something!!and every book on my darn shelf ive read alreadyi read eragon twice because i had nothing else to read (and because it was a great book).i was going to see lorena later but i dont have a ride wich stinks because i havent seen her in a while.if you think to much how to end an entry you dont know how to end it at all, you lose the thought (gosh darn it!)wellbye...(*grumble*)"wouldent it be wonderfull if i could take characters out of a book too?" said meggie-- sarita
