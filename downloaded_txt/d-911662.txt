 for this album hutchinson once again teamed up with esteemed producer crit harmon who she has worked with for 20 years. these are songs of transition, of letting go, of grief, and of discovery. working with long-time collaborators guitarist kevin barry (jackson browne, mary chapin carpenter, ray lamontagne) and bassist richard gates (richard thompson, the weepies, mary gauthier) this album is her first with drummer marco giovino (norah jones, robert plant, patty griffin). these world class musicians play with remarkable emotional intelligence. they bring a sensitivity, a dynamic range, and a warmth that is at the heart of this hauntingly beautiful soundscape.hutchinson has never shied away from difficult conversations, and this album is no exception— yet we sense that the more directly she faces these topics - loss, change, mid-life, living with mental illness - the more her gratitude and sense of wonder emerge. if beyond that had a tone of triumph, the new album has a certain humility. it is the recognition that this work is lifelong and that healing is not a linear process. there is an optimism that shines even more brightly the further in hutchinson goes. this is an artist who never stops exploring the depths of the human experience, and the joy and freedom gained in this process is tangible.  hutchinson’s music has an intimacy that makes you feel that whatever it is you are going through, you are not alone. these are life-giving songs of resilience. they honor the perilous journey through the most difficult transitions in life, and celebrate the wonder and the beauty at the heart of letting go. you can find the new album here.
