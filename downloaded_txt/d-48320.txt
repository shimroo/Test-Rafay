united poultry concerns

                is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the compassionate and respectful treatment of chickens, turkeys, ducks and other domestic birds. we hold that the treatment of these birds in the areas of food production, science, education, entertainment, and humane companionship situations has a significant effect upon human, animal, and environmental welfare. we seek to make the public aware of the ways in which poultry are used, and to promote the benefits of a vegan diet and lifestyle. we provide information through our quarterly magazine poultry press, our website at www.upc-online.org, and our sanctuary in machipongo, virginia on the eastern shore. we invite you to join us and support our work.
