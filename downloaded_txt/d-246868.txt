grayson-jockey club research foundation has no alliance with any one university, so the foundation is free to fund the best research regardless of where it takes place. since 1940, the foundation has funded more than 437 specific research projects at the 48 universities listed on our where the dollars go page.



the research today is helping recruit and train the researchers for tomorrow, giving extra impact from the foundation's funding. aside from such staff assistance, however, the foundation does not pay the principal investigator's salary or other overhead, therefore directing the dollars right on the target of research.
