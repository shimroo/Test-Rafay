   our mission the norwalk seaport association offers a cultural, environmental, and historical journey to the norwalk islands.  the sheffield island lighthouse and the light keeper’s cottage provide a unique historical and educational venue which strives to increase awareness, appreciation and consideration for our environment and how the preservation of historic buildings and nature contribute to our quality of life.it is our belief that preservation strengthens the perpetual partnership between the past, the present and the future. the combination of the lighthouse and the stewart b. mckinney national wildlife refuge offers an unparalleled opportunity to educate children of all ages and adults about the importance of preserving long island sound, our environment and maritime heritage.
