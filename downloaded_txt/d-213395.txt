tree morphophysiology has evolved from tree architecture and can be defined as ‘the study of tree shape and structure in relation to function to achieve the goal of sustaining life’.
we’re pleased to provide an opportunity to delve into this refreshing view of tree growth, response and behaviour, above and below ground, with implications for managing trees at all stages of life.
