our experience with sounds unlimited was so easy. a quick phone call and i had our date booked in. they sent us an easy to fill out information form and then they basically did the rest!the dj we got was amazing! so friendly and really catered to what our guests wanted. we got so many compliments about him! 





camillemade it easy 




★★★★★ 5/5 




these guys are seamless! sadly i was so stinking busy i couldn’t talk to my dj much, but when i did let me tell you he was ready to bend over backwards for me. such a sweet man that we got on our special day. my friends had so much fun tearing up the dance floor and the mixes he played were fire. couldn’t recommend these guys enough!
