    drop in commodity values and expansion of participating states and material recovery facilities


 by megan fontes

february 11, 2025

nerc’s material recovery facilities (mrf) commodity values survey report for the                                              period october - december 2024                                               showed a drop in the average commodity price for q4. the average value of all commodities decreased by 23% without residuals and 26% with residuals compared to last quarter. single stream decreased by 28% without residuals and 32% with residuals, while dual stream / source separated decreased by 15% without residuals and 17% with residuals compared to last quarter.                                                                                                                        this is the 23rd quarterly report in nerc’s series of reports on the market value of commodities from mrfs in the northeast. this report includes information from twelve (12) states with the addition of connecticut: connecticut, delaware, maine, maryland, massachusetts, new hampshire, new jersey, new york, pennsylvania, rhode island, vermont, and virginia. the number of participating mrfs increased from 15 to 19 as compared to last quarter.                                                                                                            these survey results reflect the differing laws and collection options in the participating states. five of the states included in this report have beverage container deposit laws. as a result, fewer glass bottles, pet bottles and aluminum cans are processed in mrfs in those states. those mrfs are also likely to have less revenue from those recyclables. in addition, the report reflects a mix of single stream, dual stream, and source separation to collect recyclables with single stream being the most common approach. the type of collection used will have an impact on mrf design and operation. thus, the data from this report reflects the unique blend of facilities and statewide laws in the reporting states.                                                                                                                         residual refers to the incoming material that cannot be marketed and goes to disposal. the value without residuals reflects the value of a perfect ton of marketed material, while the value with residuals reflects the value of each ton processed with the costs associated of disposing unmarketable material. note: in many cases, recovered glass goes to market but at a negative value.                                                                                                                        this data is not intended to be used as a price guide for mrf contracts. nerc’s database represents single and dual stream mrfs, states with and without beverage container deposits, a wide variety in markets and geographic access to markets, and variety of materials collected for processing at the participating facilities.  as a result, it represents the diversity of operating conditions in these locations and should not be used as a price guideline for a specific program.                                                                                                                         for more information, contact megan schulz-fontes, executive director, at                                              megan@nerc.org                                  .
