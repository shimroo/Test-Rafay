rare bird:  eurasian eagle owl




            
    a eurasian eagle owl, bubo bubo, appeared from time to 
    time during may and early june, 2007, at the harbor of kaohsiung.  this is a 
    first record for taiwan.

                the eurasian eagle owl is one of the worlds largest and most 
    powerful owls; length 58-71 cm (23 -28 inches), and wingspan of 1.531.82 m 
    (56 feet).  it is widespread but rather rare.  its breeding range is from 
    europe eastward across 
russia to the pacific, 
    south to iran and pakistan; across to china and korea.  its habitat is 
    chiefly remote rocky areas, river valleys, ravines, quarries; but also open 
    forest, taiga, steppe and semi desert.

              tsu-sze temple, sanshia

the tsu-sze
    (divine ancestor) 
temple, 
    popularly known as the 
sanshia bird temple, 
    situated in sanshia, taipei county, is one of the most magnificent temples 
    in taiwan.  
    it is a taoist temple, dedicated to 
    chingshuei tsu-sze (real name chen tsao-yin), born in china during 
    the sung dynasty (9601279).  he became a famous general and was knighted as 
    protector of the country for his achievements and valour.   subsequently, 
    he came to be called chingshuei tsu-sze for establishing the chingshuei yan 
    memorial temple in anshi county, china.  hundreds of years later, when 
    people migrated from that area, they brought a statue of chingshuei tsu-sze 
    with them to enshrine as guardian spirit in a new temple that they 
    constructed in the place known today as sanshia (sansia, san-hsia, san xia), 
    taiwan.

王建華青帆碼頭拍攝到黑嘴端鳳頭燕鷗

[馬祖日報]
                    

                    今年的燕鷗特別多，東莒國小校長王建華表示，近來因為港內小魚多，除增加許多釣魚機會外，許多燕歐從蛇島[蛇山]飛過來覓食，拿起相機也許就有機會拍到神話之鳥。



                    王建華表示，原先預計出海賞鷗，因為南風浪太大作罷，但聽人說在碼頭有看見黑嘴端鳳頭燕鷗芳蹤，於是趁步行之便，一路走到青帆碼頭，拿著像機隨便拍，因為最近港內小魚多，許多燕鷗從蛇島飛過來覓食，胡亂快門中，檢視了一下相片，也許是幸運，竟被我拍到了黑嘴端鳳頭燕鷗。



今夏，也許您不用搭船到蛇島[蛇山]賞鷗，青帆碼頭、坤坵沙灘也許就是您與黑嘴端鳳頭燕鷗初次邂逅的所在喔!

 

wang chienhua captured a 
                    picture of chinese crested tern at chingfan port, sijyu 
                    island, in the matsu archipelago

[matsu daily newspaper] the 
                    number of terns has significantly increased this year, as 
                    wang chien-huathe principal of tungchu elementary school 
                    said. due to the recent boosted quantity of small fish 
                    around ports, the chances of catching fish have increased, 
                    which also attracts terns from sher mountain* to prey on the 
                    fish for food. so, you may have a chance to capture pictures 
                    of the mythical bird by just picking up your camera.

wang chien-hua said that he was 
                    originally going to take a boat to look for terns, but due 
                    to the stormy wind from the south, the boat was unable to 
                    depart. nevertheless, he took a walk to chingfan port 
                    remembering that he had heard someone mention seeing chinese 
                    crested terns around ports. on the way to chingfan port, he 
                    casually took some pictures of terns that flew from sher 
                    mountain to feed on the recently increased schools of fish. 
                    he said: perhaps i was lucky. when i checked the random 
                    pictures that i took, i realized that i had just taken a 
                    photo of the chinese crested tern!


this summer, you may not have 
                      to take a boat to sher mountain for tern-watching. 
                      chingfan port and kunchiu beach could be the place where 
                      you have your first encounter with chinese crested tern!

                    off the west coast of sijyu island.






              chinese crested terns (matsu tern), sterna bernsteini, have 
              returned!

 

during a survey on 
              june 21, 2007, chang shou-hwa located three pairs of 
chinese 
              crested terns (matsu tern) 
on xijyu shershan 
              islet in the matsu tern reserve.  survey work will continue to 
              look for any more of these extremely rare terns and monitor their 
              activities during the breeding season.
 
              




on may 20, 2007, legislator tien 
              chiu-chin met with a birding in taiwan group in taipei.  
              the birders were an international group, from canada, 
mexico, taiwan and the united 
              states.  the birders had been traveling in taiwan for two weeks 
              and had visited every county (except yilan), and had also gone to 
              lanyu island.

              olor columbianus bewickii) was formerly considered a separate 
              species, called bewicks swan.  it was named for thomas bewick 
              (17531828), british engraver, who specialized in illustrations of 
              birds and animals.

            c. 
              c. bewickii breeds across most of high-arctic siberia.  
              western populations winter in europe; eastern populations winter 
              chiefly in eastern asia, mostly in japan, korea and china.  it is 
              vagrant in taiwan.

            the 
              earliest record in taiwan is of a party of 12 in the taoyuan area 
              in mid-november, 1929.  on december 6, 1929, hunters shot five of 
              them; the remaining seven escaped.  further known records are from 
              1971, 1976, 1989 and january 25, 2003.

            
              birdlife international considers the population of c. c. 
              bewickii to be stable.

rare birds:  common crane and 
              black-chinned fruit-dove




            
              a common crane grus grus and a juvenile 
              black-chinned fruit-dove ptilinopus leclancheri
              visited 
taiwan in february, 2007.  the crane was at ilan (ee-lan); 
              the fruit-dove was at kaohsiung. 
               the wild bird society of taipei classes both as vagrant in 
              taiwan.

             the
              common crane breeds in northern eurasia and winters in 
              northern africa, southern india and southeast asia.  it is 
              becoming rare.  

            the 
              presently-known range of the black-chinned fruit-dove is 
              the philippines and palawan.  however, some authors recognize an 
              endemic subspecies, p. l. taiwanus, on lanyu 
              island.  its status there is unclear at this time.

              rare geese at ilan  (ee-lan)




a small party of
              swan geese anser cygnoides, was present 
              during january, 2007 at ilan.  a few bean geese anser 
              fabalis arrived at the same time.  both species of geese 
              are classed as vagrant in taiwan.


            the 
                former breeding range of the swan goose (the ancestor of 
                the domesticated chinese goose) extended widely across eastern 
                siberia into northern china and mongolia, but the present 
                breeding range is severely fragmented.  swan goose numbers have 
                been in decline since the beginning of the year 1900.  the 
                remaining population (perhaps only 300400 pairs) breeds 
                primarily in steppe and forested steppe marshes and lakesides of 
                eastern siberia.  the former wintering range included 
                korea, japan and a large part of eastern china; now it is 
                regular only in a smaller area of eastern china. 

            
                
swan 
                goose is listed as endangered on the 2006 iucn* red 
                list (as evaluated by birdlife international) because its 
                population is declining very rapidly as a result of habitat 
                loss, particularly to agricultural development, and 
                unsustainable levels of hunting.

                bean goose breeds across northern europe and asia. the 
                two major wintering areas are temperate lowlands of europe and 
                east asia.  in east asia, the chief wintering areas are china, 
                korea, and japan.

only 130km 
        off the coast of the chinese mainland, taiwan occupies a strategic position 
        in east asia at the intersection of sea currents and navigation routes. 
        when portuguese navigators sighted taiwan in the 16th century, they were 
        struck by its tremendous beauty and called the island 
ilha  formosa 
        or "beautiful island".

jo ann on birding in  
        taiwan

it was an honour and privilege to be part 
                  of the first taiwanese-organized and led birding tour to 
                  taiwan in march 2003. i considered the opportunity to be a 
                  special treat because i had been interested in chinese life 
                  and culture since my childhood. before the trip, i read all i 
                  could about taiwan, the birds and everything else....more
