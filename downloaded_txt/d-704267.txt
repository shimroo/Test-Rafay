looking glass
the global ip network looking glass provides network routing information on the backbone infrastructure. due to the low-priority nature of these requests on our network routers, this service is not appropriate for measuring service level agreements (sla). the looking glass should only be used to verify routing information.

bgp communities
ntt data offers the most comprehensive set of bgp communities in the industry. unlike many global carriers who are very selective about the information they disclose, our company is very transparent about its routing policies and bgp communities.
