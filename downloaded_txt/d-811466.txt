feel like dissing instead of kissing your former lover this valentine’s day? think your ex is more like a rat than a prince? animal shelters and zoos around the country are encouraging little cathartic acts of revenge this holiday — and raising money for a cause — with a slew of darkly funny fundraisers. at an anchorage bird treatment center, you can name a frozen rat for your ex and get a video of it being eaten by a raptor. in memphis, you can memorialize your former lover's name over a video of an elephant pooping. and many shelters are offering to name a feral cat after your ex — and then neutering it. read morewhy people are naming bugs, rats and cats after their exes this valentine’s day

arizona has added a new species of bat to the list of night-flying creatures that frequent the state. the recent confirmation would not have been possible without the help of residents and researchers who gathered hundreds of saliva samples from hummingbird feeders. scientists at a special lab at northern arizona university tested the samples for dna to confirm the presence of mexican long-nosed bats. previously, a bat would have to be captured to examine it — which is no easy task. the mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the endangered species act since 1988. read morearizona has added an endangered bat to the list of night-flying creatures that frequent the state

a rare bloom with a pungent odor like decaying flesh has opened in the australian capital in the nation’s third such extraordinary flowering in as many months. officials say the corpse flower bloomed for the first time in its 15 years at canberra’s australian national botanic gardens on saturday and was closing on monday. another flowered briefly in sydney in january, attracting 20,000 admirers. similar numbers turned out to experience another rancid bloom at botanic gardens near melbourne in november. corpse flower plants bloom several years apart, and the three in australia are in different climate conditions, so their blooming so close together was surprising. read moreaustralia holds its nose for its 3rd rancid bloom of a rare corpse plant in 3 months

feb 7, 2025


a man described feeling “the shudders” as more than 100 venomous red-bellied black snakes were removed from a pile of mulch in his sydney backyard. david stein called a snake catcher last week after watching about six snakes slither into the mulch. he learned from an internet search that pregnant red bellies pile together to give birth. stein helped the snake catcher rake up the adult and newborn snakes. he said: “just seeing that amount in one group, it gives you a bit of the shudders." the snake catcher ended up collecting five adult snakes and 97 offspring. they'll be released in a national park. meanwhile, stein is getting rid of the mulch pile. read morethe number of venomous snakes removed from this australian yard will make you shudder
