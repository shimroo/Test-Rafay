abolish neo-feudalism





hello folks,in 1331, england was an intellectually backward country. in order to import knowledge and crafts, edward iii struck a bargain. if you brought a new industry into the country, you were rewarded with a short monopoly over it, up to five years for example. skilled workman from across europe came to the england and with them brought weaving, clock making, metal working, gunpowder, cannon making etc. [see deazley, r. (2008) 'commentary on the statute of monopolies 1624']these were not abstract, incremental or mathematical ideas, these were high-level industries, and they were time limited.over time, the aim of the original bargain - short time-limited monopoly to increase the spread of knowledge and crafts - was lost, and it became another way for the english kings to raise finance and grant favours. by the time of queen elizabeth, she had even given one of her lords a monopoly over salt. over time, as the divine rights of the monarchies were replaced by democratic parliaments, these monopolies were broken up and free trade was introduced leading to the industrial and scientific revolutions.by the late 18th century, the time of the great classical economists such as adam smith and david ricardo, it was understood that competition by manufacturers produced better outcomes than monopoly; that in a free market free of government protection, price will fall to the marginal cost of production as manufacturers innovate not just in producing the design of a product, but also innovate in the efficient production of it. adam smith's wealth of nations begins with the famous example of how to best organise the production of a pin.this reduction in price gives the most benefit to consumers and society as a whole. in the free market, that is free of feudal patronage to a single company, companies have to compete to best please their customers in order to survive.however, beginning with the rise of the cold war military industrial complex and increasing throughout the 1990s and 2000s with the rise of multi-national organisations such as the world trade organisation, this process has now gone into reverse. government created monopolies are increasing at a fast rate, one of the reasons is again the patent system.the modern patent system does not spread previously secret knowledge of high-level crafts. since the 1970s and especially since the 1990s, patents are given for obvious and incremental improvements in very specific areas. instead of a patent for say, the steam engine, a patent might be for improving an algorithm for moving stream along a pipe, 5% more efficiently under certain conditions.indeed patents now often work against the spread of knowledge. a patent over an obvious and incremental improvement is given by the state to company a, and when company b, with no knowledge of the patent, implements the obvious improvement in an act of parallel evolution, it then gets hit with a insidious threat - pay up or stop improving. these patents are sold and cross-licensed until they form huge collections owned by a handful of elite companies.because building any technology requires the combination of hundreds or thousands of these obvious small steps, no one can build technological devices without permission from the government protected elite multi-national companies.so technology becomes harder and slower to develop, less safe and more expensive. progress becomes slower. the capitalist free market is replaced by neo-feudalism.patents are just small one example of how control is getting centralised in a new feudal elite. another example is that the corruption of the democratic process by political contributions and lobbying means the government and legal system has been captured by the feudal elite, acting for those minority interests rather than for population as a whole. i have not updated this blog for over 5 years. why? because i realised that the issue of keeping or abolishing the british crown is rather small fry. countries that are republics end up with a washed up politician as their head of state - take the recent example of the german president, he served for just a year and a half before resigning in scandal. even worse, presidents seem to cost even more than monarchies do. recent american presidents spend money and dole out favours to such an extent that it puts the medieval monarchs to shame.however, regardless if we have a smiley old grandmother or a washed up politician as our head of state, it does not matter since they are no longer calling the shots. the new feudal elite does not care about jurisdictions or democratic government.our ancestors struggled for hundreds of years to win freedom from feudalism and authoritarianism. this freedom had to be defended in world war ii at a cost of millions of lives on all sides.now as we are moving into a new digital and multinational age, these freedoms are being systematically undermined and removed. a new legal system has sprung up and is building a new feudalism.the medieval feudal lords had their own system of censorship and control which they defended as their divine rights to subjugate the common man. now the new feudal lords have a new religious belief called 'intellectual property' which aims to give them the power to control technology and through it, the common man. the new feudal rulers make demands over democratic governments (which are becoming democratic only in name). these governments make laws 'protecting' these 'intellectual' rights.in the opening chapters of the proverbs of solomon, it is explained that the route to wisdom is modesty (proverbs 1:7), knowledge is not derived through being an intellectually superior individual because all knowledge derives from  god, for example in proverbs 2:6, it says "for the lord giveth wisdom:  out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding". god gives knowledge is for the good of all, not in order to "fill our houses with spoil" (proverbs 1:13).today we would express this same idea without explicit reference to god. we would say that all knowledge is derived from nature and from living in a social network of ideas.the most influential scientist in history, isaac newton, who discovered the laws of gravity, said "if i have seen further it is by standing on ye sholders of giants".since the 17th century, science and technology have revolutionised our world. they have brought freedom from poverty and disease, given us the ability to travel across the country and across the world, even to the moon and beyond.at the heart of the scientific method is openness and sharing. no one owns knowledge. all technology is reducible to the principles of mathematics, and no one owns mathematics, because it is based on nature, on the in-built laws of the universe.from aristotle onwards, philosophers have argued that the protection of personal property - your clothes, your tools, your home, your own skins and bones - is the foundation of liberty.the new feudalism argues that "intellectual property" is akin to physical property. however, this is the kind of muddled doublethink satirized by alice and wonderland and george orwell.one of the fundamental attributes of property is scarcity. if i am wearing my coat, you cannot wear it at the same time. if i give you my coat to wear, i cannot wear it at the same time.ideas are not scarce, if i understand gravity, and explain it to you and you understand it, then i do not stop understanding it. the idea of gravity is not owned and does not cost anything.you cannot own ideas. intellectual property only exists as a pseudo-religious idea in its followers' brains. if it is decided that person x has a sole property right to the idea of gravity, this system only works if everyone believes in this bizarre pseudo-religion.since these 'rights' are fictional and irrational, increasingly totalitarian  policies are being enacted on the population in a vain attempt to  'protect' the 'intellectual rights' which are allegedly held by a small elite of extremely rich companies and individuals.the side effect of this fruitless campaign is that our freedoms are removed and technological and social progress is inhibited. we cannot allow these side effects to happen. we must overthrow this new feudalism.meanwhile, while governments and the legal system spend their energies on implementing 'intellectual property', they have deliberately neglected the protection of personal property and safety which is the real basis of liberty and prosperity. a confident and free society will not stand for corrupt and ineffective leaders who act for the interests of the minority feudal interests, so society is transformed into a scared and disordered set of divided individuals hiding inside their cars or behind their satellite dishes.burglars now operate in broad daylight, murderers are lightly punished or left completely uncaught, deaths due to dangerous roads are not prevented, while child rapists are given new identities and police protection.enforcing laws against drug possession and gambling have more or less ceased, because people with brains stupefied on cannabis or distracted by the next bet cannot threaten the powerful.the rise of the digital age has much promise, but only if we can take control of our technology and take control of our legal and political systems so they benefit the whole population. not just minority neo-feudal interests.

catching up with the windsors





its been a long time since i posted here, sorry about that. lets catch up.in the last year, there has been a cinema film about the queen and tony blair during the week after diana's death, charles has had rows and court cases with the media, i lost track of the never ending diana enquires and camilla parker bowles,  the duchess of cornwall has become almost a candidate for queen but is facing fearce competition from kate middleton, prince william's very public girlfriend.today, prince charles and camilla visited philadelphia, ironically enough the same place where the monarchy was abolished in america through the declaration of independence.

the human rights act applies to the monarchy according to lord chancellor





a very interesting development is that according to the charles leslie falconer, baron of thoroton and lord chancellor, the human rights act does apply to the monarchy.that is interesting because for those against the monarchy, it may give  grounds and a forum in which to challenge the monarchy on legal grounds - i.e. the monarchy is against human rights. the belfast telegraph reported:"the human rights act puts the matter beyond doubt", he added and previous interpretations had been 'overcautious'... "national laws had to be interpreted in a way compatible with the human right to marry."on a side note the queen has decided to wash her hands of the whole marriage and not attend the wedding, maybe that is a cynical explanation but it must be pretty hard for charles to have your mother skip your wedding.the queen is of course understands the historic codes, and follows them to the letter, which of course from one perspective are wrong but least she is playing by the set rules.charles, however, is the opposite, he is either modernising the monarchy or changing the rules as he goes along, the choice is yours

who's castle is it anyway?





the british monarchy, has got itself into a bit of a mess over the forthcoming, arguably unconstitutional, wedding between divorcee camilla parker bowles and philip arthur george charles saxe-coburg-gotha-schleswig-holstein-sonderburg-glucksburg (don't try to say that after a few pints), prince of wales, earl of chester, duke of cornwall, duke of rothesay, baron of renfrew, earl of carrick, lord of the isles, great steward of scotland.slight hiccup is that because they are both adulterers, they cannot get married in the church of england. lots of questions arise from this. isn't it a bit hypocritical for the archbishop of canterbury to give a post-wedding blessing? also, if he can't be married in the c of e, surely he has no right to become the head of the c of e ?anyway, the wedding was supposed to be held in windsor castle, but that would mean, rightly, that anyone could get married there. why not? the tax payer paid millions of pounds doing the place up after the insides were burnt out.they are now getting married in a normal registry office:"thames valley police, which is responsible for windsor castle, will now have to make more elaborate security arrangements. a wedding in windsor castle, with about 700 guests, would cause minimal security concerns. now, the police will have man the entire route between the castle and the guildhall, and scan it for possible explosives. police snipers will have to be positioned on rooftops and helicopters will provide aerial security. the cost, of course, will have to be borne by the local council taxpayers." source.they do not say whether the tax payers support it anyway or whether they think that council tax bills are high enough already.

poll results about the monarchy





i had a look at the poll results at an organisation called yougov. they make for interesting reading. here are some selected statistics, the links are in pdf format.in a poll on the 11th of february 2005 (yesterday). only a third of respondents thought charles should be the head of the church of england with a majority against. 7% thought that mrs parker-bowles should be queen - down from 15% in a previous poll, even though the media operation of the establishment has been in full swing. only 8% of respondents thought the marriage of charles and mrs parker-bowles would strengthen the monarchy, (maybe the 7-8% were just saying yes to everything to make  the researcher to go away). only 14% of people thought the monarchy set a good example of moral standards. according to yet another poll, only 26% of people believed there would be a monarchy in 100 years time.

engagement of charles and camilla





is it fair that edward viii had to abdicate to marry wallis simpson, while charles can be a divorcee and marry a divorcee do the same thing without consequences? of course, it was rumoured that edward viii had nazi sympathies, so perhaps it was providential that he went before the second world war, indeed there may have been more going on than we know.it is not wise to get married if you have not broken off all ties with your former girlfriend. so charles' divorce may have been only a matter of time. however now charles is where he is (so to speak). for the couple personally of course it is better for them to get married.there are of course many issues worth discussing. the big question of course is whether monarchy (rule of the one) in 2005 is morally wrong in an absolute sense. going beyond that, there is also the problem that charles's divorce should have barred him from being the next king if the 'rules' of the monarchy still apply at all. however perhaps they don't, some argue that the easiest thing would be to just call the whole thing a day when her majesty dies.from the religious side of things, it could be argued that there is no king but god, and we should call no man king/queen (see for example, matthew 23) and to do so is idolatry. from a secular viewpoint, is it right that children grow up knowing that they have a place and have to stay in it?is the argument that it wouldn't be britain without a monarchy is like saying africa wouldn't be africa without malaria?

nazis and the royal family





a prominent story in the media is about prince harry wearing a military uniform with a nazi symbol on. below is how it appeared on the front page of the sun newspaper:the poor lamb is often attacked by the media. the narrative the media wants to impose is one of good prince, bad prince. the sun itself described them as 'heir' and 'spare'. considering the boys' upbringing, the worrying question is whether he is just resorting to type.the picture below is the ex-king edward viii and his wife wallis visiting hitler against the warnings of the british government in 1937. they wined and dined with hitler and were even shown around an early concentration camp.edward had very close links with the nazi regime and told an american magazine in 1941 that it "would be a tragic thing if hitler was overthrown.”there is more in this article in the guardian about edward viii and hitler.

is the monarchy against the public interest?





6th february, 1649, after the execution of charles i, the monarchy was officially abolished by parliament. it was written in the journal of the house of commons:“resolved, &c. that it hath been found by experience, and this house doth declare, that the office of a king in this nation, and to have the power thereof in any single person, is unnecessary, burdensome, and dangerous to the liberty, safety, and publick interest of the people of this nation; and therefore ought to be abolished: and that an act be brought in, to that purpose.”is this still true? does experience show that the monarchy is unnecessary and burdensome? does it limit our liberty? and is an act of abolishion still required?by law, mps are not allowed to discuss the monarchy on the floor of the house of commons, so it is up to us.in some other countries the public figures always swear allegiance to the people or the constitution. however members of parliament and other figures in britain must swear an oath of allegiance to the queen. this gives many mps a moral dilemma, they have been elected by people who live in their constituency, is not there first allegiance to them?in the swearing in ceremony, some mps are forced to be dishonest and cross their fingers behind their back or speak in such a way that shows their disgust. even worse, some northern irish elected mps have been not allowed to enter the parliament because of this ceremony, their constituents are effectively disenfranchised.

the founding of the modern monarchy in england





king james i believed that kings were "accountable to none but god only", he his subjects had no right to speak about how they wanted to be governed.james argued that "the state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth; for kings are not only god's lieutenants upon earth, and sit upon god's throne, but even by god himself are called gods ... kings are justly called gods, for that they exercise a manner or resemblance of divine power upon earth: for if you will consider the attributes to god, you shall see how they agree in the person of a king."as an aside, i don't think that god calls anyone god, that is idolatry. anyway, at the time, the public did not agree with james and his son charles was executed on tuesday january 30th, 1649!charles attempted to dismantle the rights of the people and of the parliament, and after a civil war was executed by richard brandon, an executioner more used to common criminals. in the place of that we had a 'lord protector', oliver cromwell.when he died, britain was at a bit of a loss of what to do now. so they sent for the dead king's son, charles ii, who was in exile. charles ii then killed all the dissenters and the monarchy was restored.things could have been very different, we could have become a democratic republic. did we made a mistake? of course, whichever way you decide, in the twenty-first century we do not need to execute people to reform the political system.

god save the queen - or no thankyou?





as a religious person, does it mean that i must believe monarchy to be idolatry? in the bible it says that you can only have one master, and one king, that you can have no king but god:'god said to samuel, "listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that i should not be king over them."'(samuel 8:7)as someone who wants to protect the environment, i hate the fact that the crown estates, which pays for the whole thing, is destroying marine environments and causing erosion by the dredging for aggregate extraction. what they do is sort huge amounts the sand and gravel each day, put it onto huge ships and sell it to other countries who have decided that they don't want to damage their own coastlines. we dig up far more aggregate than we need for own needs. they are literally selling off britain, ship load by ship load in the name of her majesty. that fact does not endear me towards the monarchy.as someone who believes in equality, i worry that it is a bad thing that every british child is  taught they cannot get to the top of society because they have not been born to the right family. i worry that the monarchy supports the class system and helps it to cling to life with all the pernicious effects it has on people. sometimes people (often foreigners) say that without britain would not be britain without the monarchy. ignoring for a moment that 'britain' itself is a slightly difficult term, one is primarily english, scottish, welsh or irish. it would be a different britain but still be britain. as john major once said:"fifty years on from now, britain will still be the country of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer, invincible green suburbs, dog lovers and old maids bicycling to holy communion through the morning mist."this will still be true without the monarchy. there is a good chance that some of the cricketers will be muslims and the old lady coming back from church will go home and eat curry for sunday lunch. do we really need the monarchy in modern britain? the island will not sink into the see if we don't have one, indeed it is more likely to sink with the queen flogging off all the sand."there will always be an england and england shall be free". for this freedom we do we really need the monarchy? or is it that freedoms in britain have come from opposing and restricting the monarchy? certainly our first 'constitution' was to restrict the domination of the bad king john:"no free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land. to no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice."so is it our freedoms that are enshrined in our culture and history which make britain? rather than the monarchy?

in the beginning





i thought a fitting way to start this blog would be with a scripture from the hebrew bible which is shared by jews, christians and some other religions. i'm sorry that i don't know relevant passages in other scriptures such as islamic or hindu scriptures. if you do then please let me know.i am starting with this because when i think about whether we should have a monarchy or not, for some reason this passage keeps coming int my mind.1 samuel 8:10-18samuel told all the words of yahweh to the people who asked of him a king.  he said,“this will be the manner of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them to him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots; and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will set some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.  he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. he will take your male servants, and your female servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them to his work.  he will take the tenth of your flocks: and you shall be his servants.  you shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall have chosen you; and yahweh will not answer you in that day.”
