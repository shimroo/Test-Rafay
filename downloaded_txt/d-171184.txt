warning!  jute thread is flammable.  please avoid open flames, sparks, or other items that could ignite the material.  do not smoke while wearing your suit.  all of our wearable garments are sprayed with a fire-retardant spray.  all ghillie kits come with one lb. of a dry fire-retardant powder that the customer mixes with water and applies to his/her suit.  we recommend dry cleaning only.  if you wash your suit with water, the fire-retardant must be re-applied.  we offer the dry fire-retardant on our website for re-applying to your suit.
