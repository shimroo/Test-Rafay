microfilms
 note: in 2002 norman ross publishing was 
        acquired by proquest, and all of the nrp microfilm titles were transferred 
        to them. however, proquest was not interested in the book titles owned 
        by nrp, so norman ross kept them and created ross publishing. in 2008 
        ross publishing began offering microfilm titles not available from proquest 
        for one reason or another, some of which are listed below. in the last 
        few years a number of librarians have reported having significant difficulties 
        purchasing some of the former nrp titles from proquest because proquest 
        cannot locate the masters. if you find yourself in this situation, you 
        are invited to contact norman ross, who may be able to help you.
(proquest also acquired norman ross's old clearwater 
        publishing titles that were originally sold in 1987 to reed/elsevier/cis.)

 three hundred 
        years of central american archives now available on microfilm
colonial records from 1544-1821 filmed 50 years 
        ago now available for the first time 
        the archivo general de centroamã©rica, 1544-1821, is the largest and most 
        important collection of documents on the early history of spanish central 
        america anywhere in the world. comprised of more than 144,000 primary 
        documents, it was preserved on approximately 4,000 reels of 16mm microfilm 
        nearly 40 years ago by mcmaster university in hamilton, ontario, canada, 
        in cooperation with the ministry of culture of guatemala. however, until 
        recently the microfilms were only available on site in the mills memorial 
        library at mcmaster. now, ross publishing, under agreements with both 
        mcmaster and the ministry of culture, is authorized to make copies of 
        the films available to libraries and researchers throughout the world 
        for the first time. 

âthe documents comprising the central american archives are unique 
        both as individual primary sources and in their assembly in the present 
        collection. they afford us at once a first-hand glimpse into the minutia 
        of a lost society, and in the aggregate, are a vast database documenting 
        the many facets of its workings.â âdr. john browning, professor emeritus 
        of spanish at mcmaster university
