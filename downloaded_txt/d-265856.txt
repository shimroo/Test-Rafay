testimonial 2
dawson is our partner in education"the combination of dawson’s elevated academic expectations, interactive learning opportunities, dedicated teachers, small class sizes, beautiful campus, safe environment, and tight-knit community cultivates an atmosphere where our daughters can excel intellectually, socially, and emotionally. they are learning to work hard, problem-solve, and help others while having fun and building meaningful relationships."- julie collins, dawson parent













testimonial 3 
i had amazing access to teachers"dawson is where i learned that you can be passionate about the things you do in school. dawson does a really great job of helping kids figure out what they really care about. i could talk to faculty about work i was struggling with or just talk to them about  the things i was interested in."- madison pelletier, class of 2016, graduate of nyu and university of cambridge













testimonial 4
my classmates are still my closest friends"i came to dawson in 5th grade from public school and am so grateful for the opportunity. at dawson, i was challenged academically and encouraged to try new things. my passion for golf was supported and nurtured, which took me to cal poly, but most importantly, it's where i found friends and mentors that are still some of my most cherished relationships."- cole nygren, class of 2012, cal poly graduate and us amateur golfer













testimonial 1
our experience at dawson has been incredible"we originally came to dawson for the smaller class sizes with that, the attention and accountability for our son. we’ve returned year after year because of the community dawson creates and the friends we’ve made along the way."- michelle yano, dawson parent
