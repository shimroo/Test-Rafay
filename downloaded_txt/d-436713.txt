                    manifests you can download, summarize, sort and email.


online buyer tools

                    and more.

                    there is no dollar minimum you need to spend with us. just 1 case, pallet or load of your choice.
                


inspect our merchandise
no appointments are necessary – just visit us during business hours, meet us in
                    person, see our facilities and our product first-hand to make sure they are right for you. we
                    practice transparency and encourage you to visit whenever possible!


we only sell wholesale
most liquidators operate both retail b2c channels as well as b2b channels. this
                    can provide a large incentive to some liquidators to separate loads according to their individual
                    sales needs prior to resale. via trading does not operate any retail channels.




widest variety of product in the industry
electronics, shoes, clothing, cosmetics, general merchandise, furniture,
                    tools/hardware, home décor, televisions, camping/outdoor items and much more.


a+ rating at bbb
the grade represents better business bureau degree of confidence that the
                    business is operating in a trustworthy manner and will make a good faith effort to resolve any
                    customer concerns.


nfma preferred supplier
via trading is proud to be recognized as the “national flea market association
                    preferred supplier”. liquidation merchandise is a great value add to flea market and swap meet
