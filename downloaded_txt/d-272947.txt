proserv act: subsea brownfield upgrade
the client required an extension of their existing subsea control system situated in a subsea tieback field in the ukcs. due to obsolescence and limit of operational spares, a threat to existing system maintenance and availability existed.
using our retrofit expertise and capabilities, proserv provided a fully redundant co-exist solution which secured not only the production capability but also provided the opportunity to plug in for future field extension opportunities.

rov operated subsea sampling system
subsea metering on individual wells is only effective when the meters are accurately calibrated, so that production efficiency can subsequently be improved.
proserv was approached by a multinational operator to provide a system that could take production samples to support subsea meter calibration at water depths of 2,500 metres, in west africa.
