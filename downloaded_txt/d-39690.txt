los angelesâ recent tragedy highlights the importance of fire safety in residential buildings. in this episode of condo craze and hoas, eric and karen break down floridaâs fire safety regulations for high-rise condominiums. weâll also explain what an elss entailsâcomponents like smoke detection, partial sprinkler systems, and fire doorsâand clarify that even condos that previously waived the fire sprinkler requirement must now comply.
