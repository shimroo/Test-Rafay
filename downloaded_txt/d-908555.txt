a sweet story....





marblesbabs miller was bagging some early potatoes for me.  i noticed a small boy, delicate of bone and feature, ragged but clean, hungrily appraising a basket of freshly picked green peas.  i paid for my potatoes but was also drawn to the display of fresh green peas.  i am a pushover for creamed peas and new potatoes.  pondering the peas, i couldn't help overhearing the conversation between mr. miller and the ragged boy next to me."hello barry, how are you today?""h'lo, mr. miller. fine, thank ya. jus' admirin' them peas, sure look good.""they are good, barry. how's your ma?""fine. gittin' stronger alla' time.""good. anything i can help you with?""no, sir. jus' admirin' them peas.""would you like to take some home?""no, sir. got nuthin' to pay for 'em with.""well, what have you to trade me for some of those peas?""all i got's my prize marble here.""is that right? let me see it.""here 'tis. she's a dandy.""i can see that. hmmmmm, only thing is this one is blue and i sort of go for red.  do you have a red one like this at home?""not zackley , but almost.""tell you what. take this sack of peas home with you and next trip this way let me look at that red marble.""sure will. thanks mr. miller."mrs. miller, who had been standing nearby, came over to help me. with a smile she said, "there are two other boys like him in our community, all three are in very poor circumstances.  jim just loves to bargain with them for peas, apples, tomatoes, or whatever. when they come back with their red  marbles, and they always do, he decides he doesn't like red after all and  he sends them home with a bag of produce for a green marble or an orange one, perhaps."  i left the stand smiling to myself, impressed with this man. a short  time later i moved to colorado but i never forgot the story of this man, the boys, and their bartering.several years went by, each more rapid that the previous one. just recently  i had occasion to visit some old friends in that idaho community and while  i was there learned that mr. miller had died. they were having his viewing  that evening and knowing my friends wanted to go, i agreed to accompany them. upon arrival at the mortuary we fell into line to meet the relatives of the deceased and to offer whatever words of comfort we could.  ahead of us in line were three young men. one was in an army uniform and the other two wore nice haircuts, dark suits and white shirts ... all very professional looking.  they approached mrs. miller, standing composed and smiling by her husband's casket.  each of the young men hugged her, kissed her on the cheek, spoke briefly with her and moved on to the casket.  her misty light blue eyes followed them as, one by one, each young man stopped briefly and placed his own warm hand over the cold pale hand in the casket.  each left the mortuary awkwardly, wiping his eyes.our turn came to meet mrs. miller. i told her who i was and mentioned the story she had told me about the marbles. with her eyes glistening, she took my hand and led me to the casket.  "those three young men who just left were the boys i told you about!  they just told me how they appreciated the things jim "traded" them.  now, at last, when jim could not change his mind about color or size ... they came to pay their debt.""we've never had a great deal of the wealth of this world," she  confided, "but right now, jim would consider himself the richest man in idaho."  with loving gentleness she lifted the lifeless fingers of her deceased husband. resting underneath were three exquisitely shined red marbles.moral of the story: we will not be remembered by our words, but by our kind deeds.life is not measured by the breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away.today, i wish you a day of ordinary miracles…a fresh pot of coffee you didn't make yourself…an unexpected phone call from an old friend…green stoplights on your way to work…the fastest line at the grocery store…a good sing-along song on the radio…your keys right where you left them.they say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but an entire lifetime to forget them.  so take the time now to call that special someone and remind them of how special they are to you.

signs you drink too much coffee





you answer the door before people knock. juan valdez named his donkey after you. you ski uphill. you grind your coffee beans in your mouth. you haven't blinked since the last lunar eclipse. you lick your coffeepot clean. you're the employee of the month at the local coffeehouse and you don't even work there. your eyes stay open when you sneeze.

some thoughts on stress management





a lecturer, when explaining stress management to an audience, raised a glass of water and asked, "how heavy is this glass of water?" answers called out ranged from 20g to 500g. the lecturer replied, "the absolute weight doesn't matter. it depends on how long you try to hold it. "if i hold it for a minute, that's not a problem.  if i hold it for an hour, i'll have an ache in my right arm.  if i hold it for a day, you'll have to call an ambulance.  "in each case,  it's the same weight, but the longer i hold it,  the heavier it becomes." he continued, "and that's the way it is with stress management.  if we carry our burdens all the time, sooner or later, as the burden becomes increasingly heavy, we won't be able to carry on."  "as with the glass of water, you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again.  when we're refreshed, we can carry on with the burden."  "so, before you return home tonight,  put the burden of work down. don't carry it home.  you can pick it up tomorrow.  whatever burdens you're carrying now, let them down for a moment if you can."  "relax,  pick them up later after you've rested.  life is short.  enjoy it!"  and then he shared some ways of dealing with the burdens of life:* accept that some days you're the pigeon, and some days you're the statue.* always keep your words soft and sweet,  just in case you have to eat them.* always read stuff that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it.* drive carefully.  it's not only cars that can be recalled by their maker.* if you can't be kind, at least have the decency to be vague.* if you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.* it may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to others.* never buy a car you can't push.* never put both feet in your mouth at the same time, because then you won't have a leg to stand on.* nobody cares if you can't dance well.  just get up and dance.* since it's the early worm that gets eaten by the bird, sleep late.* the second mouse gets the cheese.* when everything's coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.* birthdays are good for you.  the more you have, the longer you live.* you may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.* some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.* we could learn a lot from crayons.  some are sharp, some are pretty and some are dull.  some have weird names, and all are different colors, but they all have to live in the same box.* a truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.

healthy quotes to ponder





"you are the only problem you will ever have and you are the only solution. change is inevitable, personal growth is always a personal decision."bob proctor - author and speakeryou can always tell a real friend: when you've made a fool of yourself, she doesn't feel you've done a permanent job. - laurence j. peter"take good care of your body. it's the only place you have to live." - jimrohn"some people take better care of their pets than they do themselves. their animals can run like the wind and they can barely make it up a flight of stairs." - jim rohn"every life form seems to strive to its maximum except human beings. how tall will a tree grow? as tall as it possibly can. human beings, on the other hand, have been given the dignity of choice. you can choose to be all or you can choose to be less. why not stretch up to the full measure of the challenge and see what all you can do?" - jim rohn"some people don't do well simply because they don't feel well." - jim rohn "treat your body like a temple, not a woodshed. the mind and body work together. your body needs to be a good support system for the mind and spirit. if you take good care of it, your body can take you wherever you want to go, with the power and strength and energy and vitality you will need to get there." - jim rohn

the beauty of a woman





the beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears,the figure she carries, or the way she combs her hair. the beauty of a woman must be seen through her eyes,because that is the doorway to her heart,the place where love resides. the beauty of a woman is not in a facial mole,but true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul.it is the caring that she lovingly gives,the passion that she shows. the beauty of a womanwith passing years - only grows. copyright - teresa mahieu 2002

innocence - a poem





upon the dawnof the blind childs sight,an angel sangwhile in flight,a deaf child heardthis angels song,and for the first time eversang along.this angel wastheir precious host,sent to themby the holy ghost.and now foreverthese innocent three,are joined togetherenternally. by teresa burtoncopyright august 1984
