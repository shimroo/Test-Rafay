 carolina daylilies: hosta and iris  too!







welcome




general information newsi am pleased and honored to announce that in 2024 tom bruce was elected a director of the national japanese iris society for a three year term.  tom’s garden is also an official japanese iris display garden.tom bruce, in 2021, won the jeffcoat hybridizer award for ‘sunny attitude’ his very first introduction. our new garden beds, around the nursery building, highlight deer-resistant plantings. this unique display garden has signage giving the names of each plant. here you will find many varieties of our new hosta hanging baskets that are available in the hosta sales pavilion all priced at $17.00. if you keep them 5 feet or more above ground they become very deer-resistant. excellent choices for a porch or to hang in trees or on bird feeder poles.
