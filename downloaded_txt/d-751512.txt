had a great experience. gricelda helped me get into the car i wanted. was in and out, treated very respectfully and all questions i had were answered. i am very grateful, i was really in need of a vehicle it was time to retire the car i had. having poor credit was not an issue, and they even worked with me as far as the down payment. would definitely refer to kyle chapman.
