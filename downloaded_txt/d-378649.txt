al.07:10 13 may 16glenwoodie is a great place to learn how to play golf. the outdoor areas and restaurant are very nice places to kick back and relax. beautiful views of the green and geese can be seen from the deck just outside of the restaurant area. new golfers will love the place. everyone is polite and friendly. from those on the course to the staff in the golf shop and restaurant facilities, it is a very welcoming environment. the banquet room is huge with captivating views of the outdoor area. the putting green and drive areas are very well maintained. there is also a casino game arcade (must be 21 and older to play) area for guests wishing to unwind after a game in the bar area. glenwoodie is definitely worth a visit.see all reviews
