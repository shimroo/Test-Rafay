business cost due to lack of​ knowledge transfer (time,​ missed opportunities, ​delayed projects).




























55%







of manufacturers











are facing a substantial​ shortage of people  with the right skill set.




























56 yrs







average age

avoid unnecessary downtimes





manufacturing's high retirement rates and recruitment challenges create skill gaps. as a ​result, 70% of downtime issues stem from a lack of awareness about asset maintenance requirements. henkel training workshops address these challenges, helping manufacturers​ generate measurable results.

plant surveys





henkel’s plant surveys include a maintenance reliability analysis that helps uncover plant challenges such as shaft misalignment, vibrational loosening, and leaks. surveys help identify ways to improve maintenance processes and prevent downtime.














































maintenance reliability workshops





on-site maintenance reliability workshops can benefit both seasoned mro teams and new employees. workshops help identify the right products for maintenance processes and share expert knowledge of proactive maintenance best practices.














































henkel certified applicators





henkel certified applicators are dedicated to industrial maintenance, offering professional applied engineering services and other complementary maintenance engineering services.
our certified applicators are trained on surface protection and reconstruction, both in dynamic and static equipment, for composite applications, structural reinforcement systems for pipes and pressure vessels.
contact us to connect with a local henkel certified applicator.
