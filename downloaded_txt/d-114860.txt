                                       my kid loves going for karate in their tiny tigers class. levi is absolutely amazing with kids. i look up to him & would love to have his skill & patience with kids. my kid did not want to go at all after the 1st trial class. levi helped him adjust & enjoy while maintaining discipline. now he's excited about every class. each class is engaging & helps the kids develop different skills - strength, focus, patience, balance, discipline. levi sir's the reason i'm willing to travel to a class further from home than other available options. thank you soo much levi & akma!!

beyond expectations: how levi inspires excitement and growth in karate class
















                                        
                                       my two kiddos just started the tigers basic program for 3 months. this program also comes with a uniform. my children are aged 5 & 7. i was looking for an extracurricular activity to teach my kids about discipline, focus and hard work. we’ve only been attending for a few weeks, but i can already see the changes in my kids under the guidance of levi.not only are they enjoying learning martial arts, but their leader levi, also gives the kids life lessons about controlling their body, mind and emotions. it’s been a joy to see my children take these lessons and apply both their life lessons and maneuvers at home.

                                       i’m giving them 5 stars. i went to go check out the dojo and set up and to see how the classes were taught as i was scoping it out for my son who had bene in karate before and just asked to go back into it. reminded me of the dojo he grew up in who my now ex use to also be a part of i was very pleased with the family environment and the communication on just the first day. we have signed up for the program and will continue in it and likely putting my youngest in next year!

                                       this is an amazing place. i took my son who is autistic to try out and he loved it. after his first class he was so excited to go to the next class, he's sisters also started classes after him!! this place has amazing energy, and the staff is so friendly and kind.

master b is a great teacher all my kids look forward to going to class. i will always recommend them to any of my friends that want to get their kids into martial arts!!

this is an amazing place. 5-star review by adriana walsh 
















                                        
                                       just wanted to say: thank you for being a wonderful, positive place for madison to be a part of. she comes home from class and can not stop talking about what she learned and how great the class was. it warms my heart to know she has wonderful people to make her life better and that even after 4 years she still comes home with something she learned and did better than last time.

                                       i've been a student at akma for ten years and i can honestly say that my training here has changed my life. i originally joined to learn some cool moves, but it has become so much more than that. my training bleeds into all aspects of my life, both physically and mentally, and really helps me live a healthy lifestyle. my basketball game has certainly improved, and there are even benefits to my career. i love how i can find my limits and then push past them, getting physically fit and learning a practical skill at the same time.

i'm also the father of three young boys -- my oldest, age 7, is in the youth class. the increased confidence and fitness he gains will serve him very well at this young age. his mind will be sharper, helping at school, and he's going to have a huge advantage in sports.

we really enjoy spending time practicing our kung fu together. it's a fun way to bond. i can't wait for his little brothers to join us!

                                       kempo martial arts is awesome! i have been a member for a number of years. my son and daughter started coming and they have had a great time. learning a lot, getting fit and looking great at it all at the same time. it also gives us something in common to work on together.

sometimes the kids are stubborn and don't want to go but afterwards they always say they had a good time and like it. an additional benefit is my wife and i noticed their attitudes and overall behavior is better as well.

compliments to akma. great program, great support and fun for all of us.

                                       my kids love this place - it build character and important life skills in a very interactive way. the experiences is personalized to each kid. both kids (5 and 6 y/o) enjoy going to the classes and look forward to earning the new stripes/belts. we really appreciate instructors focus on the whole person. this month they are learning about stranger danger in a very tangible way - i feel that they can apply these skills right away and be more prepared to deal with different types of situations. my daughter is very outgoing, she benefits from the emphasis on focus and balance. my son needs to learn how to be more self-confident - instructors are helping her to be more comfortable in different situations. my husband and i love observing the class and how instructors interact with kids. every class is very dynamic and goes really fast.

                                       what i particularly like about this place is they genuinely care about the students. not only do they teach the techniques but also discipline, self control self confidence and they talk about how to achieve these things and make sure they are improving and are comfortable with everything that is being taught.

                                       i have a four year old and an eight year old, both girls that started going here in september. they love it and this will be a long term activity for them as the instructors couldn't be better. i wouldn't change a thing.

                                       if you are looking for a school that participates in tournaments and hands out trophies to make you feel good - or a school that 'sells' you a blackbelt - i would suggest looking elsewhere.

if you are serious about learning self defense techniques that work and getting into the best shape of your life then academy of kempo martial arts just might be what you're looking for.

the instructors are top notch and serious about helping every student succeed in meeting their personal training goals - so when you are advanced in belt level you know it's because you earned it!

this school has a great family atmosphere! you owe it to yourself to stop in and check it out.

                                       excellent school! instructors are very informative and connect with the students fantastically. our 7 year old son has been going here almost 1 year. he has been able to channel his energy here and has developed greatly in the areas of self control and goal oriented planning.

i can not say enough how family oriented this school is. they have a genuine interest in the full scope of the child's life and well being. they very aptly teach not only kung fu but life skills as well, that will remain with anyone who attends their classes.

well done akma federal way! from quality instruction to scolarship programs... thank you for the time you take to build people up!

                                       ms. pendley is great! lets me go at my own pace, tailors lessons to my goals and learning style. very understanding about the anxiety i suffer that trips me up sometimes.

i arrive to my lessons early and get to see her and mr. b. with the kids' class, and they are very patient with them, and they make their classes fun while still making sure the kids are doing their moves correctly. they are respectful to their students of all ages and gender, and emphasize that to the students.

i take private lessons.

                                       best teachers who work with your limitations in a positive way. i have trouble with some of the advanced moves, and mr. leeson makes sure to take some time to further explain how it's done. incredibly family friendly, and a overall good place if you want to learn self defense, gain confidence and to get your stress out on a good hard workout.

                                       not just a school a family. our kids now 9 and 15 have been attending the school for just over a year. the changes we have seen in them have been incredible. just the boost in their self confidence alone has been amazing. this school is a positive place for kids to stay in shape and learn discipline, respect and self defense.

the students are also taught to encourage and help fellow students. the wonderful instructors not only care about how the kids are doing in their class but also care about how they are doing in school and at home. they want to help the kids be the best that they can be in life. we looked for a long time for a school that did not focus on competition (being the best) as we wanted to find a school that taught kids to always strive be their best. this school is it!! we feel very welcome when we come in for the kids classes.

we are encouraged to stay and watch if we desire (we usually do). the positive attitude that is taught is contagious, you can't help but feel more positive yourself when you leave. both of our kids have health issues that at times make it difficult for them to participate 100% in class but the instructors are great at working with them during those times. we feel that because of what they have learned here they know that they can achieve anything if they are determined and work hard!! we just can't wait until our 2 year old is old enough to start taking classes!! if you are thinking about putting your kids in martial arts classes come in and check out the school you won't be disappointed, we definitely weren't!!!
