welcome to village of attica
                        village of attica....a great place to live!
						
in the village of attica, we are defined less by boundaries on a map than by the sense of shared values our residents hold dear. small town values, guided growth, preservation of historical, cultural, and natural heritage are just a few of the core principles that makes village of attica a wonderful place to call home.







conserve water
it's our most precious natural resource.  every drop counts...





shop local
whether it is a local farmer's market or main street shops, shopping local sustains our community and supports local merchants.  a win-win for all!
