we are excited to introduce a groundbreaking conveyor belt that combines cutting-edge technology and eco-conscious design – ammdurance rpet. 







meet duratemp – our new heat-resistant synthetic belt
one of the most significant challenges in the bakery industry is heat resistance. in this industry, it’s not enough that conveyor belts are efficient and meet hygienic standards. they also need to withstand constant heat and operate without delaminating. that’s why we came up with the idea for the duratemp belt.
