c & c sports
brighton, michigan
in 1972, bill piggins and two co-workers quit their jobs at an engineering firm and set out to make a living from their love for motorcycles. they purchased a little yellow 2500 sq. ft. store on grand river, hired one employee and opened a shop selling yamaha motorcycles and massey-ferguson lawn equipment. as c & c sports business improved, they acquired more vehicle lines, hired more employees, and remodeled the little yellow store. bill bought his partner's shares and is steering c & c sports into the future, riding on a commitment to his customers and livingston county. the newest addition to the store are cf moto atvs.
