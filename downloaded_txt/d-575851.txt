"we've experienced a 75% savings with yapp and the ease of use is evident—it took me just 2 hours to build everything. and when i had any questions, the response was quick and understandable. our experience was so positive, we're eager to use it again!”
sally mcclellanexecutive director, scaeyc 







“i say this to anyone looking at event apps in the association management profession. yapp is by far the best solution we have come across to engage our attendees during events and reduce our overall event printing cost. i could and would list all the great things about yapp but your group just need to use yapp.”
john meidlmembership & events, ncpeds







“the feedback has been tremendous. every time i am running the app at an event i get asked how they can get it and use it for their next event.”
brian adamekdigital media manager, verizon
