my hobby is  genealogy.   check out my
	ancestors and let me hear from you if you have any connections.


another hobby is  photography 
and astronomy   here is a link to a couple of basic photos that i am 
beginning to accumulate, including a short example of how i "stiched" 
together some individual shots to make a crescent moon, the ring nebula
from 6,000 light years away, a red moon that is seen in a luner eclipse,
the straight wall next to the crater ptolemaeus and a shot of jupiter.


if you have the time, visit the highland road observatory in baton rouge.  it
is open to the public for viewing every friday and saturday night.  the
pictures at this link were taken with telescopes at that observatory.
