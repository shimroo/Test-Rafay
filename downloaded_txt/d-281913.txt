tacoma 2025: make yourself at home



jan 2, 2025




as we take our first steps into the new year, we’re thinking again about home and how we make it. we’ve collected 8 ways we’ve made ourselves at home in tacoma and made friends with the city. making friends with a place is kind of like making friends with a person—you listen, show up, help out, pay attention, participate, and receive. after a while you’ve made a connection that didn’t exist before. go to a festival, become a regular, follow some local news, help out, be pals with the library, explore local history and art, do something new. these 8 ideas aren’t deep tacoma secrets. rather, think of this list like suggested ingredients for making yourself at home.
