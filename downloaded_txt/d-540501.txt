"quality always costs less"










 
why choose jk antennas?
there are many antenna manufacturers for amateur radio operators to choose from. what makes us different?
 
we design and build the antennas we would want to use, with
â¬ the highest quality materials, all made in the usa
â¬ heavy duty design, calculated to withstand powerful winds and heavy icing
â¬ tailored to the needs of our customers
 
we build our products to last. we know, from personal experience, the frustrations of replacing sub-par antennas, and antennas that do not perform as advertised. once you get our antenna on the air, we want you to stay on the air. we want our repeat customers buying new bands of antennas and recommending us to their friends, not replacing antennas that have broken down after three or four years.
 








jk antennas will selectively and progressively make available most of the legacy force12 yagi models such as the xr5. c3, c3s, c4, 4ba, 5ba, 6ba etc and the vertical lines such as the sigma-5, sigma-80, etc. the legacy models will be re-optimized using nec4 by jk and mechanically built to specification as the other jk models.









our clients are our strength and foundation ....


jk antennas stellar growth, since our launch has been due our loyal customer base.  our satisfied customers transition into vocal ambassadors for the jk brand. our strong sales has been from word of mouth referrals and repeat customers. we appreciate and thank our loyal customer base and look forward to engaging new customers as the expansion of the jk brand continues ...
