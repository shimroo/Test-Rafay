information is your most valuable resource.
our mission is to gather and organize uncommon and unexplored information.





community newspapers:
chronicling people, places, and events over time.
working with hundreds of small-town local community newspapers,
                                        weâve digitized millions of pages which contain billions of data points
                                        from the exclusive information stored in unique archives. the local
                                        newspaper has chronicled the seemingly random and ordinary
                                        information that we organize into an accessible format with value never
                                        before realized.


museums & historical societies:
troves of undiscovered knowledge revealed.
thousands of town museums and historical societies for decades and
                                        centuries have been collecting and organizing the narrow slice of information
                                        related to a defined geography and citizenry. data that at first appears low
                                        value is being discovered for its depth and detail. artifacts once viewed as
                                        strictly local are now considered high value by a broad audience.
















undiscovered information: most valuable of all.
discovery requires expert planning, physical action, and application of divergent
                                    technologies.

myheritage inks license agreement with smalltownpapers to mine its
                        historical archive for âdigital dnaâ using artificial intelligence

×



smalltownpapers, inc. has announced that genealogy research platform and family dna testing
                        provider myheritage has acquired a license to use content from the companyâs extensive digitized
                        archive collection to enhance research conducted through the myheritage online genealogy
                        platform. 
myheritage is extracting âdigital dnaâ from the pages of select small-town newspaper archives for
                        assimilation across its voluminous proprietary databases. the license agreement provides
                        israel-based myheritage access to a unique cross section of this exclusive newspaper archive,
                        which includes family and other information useful to researchers and genealogists worldwide.
                    
the data extracted from these newspaper records, potentially numbering in the hundreds of
                        millions, can greatly enrich the connections that myheritage is able to provide its customers
                        while researching their own family history. 
âafter learning from myheritage founder and ceo gilad japhet how the companyâs proprietary
                        technology assimilates newspaper archives in this highly advanced manner, i felt that the
                        uniqueness of our archives would provide tremendous new value to their incredible database,â
                        explained paul jeffko, founder and president of smalltownpapers. âamerican small towns generate
                        extraordinary information but it can be time consuming to access and easy to overlook relevant
                        connections. using small-town archives in this way demonstrates that myheritage is on a
                        brilliant track,â jeffko added.
myheritage uses artificial intelligence applied through its sophisticated extraction and matching
                        technologies to identify names, relationships, locations and other data across a wide span of
                        time from the newspaper archives. the result is more meaningful family and historical
                        connections for their customers.
smalltownpapersâ chief scientist mike meadway sees newspaper archives as an untapped trove of
                        data. âour content can be analyzed through the use of ai to extract previously undiscovered
                        information which is personal and local yet correlates to and across geographical boundaries,
                        giving researchers deeper and more rounded pictures of people and providing new avenues of
                        research to pursue. there are many practical applications,â meadway said.
started two decades ago, smalltownpapers has been working to digitize millions of pages of
                        archives that have been at particular risk of permanent loss. many are from small media markets
                        and include specialty newspapers where the pages were never microfilmed and many have an archive
                        consisting only of a single copy. smalltownpapers has obtained, scanned and now owns many of
                        these archives and today is working with publishers and historical stakeholders across the us to
                        ensure even more of these newspaper archives are digitally preserved.
