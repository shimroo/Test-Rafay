ocean rates are based upon the cubic space in the ocean container that the cargo occupies with the cost varying, depending upon the country and city destination. our rate covers warehouse receiving, tallying, loading into container, documentation and ocean transport. these costs are included in your box rate; however, there will be local destination/delivery charges upon warehouse release per custom of the port. this charge can either be prepaid or collected upon delivery. it is also important to understand that customs clearance, duties and taxes, if any, are the obligation of the receiving consignee; however, in most countries it is possible to clear customs yourself and normally duty is not levied on your own used personal effects. we cannot be held responsible for customs entry, but our delivery agent can offer this service should you choose. lastly, minimum charges are standard in the ocean transport industry and warehousing facilities. we attempt to keep these as low as possible and they are indicated in the country rates.terms and conditions
