the irish draught horse society (gb) was formed in 1979 by a group of enthusiasts wishing to register their irish draught bred horses in great britain.  the society has grown enormously since then and is dedicated to the preservation, protection and promotion of the irish draught breed.  the idhs (gb) is a passport issuing organisation (pio), for both pure and part-bred irish draughts.
