							north dakota hockey season ticket holders,
with tonight's weather and road conditions, including potential road closures, we understand that travel may be difficult for tonight's und vs. western michigan game at the ralph. for those choosing not to attend tonight's game, we encourage you to sell or forward your tickets on the tm exchange platform through your my north dakota account.
in recognition of the travel conditions tonight, we have lowered the minimum ticket listing price to $20 per seat in the lower bowl and $15 per seat in the upper bowl. if you have already listed your tickets for sale, you can adjust your price now to as low as $20 lower bowl / $15 upper bowl.
