we start by understanding the lived realities of children 
 


our projects empower young people and communities to measure and build their own capacities.
 


our team taps into the power of play to bring child rights to life.
 


we work collectively to support community ownership and positive outcomes for children
 


our stories shine light on our learning with young people 
 























lead with children. transform our world.
imagine what it would look like if children co-created the world around us. the international institute for child rights and development sees the potential to transform child rights and step boldly into leading with children and youth to create a better future for us all.
