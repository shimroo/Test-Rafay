for 200 years
the essence of a cultural and family heritage


saint-etienne acquired its official status as the french gun making capital under the reign of louis xv (1715-1774), thanks to the outstanding know-how of its craftsmen.the company founder, claude verney, who set up the business in 1820, was himself the heir to a long saint-etienne tradition. so was his wife, antoinette carron, daughter and granddaughter of gunsmiths. they put all the manufacturing secrets of their respective families together and propelled the business forward through both creative and artistic enhancement.verney-carron collection is the very best of what we do, and the quintessence of our maisonâs know-how. it is a perfect mix of traditional craftsmanship and cutting-edge technology of today. in other words, itâs a combination of every virtue of âhand craftedâ and the high performance of a gun built and machined with our companyâs most sophisticated equipment.
