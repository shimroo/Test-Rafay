fuller truck accessories:a family legacy since 1976
 

in the spring of 1976, bruce and barbara mihelich took a leap of faith and opened the doors to what was then fuller camper in fullerton, california. over 45 years later, this family-run, veteran-owned business has grown into a trusted name in the truck accessory industry, now proudly known as fuller truck accessories.
from those early days of distributing wood and aluminum camper shells to today’s cutting-edge truck accessories, fuller truck accessories has always prioritized one thing: you, our customer.
with two stores and three generations working side by side, we are dedicated to helping you outfit your truck with everything you need to hit the road, the trails, or the job site in style and comfort.
