										overall, i've had a pretty good experience. been a customer for just over a month. received the modem within 2 business days. hooked up in less than 5 minutes. internet speeds meet the package i purchased. billing has also been seamless. only 4 stars as the modem i received is apparently not up to date. my wi-fi devices (phone/ipad) recommend i update the modem. that part worries me as i'm an older none techy person.

										good service. i like that they don't have "promotional discounts" that expire after some number of months, it's just a flat rate that you get forever at a fair price. it's been consistent so far, haven't noticed any slowdowns or anything - some of the other companies were notorious for that so it's a nice change.

can i use my own modem?



										yes! you can use your own modem. a list of compatible modems can be found on the order page after the serviceability check. once you click on “order now” you will see the modem option - select “use your own”.
									




how do i check the address serviceability?



										on the website home page, check for the box on the top that says, “check service availability”. enter your detailed address including the street number, name, unit number, unit type and postal code.
									




are you using rogers or bell line?



										telcan is an internet service provider (isp) that owns its own network and manages its own internet capacity. we use the “last mile” from rogers, bell, and videotron to connect the service to the customer’s premises. therefore the in-premise installation is done by rogers/bell/videotron technicians.
									




no internet/intermittent internet troubleshooting steps




check to make sure all of your cords and cables are securely connected to your router and modem. sometimes a loose connection can cause problems with your internet.
restart your router and modem by unplugging them, waiting a minute, and then plugging them back in. this can help reset your internet connection and potentially fix any issues.
try connecting to the internet using a different device, such as a laptop or phone. if you can connect using another device, then the problem is likely with the original device and not your internet 
connection.
if you're using a wireless connection, try moving your device closer to your router to see if that improves your connection. sometimes a weak wireless signal can cause issues with your internet.
if none of these steps work, you may need to contact please contact our 24/7 bilingual support from either of the method below, thank you!
