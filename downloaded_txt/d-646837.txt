what's broken? 

















mirror glass
choose a redi cuts® mirror replacement if just your mirror glass is broken and your backing plate is intact.













backing plate
choose a redi-set-go® mirror replacement if your backing plate is damaged/missing. rsg mirrors include a pre-applied motor mount, restoring the functionality of your backing plate.













motor head assembly
a burco mirror replacement cannot connect to a broken motor head/actuator. in most cases, the entire mirror assembly needs to be replaced.
