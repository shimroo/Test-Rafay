about w. kohler lamp co.



mesquite lamps          the mesquite, called “velvet” is handpicked from the sonora desert once each year. the beauty you behold in each piece has unfolded from a tale of survival in the harsh desert. long droughts, floods, extreme temperatures and constant attack from insects create a lasting remnant of nature’s life-cycle.  the sculptured, free form designs are achieved through 17 separate processes. many pieces are enhanced with turquoise inlay or naturally occurring holes.  the golden-yellow color on the edges of many pieces is the sap ring of the wood. the satin smooth finish is the result of fine sanding and multiple applications of danish oil.   solid copper shades          lampshades, evolving through 22 distinct processes, are crafted from hand- cut pieces of solid copper, milled in the southwest.   designs are punched or individually cut by hand using a plasma cutter.  colors are achieved with a secret recipe of natural elements developed over a 25 year span of trial and error. a clear lacquer, also used on luxury automobiles, is applied to preserve the outer finish. the inside is left “raw copper” to develop a colorful organic beauty through its own natural life-cycle.  all shades feature soldered seams and wire reinforced edges that are designed to be enjoyed through many generations.
