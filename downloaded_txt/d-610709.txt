about hafner vineyard
hafner vineyard is a small family winery in alexander valley near healdsburg in sonoma county. we produce cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, a malbec blend called “next red”, rosé and sparkling blanc de blancs from only grapes grown at the winery. we have been growing grapes and producing wine for over 50 years. all our wines are “estate bottled”. we barrel-age in our wine caves and release our wines later than others to allow them to develop and mature. our wines are only sold direct to our patrons and leading california restaurants; not in any retail shops. three generations of hafners work here to deliver high quality wine at a great value with personal service.


visit us
on the first and third friday of each month at 2 pm, we welcome patrons and friends to the winery for a tour and tasting. led by a family member, we enjoy sharing what is happening in the vineyard and in the winery, followed by tasting new and older wines in the caves. just call or email us to reserve a place or to inquire about additional tour availability.
