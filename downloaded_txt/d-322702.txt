dingeman yearbook

 
order your yearbook today!  price is $50.  
due to popular demand, our 2023-2024 dingeman yearbooks sold out. unfortunately, many dingeman families didn’t get a yearbook because they didn’t purchase it during the pre-sale and we only had a limited supply at the end of the year. don’t let that happen to you!  
the last day to purchase yearbooks is friday, april 19, 2025. only a limited number of copies will be available outside of the pre-sales. however, don’t rely on that and reserve your copy today. your child will thank you later!  yearbook distribution date in 2025 is tbd.
please get your yearbook here:  https://dingeman.net/packet/yearbook/signinpacketpage/0
