support for behavior analysts along their chosen path





























i specialize in supporting behavior analysts and other contextual behavior scientists through training, program consultation, and coaching—wherever you are in the world, or on your path. for nearly 30 years, i have dedicated myself to the compassionate practice of behavior analysis, helping people live meaningful, values-driven lives.  i am committed to capacity building, continually improving our field, and nurturing the next generation of behavior analysts. i am also geekily passionate about the potential that an rft lens brings to language intervention programs, and about the potential for an rft lens to help us understand how to more effectively use language as intervention. my work is grounded in values of rigor, generosity, and kindness, and the importance of connecting with joy and with community. i hope you’ll join me in exploring innovative, values-based approaches to behavior analysis and making a positive impact together.read more about siri and her work.
