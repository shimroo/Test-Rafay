you'll  love our lucets!!!  
 we
have been making and using the lucet since 1985.  they come packaged with
thread and instructions.  i have written a book that is filled with
information on the history and technique of making different types of cording,
uses for the finished cord and different types of thread to use on the lucet.
 we make a quality wood lucet that has a silken finish.
 
   
i began using the lucet back in 1983 when i was re-enacting and needed a time
period 1750 or earlier needlework weaving tool, to take with me.  i needed
something portable and the lucet was period correct and easy to learn.  the
resulting finished cord comes in handy for many uses during medieval, colonial
and modern times.  before the advent of buttons, hook 'n' eyes, and  zippers,
cording was the only way to keep clothing on the body and it was also used for
decorative trims, and parts of jewelry.

you may need to know
  our prices...


   


we use beautiful domestic and rare
  exotic hard woods for all of our lucets, so you are getting a quality tool
  which will last a lifetime.  prices are based on type of wood...
