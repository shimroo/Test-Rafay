helping you stay pain-free and 
mobile whatever your age or activity. 



i have been practicing as a podiatrist since 1989. during the past 36 years, i have been fortunate enough to gain a wealth of experience from my 10 years in the nhs, and the subsequent full-time private practice.
i am passionate about my work and focus my efforts on providing a complete package of care. my dedication has allowed me to grow a successful practice treating paediatric and adults.
i consult out of several private hospitals across central london and hertfordshire and have a good relationship with medical insurers and international embassies as well as offering self-pay packages.
as an established specialist, i enjoy good working relationships with a range of health care practitioners including gp’s and medical specialists from across the medical spectrum. this allows me to provide my clients with expert care and support services as part of a multidisciplinary team.
