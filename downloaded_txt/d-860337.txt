ââwhenever i start a new project, i revisit my tagline: hunting truth, gathering hope and weaving stories.  i daydream about success and think about what might happen if the book becomes a blockbuster movie.  how might thoughts, inked on paper today, impact people tomorrow. i am both humbled and energized by the responsibility.â 
j.c. moore











"by and large, my stories feature people of african descent.  i think itâs important to feature characters that are proud, smart and real.  we have too much negative, stereotypical imagery in print and in celluloid.  just because a story is based upon a real event doesnât make it suitable for public consumption"
j.c. moore











âi am always surprised by my success. when strangers tell me they are moved by my stories i am amazed. itâs so gratifying to know that my work makes a difference.  after all, thatâs why i write. to impact thoughts, attitudes, behavior and thus effect organic change in the world. it never gets old for me. i am truly blessed.â
