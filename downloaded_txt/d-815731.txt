testimonials 



what survivors say about  our organization 


















						
“i have had a life time of abusive relationships and i always blamed myself. the crisis center helped me to understand the cycle of abuse and helped me to understand it wasn’t my fault.”					





crisis centerclient/survivor 






						“i came here not knowing i was in an abusive situation, even though i knew something was wrong.  my ex is very cruel and has put me through almost everything imaginable.  it was nice to have a place where you could gather knowledge and strength to face your fears.  i did face my fears and surprised myself that i could live through them when i did not think i could!”					





crisis centerclient/survivor 






						“no one really talks about or acknowledges domestic violence in upper socio-economic demographics, but the impact is just as real and, in some ways, even harder to overcome. the crisis center and its supporters helped me tremendously, but more importantly my son has improved as a result of the resources at the crisis center. it is one of the few places my challenges have been understood and supported because domestic violence usually only ends once someone dies.”

crisis centerclient/survivor 






						the crisis center has been my safe haven. i feel valued and understood. i got support here at a time i was not getting it anywhere. it has helped me tremendously.					





crisis centerclient/survivor 






						i was so afraid and alone. the crisis center saved my life. i don't have words to express how valuable of an agency this is. it has helped me find freedom, safety and peace for me and my daughters!					





crisis centerclient/survivor 






						i thought the crisis center would only help my son with his trauma from domestic violence. i was so happy that i was also offered therapy as a single dad!
