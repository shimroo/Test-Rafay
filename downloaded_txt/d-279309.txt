what my customers say!




“highest recommendation for larry schlesser and this re/max team. they really know their stuff. my family has bought and sold several properties on roatan over the last two decades. and unlike other folks we dealt with in the past, larry’s team is responsive, communicative, and solution oriented. when you’re dealing with long distances and language and rules that are new to you–that can-do attitude is invaluable. we were contending with a rather complicated deal and larry went above and beyond to simplify it and get it done. honest. helpful. friendly. professional. i don’t know why you’d use anybody else.”
jen stevens, editor “international living magazine”




“i have known larry schlesser since 2001 as a very capable and honest real estate broker. what separates larry and his company from the competition is their integrity. i have purchased properties on roatan through larry and roatan real estate and recommend them to anyone interested in a capable and honest broker. my future purchases will be through roatan real estate.”
val washington, circuit court judge, retired genesee county michigan




“just a quick word about re/max bay islands and especially larry schlesser. i have dealt with a lot of realtors/realestate companies in the past and must say that larry is the best. he is very knowledgable and not pushy. he makes you very comfortable in your roatan experience. his best attribute is his customer service skills don’t end after the transaction. he has helped me before, during and after the sale and continues to assist and answer any needs i have had about roatan. i would recommend him to anyone seeking to buy or sell property/investments in roatan as he has shown me an attention to detail and ethics rarely seen, even in the u.s. thanks larry!”
