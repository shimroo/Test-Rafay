to blog - or not to blog!






i've finally decided i should get back to blogging. writing is something i've enjoyed thoroughly over the years, but it's also something i havent been regular with either. i hope this four year hiatus is the last (and certainly not longest!) i've ever taken. 


happy writing - to me!

new favorite song alert: "how you like me now?" by the heavy






i've been enjoying a lot of music from the uk recently. "breakeven" by the script had me enthralled for days and now along come the heavy with "how you like me now?" to break that spell. especially cool was their letterman performance. i've never seen the guy ask for an encore, but he did with this performance. 

wonder what's next? i hope it's something similar old school, big band-ish music, like the sort amy winehouse makes. 

any other recommendations welcome!

shashi tharoor's ted video: why nations should pursue "soft" power





shashi tharoor has got to be one of the most prolific leaders india has ever produced. i thought this video was going to show the examples of soft power from several countries, but instead came off too much as an ad for his own country, india - one it really doesnt need! the points he makes, though, are well-suited to the audience: thought leaders and public intellectuals from all over the globe, gathered at a conference on technology, entertainment and design. pakistan can clearly learn a lot from its neighbor. 

hope you enjoy tharoor at his best!
