.
tina began her real estate career in san francisco in 1976 assisting the owner and multiple agents of one of the city’s most successful high-volume brokerages. she developed a deep understanding of every aspect of real estate — knowledge that helped her become the veteran bay area industry leader she is today.
highly self-motivated and committed to confidentiality and positive outcomes for her clients, she joined sotheby’s international realty in 2004 and consistently ranks among the company’s top producers, regularly securing top-tier sales volumes in both the town of sonoma and across wine country.
the shone group also includes her son evan and daughter amanda, both licensed sales agents, specializing in listing and selling property of all types throughout the bay area and northern california wine country, with expertise in rural, vineyard, equestrian, development and historic properties.
