last call to get in your new member skills coaching session!

this is a required session of category 4 & 5 new members to race the club series, and is one of the crca's agreements with nyc parks in order to hold races in central park. we have three races left in the season, and 2 of them are this coming weekend! this last new member skill session is this wednesday morning at 6:30am, meeting at 110th street at the adam clayton powell blvd entrance to the central park loop road. you must rsvp for the session, details to do so are in the event description on our club calendar: https://www.crca.net/schedule 

please note that there are two coaching sessions on wednesday morning, and only the new member skills session meets the requirement, not the sprinting session. looking forward to meeting/ seeing many of you there!
