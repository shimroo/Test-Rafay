welcome to the pocket flag project. 

we want our active duty deployed and deploying soldiers to know that we care and that we keep them in our hearts and our prayers. we are a non-profit organization funded entirely by donations. we encourage you to learn more and join the movement either by donating funds or folding flags for them.
