new greg platzer pickup set up shredder telecasters. 

 by admin /  0 comments 



greg platzer is the bomb when it comes to all things electric guitar.  he has and still works with some of the most notable guitarist in the biz. i met him at namm years ago and we became guitars buddies. here is his web site (https://gregplatzerguitars.com/). check him out is outrageously awesome!  i sent my blonde tele that was a gift from danny shay in new york and also my sunburst fender road worn that bill cumminsky (head of fender at that time) gave me.  the blonde “shay” tele greg outfitting with pickup from carondelet  (https://carondeletpickups.com/) that he special ordered for my guitars.  bonde tele will have a split coil humbucker at the bridge and a hum at the rhythm position.  my fender worn will be set up as a stratocaster with a spit coil hum at the bridge, a single coil in the middle and single coil in the rhythm position.  both guitars will scream like crazy no doubt.  i can’t wait to get back from detroit sessions, put the necks back on and try them out.  the pickups in the pic are considered zebras.

creating live performance tracks 

 by admin /  0 comments 



i have to be honest, i hate playing live with performance tracks, but in the process of creating live tracks, you find that songs tend to get a microscopic overview.  this detailed inspection is super important because it helps you to see the material in a variety of perspectives: fan, promoter, radio, first time fan, rehearsal value and just as a you develop your artist thumb print.  i have been an audio engineer for 39 years and creating wonderfully sounding live performance tracks is not easy.   i have enlisted the help of veteran live audio guitar hero producer e hill.  we produce the tracks in protools cutting frequencies that one may never cut on a record so that when we audition is on a live pa in the big room at the studio, the tracks hold up and do not over shadow me the artist.  these tracks consist of electric bass and simple drums kick/hat/snare.  these tracks give me a rehearsal vehicle to tighten my skills up for the live performance, provide audio for the trio to learn and when i am in a situation where the promoter wants my shredder live show and the trio is not available, the tracks allow me to perform live to sell the live trio. 
so, there are many benefits to the live tracks.  take from a music industry veteran, great sounding live tracks are one of the most difficult things i have done in the studio engineering world. note: remember to use the exact same kit and program on every song.

surrounding yourself with butt kickers 

 by admin /  0 comments 



hey gang, just a few words about my journey so far into my new world of solo performance.  as you may know, i have been performing for 39 years professionally as a hired gun/singer for many artists and that in it’s self is a job that requires precision focus.  i now have a new shredder trio with craig langford on bass and vocals, stephen ritter on drums and vocals, and e. hill on sound, steve trudell songs and management, my wife shell healthy love, encouragement, bravery, logic and sensibility. these four individuals have changed my life to a degree of feeling like i have just decided to play guitar for the first time.  surrounding your self with people that kick your butt is key!  they inspire, push, encourage and they sit back and help you help yourself.  the biggest problem with being an artist is knowing when to get out of your own way and get some help. 
on stage craig and stephen have taken my focus to another level and that makes me a better solo performer, kicking my butt because these cats are the best at what they do.
“e” is giving me insight to focusing my goals on a much hired level and a player, performer and front stage man that connects to any audience.  he is a monster sound guy that makes the trio sound killer out front, and this is as important as anyone in my group. 
trudell inspires me to write hit songs and constantly inspect my look, vibe, sound and focus as an entertainer. 
shell is the only solid rock i can stand on on this earth.  i could never put a value on her love and support.  she makes me who i am .

how to practice your instrument the proper way. 

 by admin /  0 comments 



this method can be applied to a rehearsal of one song or a rehearsal of many songs that may be part of a live show. 
many times players will sit down, and do what i call diddle with their instrument, without any focus.  yes, they are playing but without a focus muscle memory is left a disadvantage.
i am working on my new shredder power trio 90 min show. i create a rough set list loading all of the audio into my itunes for rehearsal in the order of the live set list.  i first rehearse through all the songs three times and simply play guitar without singing so that i am focused on arrangement, groove and timing.  i make notes on the ones that i am rusty on and need more work.  i create a list of the songs that need attention and begin rehearsing each song 5 to 10 times.  i may have to stop and work on a part here and there, but the idea is that i need to run them until the muscle memory is automatic.   once i have the individual songs rehearsed then i run the set list again with no singing 3 times.  now i take a break and come back to run the entire show with singing and playing.   the idea of compartmentalizing the rehearsal allows for greater success.
