everyone has a part to play 



at pikes peak united way, we believe there is more that connects us than divides us. that’s why live united is not just a slogan – it’s the vision of a community that believes we are stronger together than we ever could be apart. 








 

























we all know someone in need 





whether we realize it or not. your next door neighbor may be struggling to put enough food on the table. or your child’s teacher could be a few bills away from homelessness. need does not discriminate – that’s why we’re here. 






i need some help

















those needs start at the root 





we are fortunate to be part of a global united way network – with resources and insight into “the big picture.” this insight tells us that access to education, healthy living, and financial stability lie at the root of our community’s needs. if we can tackle these initiatives, we know our impact will ripple through colorado springs. 






i want to learn about your key initiatives











just some of our impact from last year 











100,000+ 



people served through pikes peak united way  







2,151 



people received free tax filing services 







46,417 



people reached out to 2-1-1 as their first stop when they needed help 


















 


















 









tackling root causes requires a network of nonprofits 





we can’t do it alone. our nonprofit partners are vital to helping every person find the support they need. pikes peak united way acts as the hub – connecting those in need with the nonprofits and resources that can help them get back on their feet. this is only possible through the hard work and dedication of our nonprofit community. 






i'm a nonprofit who wants to partner

















an infinite network powered by you 





in the face of so much need, making a difference can feel overwhelming. but what if each person gave just a little? every gift powers a network of support infinitely larger than any one person. that’s what it means to live united.  






i'm ready to give back and donate







i can... 














 


















 

						start a workplace campaign					

						and maximize my impact for me and my colleagues. i believe we are stronger together.					


						give back					


















 

						volunteer my time					

						because every gift benefits our community – whether that gift is time or money.					


						volunteer 					


















 

						call, text, or write to my representative					

						i believe our voices are louder together. i can take 5 minutes today to reach out and be heard.					


						advocate

the peak progress (qli) report is a community effort to look at and evaluate different components of quality of life in the pikes peak region. this project convenes volunteers, community members, and leaders from across the region (vision councils) to gather and evaluate data and create goals (referred to as “priority areas”) in various categories.

this report originated in 2007 after howard brooks and jerry smith recognized the need for benchmarking information and gathered the necessary community support and resources to publish the first edition. the 2019/2020 report seeks to move the report forward by not only focusing on indicators, but also looking for ways to take these findings and create actionable change and improve the quality of life in the pikes peak region. to do this, we followed the original process of creating benchmarks by comparing the pikes peak region to other regions in order to see how we are doing compared to other places in the united states, as well as looking at data over time.

this report is for anyone from a general citizen to an elected representative. based on the foundation of community groups, networks, and resources that were assembled to develop it, this highly beneficial tool provides reliable and easy to understand data with the potential and proposed steps for actionable change.
