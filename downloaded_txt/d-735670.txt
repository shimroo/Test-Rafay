what our patients are saying about us ….



“i couldn't be more pleased with dr. glafkides, his work, his staff, his kindness, his professionalism! i had a breast aug by him over 10 years ago....excellent work!! still 100% pleased! recently i returned for an abdominoplasty. it's been almost 6 weeks and again, i couldn't be more pleased with everything, the planning, surgery, recovery, appearance, overall health.....aces all the way!”



i am beyond thankful to have found dr. glafkides. he performed my most recent reconstructive breast surgery after undergoing a double mastectomy and three prior reconstructive surgeries due to breast cancer. there are many plastic & reconstructive surgeons to select from, however not many listen to the patients wants, needs and desires. dr. glafkides has the best artistic eye for his craft, he exudes kindness and i stand with dr. glafkides to take care of me inside and out.



“i found him to be approachable and thorough in our initial discussion and, in contrast to other surgeons i interviewed, focused on my goals.”  kf



dr. glafkides recently performed reconstructive surgery on my nose to repair the wound left by mohs surgery for skin cancer. he and his staff were highly recommended by my dermatological surgeon, and i couldn’t be happier with the results of the surgery. i’m amazed by how well the area has healed in the four months since my surgery. even my dermatologist commented on how great my nose looks during my biannual skin check yesterday. thank you, dr. glafkides! you and your staff made a stressful situation so much easier to cope with.



i am extremely satisfied with my new look after bilateral reconstructive breast surgery with dr. glafkides. it was bad enough having them removed due to ductal breast cancer. however, i felt the doctor listened to me when i expressed an interest in the "high profile" implants.even though i don't have any breast tissue underneath the implants, they look and move pretty naturally. i like the cleavage and the size. dr. glafkides has high standards. i believe he turned my cancer into a win by doing such a great job on my reconstructive surgery. 



“best lips i’ve ever had. great botox too!”



when i finally decided to do the volbella i was genuinely pleased with the result and with his precision. i fully trust dr glafkides, have no hesitation in recommending him for this, and other procedures. the office staff are efficient and very welcoming, making for a pleasant experience all around.



there are not enough words to describe how amazing dr. glafkides and his team are. before meeting him, i had consulted with another plastic surgeon who made me feel uncomfortable and unsure about moving forward with my large breast reduction. i gave it a second chance and consulted with dr. glafkides who made all of my fears and worries go away by taking time to show and explain the process. he and his staff made me feel so welcomed and after my consult i felt so comfortable with my decision to move forward with surgery. he even personally called to speak with my husband who had questions and concerns about the process. i am 2 weeks post surgery and so incredibly pleased with the results and the care and support he has given me post-op. thank you dr. glafkides for your kindness, care, support and making me feel so beautiful! nw



i had a great experience with dr. glafkides and his office staff. i felt relaxed and like i was in good hands. i was pleased with my results from my surgery to some fillers i had done. he didn’t over do anything and i still look very natural, just refreshed as we had discussed. i would recommend him to anyone interested in having a cosmetic procedure.



what a wonderful, sensitive and skilled surgeon! i feel extremely lucky to have found him. both he and the friendly staff go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and happy with everything. i couldn’t ask for anything more or be any happier
