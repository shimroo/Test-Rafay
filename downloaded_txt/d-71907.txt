limted western cedar / american walnut
february 16, 2025

we are excited to introduce a stunning nineteen-piece limited edition collection featuring exquisite american walnut combined with aaa western red cedar tops. available in om, lv, and d body styles. experience the exceptional tone and craftsmanship of our first cedar top run in two decades. 
this limited edition includes unique details such as a tri-color herringbone rosette and purfling, crafted from indian rosewood, ovangkol, and silver oak woods, creating a one-of-a-kind trim. we used highly flamed fiddleback austrian walnut that beautifully complements the back and sides of each piece. to complete the design, the vine logo headstock inlay is paired with custom jcl 18:1 tuners, featuring anodized black aluminum buttons.
