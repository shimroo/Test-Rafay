" relied on yellow cab of pw county for rides to and from a wedding. they arrived on time, drivers were friendly, price was what was expected. definitely recommend their service. "








"
                      thank you for your help with the new taxi cash card for my daughter christine, and for my senior
ride card. i do appreciate your time and assistance with regard to my intellectually challenged
daughter riding a taxi on her own to work.
                    "








"thank you for the excellent & prompt service! 3 days of back & forth from hotel to hospital to take care of my son! even with a computer crash, you still got a driver (thanks william!) to take care of
me! kudo's and an a+ from me!"








"i called yellow cab to go to the airport and found their service to be wonderful. the driver arrived at the pre-arranged time and helped my wife and i with our bags at the terminal. i used a prepaid card
that i purchased from the company that included a senior discount."








"i have always been impressed by the wonderful cab drivers in your employ but i must commend one in particular- cab 92's driver. his cab was clean, he drove well, and was friendly and courteous. he
went above and beyond my expectations by far and feel he should be recognized for his work ethic.
thanks again cabbie 92!!!"








"i use this cab company and have always found them to arrive as expected and the cabs are clean! i don't have to worry about the driver not knowing how to get to where i am going because they all
have a navigation system. i can also pay the driver with my credit card directly instead of having to
give my number to the dispatcher when i call to schedule a ride. since i switched to this company, i
use them exclusively. i've never gone back to that other cab company in the area."








"driver was very considerate and made light conversation so as to make the ride comfortable. was very affordable as well."
