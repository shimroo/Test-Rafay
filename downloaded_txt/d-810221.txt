					the human potential center
				

					the center is here to help you become more creative, loving, playful and vibrantly alive. we aren’t a treatment center and we don’t offer therapy groups. instead, we offer workshops and services that help you become assertive, empowered, energetic, compassionate and successful. join us for a workshop and see how much fun personal growth can be!
