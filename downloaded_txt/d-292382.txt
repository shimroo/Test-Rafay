it all began 
					with an elephant
when 
					someone mentions steiff, the first thing that comes to mind 
					are teddybears. but actually margarete steiff first designed 
					a small felt elephant that she made both as a pin cushion 
					and a childs toy in 1883. it wasnt until 1903 that her 
					company began producing the stuffed bears for which it 
					became famous.

america's first fashion dolls

					wasnt until the early 20th century that dolls became 
					collectible. and the person who created their collectibility 
					was beatrice alexander, otherwise known as madame alexander.

					steam-driven toys have always fascinated young boys and men. 
					its probably because of the power they produce and that

are all cast-iron toys alike
unlike 
					older toys, the lack of difference, baring signs of wear, 
					between older and newer cast-iron toys is minimal. even 
					knowledgeable dealers often cant tell the difference 
					between new ones and old ones. and its even more of a 
					problem for those buying cast-iron toys online.

happy meals for happy kids
happy meals 
					and the toys included in them have been a part of mcdonalds 
					offerings for several decades. kids loved them. but to be of 
					any value to a collector, happy meal toys need to still be 
					encased in their packaging and not used. there are some rare 
					pieces that have value even if out of their packages, but 
					generally, as with other toy collectibles, mint in package 
					is the rule.

					caring for antique dolls


					little girls love to play with dolls. many have a favorite 
					that gets loved so much it literally falls apart. some adult 
					women also like dolls, but to them theyre a cherished 
					collectible. more than any other antique, people wrap dolls 
					in an aura of nostalgia. and often that sentiment gets in 
					the way of common sense when it comes to caring for the 
					dolls in a collection.

all aboard for the national toy 
					train museum

by bob brooke


most young boys love 
			trains. and so do their dads and granddads. if theres one place 
			that must seem like nirvana to little boys and their dads its the 
			national toy train museum in strasburg, pennsylvania, headquarters 
			of the train collectors association. located just down the road from 
			the strasburg railroad and the railroad museum of pennsylvania, this 
			museum doesnt seem a bit out of place, even though its surrounded 
			by amish fields of corn and wheat.

toys in 
					antiquity
by bob brooke

children have 
					been playing with toys for thousands of years. 
					archaeologists believe the construction of toys dates back 
					to at least the pleistocene era, with some chinese 
					archaeologists suggesting early humans were making stone 
					toys from as early as 2 million years ago. an historical 
					study revealed evidence that neanderthal children played 
					with toy axes.

there's nothing so loved by a small boy 
					than his kenton toy truck




			at the turn of the 20th century, the kenton hardware company 
			promoted itself as "the largest factory in the usa exclusively 
			making cast iron toys." the factory produced a variety of toys that 
			were miniature versions of fire engines, circus wagons, carriages, 
			banks, trains, and stoves. from the 1890's to the 1950's, the town 
			of kenton, ohio, was a center of american cast-iron production.
