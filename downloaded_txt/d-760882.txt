too many events to ever catch up





i'd given up posting here, obviously, but i never could quite delete aunt vanessa all together.  i don't read many blogs anymore, since i seem to waste my time with games on facebook!i just read my last post about how much i loved my job.  that's hilarious.  as i write, i'm looking at boxes everywhere in my apartment.  i'm packing to move back to arkansas and i cannot wait to get out of this town.  the honeymoon was over quickly and i fell out of love with the town and the job.  i do, however, have a really good job to go to in arkansas, so i am exceptionally grateful for that.  i'm also grateful that i have my wonderful pete to rely on.  he's looking forward to being closer to my family, too.  they all love him, so we're going to have a big, mushy lovefest when we arrive in arkansas.much more to tell later.

so, how goes it?





i love my job!  never thought i would love a job, but it doesn't feel like a job.  i now know what it is to be fulfilled.  hallelujah!  everything is falling into place and i haven't felt the need to be crabby or sarcastic or anything negative in over a month.  which is one reason i've not posted an entry.  i do think i'll consider either giving up this blog or changing directions with it.  then maybe i can get back some of my readers!  i haven't had time to read my favorite blogs in weeks, either.  i now have a georgia driver's license.  when i got it in the mail last week, pete realized my birthday is wrong on it, so i'm going to go take care of that this week, but other than that, there have been no snafus regarding this move.  the weather has been wonderful, so far, but i've been warned about a thousand times that it's hot as hell here for a very long time since we're practically in florida, only i haven't experienced it yet.  i'm thinking skirts and sandals from here on out with those little pantyloons to keep the friction down between my thighs and thus not such a bad heat rash.  yes, i'm writing about my fat thighs rubbing together because that's just how it is.  even if i weighed ninety pounds i'd have this wad of fat between my legs that rubs together. have always had it, and short of liposuction, i always will. now, how about some beautiful photos of our state park?  it's only five or six miles from where we live and we love it:

georgia on my mind





i drove to southwest georgia last week for a job interview at a public library.  it was a long drive (1,800 miles) but i loved the experience.  now, i'm waiting for the call.  the library director who interviewed me called today with a few more questions, which means he didn't cross me off his list just yet.  i am on pins and needles and cannot concentrate on anything while i'm waiting.  i promise to come back and post some new sewing, decorating, and crafting blogs next week.  i keep finding so many and am really having fun reading them.  they do get me inspired to create.

"our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter."  -martin luther king, jr.





well, it got even colder than my last post stated, but now we're getting a little warmer weather, with lots of fog.  i love fog.dooley has made a miraculous recovery.  we are all so relieved and also quite surprised that he is doing so well.  i'm so happy for reece, who has a birthday in a couple of weeks and now he can celebrate with his beloved dog!i'm buying a sewing machine later today.  i've been wanting one for a while and feel the need to be creative.  plus, i want to make some cloth napkins and grocery bags.  pete and i have been using cloth napkins, but we run out before laundry day, so i'm going to sew some more.  we've also stopped using paper towels, and added another recycle bin to the trash bin collection so that we can be better about recycling the paper we do use.  whenever we shop, we always consider the packaging now and we are generating less trash.  we are trying!i am obsessed with decorating and crafting/creative blogs.  i need to add some to my blog list so you can look at some of them if you're interested.  i'll try to do that later.i finished this book last week and recommend it.  i'm going to buy a copy for my mom for her birthday.  i loved it.   this is what i'm reading now.  can hardly put it down, it's that interesting.need to go get dressed now and be at least somewhat productive on my holiday.  "occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart."martin luther king jr.1929-1968

sixteen degrees.  no kidding.





what a day to stay in and snuggle with a blanket and a cup of tea!  short of a tornado, it's as windy as i've ever seen it and it's spitting snow outside.  i don't want to stick my nose out there only to have it frozen off.  i'm thinking i should make a pot of chili and some brownies and just gaze at the christmas tree for the rest of the afternoon.here are some pics i took when i went to arkansas to visit in october.  the first one is reece and his beloved dog, dooley.  for the past five years, dooley has been reece's best buddy.  dooley is the sweetest, friendliest dog.  sadly, dooley is very ill and we're not sure if he's going to make it much longer.  he's not responding to treatment and my brother and sister-in-law were told that they might have to make a tough decision about dooley within the next week.  my heart breaks for dooley and the family, and especially for reece.  he's being very mature, and trying to accept the possibility that he may lose his dog, but he's also extremely sad.  i wish there was something i, or anyone, could do.  i love this one of reece, emily, and dooley:emily was trying to show us dooley's teeth and his "mean" look - but he is too sweet and is having quite an effect on emily:one more thing:  the link below is for a website i enjoy.  take a look and enter their contest if you'd like.
