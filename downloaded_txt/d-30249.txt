grand canyon national park visitor guide

are you ready for one of the most breathtaking experiences of your life? grand canyon national park is truly a treasure unlike anything else on earth. there are essentially three main rims of the grand canyon you can visit - south, west, and north rims. the north and south rims of grand canyon are in the official national park rims, which is most easily accessed through arizona and utah. but with flights to las vegas being so affordable in recent years, many visitors choose to visit the west rim, which is run by the hualapai tribe. they offer tours to attractions like the grand canyon skywalk, which is the glass bridge that hangs over the canyon's edge. each rim and each type of tour offers a unique way to experience the grand canyon and there's no one best way to do it. but there's only one way to find out which is your favorite, and that's to come and experience it for yourself!

what to expect from each grand canyon rim

south rim will provide you with the classic national park experience with ranger talks,  free hop-on-hop-off shuttles, and concessionaires. 
north rim is the more remote side of the canyon loved by hikers, backpacking campers and the like. you'll find the north rim to be the least busy, but also the most difficult to access. the north rim is closed october-may due to winter conditions.
west rim is run by the hualapai tribe. there is a per-person entrance fee that provides guests with a shuttle to the west rim from the parking area. guests may add on a grand canyon skywalk ticket for additional purchase. a helicopter ride from las vegas is another popular way to get here.
