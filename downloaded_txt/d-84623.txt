intent to opt out of homestead exemption



the columbus city council intends to opt out of the statewide adjusted base year ad valorem homestead exemption for the columbus, georgia consolidated government.  all concerned citizens are invited to the public hearing on this matter to be held at the city services center, council chambers, 3111 citizens way, columbus, ga 31906, on february 10, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.times and places of additional public hearings on this matter are at the city services center, council chambers, 3111 citizens way, columbus, ga 31906, on february 10, 2025, at 6:00 p.m. and february 11, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.no change to the current frozen assessment homesteadamong the reasons that the city council wishes to explore opting out of the statewide adjusted base year ad valorem homestead exemption is that the columbus, georgia consolidated government is already impacted by a county-wide freeze on the assessed fair market values of homestead property and affirms that with the opt-out all existing local homestead exemptions, including the local frozen assessment homestead, will remain unchanged.  the decision to hold these hearings follows a thorough review of the potential long-term impact on local taxpayers, city revenues, retention of local control, and provides flexibility for the future that is not afforded by the state exemption.  details on current exemptions can be found at https://www.columbusga.gov/taxassessors/exemptions.htm.
