how laser therapy works.


erchonia uses low level lasers in the visible light spectrum. the primary mechanism for the absorption of visible light photons is the elevation of electrons to higher energy levels. this is known as molecular excitement and can be explained deeper through visible/ uv spectroscopy.
visible light photons match the energy volt (ev) or frequency between the orbits of electrons to move the electron to a higher state (excite). it is in this excited state that chemical reactions of molecules occur. one of the most important chemical reactions is when photons of visible light energy strike certain atoms, that energy may push an electron to a higher energy level where it can be picked up by an electron acceptor.¬†the electron transport chain uses the high-energy electrons to convert adp into atp. the electron transport chain (etc) is the primary source of atp production in the body and is vital for life!

frequently asked questions



what is low-level laser therapy (3lt¬Æ)?
low-level laser therapy is the use of low intensity photonic energy as a treatment modality.




how does low-level laser (3lt¬Æ) work?
photonic stimuli excite the body‚Äôs cells infusing them with energy, with the three primary reactions being, reduction of inflammation, cell function and increased blood flow.




what are the benefits of low-laser therapy?
low level laser therapy is a non-invasive, fast and effective modality that has been proven in clinical trials to reduce pain, reduce edema, and promote healing.

‚Äúthis is one of the finest pieces of equipment i own ‚Äì probably the best. the engineering is superb and you should be proud of the excellent design and function of these lasers. for me i have no doubt, this laser has literally saved my life.‚Äù


                  dr. bert rodriguez                







i would recommend the use of the fx-635 for all practitioners who deal with chronic low back pain. back pain does not discriminate between genders, ethnic groups and activity levels. the fx is the choice for all back pain suffers.
