the education alliance at brown university




this collection holds materials from the education alliance at brown university. the education alliance was a reform support organization committed to advancing equitable educational opportunities that prepare all student populations to succeed in the 21st century. from 1975-2021, the alliance partnered with schools, districts and state departments of education to apply research findings in developing solutions to educational challenges. its mission was to enhance learning for culturally and linguistically diverse students and focused on district and school improvement with special attention to underperformance and issues of equity and diversity. doi: https://doi.org/10.26300/7eez-dz04 the education alliance archived website can be found here
