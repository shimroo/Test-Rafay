welcome to if1 pylon air racing
imagine flying over 200 mph only 50 feet above the ground in a steep turn while battling 7 other top-level pilots for first position. our formula 1 pilots and their aircraft will do just that while powered by the same engine used in a simple cessna 150 training airplane. these pilots and their crew chiefs build and maintain their airplanes, modifying what can be changed by reducing drag and increasing power all while staying within strict racing association rules. this exciting class of reno air racers will duke it out in 3 levels of gold, silver and bronze september 10-14, 2025 at the national championship air races.slideshowjul 2021upcoming eventsupcoming events
