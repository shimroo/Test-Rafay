horse riding holiday in africa with ants


only a 3 hour drive from johannesburg, you will find arguably the best horse-riding in africa. situated on a private game reserve in the spectacular, malaria-free waterberg region of south africa, ant’s offers the very best experience of the bush, either at one with wildlife on horseback, in the luxury of a privately-guided game drive or at more intimate level on foot. for over 25 years, it has won a reputation for a homely and friendly welcome that offers guests of all ages an unforgettable adventure.


  















horse safaris


our herd of over 90 horses live a blissful life on our private game reserve amongst the wildlife. as the horses are seen as part of normal daily life by the other animals, our riding guests can get closer to the game than probably anywhere else in africa. there is no such thing a typical riding day during an ant’s horseback safari.
ant africa safaris is one of the earliest pioneers when it comes to offering horse safaris in africa, successfully running them since 1996. horses are our passion, and our incredibly dedicated and long-standing team ensure that our horses are as well looked after as our guests.

tailor-made safaris


ant africa safaris prides itself on making each day of your stay a memorable safari experience, to suit all ages, young or young-at-heart, for those travelling as a family, as a group of friends or as an intrepid solo traveller. you can choose your own pace, whether that is galloping through the bush on horseback alongside a herd of giraffe or viewing game in more relaxed fashion from a vehicle.
at the end of the day, enjoy magical sundowners from incredible viewpoints or take a refreshing dip in the lodge pools or your own private plunge. the beautiful selection of rooms at ant’s nest or ant’s hill each have a distinctive style providing a peaceful haven from which to enjoy your stay.

our riding policy + extra details
 


there is no better way to savour the waterberg and experience its unparalleled wildlife population than on horseback. our aim is to give you a fun-filled riding safari of a lifetime. however, safety is of paramount importance and you will be required to sign an indemnity form which includes certain guidelines while out on horseback. you must be fully aware and understand that there are risks involved when around horses, in riding generally, and in visiting and staying in areas of africa due to the presence of wild animals. by signing our indemnity form you are confirming that you are riding on our safaris entirely at your own risk and that you have adequate insurance for all eventualities (ensure your insurance policy covers riding safaris and medical evacuation). it is compulsory to wear a riding helmet and although we have a selection of sizes, we do recommend that, if you have your own well-fitted hat, to bring it with you.
if you plan to spend many hours in the saddle, we recommend that you do some riding prior to your visit, in order to avoid aching muscles. we do have bumnahs available in our shop, or alternatively you can bring your own.
both mclellan and english saddles are available and each guest will receive a water bottle which fits into a bottle holder attached to the saddle. we do recommend bringing bum-bags to carry items such as phones and cameras. a list of recommended clothing and other items to bring can be found on our information page.
ant’s horse safaris caters to all levels of riders, from the complete beginner to the most experienced, and riding lessons are also available. we take all ages, however, children under the age of 4 can only enjoy short pony rides around the lodge rather than riding out in the bush.
we have a weight limit of 110 kgs (17 stone or ~ 242 lbs).
we take a maximum number of 6 guests out on any ride. different riding abilities will not be mixed unless they choose to do so. the duration of each ride is determined by you as a guest and full day rides are available.
