personal injury and wrongful death attorneys





i don't talk to the dead, tho i know a lot of dead people, including myself.  my old friend joel, who has been a living zombie for as long as i've known him (and so blissfully unconscious of that fact), suggested i go to halloween as a zombie jesus.  too late for that, but it seems appropriate for christmas.

a living friend of mine recommended a personal injury attorney in fort worth.  i'm going to give him a call, and see what kind of wrongful death case we can cook up for me.  my death was so wrong, so very wrong, that they kicked me out and restored my life.  restore.  i like that.

wrongful death





one morning you wake up and get in the car, thinking you're going to work.  but you're not going to work, you're going to die.  we're all going to die, but how many of us are going to come back to life?

don't know what i'm talking about?  well, matt damon does.  and if you've seen the movie hereafter you know, too.  or maybe you're one of the lucky ones: lucky enough to be so unlucky to have experienced death for yourself, and lived to tell about it. you know, like me.

wrongful death, it has an entirely different meaning to me.
