csu/uc mathematics diagnostic testing project (mdtp) 





mdtp is funded through the california academic partnership program (capp) and the uc and csu systems to provide a free assessment system to support secondary mathematics educators in california schools.












mdtp newsletter the mdtp fall 2024 newsletter provides 10 facts why math educators should use mdtp, information about current tests and field tests, and suggestions for using mdtp to promote mastery learning and bridge unfinished learning aligned to recommendations found in the 2023 ca mathematics framework. 
fall 2024 mdtp newsletter 









use mdtp open-response items to promote mastery learning 






mdtp formative constructed response field-test items
mdtp formative constructed response items (fcris) are aligned to specific problems found on mdtp diagnostic tests by topic. they are designed to provide a short and focused post-intervention assessment of students' understanding of a key mathematical topic or concept and should be administered to students after they have taken an mdtp diagnostic test and have engaged in post-testing instructional intervention. 

see fcri information and access







mdtp written response items
mdtp written response items (wris) are designed to elicit student thinking and quantitative reasoning around foundational mathematical topics and concepts. each mdtp wri aligns to mdtp topics on mdtp diagnostic tests, and many items can be used at a variety of levels of mathematics study. wris require adequate time to allow students to think and reason deeply about the problem and to clearly explain or justify their thinking.
