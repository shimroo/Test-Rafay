does your qigong teachers actively see patients daily?
to stay current with all options for patient care, your teacher needs to perpetually see patients to keep up their skill set, which translates into allowing the students to glean from this knowledge. dr cibik has an active clinic, and has worked wtih thousands of patients.






in your qigong training, will you learn about the importance of food as medicine, as a source of qi?
in ancient china, food choices as medicine were a sign of the superior physician. this modality is a key point in the inner strength curriculum.























 
education & certification programs
to become a healer   one must  have healed themselves   (physician heal thyself)
being a therapist or a dr does not automatically make you a healer
not all healers can teach others to be a healer
these are the three distinct levels of accomplishment
we invite you to step into your best and most vibrant health!
