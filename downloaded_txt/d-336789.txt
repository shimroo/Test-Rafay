masonry & foundation



                a solid home begins with a strong foundation. there's no way around it when thinking about the longevity of the home's structure.
                in fact, in order for your foundation to withstand the test of time, it needs to be done right the first time, as repairs are costly,
                and youâre resale value can be negatively affected by foundation issues because youâre required to state any repairs done to your foundation when selling your home.
                

                but at brockway's adirondack style homes, we will never compromise on quality. we build our own foundations with the strength and durability to last a lifetime!

                we also offer all types of customized brick and stone work. if you're considering a brick riser for your wood stove, or a stone walkway or wall,
                or even a stone structure, youâve come to the right place! we pride ourselves in making every stonework project we undertake unique, so if you can dream it,
                we can build it! contact us to build your foundation here in the heart of the adirondacks.

plowing & sanding 



                let's face it: adirondack winters are unrelenting and filled with more snow than most can manage on their own.
                but you don't have to manage anything, because brockway's adirondack style homes is here to help!
                when we think about your home needs, we don't only focus on building and renovating. we also consider your needs when it comes to daily life,
                especially in the harsh conditions of winter.
                

                we can work with you to schedule a plan based on snowfall, meaning weâll come plow your driveway or parking area every time we get more than,
                say, 4-5 inches, or you can keep our number handy for when the snow overwhelms and youâre in need of a hand.

                itâs also widely known that a number of roads in the adirondacks are private and dirt, especially around lakes and more rural areas.
                we can work with your community to plow your entire area, and weâll also sand whatâs left down so youâre not sliding around on a slippery layer of snow and ice.
                there's no job too big or too small for us to plow or sand. contact us today to get a quote.

excavation



                a solid adirondack style home or cottage foundation begins with properly handled excavation, and at brockwayâs adirondack style homes,
                we offer full service home building! weâre here to help you every step of the way, ridding yourself of the need for multiple subcontractors!
                

                prior to laying a homeâs foundation, we survey the site for excavation and preparation, ensuring your construction site is flat before any work begins.
                we use our specialty heavy machinery, which we are licensed and trained to use, to flatten your construction site, setting your home up for a well-built,
                long-lasting foundation, and an even, level plain for your home to settle upon. unless you want to deal with foundation work in the near future,
                excavation if one of the most important steps in the home building process!

septic systems



                itâs the unfortunate truth that in upstate new york, especially in the more rural counties, most homes arenât connected to a city septic system.
                but brockwayâs adirondack style homes is here to help install the right septic system for your home or cottage.
                

                our contractors are trained and certified to new york regulated septic system laws, meaning that we are able to install a new septic system or assess
                and repair your old system. upon installation or repair, weâll assess your leach field and test the soil surrounding it to ensure you not only have the
                proper system for your land, but also that your system is working as it should. weâll walk you through every step of the process so you understand
                what weâre doing and why weâre doing it.
