rentals of quality apartments and villas in 
			rome















			 

			 



			 







 




there's no 
			place like rome: 3,000 years of history, art and 
			architecture surround you: imperial, classical, renaissance, 
			baroque, modern. eternally fascinating... always and forever.  
			only in rome you find the combination of art, history, joyful life, 
			friendly and hospitable people.  and  - yes -  the 
			"dolce vita" (sweet life), i.e. the magic, romantic atmosphere, the 
			fine weather and - of course! - the italian cuisine. 


			even before 
			audrey hepburn and gregory peck starred in the oscar winning classic roman holiday, rome
			was a world-acclaimed place in the heart 
			of sentimental romantics, as shown by the 
			evidence that more people make a return visit to rome to get 
			married than in any other city.
			yet beyond rome's romantic flavour, rome's 
			spell will keep you coming back for more... 
			like the loss of a loved memory.
