                official podcast: most important positions of need for colts in 2025 offseason
              

jj stankevitz and larra overton take a position-by-position look at what groups the colts need to address the most â and least â during the 2025 offseason. is improving the tight end room just as important as adding cornerbacks and safeties? where do jj and larra disagree the most?


















                the last word: free agency, rookie standouts and hall of fame insights with clark judge
              

jeffrey gorman and matt taylor are back with this week's edition of the last word, the colts' offseason radio show. they dive into the team's in-house free agents and discuss which players the colts should prioritize and reflect on the 2025 rookie class, including standout seasons from liatu latu, adonai mitchell, and offensive linemen tanor bortolini and matt goncalves. finally, the guys are joined by clark judge, longtime nfl insider from the talk of fame network and pro football hall of fame voter. judge shares insights on why reggie wayne and adam vinatieri were excluded from the 2025 class and offers thoughts on the current state of the colts.
