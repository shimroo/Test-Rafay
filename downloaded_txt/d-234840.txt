welcome!





high cholesterol is beneficial!
the campaign stating that cholesterol is harmful is the greatest medical scandal in modern time. this is my conclusion after having studied the scientific background in detail for more than 30 years.
click on the buttons above, read what i have written, and i am confident that you will agree with me (unless your major income arrives from the drug companies or the margarine industry)
