parent services
our services are free to families and all information obtained is kept confidential. we offer child care referrals. we do not make recommendations. parents are fully responsible for making the right choice in child care. the ccrc cannot guarantee any child care setting.









provider services
child care providers wear many hats throughout their day. they are caregivers and teachers, as well as small business owners and economic development partners.









community services
child care is an important component of community infrastructure that serves not only children and families, but supports economic development efforts.
