helpful gazebo & deck building information
although store bought deck building plans are great for giving you a general 
idea as to how your deck will look, we've yet to find a set of deck building 
plans that didn't suffer from  major errors. designers of 
generic gazebo and deck building plans have to make many general assumptions
about soil 
type and design loads. if you have less than perfect soil and/or are building 
a deck or gazebo in an area that gets snow, the lumber, footing, and bolt sizes 
recommended in pre-packaged deck building plans won't work. even
if you're lucky enough to live in a warm climate with great soil, pre-packaged
deck building plans are woefully lacking in sufficient
detail and accuracy to help you get the job done right.
on the other hand, you may be planning on designing your own gazebo or deck 
building project. the information on bestdecksite.com has been specifically tailored for
gazebo and deck building. it's information that quite simply can't be found 
anywhere else. if your deck building project calls for cantilevering joists 
or beams, designing for snow loads or hot tubs, building multiple levels, or 
anything in-between, bestdecksite.com has the help you need. along the way, 
we'll point out lots of deck building tips that will not only make your job 
easier, but will also ensure your deck remains trouble-free for a lifetime.
