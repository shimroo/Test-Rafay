(some article links to product pages may not work.)why is phelps refinishing closing?after over two decades as a fuji spray authorized distributor, selling no other brand of system or spray gun, and carrying a full inventory of parts and accessories — roger phelps is no longer able to work.his wife, the two longtime assistants in texas, and website consultant cathy morgan have been keeping orders fulfilled since roger became unable to work around november 20 — with the hope that roger would recover. however, roger isn’t recovering. so he and his wife, deni holm phelps, have made the hard decision on sunday, january 12, to close the business.all orders already placed before midnight, january 12, 2025 are being fulfilled.we will take care of unresolved issues.these might include:pending refundsequipment sent in for cleaning or repair that hasn’t been returned to youunused gift card balancewe’re doing our best to resolve these issues from our end, but we might miss something. so please feel free to reach out with questions and concerns, by emailing the usual address: roger@phelpsrefinishing.com.our closeout sale has ended.we still have quite a few worthy mini-strainers but have not decided what to do with them at this point. the large worthy strainers and micro-mesh hobby kits sold out quickly. if you live within an easy drive of mission, texas, inquire about some warehouse equipment like a blasting cabinet and air compressor, perhaps smaller tools.you can order the large size of worthy strainers directly from the manufacturer, 10 to a box, at  https://worthymfg.com/shop/ols/productswhere do we recommend you shop?we recommend that you try paint sprayers plus, another relatively small authorized fuji spray distributor. owner jason gilbert offers email and phone advice on what to buy, and sometimes offers discount codes at checkout. i am hoping that paint sprayers plus will pick up where roger left off, and begin to sell 3m pps 2.0 products for hvlp spray guns. i’ll do my best to help him get started with this.contact paint sprayers pluschandler, az 85248mon – fri: 8:30am – 4:00pmemail - info@paintsprayersplus.comtel# - 1-833-668-5855fuji spray can refer you to other distributorsyou can also look for authorized distributors by browsing the fuji spray “where to buy” page of authorized distributors. this page also has links for foreign sales.some distributors on the list sell mainly paint or other finishes, rather than fuji spray equipment and parts. so it will take some extra effort to find some to try.however, you can always email fuji spray sales — sales@fujispray.com — for help locating a distributor, or call fuji spray at 1-800-650-0930. to leave comments, see the latest blog article, which will stay available till november 1, 2025.these may be shared with roger, to give him some encouragement that his work has had a positive effect on his customers.click here to zip over to leave comments.you’re also invited to let roger know of your good wishes at his mailing address:roger phelps1840 s. bentsen palm dr, #42, palmview, tx 78572be careful about special discounts and other ploys to get your business.take a look at this blog article: top 7 mistakes when buying spray equipment
