historic location










the st. michaels crab & steak house has been the unloading site for millions of oysters and crabs distributed from boston to the carolinas. the watermen in this area have worked laboriously for hundreds of years... often in inclement weather and untenable conditions...to ensure the supply of eastern shore seafood specialties.
