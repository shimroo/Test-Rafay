totw: conservatism in disguise






by thecollective
 feb 10, 2025 



 


when i hear phrases like "fuck around, find out" it feels like jail/prison culture has busted out and is taking over popular culture...the "fuck around, find out" mindset operates as a shorthand for harsh justice. prison justice. that phrase and others of its kind reinforce the idea that actions have clear, brutal consequences. a way of signaling a no-nonsense, retributive worldview where power is respected and transgressions are punished without mercy. they are phrases that tend towards a form of conservatism... a law-and-order morality that maintains rigid social relations.

from abolition media by dimitris chatzivasileiadis
on 12 february 2012 the last big battle of the anti-austerity movement (in the greek territory) took place. other open battles followed in the following years, but after that day, when the movement realized that it had reached the limits of its power, it did not revive.

candice alicia king 1984-2025






by anon (not verified)
 feb 14, 2025 



 


from eugene weekly
"i always introduced her as ‘the most radical person i know,’” says antonio gisbert, one of candice king’s coworkers at homes for good and a fellow drafter of the oregon rebate plan. “like, the good sense of the word ‘radical.’” 
he also called her “a force of nature,” which is a phrase many of her friends echoed to describe her. other words and phrases that friends, neighbors and family used to articulate king to eugene weekly were “activist,” “anarchist,” “passionate” and “compass.” they also say she was “one of the most sophisticated thinkers i know,” “a brilliant, bright star who was always burning in a lot of different directions at the same time,” and “a revolutionary.”

from puget sound anarchists
i wasn’t sure if i wanted to write a report back from the jan 18th people’s march, but seeing the other report that was shared i figured it’s important because i think a lot of it is self-righteous bullshit.

australia: warrnambool city council fails to shut down anarchist meeting






by anon (not verified)
 feb 13, 2025 



 


from red & black notes
on saturday, 8 february 2025, members of geelong anarchist communists (gac) and curious locals gathered under the shelter of warrnambool’s civic green. posters adorning the coastal towns’ streets promoted an introduction to anarchism workshop... city council... abruptly cancelled the event with less than a day’s notice—an attack on both free speech and political organisation.

anarchist publication rumoer #8 is here






by anon (not verified)
 feb 13, 2025 



 


the day you didn’t expect to come no more. a fresh rumoer came out (#8 but actually 10!) of the printer. critical, cheeky, sweet, punk and a bit literate as well as illiterate, we embrace our little mistakes.
the good news is that we have lots of sabotage and attacks to write about, from the whole wide world but also from nearby. also, articles on war, militarism, refusing service. our chemistry teacher would be proud at our texts on deepsea mining and another one on uranium and anti-nuclear struggle.
