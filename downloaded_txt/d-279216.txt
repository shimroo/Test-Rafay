global business travel solutions











innovative travel solutions
for law firms
frosch understands the complexities of travel in the legal space; we take a uniquely strategic approach to managing travel in this typically non-mandated environment. weâve assisted our clients, many of whom are part of the am law 100, in creating innovative travel programs that provide customized reporting and simplify complex expenses. we have also seamlessly executed recruitment travel programs and successfully conducted extensive training for travel arrangers.











consolidation & optimization in the financial sector
we understand the high level of service required in the financial sector and work to establish relationships with each traveler by assigning the same level of vip agents to service them. roadshows are key to traveler satisfaction; weâve found that putting a face to a name can drastically improve trust in a travel program. we have also helped many of our clients consolidate portfolios of companies to not only provide significant cost savings, but ease of use and full program optimization.











24/7 vip support for professional service firms
froschâs boutique approach to corporate travel has amassed a portfolio of clients in the professional services space. from publishing to engineering firms, we are able to provide clients a vip experience, while delivering cost-savings on every transaction. our follow-the-sun approach ensures excellent service 24/7, while our foundation in luxury travel enables us to provide value-add services including private aircraft consultation, the execution of firm retreats, and more.
