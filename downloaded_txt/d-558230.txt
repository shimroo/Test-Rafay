spotting and avoiding scamsthe federal trade commission (ftc) is a government agency that protects people from frauds and scams.  unfortunately, scammer often target communities that they feel are vulnerable.  that may be senior citizens, immigrants or members of ethnic communities.  the ftc partnered with ethnic media services (ems) and hosted an event in cleveland ohio on september 24, 2024 dealing with spotting and avoiding scams - especially for vulnerable communities.  experts from several agencies were joined by ethnic community leaders and members of ethnic media outlets for a robust and informative session.
there are numerous federal and local resources for people to prevent and protect from scams and also to report a scam if it occurs.  the resources are available in multiple languages and should be shared with others in your community. there are three prongs to preventing a scammer from harming you and your community: protecting yourself, identifying a scam and what to do if you were scammed.  here are some resources:
how to protect yourself
a great resource to learn about avoiding scams is consumer.gov.   this website includes information on scams that target immigrants, warnings about notarios and how to get legitimate help with immigration.  for example:
do not pay for immigration forms. those forms are free from the government.  https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms  
get advice from u.s. government websites. a website might look like it comes from the government. make sure the website address ends with .gov. that means it is a government website.
do not pay a notario for legal advice. notarios will not help you, even when you pay them.
don't carry all your important papers or id cards with you.
don't click on unknown links in email messages.
make sure websites start with https.  the "s" at the end means the site is secure.
sign up for the do not call registry   https://www.donotcall.gov/many more useful and important tips at consumer.gov. 
identifying and preventing a scam
experts say that imposter scams are the most common currently.  in imposter scams someone pretends to be someone they are not, maybe even a friend, relative or co-worker,  and contacts you out of the blue and tries to distract you and convince you to act urgently.  they want you to pay in cash or gift cards or wire transfer or similar non-standard methods.  the government and legitimate companies will never do this!  in addition do not give out personal information in response to an unexpected request whether it comes as a text, phone call or e-mail.you can sign up for free consumer alerts at ftc.gov/consumeralerts to be kept informed about the latest scams.
other useful information from the ftc https://consumer.ftc.gov/scams
includes these tips:
don't believe your caller id.  technology allows for scamming here.  if someone asks for money or personal information, just hang up.  you can always call the legitimate number of the business to confirm.  
don't pay upfront for a promise such as job assistance, mortgage assistance or the like.
take your time.  con artists want you to act in a hurry.  if in doubt, slow down and check with trusted sources, search online and so on.
hang up on robocalls.  don't press a button to be taken off the list.  that could lead to more calls.
be skeptical about free trial offers.  these can lead to unwanted billings and difficult cancellations.
don't deposit a check and wire money back.  this is a common scam where you will end up being responsible for paying back the bank.
don't click on unknown links in e-mails.  they can look legitimate so be very wary.  also, don't grant remote access to your computer even in messages pop up warning you.
spread the word to your community.  you can get information including printed materials in your language at https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/languages
other useful information from the ftc https://consumer.ftc.gov/scams
what to do if you were scammed
it is very important to report if you were scammed.   go to https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/ and choose your language.  you can also call the ftc at 1-877-382-4357 (1-877-ftc-help)
you can remain anonymous, speak in your own language and give as much or as little information as you want.
note: scammers are impersonating the ftc. know that the ftc will never threaten you, say you must transfer your money to "protect it," or tell you to withdraw cash or buy gold and give it to someone.  learn more at ftc.gov/impersonators
do not be ashamed or embarrassed.  the scammers are often professionals who spend a lot of money and time trying to fool you.  everybody gets targeted and people from every age group and demographic have been scammed.
if you think you might be a victim of identity theft visit https://www.identitytheft.gov/ or https://www.robodeidentidad.gov/ (spanish)
you can trust legitimate entities such as:
federal trade commission (ftc) https://consumer.ftc.gov/scams

the last person returned to slavery in the us
the underground railroad was a network of secret routes and safe houses established in the us during the early 1800s to help slaves escape into free states and canada.  it was run by abolitionists and others sympathetic to the cause of the escapees. ohio had many stops on the underground railroad and since canada was an ultimate destination, the short distance across lake erie from cleveland to canada made the city a popular destination.  cleveland was codenamed hope on the underground railroad. 
restore cleveland hope operates the underground railroad interpretive center in the cozad-bates house, the only surviving pre-civil war building in university circle.  they offer tours and events and it was here that we learned of the story of sara lucy bagby.

sara lucy bagby display at cozad-bates housesara lucy bagby was born in the early 1840s in virginia. on october 3, 1860 bagby fled from slavery in wheeling. she eventually escaped slavery via the underground railroad and made her way to cleveland, ohio.   her arrest in cleveland on january 19, 1861 became a test case of the fugitive slave act. wheeling resident john goshorn and his son showed proof of ownership, and the federal court ordered her return to virginia. sara lucy bagby was the last person in the united states forced to return to slavery in the south under the fugitive slave act. the cleveland plain dealer and democrat party of the us were both pro-slavery so despite the state government's and citizens of cleveland's attempts to intervene, lucy was transported back to goshorn's property in wheeling, then still part of virginia. 

after the emancipation proclamation, bagby eventually resettled in cleveland, where she died in 1906 and was buried. 
in this video, kathryn puckett, restore cleveland hope board chair, tells the story of sara lucy bagby.

the girl on the train
the #1 new york times bestseller, usa today book of the year, now a major motion picture starring emily blunt. the debut psychological thriller that will forever change the way you look at other people's lives.intersecting, overlapping, not-quite-what-they-seem lives. jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts. a haunting unease that clutches and wont let go. all this and more helps propel paula hawkinss addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. at times, i couldnt help but think: hitchcockian. from the opening line, the reader knows what theyre in for: shes buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks but hawkins teases out the mystery with a veterans finesse. the girl on the train is rachel, who commutes into london and back each day, rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names jess and jason. then one day rachel sees jess kissing another man. the day after that, jess goes missing. the story is told from three characters not-to-be-trusted perspectives: rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; megan (aka jess); and anna, rachels ex-husbands wife, who happens to be jess/megans neighbor. rachels voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of jess and jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into jess/megans disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. and who she isnt. this is a book to be devoured. -neal thompsonthe girl on the train: a novel
