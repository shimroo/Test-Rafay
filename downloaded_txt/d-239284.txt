the lord's prayer


our father, who art in heaven,hallowed be thy name;thy kingdom come; thy will be done;on earth as it is in heaven.give us this day our daily bread.and forgive us our trespasses,as we forgive those who trespass against us.and lead us not into temptation;but deliver us from evil.for thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,for ever and ever. amen.

a prayer for reconciliation


gracious god,ruling the earth and its peoplenot by terror but in love;we worship you. we confess that too oftenour words hurt othersand our deeds are selfish;forgive us. in this time of uncertainty and fear,help us to love our enemiesand do good to those who hate us,in the name of jesus our lord. amen.

morning prayer


for peace and justice, for the leaders of the nations and for those in danger our help is in the name of the lord who has made heaven and earth.  the praise of god for light in the darkness of sin  blessed are you, god of compassion and mercy, to you be praise and glory for ever. in the darkness of our sin, your light breaks forth like the dawn and your healing springs up for deliverance. as we rejoice in the gift of your saving help, sustain us with your bountiful spirit and open our lips to sing your praise: father, son, and holy spirit. blessed be god for ever.  psalm  i will bless the lord at all times; his praise shall ever be in my mouth.  i sought the lord and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears.  look upon him and be radiant and your faces shall not be ashamed.  reading  moses said, 'i call heaven and earth to witness against you today that i have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. therefore, choose life, that you and your descendants may live, loving the lord your god, obeying his voice and holding fast to him; for that means life to you and length of days.  deuteronomy 30.19-20  this poor soul cried, and the lord heard me and saved me from all my troubles.  the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear him and delivers them.  o taste and see that the lord is gracious; blessed is the one who trusts in him.  psalm 34.1,4-8   glory to the father and to the son and to the holy spirit; as it was in the beginning is now and shall be for ever. amen.
