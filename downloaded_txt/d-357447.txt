is approved to treat cataplexy and/or excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. it is taken at night to help relieve these symptoms that occur during the day. it’s time to consider the sodium content in your narcolepsy medicationsome oxybate treatments for cataplexy and/or eds in narcolepsy contain high levels of sodium. with ~1640 mg of sodium at the maximum 9-g nightly dose, high‑sodium oxybates like xyrem and lumryz™ (sodium oxybate) for extended‑release oral suspension have even more sodium than the american heart association’s (aha’s) recommendation for an entire day.the aha recommends less than 1500 mg of sodium as the ideal daily limit for most adults. with only 131 mg of sodium at the equivalent 9‑g nightly dose, xywav contains 92% less sodium than all high‑sodium oxybates.choosing xywav over high‑sodium oxybates can help treat your symptoms of cataplexy and/or eds in narcolepsy, while also reducing your sodium intake.learn
