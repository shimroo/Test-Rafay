god answers prayer







his mercy for prodigals
in march 2018, our prayer network hosted a week of 24-7 prayer.
a mother who had not seen her drug-addicted son in over a year, had been praying for him.  while she was filling her prayer slot in the prayer room, he walked in, confessed his sins and made a commitment to the lord!
in the 4 years that followed, the process of transformation was a challenging one. his mother, however, continued to persevere in prayer, reminding god of his promise to save our children (isaiah 49:25).
now her son is off the streets, reunited with his family, planted in a church, drug free and was baptised in november 2022.
we praise the father for his answer to prayer, and his love and mercy for the prodigals!
