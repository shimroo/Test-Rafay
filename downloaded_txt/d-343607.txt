why choose composites? 







composite endures.




concrete spalls, steel rusts, timber rots.​




composites are an alternative construction material without many of the performance disadvantages of conventional materials such as aluminum, concrete, steel and wood. composites will not corrode, decay, or spall thereby reducing maintenance costs and future replacements. the composite products and systems we offer resist impact, creep, uv and weathering effects better than vinyl (pvc) materials and are easier to install in harder soils than vinyl sheet piling.here are a few more advantages of ditching concrete, steel, and timber and using composites in your next project 







– uv protection– lightweight– eco-friendly 







– high strength– easy assembly– easy to transport 














 concrete spalls



 steel rusts



 timber rots
