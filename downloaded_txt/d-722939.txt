peruvian food pictures: the sky room at hotel crillón





for decades, the hotel crillón, on lima's once-stately avenida nicolas de piérola, popularly known as la colmena or the beehive, was the grande-dame of lima's hotels.the hotel crillón has been closed for many years now, in part due to family squabbles, as well as the evolving face and demographics of lima's historical center.but during its apogée, there was no more a chic address than lima's hotel crillón.and there was no better kitchen than that of the crillón's rooftop sky room, where a peruvian food extravaganza, accompanied by the finest peruvian music, were the delight of locals and visitors alike.perhaps, one day in the near future, the crillón will open its doors again, and the sky room will once again be one of lima's prime destinations.until then, we have these pictures to remember the sky room's, and la colmena's, heyday.click here for the peru food main page.tags: peru, peruvian, food, cooking, cuisine, cocina, comida, gastronomía, peruana

peruvian food video: street stall black clam ceviche





peru is all about the street food.i admit, i sometimes chicken out, but i promise: if i lived in peru, i would be less wary (and when i did, i was).especially of a peruvian food stall as tempting as this one.in this video, elwayqui visits a street stall in the vicinity of the main entry to the bellavista market in el callao (near the corner of avenida faucett with avenida venezuela), which he assures us "is very hygenic".if you go there, elwayqui asks we,  "tell the lady you saw her on the internet."this street stall specializes in black clam ceviche, cebiche de conchas negras, a true peruvian food delicacy.the ceviche vendor tells us how she prepares it:first, the clams are cracked open. she then drops the clams into a dish with lemon juice made from the tart limo limón  of northern peru. she adds salt and ají, after asking: "a lot or a little?"next chopped garlic, a spoonful of ajinomoto, some diced fish, and the calamari-like pota. next is a bit of onion and cilantro (culantro in peruvian).the dish is enhanced with a concetrado de pescado, a fish concentrate, added to "give [the ceviche] a good flavor."finally, a good mix, a couple of hearty cackles, a bit of the toasted corn cancha, boiled corn, yuyo or seaweed, and a couple of slices of boiled sweet potato, and the cebiche de conchas negras from the street stall is ready to be devoured.ceviche de agachadito parte 1 (01:54) video: el wayquione in an occasional series of posts with videos of everyday people in peru filming their peruvian food.click here for the peru food main page.tags: peru, peruvian, food, cooking, cuisine, cocina, comida, gastronomía,

how to eat ceviche in lima





this excellent article, by traveler, writer, and photographer nicholas gill, recently appeared at the online travel magazine, world hum, chockablock with "travel dispatches from a shrinking planet", and part of the travel channel family.world hum describes itself as a magazine interested "not on destinations, but on the journey; on travel in the broadest sense of the word. [a magazine that doesn't] see travel only as a way to spend a couple weeks' vacation every year [but as] a way to see the world ... abroad, [and] also a way to see the world ... at home."ultimately, world hum believes, "travel is a state of mind."in this clever and informative piece, nicholas gill gives us a type of primer for eating ceviche in lima, or in any peruvian cevichería in the world.thanks to nicholas and world hum for allowing peru food to republish the article here.photo: nicholas gill @ world humhow to eat ceviche in limaby nicholas gill @ world humthe situation: it’s sunday, and after a night out in lima, peru, you’ve found yourself in a cevichería. it’s more, you discover, than a mere place to order ceviche. it’s a cultural institution where lime juice abounds, and the events and misadventures from the previous night are discussed, reenacted and celebrated. here’s your primer.when to go: while most cevicherías are open daily, sunday is traditionally their busiest day and visiting one is a weekly ritual for many limeños. after partying until dawn the night before in lima’s discos, you might rest for a few hours but still feel like the bottom of your shoe. the act of going to a cevichería is something that can both refresh and revive; a combination of hair of the dog and raw seafood. the experience begins in the late morning and typically lasts all day; the overindulgence may, on a good day, eclipse that of the night before.the basics: early, crude forms of ceviche began to appear in pre-colombian times in the coastal civilizations of south america where fish was “cooked” with a fruit called tumbo. later the incas ate salted fish marinated in chicha, a fermented corn drink, and when the spanish arrived, they added limes and onions to the mix.ceviche preparations vary from place to place—in mexico, finely diced fish in lemon juice is served with crackers and tabasco; in ecuador, ceviche includes tomatoes and is much soupier; in the andes, chefs use trout—but it’s the peruvian version that’s recently caught on outside latin america.in peru, ceviche is eaten as a first course or appetizer. the dish requires fresh, quality ingredients; precise and lightning-fast execution; and a basic understanding of spices and acidity. the chef tosses fresh chunks of any firm white fish, such as flounder or sea bass, with onions, bits of peruvian ají peppers, seasoning and—most importantly—lime juice only minutes before serving. ceviche isn’t exactly raw like sashimi is raw, though. the acid in the lime actually cooks the fish just before you eat it, resulting in an explosion of taste and texture. in the same dish you’ll find a slice of sweet potato, a few sticks of boiled yucca and a small piece of corn on the cob.where to go: pick up lima’s restaurant guide, “guia gastronomica,” for suggestions, or head to the seaside districts of barranco and chorrillos, and look for the crowds spilling into the street from restaurants like punta arenas or la canta rana. for a step up in price and quality, check out dining options in the miraflores district such as caplina or the trendster hot spot la mar, owned by lima’s outspoken tv chef gastón acurio. at either you’ll find local celebrities and wealthy limeños sipping on pisco-infused cocktails and noshing on novo andino (new andean) foods, including a lineup of ceviches and tiraditos.still, the best cevicherías are a bit out of the way. sonia, a ceviche shack near the chorrillos fish market that has grown a fanatic following, is tucked away in a far corner of the city. sankuay, aka chez wong, sits in an unpretentious part of lima, but the loyal ensemble of bmws and mercedes outside give it away as a culinary gem. inside, chef javier wong takes a look at you and decides what you are going to eat. if you don’t like it, then leave.order like an expert: to begin, pick at the toasted, salted corn kernels called cancha serrana already on the table, and make your first order. start with something to drink, say, leche de tigre, aka tiger’s milk. it’s like a kick in the face. more clearly defined, it’s the tangy juice left over at the bottom of the ceviche bowl served in a tall shot glass. sometimes it’s mixed with a shot of pisco, a white brandy that is peru’s national spirit. throw in a few 32-ounce beers (always pilsen or cusqueña) for everyone to share. if dining after a rough night, opt for a pisco sour. better yet, make it a double.next, move on to the goods: ceviche or tiradito. ceviche comes in many forms: clásico (the traditional mix), mixto (with fish, squid, octopus and scallops), camarón (with crayfish), black conch (said to increase your sexual prowess), pato (with duck), and champiñones (with mushrooms). tiradito is the modish, young cousin of ceviche. created by nikkei (japanese) chefs in lima, it relies on the tradition of dousing raw fish in lime juice, but the slices are paper thin and its makers add a spicy ají-based sauce.once you’ve finished your ceviche—another round of drinks, by the way, has likely been put on the table without your asking—you can order the rest of your meal. your second course will be something hearty, and typically served with rice.need more starch? try tacu-tacu de mariscos: day-old rice and beans refried and stuffed with seafood. something more filling? lenguado a la macho: flounder in a zesty sauce of onion, garlic, paprika, cilantro and rocoto peppers. something unusual? arroz negro: rice cooked in squid ink with sautéed squid, scallops and crayfish. something multinational? camarón saltado: a variation of peru’s favorite chinese fusion dish with shrimp instead of chicken.bask in the benefits: die-hard connoisseurs will try to sell you the health attributes of ceviche like a can of snake oil—it will prevent sleepwalking, cure a hangover, and even increase your sex drive. while there may be some truth to their words, a visit to a cevichería will at the very least guarantee good times and a full belly. buen provecho!original article: how to eat ceviche in limaclick here for the peru food main page.tags: peru, peruvian, food, cooking, cuisine, cocina, comida, gastronomía, peruana
