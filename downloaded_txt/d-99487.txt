welcome to the eva cassidy web site, a resource for those seeking information about the late singer eva cassidy.
eva died in 1996 from melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. her music was little-known during her 33 years of life, but today her soul-stirring voice is reaching people all over the world.
for some fans, the pleasure of listening is enough. others want to know more: “who was this remarkable singer? why haven’t we heard of her before? are there more albums?” this web page can be your gateway to the music of eva cassidy.






guestbook – the most popular section by far. view and contribute to the eva cassidy guestbook! it is fascinating to read what people have to say about eva from all over the world. occasionally eva’s family, friends, and musical colleagues share their memories too.


articles about eva cassidy and reviews of her recordings, from newspapers and magazines. start here if you are new to eva’s music and story. my choices for the best of the best are at the top


eva’s recordings – basic information about eva cassidy’s cds and other recordings, including song listings for each album


exclusive interviews with some of eva cassidy’s musical colleagues, and many articles about eva’s music that were written especially for this website (mostly by the webmaster), as well as a link to download a screenplay about eva cassidy


pictures – snapshots, publicity photos, and some photos of eva cassidy’s own artwork. separated into five pages so it won’t take forever to load


questions and answers about eva cassidy, and an eva fact sheet


“what’s new” page


contact the webmaster via e-mail – also there is now an “about this web site” page that will tell you vastly more than you want to know


search the web site: there is a rudimentary search box at the bottom on the left. unfortunately it is not very good and only shows one result per page; then you have to go to the next page and more to find what you’re looking for. if anyone happens to know of a better way to get a search function on a wordpress site without any advertising, please let me know.
















message from the webmaster: support the hardworking musicians in your area by attending live performances, and i’m not talking about the national touring acts in the big arenas. go out to the little clubs, and seek out restaurants that offer live music. if you enjoy what you hear, tell the management as well as the performers. clap long and loud! put money in their tip jars! sign up for their mailing lists! follow them on your streaming services! write online reviews! if they’re selling cds and other merch from their guitar cases, as eva once did, support their talents and efforts that way too. as someone once wrote in the guestbook, “there will never be another eva cassidy, but there will be someone else.”
