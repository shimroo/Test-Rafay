the three story, shingle style princess anne hotel first opened its doors in 1924 during asheville’s economic boom. built by registered nurse anne o’connell and financed by doctor karl von ruck, the hotel promised “comfort first.” listed on the us department of the interior’s national register of historic places, the princess anne hotel continues to deliver an exceptional experience to guests. 




the history
 













                                                                     











 

		i don't want to tell anyone that the princess anne hotel is wonderful, because then the secret will be out and it will be impossible to stay there again. and, staying there again is exactly what i want to do the next time i travel to asheville. the princess anne does everything right. from the beautiful, quiet, and comfortable rooms. (with the classy nespresso machines and bidets.). to the pleasant common areas, lounge, and dining room. to the food -- snacks and breakfast and happy hour. to the staff. no one could praise the staff too much. the manager, front desk, and ness, the chef, along with everyone else on board is so pleasant, welcoming and helpful. the princess anne is nestled in a comfortable off the beaten path neighborhood, yet close walking distance to downtown asheville and all the major highways. the princess anne is a gem.	


		wonderful!	







 

		“historic inn oozing with charm. convenient, safe parking behind the inn. can’t say enough about the staff - they were all friendly, helpful, and engaging. breakfast provided was ample and tasty - 4 options available and two were vegetarian which pleased the other couple traveling with us. wine and appetizers provided each afternoon were quite nice. and the homemade cookies/brownies provided throughout the day - heavenly. the chef/baker here is just exceptional.

remember this is a historic inn so yes, the floors creak. our bedroom tv was on the side wall so yes, you had to look sideways. no, it doesn’t have a magnifying makeup mirror in the bathroom. but the friendliness and expertise of the staff - and the great baked goods - more than makes up for any non-modern inconveniences.”
