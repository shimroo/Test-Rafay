life, raptoral atavism and everything



life, as seen from the eyes of a hopeless narcissist. a true story of one man's journey through life's little pleasures and pointless struggles; a man whose last friends died 65 million years ago; a man who believes evolution has taken a step back after velociraptors...

this is the inspirational story of his life, his experiences, joys, sorrows, women and dinosaurs; his sometimes hilarious, sometimes tragic escapades and his one true love: himself.

nicotine, a rather strange strain of insomnia and a really bad psycho thriller kept me awake till two past midnight. but that's not the point.the point is that there are way too few psycho killers in india, and i see a whole lot of potential to make an industry out of it. here's the plan in all its concise beauty - abduct kids and torture them for a few years. after making sure that they'd become psychotic killers, ask them to sign an exclusive contract and release them on the world. record their stories, write a best-seller, make a movie and become rich.

close on goldilocks' heels





curtsy to the queen and her fancy cohortscurtsy to the arguments of design and teleologycurtsy duly to corporates, conglomerates and their confounded rationalecurtsy verily to family, kinship and societycurtsy sometimes to all those things that make us unhappyand curtsy eventually to the fell virtuous human mind.p.s: go figure!

you and i





we exist, you and i, as inexorable experience collectors, sometimes individually, often collectively; intertwined in our quest for experiences.we're a rare breed, you and i, for we believe in gathering experiences sans judgements, sans pain, sans hatred. we wish to be like a sandstorm, indifferent to the dust we gather, yet growing strong with the same dust; atleast we wish to be, for sometimes, the storm falls in love with the grains, not willing to let go. we begin to love the grains, hate them, wish they'd be less abrasive, or more. the grains are what gives us strength, will and reason to sustain the storm. without the storm, the grains needn't exist, and without the grains there'd be no storm. what matters - the grain or the storm?we're funny, you and i, for in the course of our quest, we forget that the course is short, that the course didn't have a past before it started, and no future after where it stops abruptly. millions and millions of paths had the million quests taken, strengthening each other, bitching, groveling, snarling, smiling, existing.we're wise, you and i, for we realise that the course is ephemeral, and in a cosmic scale, is hobbesian.

location: a conf roomoccasion: an engineering meeting to discuss architecture for the next generation of our product.person 1: yada, yada, ...person 2: so, yada, yada ...person 3: re-architecture is costly. so, when we do re-architecture, we must make sure that we don't need to do another one for at least five to ten years. let's design our schema in such a way.person[4-6] nod their head vigorously in agreement. person 2 had a hearty laugh, excused himself and walked out.

random crib





you indhi boy, listen up. transliteration rules aren't sacrosanct. there're no universal rules driving the shining path of transliteration. they're driven by local inculcations, and yours is as funny(and illogical) as the other one that you find funny.

apocalypto reeks of racism





opening quote: "a great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." — w. durantneed i say more? the opening line stopped short of swearing by "white man's burden".
