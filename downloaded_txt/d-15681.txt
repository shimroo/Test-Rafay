drivers, occ code , bls.* employment conditions in your area may vary.how to become a truck driverstep 1 get yourself a regular driver’s licenseit sounds a little silly, but it definitely is the first step.you’ve no chance at getting behind the wheel of a mega truck if you’ve not yet mastered a ford!be sure to obtain your regular license first, you’ll then eventually be able to follow by earning your cdl – commercial driver’s license.step 2 complete your education requirementsit’s always better to have certifications and educational achievements in your name when you’re looking to get started in any new career, but the bureau of labor statistics has reported that it’s not entirely necessary to have your high school degree to find your place in the truck driving industry.however, serious candidates do enroll in community colleges or private driving schools in order to study and complete the truck driving curriculum and make an easier entrance into the industry.of course, tuition fees will apply, and the programs can last for several months and sometimes up to a full year, but there is always the option of seeking tuition assistance.step 3 earn your required licensesas aforementioned, you are required to pass your cdl exam in order to progress with your truck driving career.the aspects of the cdl exam can be studied in your educational courses.truck drivers are expected to pass tests pertaining to their knowledge of federal traffic laws and the quality of their sight and vision – these topics are included in the federal motor carrier safety regulation examination.there is also an option to acquire a clp – commercial learners permit – while learning as a pupil of an experienced, cdl licensed driver.step 4 experienceexperience – the frustrating aspect of job-hunting! employees want you to have it, but nobody seems willing to give you it, it’s a catch-22!but do not get disheartened if you’re struggling to get into a job once you’ve completed the training and educational aspect of things.there’s always apprenticeships and internships that you can take on – in these positions, you’ll be able to build your skills and get acquainted with the more practical aspects of the role before you take the leap and apply for the job. find schoolswhat education is required?as we’ve already discussed, education and diplomas are not entirely necessary if you want to become a truck driver, but they certainly do help!there are only beneficial effects to be felt from enrolling on a course or achieving a particular certificate – it will only further your career.and besides, some jurisdictions do demand that you enroll in accredited colleges to pass examinations.so, in short, the education required does vary across states and companies – but it is always better to have the education on your side!video about the career what certification is required?again, this will change dependent on states.in certain states, an ordinary drivers’ license would suffice – but in most states, you will need to have passed certain license exams, including the cdl exam and the federal motor carrier safety regulation exam.the latter will require a written piece on federal laws.certification example: average training program duration: 6-12 monthswhat is the job outlook for truck drivers?there’s a demand for truck drivers, and worry not, the demand is expected to continue.the truck-driving industry is heavily based on commercialism and spending and we all know that this is not showing any signs of stopping, so the trucking industry is actually expected to increase by 5% between 2023 and 2033.now seems like the perfect time to get on board!employment growth projection: 5%2,211,30020232,313,4002033that's a higher than average projected growth of 102,100should you become a truck driver? overall satisfaction: mediumfor all the perks of being a truck driver, there are also plenty of pitfalls to consider, too.we’ve considered these downsides and factored it into our conclusion that truck-driving provides a medium level of job satisfaction.it’s true, you can make good money as a truck driver and the job occupancy rate is expected to sky-rocket, but you’ll also forfeit a lot of time that could be spent personally – with family, friends, the people that you love.you must also consider that havoc that trucking wreaks on your body-clock – say goodbye to any semblance of a sleeping pattern!a lot of truck-drivers do feel a lot of stress, but the job itself pays well, is flexible and is secure.job security is one of the most sought-after things in this day and age – we all fear the prospect of finding ourselves out of work and being unable to keep up with the bills, but there is no danger of this in trucking.the american trucking association have stated that there is in fact a serious shortage within the industry, so much so that it could damage the us distribution system!some individuals find truck driving as a welcome escape from their previous dreary, 9-5 working life.truck-driving provides variety – while you may work up to 70 hours a week at times, you can guarantee that all your trips are unique, and there will always be something memorable that occurs along the way.the salary itself is also enough to encourage people to overlook the downfalls of the industry – it is a comfortable wage, and for those who genuinely love to be on the road and venture into new places.it’s a chance to get paid to do what they enjoy the most. average salary: highas we’ve already covered, the truck-driver salary is around $50,971 on average.if you compare this to salary figures of a decade ago – which were more in the range of $20,000 – then you can really see how the wage has increased alongside the demand for drivers.and you already know by this point that the demand for truck drivers is only continuing to grow alongside commercialism and trade – so you can expect that the wage may rise too.overall, we’ve concluded that the salary is quite high considering the work and the requirements. job growth outlook: mediumthe job does provide security, and it is expected to grow to meet the rate of commercialism, but we must conclude that the job growth is average.consider the growth in careers within the technology field – more and more businesses are becoming reliant on the use and development of technology, so you could state that job growth is high in this field.to further touch on the topic of technology – it is also worth considering the advancements in technology in terms of vehicle usage.developments are consistently making vehicles easier to operate, which will subsequently open to roles to a wider group of people – applicants who may have previously struggled with obtaining certification and operating a large vehicle will find it easier and the job itself can be made safer.overall, truck-driving will continue to grow in demand at a steady rate, considering there are serious shortages within the industry – so it’s pretty much guaranteed that employees will continue to be required. education duration: 6-12 monthswhile levels of education and certification will vary depending on the state, the average length of time it takes to become qualified is usually between 6-12 months.some establishments will demand a full year in training, as well as education.but, other private establishments may facilitate a more practical, apprenticeship-type approach that allows you more time in a hands-on learning environment and less time spent studying on a course. personal skills neededyou could take all the examinations in the world and obtain umpteen certifications, but there are certain personal skills required in order to meet the truck-driving criteria – and those are:mental resiliencedeterminationeffective communicationendurancea propensity to work aloneability to work as part of a teamability to detect any issues quicklycreative thinkingproblem resolutionpassionfrequently asked questionsq. do you make good money as a truck driver?there are outliers within the statistics of truck-driver salaries; some reports range from $38,000 to
