order the new 
sleeping lady cd






click here=> i am interested in the sleeping lady cd: 





     
            















sleeping lady  
turkey in the straw, walkin' in my sleep, catnip, moonlight waltz, bluegrass swing, the old mountaineer, call of the shepherd, little rabbit, cruel willie, cotton eyed joe, salt creek, carol county blues, sleeping lady, midnight at bean blossom





 

            







independent  reviews from mandolin lists
the final word of praise goes to your "sleeping lady."  first, the
recording itself:  i see what you meant by saying that you recorded frank
as if the mandolin were 50' tall.  clear, hard, stunning clarity:  the
pick clicking on strings throughout.  many things to praise, from that
great split break between fiddle and mandolin in "turkey" (you go low and
he goes high) to that languid sweet slide you get on "sleeping
lady"--followed by frank's teasing slow tempo in his break.  in fact, on
both these recordings frank sounds more like monroe than ever, and seems
deliberately to have slowed much of his playing (noticeable on "camptown",
my fifth recorded version and my favorite) which gives a wonderful effect.
 a very great record.  i have been playing john hartford's two ed haley
records ("the speed of the old long bow" and ("wild hog") lately, and
yours has entered the rotation for daily listening.   in fact for variety
as well as great playing, i rank it with the k. colonels "appalachian
swing" and dan crary's "bluegrass guitar."
now please find your way to new england.

"sleeping lady" bluegrass instrumentals by jim moss (on fiddle),
featuring frank wakefield (mandolin) and bob black (banjo), is a cd that must
not be kept a "sleeping lady".  it must be heard by all!
i purchased the cd after the frank wakefield concert at mccabes! 
i was able to meet jim moss~ and i must say i was very impressed with his playing! 
actually, i think the band would have played into the wee hours of the night... that is
how much they love their music!   btw the concert was 3 1/2 hours long!
on the cd, my favorite songs are:  "moonlight waltz",
"catnip", "little rabbit", and "cotton eyed joe".
check this cd out... you won't be disappointed!
my best,
linda riha
burbank, ca
                         
linda,
that is a great album.  i bought one from mr. moss at the
frank wakefield band show at mccabes.  i don't think i have ever heard
fiddle and mandolin with the rich monroe sound as i have with this cd.
mr wakefield's mandolin sounds like it is coming through the speakers.
same for the fiddle.   this is like no other mandolin cd.
why can't we get more cds with the huge sound that sleeping lady has.
moonlight waltz is incredible.   i also like walking in my sleep.
this is the first moss album i have seen.    does anyone know if there
are others out.
this sure has the monroe sound.

frank wakefield's fiddle player, band leader, manager and booking agent,
jim moss has a new cd called "sleeping lady". frank's all over it with his
own unique style as is bob black on banjo and various others. this is some
really powerful fiddle playing....tough,strong recording. bluegrass on
steroids! there are some good old tunes, some new stuff and it's a really
fresh take. he uses some open tunings on the fiddle where it sounds like a
bunch of bagpipes along with the fiddle. good stuff as anything frank
participates seems to be. get it at: www.candlewater.com. highly
recommended with no financial interest. 
larry otis
                         
i have to second linda's "a must"!  sleeping lady is one of the most
tasteful projects that i've listened to in quite a while.  all instrumental,
and several jim moss originals.  jim's fiddle is spectacular, wakefield's
loar is stellar, and black's banjo is about as tasteful as i've ever heard.
kenny baker must be some more teacher!
gary mcelwee
 
  
  the "sleeping lady" cd is outstanding! i can't believe you guys aren't
household names! every tune is great, from the smokin' "turkey in the straw"
to the title tune. i'm going to order both of your current cd's and give a
copy of "sleeping lady" to my parents. they'll love it!
thanks again,
john bowen
                       
i just wonder why we don't hear more music like this.  if you close your
eyes it sounds like monroe himself.  it also sounds like frank wakefield.
the fiddle has real punch in fact the entire album has punch.  this is
what bluegrass sounded like in the 1960's.  hard! and tough!
bill mason
    
i just need to add my voice to the chorus of praise for the jim moss
"sleeping lady" recording. i received my copy yesterday. i played it in the
car on the way to work this morning. i've got a bose system, and the sound
was just breathtaking. the fiddle and mandolin sounded like they were right
there in the car with me (at least until my wife made me turn it down some).
not that the other instruments don't sound good as well, but it is those two
that sound so startlingly present to me. and while i'm talking about the cd,
i certainly don't want to ignore the music! fourteen great tunes, some old
and some new (to me at least). frank wakefield sounds great as always, and
bob black does a fine job on banjo. i'd have to say that "cruel willie" is
my favorite. sends chills up my spine as i listen to it hear now. very
powerful stuff. right now i'm listening to it on my cambridge soundworks
desktop theater computer sound system, and it sounds great on that too!
anyway, i'm rambling, and need to get back to work, but i can't say enough
about this recording. you owe it to yourself to get a copy. i have no
financial interest in saying so, and i don't know jim personally (although i
hope our paths cross someday). 
 
regards,
rob coleman
                       
 
jim, i received your new cd sleeping lady.
this is a great cd! there's some fine fiddling going on
and frank is kicking it. it's getting repeated playing at the moment.
i like all the instrumentals but, i i'm really digging bonus track #16.
 
thanks!
john amann
                       
hi jim, i'm listening to the sleeping lady cd today at work and i can't believe 
how well it's recorded.  my compliments to the chef !! 
(our mastering engineer at work is impressed)  can't wait to hear the next batch.
when walkin' in my sleep came on it almost blew me out of my chair. 
frank's mandolin sounds like it's coming from right between your ears. 
bob black sounds crystal clear and your fiddle rips right through your chest. 
i had to pour a drink and settle down.  that's the way bluegrass is supposed to sound, 
not like the antiseptic recordings we hear today - way over produced like they're squeezing 
all the juice out of it.  english rocker and producer nick lowe used to mix everything 
through tiny car radio speakers and his records always sounded more present than 
anyone else's at the time.  i think we should all go back to mono and start over. 
by the way, last night i viewed part of the dvd and i must say that that's gotta be 
the best way to teach mandolin.  i had a non-playing mandolin friend with me 
who always asked me "how do you do that?" now after seeing frank, 
he's substantially demystified.  i'm very impressed with the whole method. 
great job jim.

when i got home (sunday) all i did for the next week is to play the new cd's 
and tape i got.  i couldn't believe i had only gotten the one with you on it (sleeping lady). 
                      i marked a few of the songs that were my favorite. 
when i heard 'moonlight waltz' i nearly wept.
