common questions





										will my ez oil drain valve leak?
										





									no. the ez oil drain valve incorporates the âball valveâ design of valves used in pressurised gas applications and will not leak. every single valve is constructed under precise specifications and pressure tested, ensuring a perfect seal upon factory approval. the ez oil drain valve is produced in an iso-9001 certified factory.
								






										will my ez oil drain valve open up due to vibration or shock?
										





									no. when installed, the ez oil drain valve only extends about 1.5 inch from the oil pan more than a stock oil drain plug in its closed position. the valve's effective locking system requires a double-action mechanism to open it, preventing any accidental openings.  unlike spring-loaded gate valves, the heavy-duty ball valve construction will withstand any engine vibration. 
								






										how long will my ez oil drain valve last?
										





									the ez oil drain valve is constructed out of corrosion-resistant, forged brass, stainless steel, and nickel-plated for added protection from the elements. brass is the ideal material as it can withstand temperature extremes as well as harsh environmental factors (eg. salt, water, oil, chemicals, etc.). your ez oil drain valve will outlast your engine. 
								






										how do i know which ez oil drain valve to use?
										





							  please go to the size guide page to find the correct sized ez oil drain valve. we will soon have a printable measuring chart to help determine the correct size for your application. feel free to contact us for technical help.






										can i use the ez oil drain valve for other applications?
										





							  yes, the ez oil drain valve can be used for many applications, including transmissions, radiators, water drain, fuel drain, diesel exhaust fluid (def) tanks and many other applications. please contact us for your requirements as we can also custom design for your application.

it's not even expensive!
for such a high quality product, you certainly can't complain about the price.
$a39.50 small body valve. $a56.50 medium/large body valve. hose ends from $8.50. shipping from $7.90.

it literally costs less than a bottle of good oiljason qld

compare the costs over 100,000km for a toyota 100 series landcruiser 6 cylinder petrol. don't forget, an ez oil drain valve is a once only cost. you install it and never have to replace or service it.






genuine wiper blade inserts (drivers, passenger, rear) replaced every 20,000km. genuine oil filter replaced every 7,000km with oil change. premium quality mineral oil (2 x 5l bottles required) changed every 7,000km (some prefer more frequent changes e.g. 5000km). fuel prices fluctuate.
