about click

the uc davis collaborative learning in classroom networks (click) lab is a research group focused on developing and studying new technologies to support the teaching and learning of mathematics and science. our methodological approach is grounded in design-based research, and our development efforts center on personal digital devices as tools for supporting students’ collaborative engagement with important concepts and practices in mathematics and other stem fields.
we see new devices as opportunities to imagine and create new ways for students to interact with one another, with teachers, and with mathematical objects and ideas. our designs use mobile computing tools to support collaborative learning activities for small groups of students in k-16 stem classrooms. these designs form the context for ongoing cycles of research focused on investigating intersections between conceptual and social dimensions of learning, and formal and informal dimensions of digital and mathematical practices.
