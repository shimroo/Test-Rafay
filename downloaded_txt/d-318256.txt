third rug purchase - quality and service brilliant 

                the sales folk at kilim are responsive and really helpful. they give clear responses which make it easier to make a decision on a large purchase.the shipping time was fast and free unlike many of the larger retailers.this is my third rug purchase from kilim and initially i went with a different company - big mistake. i love my newest rug - it’s exactly as described and the quality is fantastic.

just what i was looking for

                the rug is exactly as pictured, it was well packaged, and a perfect addition in my space. there are so many wonderful options on the website to fit any size that you were looking for. i was concerned i wouldn’t be able to find a runner in the size that i needed and this is perfect.
