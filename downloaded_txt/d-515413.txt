master of orion ii - battle at antares


lord brazen's game review
        master of orion ii: battle at antares is an epic turn-based fantasy strategy game which was first released way back in 1997.  for those that enjoy games that are focused on tactics, strategy, and diplomacy, master of orion ii is a good place to start.

        whether in the thick of battle or viewing a cut scene, the visuals were pretty impressive for its day. the 640x480 screen resolution is a little limited by today`s standards, but the implementation works well and it gives plenty of life to this classic series.

        the basic premises of the game are to create an empire, develop technology, and eventually build an invasion fleet against rivals who are seeking to do the same.

        master of orion ii offers game play against up to 7 opponents.  the game has excellent multiplayer support with hot seat, modem, serial link, and lan games.  you can choose any combination of human or ai opponents.

        there are thirteen standard races to choose from but most veteran players design a custom race.  there is a large array of race customization options available allowing players to customize their race to match their playing style.... full review

updated patcher moo2v140b24



today i posted a new version of the patch. this build does not add any new fixes to the game however. it simply fixes some minor issues with the exe that applies the patch to the game.the new patcher can now be run in dos or dosbox directly. you no longer need to run from the windows command prompt. this should allow the patch to be applied on any system with dosbox (such as linux and mac os users).i actually built this version of the patch back in 2008 however never released it.
