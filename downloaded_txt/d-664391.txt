the love frequency retreat



may 8, 2024




adora, thank you for living visibly and clearly into your calling and invitation for all to remember, to heal, to become. as i stopped long enough to listen and clearly heard the invitation. my experience at the july 2023 retreat opened up clear connection, community, and answers i had been longing for. there is so much to say about that weekend that i'm not certain where to start. the primary learning was that the weekend was just the beginning. in the past month my life and the life of my loved ones has opened up in areas where there was once loss, grief, missed connections, and pain. the retreat set off a series of events that were clearly aligned and ready to come forward. i appreciate the integrity, inclusion, and connection you stand in. thank you. k.h.

divine feminine immersion retreat



may 8, 2024




i am very blessed to have met you. your retreat was at a turning point for me in both knowing and nurturing myself better. much of my joy in life comes from connection and community, so finding you and the soul institute has truly been special. the retreat taught me to go inward, even when that is not easy. i now see that the only way "up" the vibrational ladder is to experience my emotions more fully. the retreat increased my awareness of my emotions and limiting patterns, and in many cases, their dna linkages. you guided us with love and care, making my retreat experience a life changing one. g.s. canada
