we recognise and acknowledge the indigenous peoples and cultures that have traditionally lived on the lands on which our facilities are located. in australia, we acknowledge the wajarri yamaji as the traditional owners and native title holders of inyarrimanha ilgari bundara, the csiro murchison radio-astronomy observatory, the site where the ska-low telescope is being built. inyarrimanha ilgari bundara means “sharing sky and stars” in the wajarri language.
