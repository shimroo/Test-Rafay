brooklyn’s 50 most fascinating people 2022 – eric gonzalez
brooklyn district attorney eric gonzalez
eric gonzalez made history in november 2017 when he became the first latino district attorney elected in new york state. he assumed the post after the 2016 death of ken thompson, who three years earlier had become the first black d.a. in brooklyn.
but with a promise to helm “the most progressive d.a.’s office in the country,” he didn’t stop making history there.


homicides and shootings continued to drop in brooklyn in 2022, driving citywide decline in gun violence during past two years
shootings in brooklyn decreased by 31% and homicides went down by 21%,  since the 2020 peak, accounting for about 88% of the decline in murders and 83% of the declines in shootings and shooting victims across new york city over that time period
district attorney gonzalez said, “i am happy to report that public safety in brooklyn continued to improve over the past year, as we rebound from the spike in violence that we experienced during 2020. the significant declines in murders and shootings in our borough are driving the citywide gains against gun violence and are a testament to the hard work and focused approach by my office, the nypd and all of our partners. we still have work to do as we pledge to drive down gun crimes even further and contend with upticks in other crime categories, but i am confident that we are on the right track. i remain committed to targeting the most violent individuals and to growing our partnerships with community-based groups, violence interrupters and others who are engaged in preventative strategies.”


brooklyn da eric gonzalez dedicates unprecedented resources to combat gun violence under comprehensive stop violence initiative 
building on reductions in shootings and homicides during the first half of the year, plan adds personnel, technology, intelligence-sharing protocols and community partnerships to prevent shootings and prosecute offenders
brooklyn district attorney eric gonzalez today announced a comprehensive strategy to fight gun violence in brooklyn and dedicated unprecedented new resources to enhance the office’s analytics, investigative and technological capacity to prevent violence and to hold accountable those who commit gun crimes. the new investments include a $2 million digital evidence lab, a new ghost gun unit and an executive position focusing on gun violence reduction. the office is also making significant new investments in gang violence prevention programs and youth engagement.

brooklyn district attorney eric gonzalez announces the creation of new gender-based violence division
will include domestic violence, sex crimes, human trafficking, victim services and more; led by experienced prosecutor and national expert on intimate partner violence
district attorney gonzalez said, “improving the way we approach gender-based violence has long been a goal of my administration and creating this new division will go a long way toward achieving that. the same trauma-informed and survivor-centered approach is necessary when handling cases of sexual abuse, intimate partner violence or trafficking, and when providing support to survivors. i am confident that under this new structure and with guidance from a nationally recognized expert and veteran prosecutor, the brooklyn da’s office will be able to better assist victims and more effectively bring offenders to justice.”

$200 and ipad will be given for working handgun or assault rifle, no questions asked; will be held at emmanuel baptist church on saturday, may 21
district attorney gonzalez said, “our close collaboration with law enforcement, strong commitment to holding offenders accountable, and constant engagement with communities to prevent violence is bearing fruit, with shootings in brooklyn decreasing by nearly 25% so far this year following a 20% drop in 2021. as we redouble our efforts to keep our communities safe, we will be hosting another gun buyback event this saturday – just one part of a comprehensive strategy to get firearms off the streets. i encourage anyone who has a gun at home to take advantage of this opportunity, safely turn it in, and get some cash and an ipad in return.”

seventeen alleged gang members charged in two indictments containing total of 118 counts, including conspiracy to commit murder
three violent gangs allegedly formed alliance to increase numbers and territory;
fourteen shootings charged during course of conspiracy, including three murders
district attorney gonzalez said, “this successful takedown is part of our ongoing strategy to reduce shootings and senseless deaths by targeting the most violent offenders in our communities. a particularly troubling aspect of this case is that many of the defendants are teenagers, including an individual charged in connection with all three murders, allegedly committed when he was only 16. we must engage with our young people and help to keep them on the right path. they must learn that there is another way to live beyond the gang life and be given the tools and services to help them succeed. i am committed to doing both: aggressively prosecuting shooters and partnering with community-based groups that work with our youth to prevent future violence.”

brooklyn district attorney eric gonzalez dismisses all outstanding prostitution-related warrants
262 warrants connected to offenses that are no longer prosecuted dismissed in first phase; da calls on legislature to repeal loitering law and expunge prostitution convictions
district attorney gonzalez said, “vacating these warrants and dismissing these cases is consistent with my view that those who engage in these activities need to be offered assistance, not criminally prosecuted. i am also calling on albany to repeal the law that prohibits what is known as loitering for purposes of prostitution, because of the vagueness of the law, the stark racial inequalities in its enforcement, and the disproportionate harm that enforcement of the law has caused to vulnerable trans women in our community. additionally, i am asking the legislature to expunge past prostitution convictions so they will not hold people back from opportunities for a better future.”
