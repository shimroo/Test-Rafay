 e-mail 
                            is by far the best way to reach us - it's quick, and

                            non-lightweight bikes. (to establish value, we recommend 
                            searching ebay for similar items that have sold recently 
                            with the aid of good, clear photos). if you don't 
                            receive a response to your legitimate e-mail, you 
                            may have a spamblocker or filter of some kind that 
                            needs to be adjusted! 

we

                            than about 1987, index shifting, clipless pedals, 
                            or repainting / re-decaling bikes, sorry....

a note from the owner:
i purchased a fairly dormant bicycle classics in 2003 not 
                    for 'mercenary' reasons, but to escape the corporate world 
                    after twenty-plus years, help fill a need that i felt was 
                    largely going unmet, and, hopefully, to have a much cooler 
                    job. this is a real llc that pays real taxes, insurance, legal 
                    fees, banking fees, etc., etc. bicycle classics 
                    will never be very profitable, but that's ok by me. our 'mission 
                    statement' is very narrowly-focused. we don't manufacture 
                    things ourselves (yet!), or sell anything made of carbon fiber, 
                    or that was made in china. we sell top-quality items with 
                    craftsmanship and lasting value. if we can survive, and help 
                    a few more folks keep their vintage 'old-skool' skinny-tired 
                    road and track bikes rolling along smoothly and safely each 
                    year, i'll be very happy. additionally, at least five percent 
                    of the sales of this business (not of the profits, which can 
                    be 'cooked' to come out any way you want) go to worthy organizations 
                    such as: doctors without borders (msf), kiva zip (a major 
                    microloan underwriter), keep a child alive (an anti-retroviral 
                    medication provider), and others.
ciao,
gregorio
p.s.: i am always looking for more cool (and appropriate) 
                    vintage-themed bike parts to stock. suggestions / requests 
                    are always welcome!
 
note: nos means "new, old stock." these 
                    are parts that are new and unused, but are out of production. 
                    (contrary to what you might see on ebay, nos does not mean 
                    nice old used shyte)! all items for 
                    sale on this website are either new (current production) or 
                    n.o.s. unless otherwise specified.

                    tape. price is $45.00 for ten rolls, the same as the french

now available! "rene herse - the 
                    bikes, the builder, the riders" coffee-table book!

jan heine's new masterwork about rene herse is just stunning. 
                    many years in the making, this huge book was painstakingly 
                    researched and is brilliantly written and organized. the massive 
                    quantity of vintage black-and-white and color photographs 
                    is awesome, all by itself, but the book really delves into 
                    the man and his creations in a thorough and logical manner. 
                    with herse coming from an early aerospace machinist's background, 
                    it is now more obvious (to me, anyways) why his products were 
                    so thoroughly engineered, well-thought-out, and flawlessly 
                    executed. bravo!

now available! skf super-durable high-quality 
                    cartridge bottom brackets from germany!
we now have the new bottom brackets from the wizards at skf 
                    (tullio campagnolo always spec'ed their bearings, even though 
                    they were not an italian company, because they were the best!). 
                    these were designed from the ground up, using a roller bearing 
                    on the drive side, stainless steel almost everywhere, large 
                    ball-bearings on the non-drive side (that run directly on 
                    the spindle), and sturdy seals. life expectancy is ten years 
                    or 100,000 km for these bbs. various lengths, mostly bsc, 
                    but some italian-thread and french-thread options as well. 
                    these are $139.00 - $159.00 complete. see our bottom brackets 
                    page for details.
