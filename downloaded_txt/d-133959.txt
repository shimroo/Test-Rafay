since 1897, four generations of the freitag family have provided the finest 
quality funeral services to all faiths in the bridgeton area. the funeral home 
is widely recognized throughout the state as one of the finest facilities used 
as a funeral home. the support and confidence from the community throughout the 
years have enabled them to reach over 120 years of business. kenneth freitag, the 
fourth generation of the freitag family is proud to carry on the traditions on 
which the freitag funeral home was founded. their commitment to each and every 
family they serve is a testament to the long and distinguished record of service 
to the greater bridgeton community.
