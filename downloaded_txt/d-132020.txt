the saint john's bible

            in 1998, saint john's abbey and university commissioned renowned calligrapher donald jackson to produce a hand-written, hand-illuminated bible. we invite you to explore this work of art that unites an ancient benedictine tradition with the technology and vision of today, illuminating the word of god for a new millennium.
