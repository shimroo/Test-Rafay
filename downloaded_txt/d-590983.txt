	 jennifer hudson shines at oscars
	 
    
jennifer hudson won best supporting actress for her role as effie in dreamgirls. i'm so happy for her! no other american idol reject has ever achieved so much. not only did she win big, she also gave an outsanding performance along with her co-stars. you go girl!

ciara shot a video for her latest single "like a boy". i think it's good because it's not the typical ciara video look.
