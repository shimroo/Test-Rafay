peopleread aboutour people












hi allison, i just wanted to send you a note about how pleased we have been over the past 8 years with our frosty factory machines. we have them in all 10 of our colorado locations and i think they are an integral part of the success of our margarita program.
 the features that make frosty factory stand apart are…
·       large display freezing cylinders
·       lighted name plate
·       ease of assembly and operation
·       variety of models
·       and of course cost
as president of the fuzzy’s franchise council i have recommended your company to every new franchisee. thanks again for all your help over the years!
