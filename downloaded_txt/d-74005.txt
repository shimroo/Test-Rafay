    who's the kid?

january 11, 2024

a few folks who have called our office recently have noticed that our auto-attendant sounds like a child. that’s because it is. most of the comments have been very positive: “i love the voice recording when i call your office!” “who is that sweet child whose voice i heard when i called you? she’s awesome!” “can we hire the youngster who recorded your phone greeting?”                                                                                     is she real? yes. is she for hire? yes! just give us a call and we’ll let you know how to do that. we did get one negative comment: “it sounds like you have a little girl answering your phones. i think that’s very unprofessional and it doesn’t make any sense at all.”                                                                                      first of all, in response to the negative comment: as unprofessional or senseless as you may think we are, our talent is nothing but professional. she is a voiceover talent who is available for hire for video narration, animation, auto attendant greetings, and commercials. as her website says, “she's got a voice that can make rainbows jealous and unicorns do a double take!” how could we not hire her? she aced the script right off the bat!                                                                                     so, why did we choose a young girl for our phone system? first of all, the list of our customers who serve children is one of which we are very proud. consider these websites as a few good examples of ways in which we help advance the mission of making the world better and safer for children:                                                                                     mentorakid.org                                                      noahbrave.org                                                      tnhandlewithcare.org                                                      youthencouragement.org                                                      livebrave2gether.org                                                      marthaobryan.org                                                      tnhistoryforkids.org                                                      owlshill.org                                                      tnicac.org                                                                                     we want to acknowledge the good work of these and other clients who work hard to serve children.                                                                                                            second, kids are part of our one eleven staff families. we want the best for them and, frankly, being a kid has been tough these past few years. covid made life hard enough for everyone but there wasn’t a parent in nashville who didn’t panic about the welfare of their child when they learned about a deadly school shooting on march 27, 2023.                                                                                     we know hiring a child to record our phone greeting is a little thing in business but part of our mission is to maintain the human interaction that seems absent with so many other businesses, especially in our industry. kids are human and humans are what we are about!                                                                                     so, to honor children and to remind ourselves how important it is that we listen to them, and care for them, we hope that you will enjoy being greeted by kylie when you call us.
