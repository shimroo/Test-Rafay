dr.
                    hyles on the king james bible:
 

"the biggest split that has
                    ever come will come in the next ten years, if not sooner,
                    over the king james bible - and it couldn't come soon enough
                    for me. i'm tired of colleges and universities advertising
                    that they 'use' the king james bible - tell the whole story!
                    tell everyone that you do not believe that it is inspired
                    word for word." -dr. jack hyles, revelation
                          to illumination (1998 wednesday night bible study)
 

"don't come to me with your
                    stinkin' 'only the original is inspired'! you're not
                    intellectual... you're retarded!" -dr.
                        jack hyles, keep your stinkin' feet out of my
                            drinking water (1998 wednesday night bible
                        study)

jack hyles began preaching at
                the age of 19 and pastored for 54 years. these pastorates
                include churches that varied in membership from 44 to over
                100,000. all of these pastorates, other than first baptist
                church of hammond, indiana, were in the state of texas: first,
                marris chapel baptist church of bogata, texas; then to grange
                hall baptist church in marshall, texas; from there to southside
                baptist church of henderson, texas; and then to miller road
                baptist church of garland, texas. he pastored miller road
                baptist church for approximately 7 years and saw this church,
                with the lord's help, grow from a membership of 44 to over
                4,000. it was from miller road baptist church that he was called

                average weekly attendance of over 15,000 with approximately
                10,000 baptisms each year. for many years, the church has been

                baptist church also owns and operates a rescue mission and
