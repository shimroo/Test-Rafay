our purposeprelado de los tesoros de la purísima (prelado) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. prelado roughly translates to “keepers of the treasures of la purísima." la purísima mission is the jewel of the california missions and california state parks.  this precious jewel is financially supported by prelado.prelado's support provides la purísima mission state historic park with animal care, money for enrichment programs, docent training, building repairs and many other aspects of operating this historic park. prelado also plays an important role in keeping la purísima mission open to the public through letter writing campaigns and other park supporting events. if you would like to become a member of prelado please contact us. for more information about the mission tours email lapurisimamission@gmail.comoverviewhistory comes alive here at the most extensively restored mission in the state. la purísima mission is restored to the 1820’s mission era. la purísima hosts over 200,000 visitors each year for recreation and a chance to explore california's heritage.founded in 1787, the la purísima mission land holdings once covered nearly 300,000 acres. bordered by the santa maria river in the north and the gaviota coastline in the south, the land was home to the chumash people and spanish settlers. the mission was best known for its hides and blankets, and at its peak two-thousand inhabitants herded as many as 24,000 cattle and sheep.













la purísima mission state historic park is open nearly every day for self-guided tours. the park interpreters lead a free one o’clock tour most days. the park frequently provides a re-creation of mission life during the 1820's, when the residents engaged in weaving, pottery making, candle making, blacksmithing, animal husbandry, and leatherwork. for dates, you can visit la purísima mission state historic park website for more information about the mission email prelado@lapurisimamission.org










the visitor center, which opened in 2009, tells the mission story from a multicultural perspective. this important exhibit hall was possible by prelado’s efforts in raising over $300,000 in grants and donations and sales from la tienda.
