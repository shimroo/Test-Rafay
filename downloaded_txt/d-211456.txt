chimney liners
a chimney liner is like the exhaust on your vehicle if it does not function properly or there isn’t one you and your family would inhale toxic fumes. your chimney liner does the same thing so it needs to be free and clear of any blockages, as well as structurally sound to ensure all fumes and toxic gases exit your home properly.

                                            absolute top notch service

                                            absolute top notch service. hired them for an inspection of the chimney flues; the technician was very courteous and professional, gave a detailed explanation of what they look for and showed pics on his device of the points of concern he found. we ended up needing repairs on the furnace flue. he was able to come back same-day and get the job done efficiently and properly. i looked up the average cost later just for the sake of thoroughness, and their prices were well below the high end for the services provided. definitely would recommend them to anyone that needs service done on their chimneys and flues.

                                            same day work

                                            jeff initially came out to inspect our chimney and found that there were drafting issues that were pretty unsafe. he was able to fix it same day! mark showed up and they got to work for a few hours completelty redoing the lining of the chimney, working into the night. they were awesome, they cleaned up and hauled out the brick and mortar they had knocked down for access and cleaned any mess made. the best part was that they were extremely knowledgeable and patient answering any questions i had. did not go a dollar over the original quote price for the work either. anyone who needs a chimney fix/maintenance call ultimate chimney sweep. i will be using them for years to come!

                                            they treated my home as if it were their own

                                            everyone from the office staff to the folks that came to do the work were polite, knowledgeable, professional, and confident. there were a couple of surprises inside the chimney, but the men cheerfully doubled down and were all business. throughout the entire process i felt they treated my home as if it were their own. truly a great group of people and a great company. thank you!
