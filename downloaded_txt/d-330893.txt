visiting central parkwhen it first opened in the winter of 1858, new york city's central park was the first major landscaped public park in america. the park's designers, park superintendent frederick law olmsted and architect calvert vaux, beat out 32 others in an open competition with their vision of an urban park landscape that included sheep meadow, bethesda fountain, belvedere tower, the lake, and the sunken traverse roads in the park's center. today, central park spans 843 acres of land in the heart of manhattan, the busiest of nyc's 5 boroughs, from 59th street to 110th street. over 42 million people visit central park each year.for first-timers (and even local new yorkers), walking through central park can feel a bit overwhelming—there is so much to see and do! let us introduce you to the park's possibilities with a relaxing carriage ride as you plan your visit. depending on the season, popular activities include but are not limited to: nature walks, rollerblading, visiting the family-friendly central park zoo or victorian gardens amusement park, bike riding, ice skating, attending outdoor concerts and shakespeare in the park (summer only), boat-rowing on the lake, and fishing in harlem meer (catch and release only).
