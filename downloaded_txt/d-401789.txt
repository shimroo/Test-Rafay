	 simon's brother chris' photoblog
	 
    


all his life my brother chris has been traveling to places that most people will probably never see. if you ever have the chance to sit down with him and have him tell you some of the stories he has experienced you are in for an incredibly captivating evening. his photography captures many of those moments and are amazingly powerful images. i personally love his portraits of the indigenous people of northern mexico...(click on the portrait link on the top right)check it out here!!
