welcome friends to mark’s black box project!













just what is the black box project?i am now 57-years-of age and i have put out a boatload of material over the years—i’m mighty proud of the work but i’d be a liar if i didn’t ‘fess up to three things.thing one-some of what a young man does in practice, tactics and strategy is just that, what a young man does. one with vim, vigor, speed, around 300 less injuries, and far less experience. if we are playing the game of life right, the older we get, the wiser we get, and in this particular case the meaner we get.thing two-i am a far better archeologist now than i was decades prior. oh, i’ve always been not too shabby in the research, test, trial and error department, but, again, that age thing leads me to believe that i’ve only gotten better at my obscure digging for old school combative gold. hell, i never would have thought that i’d learn the comanche language simply to dig even deeper under layers of wicked dust.thing three-we have always presented our material in an abc/123 logical manner with no skipped steps. to my mind it’s the ideal way to assimilate but…there are a few aspects that have always been held back. why? home-court advantage, and all that jazz. i love you all but those who stand side by side with you get a bit more hands on, if you will.you hate reading? listen to mark talk about rough and tumble on the managing violence podcast!or listen here to the latest episode of mark’s rough and tumble raconteur podcast  if you want to support the podcast, i’d be much obliged. 



two questionsover the years kind folks have often asked one of two questions.question one-“mark, you have a boatload of material, where do i start?” my answer has always been, stepping into the river anywhere will get you wet and over time the strokes blend together and we’re all swimmin’ and having a fine time. there is truth in that answer, but perhaps an insufficient tack for those in a hurry.question two-“mark, if you had to boil meanness down to the marrow bone, trim the fat and leave all the parisian filigrees behind what would that black box of mayhem look like?”the black box project is the reply to those two questions.beginning august 1st, 2020, and starting with raw 214 and moving forward each monthly raw dvd will open that black box and offer tools that…1.      i guarantee will put the hurt on from the word go.2.      most of which we’ve never offered before [our home-court advantage tools if you will.]3.      are the result of all the accumulated years of combat archeology.4.      each volume will feature 3 units: striking, with old school boxing & frontier rough ‘n’ tumble as its base.5.      grappling with old school wrestling as its base. and crew, i guarantee that this new direction is new indeed as it tilts from mat-approved competition tactics to the unkind. [many of these tactics are quite harsh, part of the reason i never really featured them as friend-utility is low.]6.      frontier weaponry, primarily historical tomahawk and trade-knife. we will be using the full head weight protocol and not modern lighter head tactics.7.      we will also occasionally feature a sidebar for an old school conditioner that has caught my eye and seemingly fallen off radar screens.most of this material being kept close to the vest for so long will also mean that some of the freebie video will tease more along the edges. i will transfer this home-court advantage to paying customers and likely leave more than a few key details off the freebies for both safety and home court reasons.having communicated with so many of you i can almost guarantee that historical mavens, the street focused, the hardcore cadre will enjoy this new stew.i can also almost guarantee that those looking for kinder, gentler subs that are kosher for almost all rule-sets, well, we’ve got over 200 back volumes that will cover those bases. the black box project is for the wicked at heart.every volume of raw comes with a targeted syllabi, and the black box project is no different. if the above whets your appetite but you need more info—have a look-see at my blog where you’ll find hundreds [literally] of articles on old school combat history, old school pt, rough ‘n’ tumble fighting, scientific aspects of preparation, motivational wisdom form the old-timers. https://indigenousability.blogspot.com/prowl on, you’ll see what i mean and thanks for stopping by!
