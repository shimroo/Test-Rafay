“i am a school-based autism consultant. your work has truly been life changing, and i reference your materials and research every single day. at my job, i work with teachers and give them suggestions based on observations of students… s’cool moves is always relevant, and i always share the information with enthusiasm.”

— chris r.















“teachers, students, support staff, and administrators love using these activities and are seeing the difference that it’s making in the classrooms! i love having something tangible and already beautifully put together to share with teachers. i feel like i’m being so much more effective as an occupational therapist in schools.”

— tiffany clark, otr/l





















































“i’m having my rock star moment. the more i share my passion for educating, the more  my staff is seeking out information from me. i’m so excited and feel so successful.”

— dr. rachel gambino, dpt

































hello. i’m dr. debra em wilson, and here’s my backstory in a nutshell…my daughter was born with microcephaly, a rare genetic disorder, and a constellation of cognitive and developmental challenges. she now lives in her own apartment and becomes more independent every day with habilitation coaching and support. i developed s’cool moves to help her learn and succeed in school because school staff didn’t know how to help her due to her significant challenges. understanding polyvagal theory and how the nervous system works in times of regulation and dysregulation has provided an additional layer of understanding and support for my daughter. it’s been life changing. i want to create a short-cut path for those in a similar position. i’ve been there. i’m still there. i want to help you however i can.author • teacher • reading specialist • founder of s’cool moves

what trusted experts say




“at last, the science and practice of polyvagal theory clarified and adapted for the educational setting which needs it more than ever. i look forward to referencing this book again and again.”

— dr. christopher willard, faculty, harvard medical school
















“...a thoughtful, helpful guide to the ways in which we ‘think with our bodies.’ teachers, administrators, and parents can all benefit from reading wilson’s informed and insightful book.”

— annie murphy paul, author of the extended mind




“...with analogies such as leaky boats, car alarms, and loaded backpacks, teachers will be equipped to get in sync with their challenging students and to transform their classrooms into joyful learning centers.”

—  carol stock kranowitz, author of the out-of-sync child





“the resilient learner’s backpack is a beautifully crafted guide to bringing polyvagal principles into everyday use in school settings. through stories and activities that honor the needs of the nervous system, debra em wilson uses her deep understanding of classrooms and learners to help students, staff, and teachers travel the ventral path to safety and connection.”

— deb dana, lcsw, author of the polyvagal theory in therapy: engaging the rhythm of regulation and polyvagal practices: anchoring the self in safety


























we’ve proudly provided effective, engaging, and evidence-based trainings to schools, clinics, and organizations for 25 years.
