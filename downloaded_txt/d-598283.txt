rnn media group
rnn owns the largest group of independent broadcast stations in the united states.
we cover more than 28% of households within eight of the top-ten dmas.
our total reach will exceed 86mm over-the-air pops.







 















rnn is an entrepreneur-owned portfolio of independent broadcast assets and production/distribution capabilities located north of new york city.
in 1993 rnn was established with a single broadcast station in new yorkâ€™s hudson valley, reaching less than 250,000 homes.
over the subsequent years, rnn has grown to cover the full nyc dma and expanded with independent broadcast stations in philadelphia, washington, dc, and boston.
