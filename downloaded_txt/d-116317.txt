wrapping up the fall 2024 semester with the pafnys campus organizing program



dec 23, 2024




in the wake of the turbulent 2023-24 academic year, during which demonstrations for gaza erupted across college campuses around the country, including at colleges where pafnys chapters are currently active, the fall 2024 semester marked a shift in the way that students were organizing around this issue and other critical peace and justice issues we focus on. although several of the 12 currently-active chapters did carry out demonstrations such as rallies and teach-ins, others chose to focus on fundraising as their primary organizing strategy in the fall semester.

notes from japan: the august 2024 peace march and world conference against a & h bombs



oct 24, 2024




by rex alex — along the march, i had opportunities to share stories about student activism surrounding gaza over the course of the spring semester. upon hearing the stories of students like myself facing arrests and suspensions, the other peace marchers expressed admiration and encouragement. their kindness inspired me as i realized that there is a global community of activists who support us even in times of hardship. furthermore, local organizers explained to me that they are passionate about the cause of palestinian liberation because when they look at gaza today, they see hiroshima and nagasaki 79 years ago. this message of solidarity, a message which asserts that no people should suffer from war crimes and indiscriminate bombings, moved me and motivates me today to continue my human rights and peace activism.

the 2024 william sloane coffin, jr. peacemaker awards



oct 9, 2024




on september 30, 2024, new york peacemakers gathered at the 17th annual william sloane coffin, jr. peacemaker awards in new york city. this year, pafnys was pleased to present the peacemaker awards to leslie cagan, former national organizer for united for peace & justice, and professor rashid khalidi, author of the hundred years' war on palestine and edward said professor emeritus of modern arab studies at columbia university. pafnys also presented the annual don shaffer student peacemaker award to stony brook university peace action, and the inaugural holly maguigan peace with justice award to charlie mandracchia.the theme of this year’s event – grassroots organizing against war in 2024 – centered the courageous work of peace activists who are organizing to oppose war in the particularly fraught political environment of 2024. throughout the year, new york grassroots peace groups have been at the forefront of pressuring u.s. leaders to work to end global conflict and confront the rising nuclear threat by pursuing diplomatic rather than militaristic solutions to conflict. in the spring, new york college campuses were the catalyst of a global student outcry against the war in gaza, giving voice to the growing youth movement for a ceasefire and end of u.s. weapons support for genocide.

aug 5, 2024




as we reflect on the 79th anniversary of the atomic bombings, holding the stories of hibakusha in our hearts, it is critical that we acknowledge all victims of nuclear weapons and know that there is still so much work to be done.
