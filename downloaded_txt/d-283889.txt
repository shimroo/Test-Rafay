steampunk gibson girlsi'm contemplating a costume based on charles dana gibson's "school days" gibson girls. any ideas on how to steam it up? i'll have a clockwork cameo brooch, and i'm trying to figure out a way to sub in mad science for the golf club - lightning rod attached to box with dials or something?

03:48 pm[link]so it's going to take me a while to change all my @livejournal emails to @gmail, and get my new journal style set up the way i want it, but yeah: i'm going to be moving to dreamwidth. if any of you have dreamwidth accounts, let me know so i can add you. and if you know of a style that will give me colored bars with user icons to the left of the entry text, let me know that too.
