costa rica fly fishing
the rio indio fly fishing lodge is located in a region of costa rica & nicaragua that puts our magnificent fly fishing lodge in the ideal location to offer a variety of costa rica fly fishing charters and nicaragua fly fishing charters.  rio indio lodge offers the best costa rica tarpon fly fishing, snook fishing, rainbow bass fishing, and machaca fishing.  come join us at our los suenos fishing headquarters for costa rica fly fishing trips that target marlin, sailfish, dorado, and roosterfish.  we are only minutes from jaco beach.  our costa rica fly fishing lodge and nicaragua fly fishing lodge provides guests with an exclusive year-round fly fishing destination for species unlikely to be found anywhere else.
the desire to experience catching trophy fish in costa rica on both the caribbean coast and pacific coast has become the prime attraction for anglers looking to experience costa rica fly fishing trips. our costa rica fly fishing lodge offers fly fishing trips to remote areas on the caribbean coast that have a more traditional method of tarpon fly fishing involving sight fly fishing and casting to cruising or feeding tarpon. here we usually expect to find smaller costa rica tarpon in ranges from 40 lbs to 70 lbs.  larger costa rica tarpon are also regularly hooked and released on the fly around 140 lbs on the ocean.
the schools of costa rica tarpon are found cruising around in search of baitfish in the calm clear waters of the shallow lagoons. when the lagoons begin to empty into the river thereâs a feeding frenzy on baitfish and a concentration of tarpon found at the outlets of the small canals. this presents some of the most exciting costa rica tarpon fishing to be found anywhere and the excitement doubles when using fly fishing rods and surface flies.  if the conditions are suitable, casting large poppers can result in some very exciting surface fly fishing as the hooked tarpon usually jump much more in the shallower freshwater.  we also offer amazing costa rica fly fishing trips on the pacific coast that target a variety of species.  we will take you and you group out costa rica fly fishing for marlin, sailfish, dorado, rooster fish, and more.

fishing reports
the rio indio lodge is truly an incredible paradise nestled atop a river bank only minutes from the ocean.  the lodge and accommodations were breathtaking only to be trumped by the incredible tarpon fishing and snook fishing to be had just a short boat ride from the docks.  i hooked several 160lb tarpon and a friend on my boat hooked a 240lb tarpon that took him 2 hours and 4o minutes to reel in!
