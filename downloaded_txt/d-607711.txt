monday, october 03, 2005




yesterday i played mucho hours of poker, both online and live. i played single table and multi-table tournaments and a live 4-8 kill ring game in the eureka casino. poker was good to me yesterday, as i cashed in every tourney ( even won two of the sit n goes), and took $400 from the live game that was peopled with drunks and wild players.aside from great hands, my poker instinct and rhythm was good the entire day. it seems like i folded big hands or played marginal hands at the right times. i correctly layed down pocket kings three times, and won a monster pot with pocket nines, when i called a loose player who bet into overcards on the board.  href="mailto:vecino26@hotmail.com">email me!">share your poker experience with me

	 sit n go poker strategy
    



read howard lederer's advice on winning online sit n go single table poker tournaments. his "play tight early, loosen up later strategy" is the opposite from the way most people play, but makes perfect sense when you understand howard's logic. check this out, you may end up in the money more often!

	 coach is back
    


it's been a while since i posted here. i still play poker daily, but i've been involved in another writing project and have neglected this blog.  now that my project is near completion, i intend to write about poker again. i continue to sponsor and moderate my paradise poker private tourney mesquite$. it is $5.00 buy-in omaha8  h/l tournament played at 6:30 p.m. pst daily. the password is omaha and any registered paradise poker player can play. usually between 40-80 players participate daily. five or ten places are paid, depending on the number of participants. log on to paradise poker, click on the private tourney tab and join the fun.

	 new year's eve in mesquite
    


at the oasis casino in mesquite, nevada, revelers dressed in their finest holiday wear to participate in some great texas hold'em action. loose and tipsy, many players and newbies decided to try their luck. the action was fun, fast and furious. my $10-20 table was a blast. often the pots were capped pre-flop, with eight or more players tossing in their chips. every variety of hand was turned over at the showdown, with suckouts by players holding cards like 2-3 offsuit common. it was comical and reminded me of some of the montana home games that i used to play. the dealers had to settle many trivial disputes because a lot of newbies didn't understand the rules or were unaware of common poker etiquette. intoxicated gamblers chatted about their hands, played out of turn, exposed their cards, constantly rabbit hunted, and taunted the winners when they lost. it was a full-tilt, albeit profitable game. a true wild west experience. in 3 hrs. of play, i turned a $400 profit, taking advantage of the loose action. a nice way to end the year.i believe 2005 will be a banner year for poker. new people, being curious about the game's popularity, will enter the fray for the first time. this rush will provide experienced players, such as myself to realize more profit. it's always great when you can make money from your hobby. i love to see new players at the table. they present constant challenges and create a healthy poker environment. i hope you all had as much fun as i did on new year's eve. may 2005 be a great year for you. if you're strictly an online player, consider trying out your skill in live casino action. you'll be surprised how good you really are. you've honed your skill from the many hours in front of the computer screen, and you won't take a back seat to anyone. go for it! good luck in 2005. see you online at paradise poker's mesquite$ tourney or in my favorite live action poker room, the oasis casino in mesquite ,nevada.

	 end of year luck
    


happy new year fellow mesquite$ omaha h/l players. this year's end, like last year's end has been lucky for me. on dec. 30th of 2003, i won a live 6-table $100 buy-in nl hold'em tournament at my favorite poker room at the oasis casino in mesquite, nevada. after the tournament, i sat in a $4-8 hold'em ring game and hit a $1600 bad beat jackpot on my first hand. a $3500 take for one day was a fantastic way to ring in 2004. my end of year luck is holding up this year as well. two days ago, dec 29th, i won dkblue's on- line $10 buy-in omaha tourney and yesterday dec. 30th, i won the mesquite$ online $5.00 omaha tourney, which i sponsor. this is the first time that i've won my own tournament, so the win was particularly satisfying. i think i had a cute little lady lepracaun sitting on my lap. as the old saying goes, i think i'd rather be lucky than good. i keep telling myself, that if i play enough, and strive to improve, i'm bound to win once in a while. being a bridesmaid without getting to the altar in the winner's circle, gets old, and is frustrating. these recent wins, although moneywise, not much to brag about, helps my confidence inmensley. i think i'm on the right track, but have a long way to go before i sleep. as my poker improves, the competition also improves. the online players are playing better and better as time passes. the competition is fantastic and the level of play is very high. the games, especially omaha h/l are furiously competetive, and great fun to play. i look forward to some fantastic play in 2005. i'll be looking to improve my play, to increase my luck and to chalk up a few victories. someone once said the"luck is the residue of design", so if we can increase our skill, perhaps we'll win more when lady luck pays us a visit. thanks to all of you who have been playing mesquite$ regularly. if any of you ever visit mesquite, nevada look me up and we can play face to face at one of three casinos. good time guaranteed. again, happy new year to all!! see you at the table. coach

	  confirmation bias: a poker analogy
    



"confirmation bias is the investing equivalent of a full house in poker -- you've got a great hand and you're convinced that you're going to win. but someone at the table keeps raising your bets. "sucker," you think. "i'm going to make this expensive for you." ah, but come time for the showdown, you're in for a shock. you lose -- to a higher full house" fool.com: beware confirmation bias [commentary] november 30, 2004

	 expert omaha h/l advice
    


poker writer lou krieger and expert players annie duke and linda johnson share the following advice on inproving your omaha h/l game: • draws and traps to avoid: here are some of the draws you ought to avoid and some trap hands you need to be on the lookout for: 1. top and bottom pair 2. third-best flush 3. second-best straight 4. second-best low hand 5. k-q-q-x and similar holdings 6. j-j-10-x and similar holdings 7. 7-6-5-4 suited or unsuited 8. 6-5-4-3 suited or not • some miscellaneous tips: here are some miscellaneous tips to improve your omaha eight-or-better game. they are covered in more detail elsewhere in our book, but we’ve listed them here so that you can access all of them in one place. 1. if you’re playing $10-$20 or lower, after the flop you should generally draw only to the nuts or have multiple high-quality draws. 2. if you’ve been dealt a-3 or 3-2 with nothing else of real quality, you ought to throw it away if you’re in early position. in late position, a-3 is almost always playable, but 3-2 is not. 3. while late position allows you to play more hands, middle cards such as 9-8-7 — particularly hands with nines in them — should not be played. 4. when you’ve made the nut low on the flop and are sure you’re going to be quartered, you have our permission to occasionally muck your hand, particularly when you have no backup to protect you against getting counterfeited, and no possibilities of making a high winning hand. if you’re holding a-2-k-q, it may look good if the flop is 6-5-4, but if you suspect that one of your opponents also has an a-2 in his hand, the best you can hope for if there are three others in the pot with you is that you’ll get your money back. it’s sort of like, “heads they win, tails you tie,” and that’s not a rosy picture, is it? 5. on the river, you can usually raise if you’re holding the nut low when it’s fourhanded, but generally just call if you’re playing threehanded. 6. when you’re in the cutoff seat or on the button in a pot in which no one has come to play, either raise or release. do not call. 7. in multiway pots, early-position strength should be bet because you’d like to attract paying customers. deception is unimportant. when your opponents see the flop, many of them will find any possible excuse to call and see the turn — and the river, too. 8. if a player in early position bets into a raiser, do not call with anything other than the very best of flop fits. in this situation, it’s really ok to throw your hand away. 9. an ace is the most important card in omaha eight-or-better. next in importance is a deuce. a 9 is the worst card, and if you hang around an omaha eight-or-better table long enough, you’ll find that nines, eights, and sevens appear in more losing hands than any other cards. 10. according to world series of poker bracelet winner and omaha eight-or-better expert linda johnson, 6-5-4-3 is the worst starting hand combination that most omaha eight-or-better players consider a good hand, and one they will play on a regular basis. 11. the flush factor: you’ll be dealt a suited or double-suited hand the vast majority of the time. so will your opponents, so when you do draw to a flush, be certain it stands a good chance of winning the pot, or at least the high end of it, if you make it. 12. it takes a bigger hand to call a raise than it does to raise in the first place. and it takes a bigger hand to overcall than to be the first caller. 13. although many players think of omaha eight-or-better as a game of drawouts, it’s worth remembering that seven-ninths, or 77 percent, of your hand is known on the flop. 14. the river card is the least important card in omaha eight-or-better. all of the important action takes place prior to the river. if you have the best of it before the river, you’ll win more often than not. get your money into the pot when you have the best of it, and save your bets when you don’t. while that sounds simple and obvious, many players do not follow that axiom. 15. high-stakes poker player annie duke’s list of mistakes many players make in omaha eight-or-better:  • playing stranded pairs; hands like k-k-8-4 are unplayable, but hands like k k 2 3 and k-k-q-q can be played • overestimating the value of small pairs, deuces through eights, since these sets become very vulnerable when hit • overestimating the value of a-2 • overestimating the value of a-a • underestimating the value of big connecting cards, because it is tougher to get trapped with them

	 the flop
    


after selecting a solid starting hand to play, the flop becomes the most important decision one makes in omaha h/l 8poker. while to most of you this is self-evident, it's surprising how many players ignore coordinating the flop with their starting hands. it seems like hope springs eternal in this game. from this point, for some, the chase is on! mucking a great starting hand is impossible, and the hopeful cling to the missed flop in disbelief. they leak their chips, and scratch their bewildered heads as they wonder why their stacks have disappeared so rapidly. after all, they began with a great 4, 5, or even a 6-way hand, so they attribute their demise to bad luck. in reality, poor decision-making creates their so-called bad luck. the next time you begin with a strong starting hand, followed by a missed, uncoordinated flop, muck that trash! you'll be glad you did, and your bankroll will thank you. remember that omaha h/l8 is a nut game, and the prize usually goes to the patient players. good decisions create good results.

	 starting hands in omaha h/l8
    


good omaha h/l 8 players realize that solid starting hands often determine success or failure in winning or a losing a pot. (see my starting hand article, close but no cigar) without at least a 4-way hand and a chance to scoop the whole pot, they know that over time, they'll be consistent losers. their objective should always be to win the entire pot. given this goal, one still sees some very strange hands in this difficult game. online, i often see players raise pre-flop with only an un-suited a-2 and little else in their hand. when the flop hits two cards to a low, they'll reraise, hoping to catch a low card to complete a low hand, without much chance to a scoop. then they'll continue to chase and call or raise through the river or turn, irrespective of the number of players participating in the hand or the strength of the opponents action. they are frequently counterfeited or at best, end up with a quarter or a sixth of the pot. a losing proposition for sure. the next time you ask yourself."why can i not seem to win very often?", carefully consider your starting hands. 4, 5, and even 6-way starting hands with strong scooping possibilities should be your major consideration when deciding to play. next, you must be able to get away from your strong hand when it doesn't coordinate with the flop.. in my next blog, i'll talk about the flop. start with good hands to win more! [listening to: cuando vuelva a tu lado - luis miguel - (03:48)]
