home heating: services & equipment
standard oil offers heating equipment service plans that can help your system run more efficiently and reduce the cost of system repairs. in order to provide you with the most appropriate maintenance coverage and the best possible value, we offer two service programs.
both plans include a preventive maintenance tune-up, which keeps your system running efficiently and has the potential to lower your heating bill by as much as 10%. as a standard oil customer you will also receive priority service, which means that in most cases a technician will respond to your "no heat" call in less than two hours, even at 2 a.m.


24-hour emergency service
priority appointment scheduling
nights, weekends & holidays
system cleaning and tune-up included


the primary difference between our two service plans has to do with the type of system you use to heat your home, and not the type of coverage we offer.
