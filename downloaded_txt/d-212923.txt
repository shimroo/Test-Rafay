brian's home aluminun foundry, metal casting & gingery lathe projects




















update! gingery lathe is underway!

        hi! my name is brian boorman and i live in rural honeoye, ny in the
        finger lakes region and ny wine country. these pages are designed to document my creation of a working
        home foundry for melting and casting aluminum, brass, and other metals.
        my initial goals are to build a working foundry and develop my casting
        skills. i then plan to move on to building the gingery lathe.

        on working with explosive gases and molten metal. extreme caution should
        always be used when working with dangerous substances. i make no
        warranty and assume no liability about the accuracy or usefulness of the
        information contained in these pages. know what you are doing and the
