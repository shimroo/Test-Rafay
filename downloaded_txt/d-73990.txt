the 
              most consistently sane, sound, correct herd of horses and ponies 
              you'll find. all born on the farm and raised in grassy fields where 
              they play, learn, and grow.

              you can see the sires, dams and grandparents on site when you visit 
              karen griffith farms.



exceptional 
                soundness and longevity:
most of karen 
              griffith farms' stock descends from the senior herd stallion, atahi. 
              this fine stallion still sports a perfect set of feet and legs at 
              31 years of age!

              his dam was still sound and going strong at 32, and his grand-dam 
              was sound and working at 38 years of age!

not one of atahi's offspring has had to interrupt their career 
              due to unsoundness. 

an added benefit to you is that the animals from karen griffith 
              farms can work and show barefoot.



unparalleled 
                pedigrees:
the best foundation 
              quarter horse and foundation paint horse blood found anywhere today.

              karen's breeding animals have always been carefully selected for 
              flawless structure, athletic ability, and willing dispositions.



 
                knowledge and experience:
karen griffith 
              is a graduate of the ohio state university's highly rated college 
              of agriculture and has over 30 years practical experience. this 
              allows her to sensibly assist you in buying and breeding decisions.





affordable 
                transportation:
national and 
              international transportation 
              is easily arranged for purchased animals.
