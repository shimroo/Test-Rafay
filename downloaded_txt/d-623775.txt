titanium strong

flexon frames feature technologically advanced memory metal in the bridge and/or temples allowing them to be flexed, bent or twisted and return to their original shape.












flexible

flexible in multiple ways. with years of design and construction experience, flexon eyewear has evolved into a collection with no limitations. memory metal combined with rubber, tr90 and stainless steel create a varied collection filled with color, advanced durability, lightweight construction, and a comfortable fit.





although flexon frames are durable, they are not indestructible. flexon frames should not be twisted more than 90° and flexon temples should not be twisted more than once around the finger.
