    the bridge to travel soccer


welcome to pwsi’s courage classic program. this program is currently offered for u9 to u19 for both boys and girls. the classic teams, as they are labeled, are in place to provide those interested in higher levels of soccer at a lower cost. the program also helps bridge the gap from the courage recreational program to the courage select program. all players interested in the program will be required to commit to a full year.

    cdp - preparing for the next level


the courage development program (cdp) is a 9 month program that provides our youngest players an environment that promotes problem solving, authentic learning, skill development, and social skills. cdp is the ideal transitional program between the recreational program and our select program. cdp sessions will offer a developmentally appropriate curriculum that will create a fun, challenging, and competitive environment. players will train in small groups, with new teammates and coaches each week, to help their development on and off the soccer field.  all training sessions and games will be coached by the courage professional staff. the u7/u8 cdp is intended for those players (and parents) who are willing to make a stronger commitment to prioritizing development in all aspects of youth soccer.u7 cdp will be formed with players born in 2015/2016u8 cdp will be formed with players born in 2014

    soccer for all levels
