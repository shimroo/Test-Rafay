site updates:
september 24th - not much to updat at the moment to be honest - any more fan submissions would be greatly appreciated.  i'm doing some trawling of the internet to see if i can find any material that we haven't see before.  also, i'm contemplating as to whether i should remove the message board.  it's not really getting used, so unless anyone lets me know of any major objections i'll probably remove it for the time being in a few days. september 15th - apologies for the lack of updates, going back to school has been crazy hectic.  added a couple more of my favourite photos to the gallery.september 1st - added a portrait that was sent to me by jeff to the fan submissions page.  added a couple more photos to the gallery.  plus added some of the older update notices to the archive page.august 29th - added a photo gallery for some fave pics.  any requests let me know.  so far theres only a couple up, more coming soon.august 27th - have added a couple of bits on about me and updated the links page.  plus added a credits section within the home page which i'm still working on.august 26th - have updated the home pageaugust 14th - added some more on the 'about me' page so you have a little more info about why the site was set up etc. and also some more stuff on the bio page.july 31st - added a bit more info about 'the snobs' on the filmography pagecredits:wb - pics
