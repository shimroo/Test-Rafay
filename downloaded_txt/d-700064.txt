advice on management
arguably the best way to advise a business manager is to facilitate the 
particular person to deal with his problem himself. management 
quotes are an excellent way to achieve this. why? quotes have the capacity to make us re-think our 
situation from different angles. in doing so, they can help us develop 
new perspectives and ideas.

but don't take this website to serious: perhaps and hopefully the advice by great 
thinkers that populates this site can give business executives a fresh perspective, 
allowing for a new vision and approach to grow. but of course you may and 
can not expect that management quotations alone can really solve the complex 
management dilemmas of corporate executives.

after all:
for every complex problem there is a simple solution that is wrong.
george bernard shaw 1856-1950, irish playwright and critic
