over 20 years and this site is still up…what say you?

whoa...






it’s my old house…

it's been almost 20 years

so difficult to believe…no doubt this site was epic for rides, racing and just helping an evolving rider… curious who is still around.

so, who is still around?






i was a jax, fl sbws member waaaaay back in the christian days. when sauron, batch, okaive, doc, dolphingirl, saki and such were all around. back when there was a t2x  (who remembers that?). back when we would meet at dunkin donuts on blanding. i still ride, i moved all over the country with my job, but have landed back home in ny since last year. still riding (2016 honda cbr1000rr sp repsol) and doing my thing. i was just buying a new back protector for next seasons gear and got curious. looks like it’s still here!

pnw riders facebook group can suck it!






time for a poo flinging post!
i had a comment removed and was silenced for a day by an admin on the pnw rider facebook page.
seriously, that post was g rated compared to the poo we used to fling in the day. it was directed at no one but myself, so nobody can claim to be offended by it.  i dont know who that admin was but i think they need to grow a pair and calm down!  lol!  but then, the admins on the old pnw forum were hyper sensitive like that
makes me miss the days when i got to watch some truly epic poo flinging on this forum!

real names vs pseudonyms






given that sean has rebuilt this forum with the hopes of bringing back the sense of community that we had before, i’d like to  encourage everyone to use their real name rather than a nickname.  just my $.02
(maybe there’s a way to do both?)

making a comeback!






ever since i sold my '07 750 in 2011, ive had the itch to get it back and get riding again.  cliff notes:
sold bike, bought house, got pregnant, got financial woes, got pregnant again, worked damn hard on careers and getting the pay scale increase, and now we are doing really great.
well, that itch has only grown stronger over the years and i am getting close to justifying the price of a reasonable toy expense.
i want my '07 750 back!!!
at this point im leaning towards doing 4-5 track days in the season and a few street rides here and there, certainly not the epic rides every weekend we used to have.
hoping to be up and running by next riding season!  stay tuned cause nicegy is coming back!

2017 yamaha fz-10 - funnest bike ever!

zrx riders?

any zrx riders here?
i picked my 99 1100 up while i lived in atlanta a couple years ago and rode her from atlanta to houston in one day…
of all the bikes i have owned, this is my favorite street bike. a bit dated and heavy, but excellent motor with gobs of torque at any rpm.

2004 cbr 1000rr - deep clean






well, after 14 years of regular riding, when a local motorcycle shop dinged one of my carrozzeria rims while trying to mount a tire - i decided the time had come to tear down the cbr 1000rr and give it a deep cleaning while i was waiting 6-8 weeks for my wheels to show back up.

tore all the plastic off, tank, airbox, shower injectors, tail, etc. and started in with a sponge and some dish-washing detergent (like for your dishwashing machine - works great to cut the grease) and parts-cleaner.
cleaned up the tail first and reassembled the tail:

then cleaned up the exhaust system:

repaired some of the broken/burnt leds in my tail light as well.  also glued the tach faceplate down where it had bubbled up a little, causing the needle to rub.
cleaned up the airbox, fresh k&n filters, and reassembled all of that.
next will be the front-end cleanup, forks, calipers, etc.
i ordered new matte-black fairings for it - birthday present from my wifey ♥ .  should have those in hand in the next couple of weeks.  also got new grips and bar-ends that some nice accents.  bike should be all black, gold and silver.
i’ll post more pics as i reassemble - shoud look pretty dang sweet when i’m done.
stay tuned!

i am hoping to upgrade my gear over the winter for next year.  currently rocking an alpinestars 1 piece perf for track/agressive street and a spidi leather jacket for street
recently got an olympia mesh jacket for hot rides and it makes a huge difference!
im gonna shop for some 2 piece leathers that fit a little better, full gauntlet gloves that are more comfortable and trustworthy than my sedici, and a textile jacket for street rides’
id also like to get some kevlar jeans for more casual riding
