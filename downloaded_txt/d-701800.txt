saturday: closed sunday: closedyelp reviewswhat they're saying i came on july 5th to purchase a whole set of new tires for my honda. i got cooper tires and was recommended to come here by a friend. i am a female who has slim to none knowledge when it comes to car maintenance/tires. i appreciate when i called and spoke to greg he was able to help with an estimate of the cost after giving the info of my tire size and car year info. 

the service here is extraordinary; i was worried/scared coming by myself i may have been treated like a deer in headlights where they might try to pressure me or sale me other stuff than just tires. this for sure is a family business and they made me feel very comfortable as a customer to come to a company i feel i can trust 

no one tried to sale me anything or pressure me for other services. my car had new shoes within 40 mins and i drove away feeling happy and content. 

i did go back two weeks later because i noticed one of my tires was making a noise that i got worried about and wasn't sure if it was normal or not. i spoke to jeff on july 15th who was great at giving me information about possible causes it could be to cause a noise after getting new tires. i took it in the same day and my car was looked at within a couple of mins and it turned out it was just my hub cap that was causing a scraping noise; it was fixed within seconds lol and i felt kinda silly for thinking it might have been something damaging or serious but i'm thankful for the service this company has and will definitely recommend this place to family and friends, especially my independent female friends who share the same anxiety i have at times when it comes to finding car maintenance places that are trustworthy and reliable. 

i appreciate all the employees and the professionalism they have who work here  may god bless you allread moreread less

 i was referred to scott at tucker tire from the manager at costco, when costo accidentally ordered the wrong tire for my truck and i needed new tires for a trip my wife and i were taking the next day. scott was so helpful and professional, he showed me three tires that fit my truck and when i asked him for his recommendation after telling him my budget (and the refund i was getting from costo), he met my budget needs and i feel i got a superior tire. i drove my truck over to the service center, and dave greeted me with a smile and told me were the waiting area was (i had work to do on my laptop), and my truck (all four tires) were replaced quickly. i am very impressed with their customer service at every stage of the operation. i was also very grateful they had the best tire for my needs at the right price and they were available when i needed them. thank you tucker tire!!read moreread less
