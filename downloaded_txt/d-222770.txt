welcome

over two decades ago we started out as a tupac site. we then evolved into a hip-hop community. now we're just old and grumpy. 

come say hi, but we probably don't like your favorite mumble rapper.





donate

any donations will be used to help pay for the site costs, and anything donated above will be donated to c-dub's son on behalf of this community.
