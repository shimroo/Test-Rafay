the difference with scpm is the attention to detail.
southern coins and precious metals (scpm) is a louisiana corporation that has been owned and operated by the same family for the last 40 years. we were first located in the historic new orleans french quarter. in 1986 we moved to the suburb of metairie which offers our clients convenient parking, a comfortable, safe atmosphere and private office settings to assure client confidentiality in all trades.
whether you are buying, selling, or are just seeking information, scpm is here to assist.
