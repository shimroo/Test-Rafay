the elff mission is 1) to enrich the cultural community of michigan by bringing independent films from around the world that will enlighten, entertain, affect, educate and expose the people of michigan to other cultures, viewpoints and backgrounds. the film festival and the elfs achieve this. 2) to foster, promote, exhibit and award filmmaking in the lake michigan region. the lmfc, the 48/5 film contest, and the festival trailer contest achieve this goal.
