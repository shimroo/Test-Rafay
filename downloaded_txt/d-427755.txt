about the book
just published by john wiley & sons, federal style patterns 1780-1820! in spite of a renewed interest in and enthusiasm for america’s federal style, a federal style pattern book has not been published in over 200 years and until now, there was no single volume source to turn to for examples of the appearance of federal style interior architectural treatments.
drawn by a cabinetmaker, these federal style patterns were meticulously researched, accurately drawn, and are based upon period pattern books, photographs, and drawings of historic homes.
this unique one-volume resource includes over three hundred clear, crisp line drawings of federal style architectural details:
cornice moldings in five styles, chair rails, window & door surrounds, window sills & aprons, interior doors and arches, baseboards, mantels, room designs, & fences.
learn the “secret” of neoclassic proportioning and see how simple it is to create your own eye-pleasing designs! period books, such as asher benjamin’s american builder’s companion, assume and require that the reader possess an understanding and facility with geometry. federal style patterns 1780-1820 introduces the use of the common feet/inch calculator and computer so that the modern user may easily understand and utilize the proportioning system used for federal style designs (golden section). the golden section is explained in this work for practical design use. most volumes discuss the golden section only as math theory. in addition, each book includes a companion cd with drawings ready to use in pc and mac formats.
acomplement to photographic architecture books. federal style patterns 1780-1820 provides clear, contour- style drawings of the small details of the american federal style. these small details (quirked moldings, carved rosettes, beads, etc.) are its most characteristic feature and photographs rarely can capture them.
companion cd. each book includes a cd-rom containing the drawings in vector pdf, powercadd for macintosh, dxf for pc, and postscript formats.
