				men for others
			






















walk the rock

		work hard. play hard. pray hard. if it‚Äôs possible to describe the rockhurst experience in just six words, these sum it up best. for more than 100 years, rockhurst high school has been a place where boys become young men, with minds, bodies, and souls prepared for the challenges of college and life beyond. rockhurst challenges students with a rigorous academic program in the classical jesuit tradition. today, that tradition continues through a comprehensive study of the liberal arts and a strong commitment to the jesuit mission of service to the church and community. here, we strive to develop ‚Äúmen for others‚Äù, men distinguished by their competence, conscience and compassion.
