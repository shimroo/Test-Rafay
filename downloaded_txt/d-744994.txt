mission




the ocean state parrot head club, the rhode island chapter of parrot heads in paradise, was formed in 1995 by a group of fun loving parrot heads who were inspired by the lyrics of jimmy buffett to (more than occassionally) live life like a tropical vacation.located in rhode island, the ocean state parrot head club is an official club of the parrot heads in paradise, inc.along with concerts, parties, regular meetings, and other social events, parrot heads are very active in community and environmental concerns. clubs across the country are or have been involved in projects ranging from the "walk to end alzheimers"  to the "american cancer society relay for life " program.one club member said, "there is no better feeling than going out there and helping someone while having a ball doing it!"  the bylaws of the ocean state parrot head club may be found here.
