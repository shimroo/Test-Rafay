jessica conner argues before the united states supreme court
jessica conner, our board certified appellate attorney, argued in front of the united states supreme court in the stanley v. city of sanford case.  doug noah and patti rego chapman, whose motion to dismiss was up on appeal, attended oral argument and assisted throughout the intensive preparation process. the dispute arises over a city policy regarding disability pension benefits and involved nuanced statutory interpretation involving a former employee’s right to sue for disability discrimination under title i of the americans with disabilities act. jessica was poised, passionate, and expertly fielded a salvo of difficult questions from the highest court in the land. the drml team’s hard work and commitment to zealous client advocacy, along with jessica’s impeccable oral advocacy skills, were on full display!
