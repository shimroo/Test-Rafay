intercessory prayer?
february 6, 2025 by dr. mike bagwell 
prayer can (and should) be a time when we confess our sins unto the lord. prayer can (and should) be a time when we adore our dear lord. it also should be a time of giving thanks to god for all his benefits!
but prayer of necessity (or at least ideally) must also include a time of “intercession.” 
intercession?
what is that?
the word is from the latin. 
where “inter” is a preposition and means “between,” just that. 
and cedere (the infinitive form) is a verb meaning “to go.”
put it all together … “intercession” is prayer that “goes between” the lord and any person for whom you are burdened!
you pray to him … for them!
paul, for example, constantly interceded for the new believers he had won to christ. 
“we do not cease to pray for you.” (colossians 1:9)
but … is this form of prayer all that important?
yes, it well might be a duty too!
listen to godly samuel of old testament days: “god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you.” (1 samuel 12:23)
sounds like it might be a blatant sin not to intercede for others!
make you a prayer list today. not with all your needs and wants, mind you. a prayer list of names for others for whom you intend to pray!
now that’s intercession!
jesus is, in fact, in heaven right now interceding for you and me! “wherefore he (jesus) is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.” (hebrews 7:25)
i am serious. start building that list! and if you run short on names, please add mine as well.
thank you …

january 15, 2025 by dr. mike bagwell jesus' twelve disciples are often thought to be "giants" in the faith. and they really did become that, most all of them dying (as martyrs) for their saviour, for our dear lord.

december 24, 2024 by dr. mike bagwell the words form nearly a contradiction! a paradox indeed!



a rock is tasteless, presumably!



and honey, nothing sweeter!



yet psalm 81:16 as much as promises that our great god can give just that, "honey out of the rock!"

december 15, 2024 by dr. mike bagwell the patriarch joseph actually expressed this sentiment at a time in his life when it appeared he was going to lose another of his sons to the vast kingdom of egypt.

november 27, 2024 by dr. mike bagwell yes, it is a word, "mentee." meaning the recipient of a "teacher's" (also called a "mentor's") instruction ... and probably including some "on-the-job training!" (more than just oral direction. like "how-to-do-it" demonstrations.)
