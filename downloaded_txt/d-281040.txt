we at baht gold jewelry co., 
									  ltd specialize in making 
											traditional thai baht 23k and 24k 
											gold chains and bracelets, typically 
											between 30 grams - 227 grams.



most of the styles we 
									  sell are not available in thai gold shops 
									  since those are normally mass 
											produced and not as precisely made 
											for the export trade. our 
											product is made by skilled master 
											goldsmiths who make each piece one 
											by one for our customers or 
									  made by goldsmiths who have been commisioned by us 
									  to make the item.
