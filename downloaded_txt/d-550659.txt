itâ€™s been a number of nights so far that iâ€™ve been able to look through my telescope with your 10â€³ 1/10 pv mirror installed. what i want to say, is that i am hugely impressed with the image quality and resolution the mirror produces. never before was i able to see such faint and small details on jupiter, saturn, mars, and the moon. yesterday i had one of these two-three nights per year with great seeing, and the oouk mirror showed things iâ€™ve never seen before in real-life visual observing. you made my day, eergh rather my night ðŸ˜‰the 10â€³ taiwanese mirror i had before was good, but it came nowhere near your optics. the hi-lux also makes the images brighter apparently.
so, iâ€™d like to thank you once again for the great product, and wish you, and your company all the best.

i wanted oouk to supply me with a top quality telescope to take my imaging to the highest level possible, the ag10 certainly does that and now i can produce images that are as good as the very best out there.
â€“ peter martin (n. ireland) â€“ ag10


revealing seldom seen ultra deep sky objects is what i strive for. the orion optics ag12 has exceeded my expectations in every way, it has proved to be the telescope that changed my imaging life!
â€“ peter shah (uk) â€“ ag12


i like to image at long focal lengths and the odk 10 does this perfectlyâ€¦ it makes things a lot easier and each nightâ€™s session is a joy. i will definitely keep the odk for a very long time.
â€“ ezequiel bellocchio (argentina) â€“ odk10


having the right tools to produce unique and groundbreaking images is the dream of every astroimager. i love my orion opticsuk ag12, it has allowed me to push myself to new levels and truly reach for the stars.
â€“ mike sidonio (australia) â€“ ag12


i concluded that i had to have the highest quality optics in a perfect carbon fiber tube and, to make it perfect and personal . . . i wanted a signed name plaque.so i turned to the best i know and â€“ most importantly â€“ trust, when it comes to making the highest quality optics on extremely well built and very light tubes: orion optics uk! iâ€™ve had several newts and maks from oouk and all were of outstanding quality, so i knew exactly on which doorbell to ring!once again they surpassed my expectations and not only did they produce exactly what i was after and more beside. my ct8 brings me great satisfaction knowing i have the best telescope i dreamed of for my imaging.
