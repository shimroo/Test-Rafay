small batch chips are different
each of our batches yields only about 20 pounds of chips—which is not much! it takes a lot of time and attention to kettle cook chips this way. but the payoff is that perfect, crispy crunch and tons of curl in the potato body. our small batch technique will never make us a big company. but it's the only way to make a truly excellent potato chip!
