	 dakota fanning to appear nude in new movie
	 
    


12 yr old dakota is filming a movie right now in which she will appear nude and have near nude scenes.  the movie is based on the young female lead  character being sexually assaulted.  if you'd like to read more about the role please visit tmz.

as a mother to three girls i don't think i could ever stomach something like that.  period. the end. hell no!

	 pink at the late show w/ david letterman
	 
    


here's a good guessing game.  is pink really a man? or simply a lesbian?  or technically you could choose option c. which would be bi-sexual trannnie.  did i mention i kinda like pink?

	 ashlee simpson leaving the ritz carlton in nyc
	 
    


it's paris hilton, it's jessica simpson, no it's super changing ashlee simpson.
i think she looks good in that generic way that all of hollywood looks good.  i don't know maybe i'm being bitchy or too critical but i would like to see her do her "own" thing instead of everyone else's.


oh and can she stop singing? please?!

i hate hate hate those fugly boots!

	 justin timberlake in gq magazine
	 
    


hmm... the jury is still out on whether or not i find him hot. i don't think i'm feeling the "military" look they did here but he's a rather sexy guy.  well except for the whole sleeping with cameron diaz thing. 



so what do you guys think is justin still a hottie?

	 jessica simpson on mtv's trl
	 
    


here's jessica with her mouth open and her roots bleached,  like always.  i really am in wonder of the fact that someone with such little intelligence can get so far in life.  honestly even pamela anderson is smarter then jessica.

for those that love them some jessica enjoy the pics. 



speaking of mtv here's ashanti at the mtv studios.

again with the prom dresses.

damn girl!
you've gained a little and by a little i mean a good 20 lbs or so.
