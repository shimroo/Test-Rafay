since 1973 ed quay has built a solid reputation for providing excellence in products and services. although longevity does not prove ability, we strongly believe that having been in business for so long speaks volumes about whom we are and what we do. we've dedicated ourselves to providing you with the best products possible at a fair price whether you are purchasing a part or a complete car.

the attitude that prevails in america today is to buy things at as low a cost as possible but we believe that buying on price alone is not always the best thing to do. there is usually a reason that a product is "cheap", whether it's that inferior materials are used or the manufacturing process itself. have you ever bought something that was "cheap" only to have it break or it quit working within a few days of purchase, then you had to buy another (better one) to replace it. ed quay products are designed to give you superior quality and long term reliable service at a reasonable cost.

thank you for your interest in our products and services, together we can build a race car that is capable of winning. the rest is up to you.
