12:26 am - warning: certain entries are restricted to friends only



warning: i rant a lot, i have a problem with how many people treat what i have to say (meaning don't believe me, treat me like crap, or laugh at my achievements as a joke), thus, most entries in this journal are restricted to friends only! there are some that are even listed as personal meaning nobody can read it except me! (these are generally listed as such for the purpose of later import into the autobiography.)if you are listed as a friend, and not reading the syndication from the web site, i suggest you skip this unnecessary information and move to the next entry.what does this mean?if you are viewing this journal through the alan rss syndication center on the official web site of alan tan - tag2000 international llc founder, chairman, and ceo: you are only viewing my last 20 public entries. to access the private entries, you will need to click on the tagboss link on the top of the syndication output, log in to livejournal, and then view the respective entries, until the syndicated restricted feed viewer is complete.if you are viewing this journal through the standard page provided by livejournal.com: you are only viewing my last 20 public entries unless you are logged in. if you are logged in, you will see all of my entries.does this affect how i leave comments?anyone listed as a friend:your comments are automatically posted, without modification - but please note that alan reserves the right to delete offensive comments.anonymous users:your ip address will be compared against tag2000 international llc's blackhole lists and your comment will be throughly proofread before it will be allowed to be unfiltered. if you wish to avoid a delay in posting comments - please create an account and request friend status.livejournal users not on my friends list:see the above description.how do i obtain friend status?you may contact me by any means - know that only true friends will be granted status. anyone who is a tag2000 international llc partner is granted automatic friend status to my livejournals (the friend entries usually deal with rantings that stay within the company anyway) and the tag community.

9:29 pm - reorganization makes alan pooped



this summer probably has been the most grueling of them all. for the first time, i am finally properly reorganizing the company. we have a lot of mistakes to fix...but anyways, what's more important is that finally, after about a year of poor service, the company is going to be making it up bigtime. we are planning to streamline and provide more electronic systems to make it easier for our clients to procure services from our corporation and we're switching to a electronic system for accounting.the company will be preparing to switch over to a new way of licensing our servers primarily to streamline our costs and keep our web servers in good software shape. this also means preparing our web servers to be ready for microsoft windows server 2003 x64/2007 and microsoft exchange 2007. our hope is to offer great software services at minimal cost to our clients.of course, this also means prices are changing across the board not only because of licensing, but also because of increased energy costs. we will be changing to new x64 bit hardware to run the web servers at the datacenter as part of the spla conversion.and finally, the company pays and charges for all labor. we pay way above the minimum wage, with most getting 9-10 dollars a hour (or even more depending on the job). so i don't work for free anymore, and neither does anybody at the corporation. this is all made part by switching to a electronic system.this is why i continually say the chief executive's job isn't easy. hey, somebody's gotta do it...on the non company side though, i actually have been able to have some fun in my life complements of the ongoing alan offloading. most people know me to work work work and wonder how i get everything that i do done. recently, i've been able to play badminton again and at andrew's graduation party while i was busy with lots of party-related tasks it did give me a good opportunity to catch up with erica. since everyone wanted to play that stinking dodgeball, we just went to go pick up the pizza instead. the reason i wanted her to come to the party is because i wanted to play her in badminton (it ended up that i played with her against dan matthews and kenneth) and if i was going to take a break from work, so should she =p. since she didn't live that far, basically down the road into the next town over, i just picked her up and dropped her off. then i was also able to catch up with the rest of my friends i haven't seen in a long ass time, including matthews, vinh, among others. vinh stayed to help us to finish cleaning up after the party... and we looked at pictures of my dorm room (and how crappy it was, hahahaha) - too bad i didn't have pics of the poorly designed bathrooms.we also set up a very nice halo 2 extravaganza at the party. complements of my huge ass switch and tons of 50 foot cat 5 cables left over from what i used at my dorm and back at the office we were able to hook in everyone to the party, and it was a halo killing fest there. i'm sure clark was disappointed he didn't get to join in the fun and wish he was there.i've also gone to chuck-e-cheese with kraynak and pals, who i haven't seen in a long ass time (before the party of course). i've been everywhere, to say the least. i also have online summer classes to raise my gpa and propel me that much closer to junior standing. i'm hoping for 54-credit junior standing by the end of intersession 2006. not to mention i was in manhattan for a day and actually drove during rush hour... total gridlock.i must say though i'm now not that bad in badminton. i had to actually restrain myself so i wouldn't deliver a "killer" birdie shot to the other side...more details later, i'm pooped.

8:15 pm - update...



well i'm back in rocky hill...and the new corporate policies are actually paying off. i now again have time in my life by limiting my working hours. i don't work all the time anymore... and now workers are actually paid. accounting overhauls have worked magic in this company, now we are moving towards technology overhauls.the change from dictatorship to a democracy is slowly occuring at the company, and at this point, the transition is going very well! many people doubted that they would see the day that workers got paid and everyone has a equal voice, and a equal responsiblity to uphold their jobs - and it came on may 13th. i actually am amazed at the productivity that came out of saturday's meeting. we got so much done.but yet again, nobody bothered to invite me to what happened yesterday. i feel like a forgotten thought, so to speak. oh well, not that it really matters. i actually found out about this "hang out" after it had happened...anyways badminton was fun, along with the plan, and also having time to watch my favorite tv shows again. now that we got rid of compu-tech problems i can spend less time worrying about that.i grew up too fast. i need to slow down with my aggresive pace at raising my stature, it's so damn high that i can't even win a single scholarship. oh well. finished the year with a b gpa thanks to the hard class... at the end of the summer provided all goes well it will be back up to between a b+ and a-. at least i never have to take those kind of social sciences again, ever, in my life!oh yeah, we finally got rid of everyone who doesn't belong at a real company. with a dedicated corporation of principals who are hard-working and determined, i think we actually stand a chance in the real business world now.economics, political science, and business it is!time to do more fun stuff for a change...for those of you who think i'm still stubborn old me who works 24 hours a day, has no time for friends, and is a "slavedriver", i would have to say that your thoughts are totally wrong.(i will visit ghamas and rhhs, eventually, muhahahahaha... while i must go to work early in the morning, i am still lazy to wake up a extra hour early to visit...)

5:33 pm - the end of uconn... and alan's favorite day is tomorrow!



oh this is very disappointing, i am now officially a 3rd semester sophomore. well, at least - once my remaining credits clear the peoplesoft system.however, due to the fact that my history instructor, a grad student, was not in his office friday like he said he would be, and didn't respond to my e-mail after all... (i thought i saw a e-mail from him but it turned out to be someone using his name as spam, hahahahaahahha too bad i already deleted it) now i must drag my sorry ass back to uconn next week to see the final exam and then ponder what the grade should have been.diana said he wrote something on the front of her final exam - i think i have some idea of what he wrote now.anyways - i need to clear $1600 to the university for summer credits phase i... meaning internal alan accounting transfers take place on monday and the funds are being transferred as follows: from the "rel" account (many people affectionally call this the unused relationship account, since i never need it (anyone reading this should know why by now, especially those in the company...) i always pull loans to the company/myself from this account haha) i am transferring $1.6 k to the general expenses account so it clears my general ledger, then to tuition checking (the higher limit checking account) and then cutting a check to uconn. i repeat this again the 2nd week of june with the remaining $600 balance. once summer classes and next fall's hectic gen-ed killing spree is over, i will be a junior with 57 credits. the year that i am technically supposed to become a junior, i will be a 2nd semester junior with approximately 72 credits. talk about accelerated credit-acquiring spree!so the summer begins. here's the summer plans...- michelle + trevor, and the uconn crew want to have summer pool parties. while i may not like chlorine, i will be there given enough advance notice!- my high school buddies from rocky hill hs are going to be hanging out - i have intentionally reduced my hours working for the company to 40 a week instead of 17 a day so i can hang out with them.- i intend to go visit ghamas, the best school on this planet!- i will be in new york city for joint-venture and capital raising for our new joint venture as necessary, and also for getting the visas for my vacation!- i will actually be out of the u.s. for a vacation this year! this means no paging! woot! i get to visit fujian province in china (and possibly the islands held by taiwan) visit the relatives in malaysia, stop over in sweden... yea... a real vacation! woot!- of course, i will be administering the company projects commissioned by dha with dave hale this summer, 40 hours a week, at dha. this is the year that our financial system has been overhauled and we reimburse all expenses - and pay our workers!- finally, i have stuff up at uconn related to a conference we're starting and a student organization that i'm helping to organize - meetings and more meetings!so, i wasn't kidding when i said this summer if you want to find me it's going to be "where's waldo?" except you replace waldo with alan, hahahahaha! ok enough bad alan jokes.monday is my favorite day, does anyone know why? most people seriously don't. if you don't know, you could always check to see if facebook gives you a special reminder in your home page, haha. of course, only i would be spending my favorite day in meetings, at the bank in more meetings, and running training. of course, if my history instructor dares to make that the day i am forced to drive back to storrs aka cowland, i will be a very cross and angry alan because nobody ruins my favorite day like that.off to finish unpacking! i have way too much computer equipment for my own good, haha.

11:26 am - wow i'm tired. from asian night '06



just finished up with asian night 2006. which means i just read people's livejournals from last week to today... just now.asian night 2006 was exhausting. i was the technical guy, technical coordinator so to speak. during the entire show you did not want to be the one sitting next to me and my computers. haha. well everything went well during rehearsal we just worked out all the kinks with the power supply to the stage. run through was like perfect. so we start the actual show. it was going perfectly too. then... guess what?well, wednesday i was at jorgenson from 7:40pm until 11:20pm. we used my laptop. no wireless connection, so i never thought about shutting it off. it's a pain to kill my wireless card and i don't do it unless i have to.so saturday i get to jorgenson at 1pm. still no wireless internet. we do the runthrough. no wireless still. powerpoints and movies work perfectly while the power was consistent. we had power outages at the computer stations so we ran new cables, but that was our only technical problem. so we get to the show and we start! minor problems that we techies were able to fix without people noticing. my computer crapped during the show so we had the emcee stall for a bit... but nobody noticed that either. then, during a later act, the powerpoint was working perfectly. nothing was going wrong. all of a sudden out of nowhere... my fucking laptop decides "omg i can get on the internet"! so what does it do? "internet security warning!!!!!" omg then i tried to press "no" many times and it wouldn't... go... away! omg i was really pissed off! so we killed the machine and the projector. everything was restarted during intermission.after that though, it was a interesting night. i can't wait to see the tape. we're stealing uctv's tape because i had their camera's sound input hooked into the sound board output via xlr cable.oh yeah, it was good to see brian who i worked with my senior year at the rhhs drama club again. apparently he's a jorgenson supervisor now. it made getting my technical needs taken care of real quick easily.it was a great performance by all... and it seems already that people want me to do asian night 2007... i'll tackle that when 2007 comes around =)alan outand yes thats right... that was me before the show. i'll replace my facebook or something with that... eventually.

12:17 pm - back from ecaasu



hello people, i am back from the 2006 ecaasu conference at the george washington university. i will post the details under friends only later and will make a request for all the people i met from ecaasu - please send pictures! my corporate e-mail is on facebook, or you can go get it from the company website - www.tag2000international.com!i did, however, get paged on the busride down so that drastically cut down on my available partying time.when i got back i was tired as hell but nevertheless i went with clark to meet christine and missy at buckley dining hall and then we went to shippee to hang out. i took the personality test and lo behold i am classified as "the executive"... oddly enough it is mostly right, and i fall under the realm where i have developed a lot and am one of those who care more about others, and not about myself, developed a sense of feeling that most entjs don't have...http://www.personalitypage.com/entj.html

5:44 pm - long time no update... happy chinese new year



新年快樂!恭喜發拆!紅包那來!hahahaha! happy new year, and bring me red envelopes! (ps: i didn't need that njstar communicator crap or any of that garbage to type all that chinese, it is traditional chinese, our company uses the thing built into our corporate edition of our development systems.)anyways, some updates.slip-n-slide... topping the last!i sprained my arm... really bad! had to go to student health services, which made me very disappointed because i didn't want to drag my ass to north campus but the pain was awful. it's bandaged and braced up, and in a sling!a friend of mine said my productivity has dropped 50%, and they weren't kidding.i type slower now, but here's the story. some of you may remember the other time i pulled a stunt like this...before: sophomore year, ghamas bus...i walked onto my own driveway and was like wooo bus is here! then i run down the driveway, slip, get some air, and butt lands on driveway, with laptop hitting my lap. at least it didn't break... everyone laughed at this for days. luckily, only a few scratches and pulled butt muscles...now: 2nd semester student, uconn, behind the business building...i was walking down the hill and the lighting is horrible. i did not see the black ice. i slipped, and got air, and fell on my left arm. then my books followed along with my dad's dvd i was supposed to deliver - the books crushing my left arm. this was almost all my books with the exception of my psychology notebook. ouch. the dvd's case shattered into like a million pieces. luckily, my ipod landed on the side of the arm that did not hit the ground...i went back after class and thought i could stand the pain. nope. the pain got worse, and i had to walk all the way to the infirmary. i missed some of work to do this. they said i was lucky, it wasn't broken, but it was "seriously sprained". i inquired further and they started naming the list of muscles i injured and couldn't use... finishing up by heres a ace bandage, wrap it good, make sure to elevate the arm for a week at least, practice r.i.c.e. for the arm. i didn't listen to the e part by wearing a sling, only to make my swelling worse. so, i finally took trevor's advice (he's my buddy with the connecticut emt-b license that i want to get) and am walking around campus like a cripple.thus, this has beyond topped the last time i took a slip-n-slide! i'm a cripple =( i have trouble opening doors and cannot carry books on my left shoulder... but i can still type and drive as long as i reinforce my left arm, and use it as a guide, with my right hand doing most of the work.so, in recap, they should have cancelled classes so this wouldn't have happened! >:othe contractor screws up again! can i attend college in peace without my business network being messed up by these idiots?so, you know the saying:first day of chinese new year means no work!well what actually happened:contractor's misconfiguration of routefinder screws up alan's trip to the buddhist temple in carmel ny! many problems occured that day, all resulting from that routefinder screw up!like most if not all the other chinese on campus, i left campus to spend new year's with my family. i was content to going to the temple. then, people keep hitting my arm there inflicting pain on me, which really annoyed me, especially those cutters in line. they kept bumping into me thinking they were "ahead of me" which took me a lot of effort to withhold my anger. so, if i have to have this on longer now, i am going to be very annoyed. then, i realize that i got a e-mail saying that there were network problems on the itcomm segment of the corporate network, dha managed network. apparently there were tons of problems there. instead of relaxing and packing to go back to uconn, i had to fix the stinkin mess on new years day because this contractor after many many repeated comments saying that they need to disable dns proxy and set up port forwarding and network address translation correctly, they do not get the stinkin message! can i get any clearer????? no!so, i hi-taled it back to uconn and ate at chang's garden with the family... had stuff not on the menu (thats what you get when you know taiwan people, hahaha) and then went back to the dorm.picked to represent uconn at the ecaasu!i got the e-mail that said i wasn't rejected! which is good! i have registered and will attend the mandatory meeting and hopefully learn from the conference and bring some new ideas to share like i always do.the future is coming...next up:corporate taxes, personal taxes (all next weekend), corporate summer planning, fafsa, ecaasu, asiantation mentoring program application, and hopefully i'll win the scholarships i have applied for.i should actually make a bundle from the company this summer for my share of the company training program.

2:47 am - wow... 338+ hours of 600 available hours since leaving storrs spent working...



holy cow, how hard does alan work, you ask?well, here's the official count:hours worked - since december 15, 2005 (when i left storrs after my last final)as of january 11, 2006, at 12:00 midnight...320 hours spent working for the corporation, both at the home office and the dha office6 hours spent working for the university of connecticut honors program, back in storrs12 hours spent working on my 2005 tax forms! (unlike most folks my age i have to file the regular 1040... with tons of schedules... ugh...)wow. amazing. i've never worked this hard in my life.and you know why i have to work this hard? it's called compu-&*%#. no, it's not me half-pronouncing the word computer and cursing at it. it's me cursing at a business that we hired that's ruining our life. we gave them a 2nd chance, 3rd chance, and so on to redeem themselves. biggest mistake i've made in my life. never going that route again. i'm way too nice. seriously.because of them, the real project i was supposed to do got backlogged three weeks...oh well.so, while everybody else is enjoying their break, poor alan has put over 338 hours of his time working. there are only 600 hours that has elapsed...man i really need a vacation, wait, this is my winter break from college, i'm supposed to be on vacation! oopsy... guess that's what happens when you're the chairman and ceo of a science and technology holdings corporation, right?

3:53 pm - yes!!!!!



oh man my dad's retirement from the ccc board is effective this february, with the expiration of his term! can't wait - because this effectively means i am officially retiring from helping out at camp and other things like that... effective this year!i know all of my friends from rhhs and ghamas have asked me, why do you stay? you should leave. now i finally am. most of the time, when i give something up, i feel kind of bad. this is a exception, i feel bad leaving behind those who appreciate my work, but i don't feel bad at all leaving behind those who have treated me like utter crap. i won't name names.while camp had brought me a lot of good times, the treatment i got from certain people (meaning, a huge bunch of people my age within that organization) over the years within the ccc has begun to push me towards helping out less there and more where i am actually more appreciated.ah, i feel so good inside now. besides, i wouldn't want to introduce her to those who have treated me like crap for the last 12 years. it's time i listen and stop volunteering for things that aren't getting me anywhere, to learn to say no for my own sake, and it feels real good finally being able to say no!speaking of 12 years... we're in the tag 10th fiscal year! 10th year of service to our community! time to celebrate... www.tag2000international.com/tag10

3:03 am - can i have a vacation without being paged? please??? pretty please????



ahhhhh!!!!! i evidently cannot go on vacation without something going wrong...
the tag2000 international llc holdings company global network was running in a overall stable state while i was on vacation, which was very good news. stablity had dramatically increased in routing through a majority of the network once our last windows 2000 server was replaced with a windows server 2003 machine.
however, while a majority of the corporate network enjoyed benefits from the new enhancement to the older backbone of the corporate network, the itcomm backbone which services our major clients, including our parents' businesses, had some sbs 2003 servers that needed to be recreated from scratch and this was causing us serious issues.
so, i got called in to do some heavy duty computing problem solving the day after thanksgiving day. here's the funny part. at the same time, my dad's good buddy from high school, who's house we were staying in, had also been called in...
so yeah, other than me and dave having to pull late nighters fixing corporate supported systems, i had a enjoyable vacation.
actually, i got so sick and tired of crashing computers that when i went over erica's today to watch wayne's world, i just shut off my phone. i'm beginning to like her idea of a vacation without technology... and technology is kinda my business, yet it is only one of my many interests... i was like screw this, if it's that important, i'll answer it later.
