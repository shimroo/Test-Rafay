19 months old


sep. 14th, 2011 at 12:08 pm



 

my little baby boy is now a big 19-month-old! time sure flies… i wish i could freeze him like this for a while. he is still so sweet and cuddly, but he’s also independent and full of curiosity!
i’ve been working on a big sewing project for jax. i’m making him a quiet book to bring on his first plane ride out to california in november. it’s a huge undertaking, so i’m trying to get two pages done per week. lots of drawing, cutting and hand-sewing, but i hope this activity book with become a family heirloom for him.
i’ve been busy, busy, busy on our family blog! check it out:

we are so ready for autumn!
jax loves books! we set up a reading corner.
we talked some more about nursing a toddler.
i shared a beloved childhood photo.
i’m learning to take better photos (see the photo above!)

our morning adventures


aug. 9th, 2011 at 11:05 am



 

jax is currently napping off our morning adventures… his daddy worked the overnight shift and jax had trouble sleeping. that lead to him being crazy and loud right when my husband was going to sleep in the morning, so i got him out of the house.
i drove out to one of jax’s favorite playgrounds that has an airplane theme. after playing for a while, we sat in the breeze and shared a mango smoothie. we walked hand-in-hand to the pet store for crickets and he pulled my hand to his mouth and gave me a loud kiss: “mwah!!” so sweet.
on our way home, i saw a large collie running across the road. i pulled over into a turn lane by the median, but he had already crossed the other side of the road. i was able to u-turn and park in another turn lane near where he was sniffing. i popped the back of my suv and crouched down to call him. he was super sweet and came running to me. i helped him into the car, then got in the backseat to call the number on his tags. turns out he wasn’t too far from home – well, his new home. his address was listed as omaha (we are in virginia!), but his new address was only a couple minutes’ drive away. his mom had her son meet me outside so i could deliver him safe and sound. i was happy to help a dog in need! i can’t let a dog run around in the street without stopping to help.
jax had his first encounter with a playground bully today. read about it here.

the other side of me…


jun. 20th, 2011 at 8:53 pm



 

as most of you know, the recreation of stvlive has been a slow and ongoing project since we welcomed little jax into our lives. the site is always in my thoughts, and as soon as someone invents a brain-to-blog wordpress plugin, i’ll be writing all the time!
i’ve run into a lot of tough decisions while figuring out how to remake the site. just like in life, it can be tough to balance life as a mommy with life as a woman online. i finally decided to separate the two somewhat and create a blog dedicated to my life with jax. now that i have my aunt’s old ipad, i have no excuse not to write blog entries while nursing the little one in bed.
now i can go forward with stvlive as my personal site, as it always has been. i’ll be posting journal entries, self-portraits, brain dumps… all that good over-sharing stuff that no one cares about anymore now that we are all so accessible.   i will also be posting snippets from my blog with jax occasionally, and i hope you all will visit us there and new a comment or two!
if you have any suggestions for stvlive, please let me know. it has been an amazing journey – having run this site since 1998 – and i’m ready to keep it going!
without further ado, please check out imagine our life! you can subscribe to receive it’s updates either via rss or email. i also started a facebook page for it. please join if you’d like to connect with me on there.
