“naon membership and orthopaedic certification have been catalysts to advancing my career and have allowed me to connect and network with nurses providing guidance and support.”
charla b. johnson, dnp, rn-bc, onc



“naon membership is very important to me. i think it brings value to me personally and to my organization. i feel i am a stronger orthopaedic nurse because i have access to a network of exceptional orthopaedic nurses who strive to be the best they can be and access to resources that help us provide the highest level of quality care to patients. i am a strong believer that all nurses should belong to a professional organization that aligns with their specialty.”
donna kurek, msn, rn, mha, onc, cmsrn
