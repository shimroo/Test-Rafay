new page that list some videos we have created 
 
of our local car shows. we use to use you tube for years but for no reason given 
they jacked my place and can't explain why. i have researched and it seems to 
point at some jealous competitors filing false complaints. you tube will just 
remove stuff without even checking the complaint thoroughly. then give you a 
short period to try and deal with their loops to reopen. best to use your own 
server source and stop living under some body else's domain.

driving is your "right" - not a privilege!!! it's called, "your right to 
travel safely"

does it all end? know your rights.

what the us government does not want you to know! 
beware: 
this is highly controversial documented information which includes court 
case listed proof.
did you know that driving is your right and not a privilege if you live in the 
usa?
we posted a page that is a very informative posting about everything you need to 
know about your rights as a driver of a motor vehicle. it explains what you 
should do and say in the event you are pulled over by a police officer or have 
to go to court to fight a traffic ticket. there are examples of actual court 
cases and step by step questioning for your defense. police can be pretty tough 
on you when your stopped by one. they are trained to ask specific questions that 
in most cases always gives them the control of the situation. you must know your 
rights. stop yourself from getting in trouble and start defending your rights to 
travel safely. you do not have to speak to an officer if you do not want to. if 
you are ever asked to have your car randomly searched by an officer, remember to 
say, "i do not consent to searches". there is no reason to have a car searched 
unless you were reported in a crime. as well, it is illegal for a police officer 
to search inside your pockets unless you have been arrested for a crime. they 
are limited to just patting you down to look for anything that may hurt them or 
you. also, if you do not have a camera in place in your vehicle nowadays, your 
asking for trouble. be it an accident, crime, or abusive police behavior, you 
need to have strong evidence in any courtroom, especially when it's the police 
that are the ones involved in the problem.
you will be surprised what you don't know, concerning the laws of the road. the 
government does not always inform you on what your true rights are as a driver. 
you have to find out yourself.
if just a very small percentage of drivers whom received traffic violations 
contested their tickets, there would be havoc within the financial balance of 
our local cities and courts would be overflowing. most people that get a traffic 
violation just end up paying the ticket and that's it. well, this is what the 
government wants to happen in our local traffic court systems. the system is 
designed to make revenue and it does it very well when you break the law. local 
law enforcement, street updates and maintenance, traffic signal installation and 
much more depends on a large amount of money given to them for fines and 
violations, etc.
there is so much more to read about in 
your right to travel . learn to better protect your rights as a traveler on 
our highways. stop thinking like you were taught to think and learn the truth 
about your right to travel. you will be surprised what you have been missing. 
you will be more informed the next time you are asked for license, registration 
and proof of insurance.
if you feel that your rights have been violated by a police officer, remember 
to file your complaint with the departments internal affairs for investigation.
