“we don’t have time for inefficiencies, so anything that helps me focus on the important moving pieces and reduces noise is critical. abacus helps me do that by letting me quickly review standard expenses within budget and flagging which are out of the ordinary that i need to dig into deeper.”
daniel kan, chief operating officer at cruise


"my employees love the simplicity and ease of the system. as an administrator, i love the functionality of seeing expenses in real time."
matt hagel, controller at bark & co.


“abacus fulfills two requirements that help us make our expense reporting more efficient - a simple interface that helps our employees submit accurate expenses in real time, and powerful rule-based automation that we can customize to our policy so expenses are auto-approved or sent to the best person to review and approve.”
daniel niccum, cfo, north american substation services
