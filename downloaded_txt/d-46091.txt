 icarus shawl, originally uploaded by elemmaciltur.  started: 24th april 2007finished: 03rd april 2008needles: 3.5 mm / 80 cm addi lace circsyarn: rohrspatz & wollmeise lace-weight, 100% superwash merino, 300g hank (530 m / 100 g), colour: "poison no. 5"pattern: "icarus" by miriam felton from interweave knit summer 2006"nam ponit in ordine pennas a minima coeptas, longam breviore sequenti,ut clivo crevisse putes...postquam manus ultima coepto imposita est, geminas opifex libravit in alas ipse suum corpus motaque pependit in aura; instruit et natum 'medio' que 'ut limite curras, icare,' ait 'moneo, ne, si demissior ibis, unda gravet pennas, si celsior, ignis adurat: inter utrumque vola. (...)...cum puer audaci coepit guadere volatu deseruitque ducem caelique cupidine tractus altius egit iter. rapidi vicinia solis mollit odoratas, pennarum vincula, ceras; tabuerant cerae: nudos quatit ille lacertos, remigioque carens non ullas percipit auras, oraque caerulea patrium clamantia nomen excipiuntur aqua, quae nomen traxit ab illo. (...)at pater infelix, nec iam pater, 'icare,' dixit, 'icare,' dixit 'ubi es? qua te regione requiram?''icare' dicebat: pennas aspexit in unis devovitque suas artes corpusque sepulcro condidit, et tellus a nomine dicta sepulti."finally, it's finished! i think that it's really beautiful. even though knitting the body was tedious and boring, but the result was well worth it. now i have to pack it up and send it off to my mum for her birthday.i went to do the photoshoot yesterday and took about 30 photos. they all turned out so great that it was hard to choose. so, i picked out a lot of them. hope you like them.i chose some passages from ovid's metamorphoses "daedalus and icarus" and posted it above. if you want to read the translation, you can find it here.photos are taken at königsplatz.here are some selections of the photos. you can find the rest of them here. icarus shawl, originally uploaded by elemmaciltur.   icarus shawl, originally uploaded by elemmaciltur.   icarus shawl, originally uploaded by elemmaciltur.  current mood: good

 i definitely loved this project, and can't wait to take post-blocking photos! i knew that once i'd gotten the chance to block this shawl, it would drastically different. however, i think i knew that on a purely intellectual level. once i got icarus all pinned out, i was quite shocked at the difference. (just like i am every time i block lace! i really should remember how cool this process is!)pre-blocking vs. blocking:yup.  it's love.cross-posted to interweave knits knit-along, and my blog.
