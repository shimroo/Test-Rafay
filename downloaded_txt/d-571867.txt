our mission is to provide mental health treatment for childrenaustin child guidance center is a nonprofit that provides accessible, high-quality mental health services to children and their families to empower them to thrive in childhood and beyond.






child mental health services
we provide a variety of mental health services to support children and their families all across central texas. they include individual and family therapy, group therapy, psychological assessments, psychiatric services, caregiver workshops, and a walk-in clinic. our clinical services are offered in english and spanish and provided both in-person and via tele-therapy.
we offer a sliding scale
here at acgc, we don’t want the cost of treatment to be a barrier to mental health care or add to the stress of families seeking care.  as part of our effort to serve all families, especially those with financial needs, acgc offers a sliding fee scale. we consider circumstances such as household income and family size and regular/standard living expenses to calculate the percentage of service fees qualified clients will be responsible for paying.
who we are and how we work
our clinical staff of licensed therapists, social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists are dedicated to providing high quality, evidence-based treatment to your child and family regardless of ability to pay. our therapists work with each family to help determine your goals and develop a treatment plan. together, we identify your desired changes, ways to achieve those changes, and set goals.
psychological assessments
acgc offers psychological assessments to help gain a better understanding of your child's mental health. in addition to helping parents and professionals better understand your child, psychological assessments are used to diagnose adhd, learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, depression, anxiety, and other emotional and behavioral difficulties.
individual & family therapy
individual & family therapy helps family members better understand each other, support one another and work through difficult situations. with your therapist, we will work together to support both you and your child. we also provide group therapy in austin to provide additional counseling and support for families. free caregiver workshops are available as a resource as well.  
if your child has immediate needs, we offer an in-person walk-in clinic every tuesday from 3:30-5:00 pm. parents or guardians can schedule an appointment with or without their child to consult with a therapist about problem behavior, seek advice, and explore solutions. please note that our clinic is not for emergencies or crises.
