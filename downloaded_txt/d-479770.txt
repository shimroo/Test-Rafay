connecting people to music through music since 1992

 







 

community music schoolwe enrich the lives of students, teachers, professional musicians, and the community through music education, performance, and appreciation. we do this by hosting music workshops, concerts, summer camps, and ongoing ensembles for musicians age seven and up; maintaining a free database of local music teachers; placing donated musical instruments with people or organizations who need them; offering music instrument “petting zoos” at community events; and publishing a free monthly e-newsletter that lists upcoming concerts and music-related events around the monterey bay area.
