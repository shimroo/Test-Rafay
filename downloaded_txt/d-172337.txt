back to the roots or back to the future? no matter how you call it ... grave digger record the first album of their career completely without keyboard passages. with new axeman tobias kersting, the band finds its way back to long forgotten trademarks. raw, brutal, honest and yet catchy, songs like "bone collector" or "made of madness" thunder out of the speakers. groovemonsters like "riders of doom" or "mirror of hate" come across like a steamroller and the band also quotes the good old stadium rock times in the form of "the devils serenade". far from the concept albums of the last two decades, "bone collector" is a manifesto of german heavy metal. "kingdom of skulls" pays homage to the reaper and you can feel the spirit of the 80s without sounding stale. oldschool at its best, without rust and patina, no self-copying and always authentic, this is how the band's new work can be described. those who think they are listening to a brew of old heroic deeds are mistaken and will be proven wrong by songs like "the rich the poor the dying" or "whispers of the damned". rarely has the band sounded more versatile than in these days. energetic, fresh, multifaceted ... brings it to the point. produced, mixed and mastered by chris boltendahl, optically set in scene by brazilian artist wanderley perna, this is a work of art that heralds a new era.the new album "bone collector" is out now via rpm roar and can be listened and purchased from here!

in january and february 2025, grave digger will pop the corks and celebrate their 45 years of band existence with you on their "45th anniversary tour". they will be supported by none other than metal greats victory as well as rigorious (from january 16th to january 26th, 2025) and warwolf (from january 30th to february 8th, 2025).chris speaks out and comments on the anniversary party: "really looking forward to hit the road next year with this great metal package to celebrate grave digger's 45th anniversary. with german heavy metal legends victory, we have a more than top-class "very special guest" on tour, supported by the exciting up-and-coming and endowed with extraordinary potential acts warwolf and rigorious. metal heart, what to you want more, this is going to be really really awesome ... you will definitely love it!"
