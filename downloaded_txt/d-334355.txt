what is this site all about?

              1.  the telling in words and pictures of one of the eastern sierra's most incredible mule packing outfits - mt. whitney pack trains which operated out of lone pine, ca from the 1940s through the early 1970s.

              2.  the history of owens valley towns, pioneering families, and individual people who made owens valley what it is today.

              3.  stories of mining camps and surrounding areas affecting mining in the mountains surrounding owens valley.

              4.
              stories and photos about the sierra nevada mountains (the range of light that is like none other), the personalities who enjoyed them in the past and who are part of the lore we relish to hear about today.








mcgee creek (the packer's song)
written for the mcgee creek pack station while it was under the ownership of the roeser's by dave stampey.
              from his album buckaroo man
              

                this song is a testament to all of the sierra nevada pack stations on both the east and west sides of the sierra nevada.

(all books are available at amazon.com) 


high sierra adventures:
              my summers with mt. whitney pack trains

this book follows the adventures of a teenager who worked for mt.  whitney pack trains, out of lone pine, ca, for six summers between the  years of 1965 - 1970. it details his journey from being a "city slicker"  knowing nothing about livestock and packing to becoming a seasoned  packer / guide for one of the most prestigious pack stations operating  on the east side of the sierra nevada. using a combination of  photographs and life events he takes the reader progressively through  six summers of "learning the ropes" of being a packer as he packed in  such groups as the sierra club, the trail riders of the wilderness and  private parties. this book is full of events that will make you laugh  and cry as he describes the pack trips, wrecks, wrangles, livestock and  personnel that made each summer a greater adventure than the preceding  one. 


california adventures:
              on the trail with ray & josh

california adventures are the real hiking adventures of ray delea  and his nephew josh green. over a period of seven years from 2012 to  2019 this hiking duo ventured into the southern california deserts of  anza borrego & joshua tree in search of desert adventures. when they  had had their fill of the blistering heat of the desert, they turned  their attention to the mountains of los angeles and riverside counties  pursuing their hiking dreams. finally, when they had hiked to the summit  of most of the mountain peaks in the los angeles area, they ventured  northward to the sierra nevada mountains flanking owens valley and the  panamint mountains overlooking death valley. it was there, from the  cattle-worn trails of the southern sierra nevada near olancha to the  mid-sierra nevada country west of tom’s place that they found true  “hiking delight.”



              arrested by the master

arrested by the master is one persons journey to salvation from  when he was a young child until god reached down and touched him in  october of 1976. it is written to let the reader know that no one's  journey to salvation is a boring one. it is filled with the ups and  downs of life, seemingly meaningless actions, relationships, work  experiences, family relationships, school experiences etc. all which god  finds valuable in winning others who are lost, without hope, and on  roads leading away from him. this book will let you know that god places  high value in your personal journey to him saving you, no matter how  simple, plain, or without excitement you might think it to be. it is so  precious and individualized by the holy spirit.. you too should tell  people about your journey.

many thanks
                to the backcountry horsemen of california for their continuing
                efforts over the decades to help preserve the sierra nevada and
                keep it open to livestock. they strive to promote conservation
                and the awareness of the benefit of livestock in the backcountry.
                in addition i, in particular, am thankful that they strive to
                keep everyone appraised of those, who through misguided legislation
                or self interests, would try to ban livestock from the mountain
                range packers not only opened to the public, but who also made
                us aware of the importance of preserving that same country. it
                is indeed ironic that it has been those on two feet with easy
                road-end access to the sierra, and not four, who have contaminated
              nearly every stream and lake in the sierra with giardia.









many
                  heartfelt thanks to all of the packers, owens valley pioneers,
                  and friends who have so generously contributed to this site in
