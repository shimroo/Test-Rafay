joseph barbaccia fine art





joseph barbaccia (american, born philadelphia, pa, 1952) studied at tyler school of fine art in philadelphia. barbaccia spent the following 8 years (1976- 84) traveling through the united states and south pacific, concentrating on drawing and painting in a mostly representational style.
in 1996, barbaccia moved to potomac falls, va. over the next 4 years he began to paint with encaustics on carved plaster reliefs. with his âanimal metaphorsâ series in 2000 and the 2002 âsantosâ series, he fully evolved to freestanding sculpture, creating pieces that employed the act of wrapping and winding materials over a mixed media framework.
in 2003 barbacciaâs art took another definitive step. by incorporating the most basic of materials in assemblies that underscore craftsmanship and meaning, he had pared down visual insight to a more essential level of expression.
2008 saw barbacciaâs work recognized in the greater washington metro area as some of the most compelling by his becoming a finalist for the trawick prize.
 
 
 





in 2014 he began to create with polymer clay. the resulting works are three dimensional in form, similar to bas reliefs.
in 2018 barbaccia moved to delaware, usa. his images have been presented as covers and interior pieces for magazines, books, and more.
barbaccia has written articles about his unique style for polymer arts magazine. his work has been featured in luzerâs archive 200 best illustrators worldwide, illustration annual 57,
3 x 3 illustration directory, polymer journeys (the art and craft of polymer), creative quarterly, illustration west 54, and the aoi world illustration awards.
joseph barbaccia is a member of the rehoboth art league,the society of illustrators, the illustrators club of washington dc, association of illustrators, society of childrenâs book writers and illustrators and the international polymer clay association.
