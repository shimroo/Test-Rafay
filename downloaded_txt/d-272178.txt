“do you want to hear a story?”

that question has turned the heads of young and old alike as long as storytellers have been issuing the invitation. it is not a coincidence that god, who made us to learn through stories, chose the vehicle of “story” to teach us his divine truth when he walked among us. the “parable” is god’s idea; that is why we flock to stories, and that is why they have the power to mold us. is it any wonder that satan works hard to fill our minds with bad stories? let’s silence the whine of bad stories with the roar of god’s story. it is my earnest prayer that you find these dramas useful, and my humble privilege to join with church dramatists everywhere, as we teach as jesus taught: “and he spoke to them in parables, saying…” (matthew 13:3)
thank you for visiting inkspirations! may god use these scripts to draw people closer to him!

“the power of agape love”
in this third skit of four, the quality of real love among life-long friends is
humorously portrayed. these “senior saints” have had a lifetime to
practice their love relationships. god’s “agape” love has seasoned them
all to perfection. bob, their sunday school teacher, tries to teach them
what it means to practice true “agape love,” but he can hardly get a
word in edgewise because they are constantly chatting with one another
about their lives, what’s going wrong, and how they can help each other.
finally, bob gives up, realizing that these life-long friends are already
excellent examples of what it means to be brothers and sisters in christ.
