news - complete human day 14 post-implantation embryo models from naïve embryonic stem cells


 carnegie stage 6 embryo
this recent nature paper[1] describes the use of naïve human embryonic stem cells to recapitulate the early stages of human development.
"the ability to study human post-implantation development remains limited due to ethical and technical challenges associated with intrauterine development after implantation....only genetically unmodified human naïve human es cells...recapitulate the organization of nearly all known lineages and compartments of post-implantation human embryos including epiblast, hypoblast, extra-embryonic mesoderm, and trophoblast surrounding the latter layers...these human complete sems demonstrated developmental growth dynamics that resemble key hallmarks of post-implantation stage embryogenesis up to 13-14 days post-fertilization (dpf) (carnegie stage 6a)."
