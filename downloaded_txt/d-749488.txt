snow storms in vermont.





2-15-25 vermont: the snow has started, just as predicted. we are expecting several inches with wind and cold, and we are stocked up with batteries, food, propane, candles, wood and are ready for the power to go out. 

we came up on wednesday, a day after a snow storm and a day before another snow storm. we had dinner plans that got canceled with cousin john the night of the second storm, and tonight we were supposed to have dinner with jim, brooke and lara-beth, but that too is canceled. 

we are house bound, but i’ve been doing repairs and chores that keep me going up and down stairs, so it’s like a workout. i brought a load of wood in this morning.

i had been watching the birds at the feeders in short hills when suddenly they  all vanished into the shrubbery as a hawk flew in. it landed in a tree over-looking the feeders and stayed long enough for me to get pix. the id from merlin was either a coopers hawk or the much less common sharp shinned hawk. they are virtually identical unless you see them side by side to compare them for the subtle differences.  
there’s two weeks to go in february and then it’s march and the beginning of spring! can’t wait.

the red birds stand out against the drab colors of winter foliage.

here's a goldfinch just with hints of the summer color. he knows spring is on the way.

the coopers hawk. anybody with a better id?

blanca's favorite show is only on once a year. actually both dogs were watching with judy.

this woodsman carries a cane instead of an axe.

from a neighbor--horses wearing stocking caps.

doesn't look like spring here.

the chairs and tables are set--waiting for the customers.

caught in bed with a blonde girl.





2-8-24 short hills: judy caught blue and me in bed this morning. actually blue doesn’t climb on the furniture, judy helped her up on the bed. it wasn’t that late in the morning.

adventures of val and steve.





2-4-24 short hills: we were back in nyc to have sunday brunch with cousins david, kenny, and moni at their place on 64th st. we were there for hours talking about past times and current times. tonight we had dinner with lynn and bill here in nj. last week we ate at eataly in the mall with bebe and ronny.

the exciting news is that val and steve are in finland, northern finland, to see the northern lights. they are sleeping in glass igloos and get roused if there is any activity. they have been lucky, with a nice show, and maybe more to follow. i will post their pix that were on messages.  

dog sleds ready for action.

another mode of transportion.

here it is: aurora borealis in green and red.

and another shot. [all these pix are from val.]

blue hill.





1-28-25 short hills: the deep freeze is over for the moment. we continue to be dry without more snow or rain. we do have snow cover of an inch or so that is slowly shrinking. all the snow is off the shrubs, and i don’t see any damage. 

sunday we went to nyc for lunch with anna, gardner, lily and danna at blue hill. they serve you what the chef has made for that day—it was excellent. i don’t think anyone had a problem with any of the many courses. the mince pie and mashed potatoes were especially delicious. it was a bit pricey, but worth it. emmett was booked to attend, but decided to nap instead. fortunately judy and i spent time with him at home before the  lunch. 

judy has been doing 2-3 dog visits per week.  

judy, emmett and me before the restaurant.

the starters and main courses.

our table with dessert cheese cake.

i'm not asleep, but contemplating my birthday candle and special dessert. they were a few candles short.

new snow, new flower, new moose.





1-20-24 short hills: it stopped snowing this morning after about 12 hrs of storming that delivered 4-5 inches of white stuff. that’s our biggest storm so far this season. the bigger news is that the temperature is dropping fast and will give us below zero wind chill values tonight. the dogs seem to like the snow, and we took pretty pix this morning. we filled all the feeders, and the birds are mobbing them.

we had dinner with nancy and alan a few days ago and with lynn and bill  yesterday.  

gardner had seen a stuffed moose at vermont flannel in woodstock, vt many months ago, but they wouldn’t sell it. judy found out that it came from canada, stuffed animal house of new brunswick. she looked at the tag. it turns out that they only sell wholesale, but judy turned on the charm, and played the great grandma card and got them to sell her one, when the new shipment came in. it was delayed and delayed again and then shipped, but then the dock strike caused more delay. it finally arrived, and emmett loves it. judy sent pix to stuffed animal house—they were as pleased as we were.

during the summer a neighbor gave me a sprig from her christmas cactus that i potted after it grew roots while in water. it put out some new segments during the fall and [ta-da] has a flower this week.

new blooms: christmas cactus.

cactus flower.

moose takes a whole chair for himself.

cloud cover gone, but it's cold.

lilac in white.

cardinal in the snow.

snowy apple tree.

white dogs are not as white as the snow.

southern magnolia gets white flowers too.

cold and windy.





1-9-25 short hills: new years eve and day have come and gone. here in nj it’s been cold with very cold wind chills from a northwest wind that won’t quit. we have had a couple dustings of snow. 

tomorrow is my bd. we have a couple dinners planned to celebrate, lorenas tomorrow and gramercy tavern saturday for lunch with alison, dan, steve and val. it might snow friday night into saturday, but less than an inch predicted, hopefully it won’t disrupt the plans.

the birds are busy at the feeders, but i don’t have any new pix.

since the first, i have had four medical visits and two more coming up this month and more in february. that’s my new career, ‘doctoring’, i get a lot of reading done in waiting rooms. 

our latest snowstorm. snowshoes not needed so far this winter.

snow and ice--while they're still fun.





12-27-24 vermont: we have had more snow and plenty of cold. the views from the house look quite wintery. one day after some rain and then a freeze the road to town was flanked by crystalline trees in bright sunlight. the snow and ice are still novelties and a treat for the eyes. in a few weeks the novelty will have worn off. 

judy’s party was a huge success. alison, dan and lily were here for the party and to help before and after. we are still eating left-overs. 

i got outside in the snow to change the camera card in the game cam by the upper pond. we caught deer, fox, skunk, and one unknown that i’ll post for your guesses.

bad weather predicted for sunday so we go home tomorrow. 

shiny, icy trees after rain and freeze. we are only a couple miles north of this site, but had snow without the ice.

here's the mystery animal. not a fox or deer, doesn't look like any of the dogs in the neighborhood. maybe a pig??

me out in the snow to get the camera card. judy accompanied me and took the pix. 

blue watched us playing in the snow but stayed in the driveway.

a bunch of apple trees glittering in the sun.

snow while it's fresh and still on the trees.
