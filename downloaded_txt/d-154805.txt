need food?



1 in 8 households need food assistance
here’s how we help
we are at the centre of the community food assistance network
the community food assistance network consists of 54 organizations and 132 food assistance programs. working together, these organizations address hunger by providing food hampers, community meals, nutritional outreach, and shelter and residential meals.
fifty-nine per cent of the food we distribute to the community food assistance network is fresh or frozen.
our fleet of refrigerated trucks, onsite coolers, and freezers ensure we are safely storing and transporting thousands of pounds of fresh, frozen, and non-perishable food every day.
we are the source for reliable information about hunger and food insecurity in waterloo region.
last year, more than 73,600 people accessed a food hamper program in waterloo region.

our mission
