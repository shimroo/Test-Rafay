an eye-opening 
                      trading blog,
                      and free trading education
doing what everyone else is doing will give you the same 
                      boring results as everyone else.
if you want more, you must do, think, and act differently. 
                      learning how to trade (or simply following a successful 
                      trader) is one of those things that can change your life.
anyone who has the desire to increase their income and/or 
                      investing results must include trading as part of their 
                      strategy.
my job is to help you do just that.


"trading 
                      reality"
i'm a professional trader. i have been for a very 
                      long time. it's what i do for a living (about 
                      me).
for over 15 years i ran a very successful trading service 
                      that let you see exactly what i was looking at, what i was 
                      thinking, and.. what trades i was taking.
my goal was simply to allow others to see 
                      the amazing benefits trading can bring to their income and 
                      lives. 
while i no longer offer advisory services 
                      (i've thankfully achieved an amazing life for my family 
                      and i through trading and hard work), i want to continue 
                      to offer this website as a helpful tool to help others find 
                      their own path to independence thru trading.

trading 
                      blog  
i've spent way too much time 
                      searching for trading blogs that actually have value. while 
                      there are many out there, only a few are worth reading on 
                      a consistent basis. 
because of this, i decided 
                      to create my own trading 
                      blog that contains relevant advice, useful trading 
                      information, and most of all has truthful advice 
                      on what it really takes to succeed in the trading 
                      world.
my trading 
                      reality blog will give you real-life lessons and insight 
                      from someone with literal decades of experience in trading 
                      the forex, futures, stock, and option markets.
