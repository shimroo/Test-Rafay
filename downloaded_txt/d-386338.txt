public ranges


public lands




    there are many privately owned or club run shooting ranges in arizona. the benefits of an organized range are the safety, education and low environmental impact
new shooters would do best to visit a public range to learn how to shoot. having the experience and patience of a safety officer is invaluable to a new shooter.
public ranges collect the brass cases and contain the lead bullets in one area to result in a much lower impact on the environment. in fact most ranges recycle the brass left behind by shooters so shooting at a public range can actually help the shooting sports


     you might not know it but arizona is only about 17.6 percent privately owned.
more than a quarter of arizona is owned by 21 indian tribes
more than half of arizona is held by the federal and state governments, administered through federal and state agencies
bureau of land management
arizona game and fish department
u.s. forest service
keep our public lands clean and available for the next guy. pack out all your trash, police your brass, don’t shoot at clay birds in the desert.
