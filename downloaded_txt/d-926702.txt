centennial theatre presents​​
grease, the musical 
here is rydell high's senior class of 1959: the duck-tailed, hot-rodding t-birds, and the gum-snapping, hip-shaking pink ladies, evoking the look and sound of the 1950's in this rollicking musical.  at the heart of the story is the romance between head greaser danny zuko and the sweet new girl in town, sandy dumbrowski. sandy and danny try to reclaim the love of their 'summer nights' but will it cross clique lines?  the gang of wise-cracking teens sings and dances its way through such nostalgic scenes as the pajama party, the prom and the drive-in. songs like 'greased lightnin'', 'it's raining on prom night' and 'freddy my love' recall the music of buddy holly, little richard and elvis presley that became the soundtrack of a generation.  book, music, and lyrics by jim jacobs and warren casey.  a fast-moving period piece that pays affectionate homage to the bittersweet coming-of-age of a group of blue-collar high school kids in the late 1950s.  chicago sun-timesthe show has a run time of approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes, including intermission.some adult themes and suggestive language. suitable for ages 12 and up.

show dates & times:

february 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, & 157:00 pm​
