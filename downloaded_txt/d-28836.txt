the best thing about women is their detachment from reality, that they can make things seem magical and special. the worst thing about women is their detachment from reality, with their ingratitude and dismissal of all the luxuries and amenities men have made for them — ethics? people have died suddenly — brandon smith on feminist fantasies — tucker carlson speaks to canada — jordan peterson tackles transgenderism and the psychopathology of the devouring mother — “i may be crazy. but itâs no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” ivor browne, emeritus professor of psychiatry, university college dublin (2017) — how ukranians are drafted into the army — goldilocks has arrived! — stunning statistics concerning vaccines (video), “the authors did not agree with this retraction.” — censorship special: mike benz interview; proof; those awful awfuls — tucker and putin — and jeffrey sachs — and thomas massie — and mike benz again — nick fuentes on marriage — on simps — on 9/11 — first sound principles — former british mp reveals all — operation goldfish — solipsism and the roots of the death cult — israel’s armageddon — 
not caring and point and shriek — one day in kaliningrad — this land is mine — how women destroy nations — gaza — the fall of england — bullshit jobs — israel’s nukes — columbus day — vampire currency — vampire art — 
morgenthau plan — occupied film — onlyfans — bill gates — pussywhipped satan — child molesters — narrative shift

‘it was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy.’ george orwell, nineteen eighty-four



‘the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race, posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. if the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth produced by its collision with error.’ john stuart mill, on liberty, 1859







   

the heretical website has been online since june 1998. if you’ve made it this far – congratulations! powerful interests are doing their best to prevent it, but sanity will ultimately prevail.




news is something someone somewhere doesn’t want printed. everything else is advertising – northcliffe

or maybe not
‘do i “deny the holocaust”? no! no indeed. i hope the holocaust is not denied and never forgotten. i hope the holocaust is remembered as the greatest propaganda effort and hate campaign ever waged against a civilized people. we must never forget. we must look at the despoliation of our people and our culture and ask: why do the heavens not darken? we have lost the will and courage to defend ourselves. the time has come to commit the new blasphemy. it is time to deny the gods of the new world order.’
tom blair, ‘the new blasphemy’






‘a new theory of biology’ was the title of the paper which mustapha mond had just finished reading. he sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page. ‘the author’s mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious but heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. not to be published.’ aldous huxley, brave new world




this website is best viewed using netspoiler v6.66 on a sunday following the 25th wedding anniversary of a distant relative, providing the weather is gloomy. then the temperature is good, and the spirit shall be at ease, especially if the anniversary was a joyous occasion. for more on ease of spirit and deeper spiritual matters consult the higher authority via the world church of xion; christians, of course, will not tremble when the true god steps down and (thanks to martin luther) need not enter their credit card number into indulgence order forms.

‘the enemy of subversive thought is not suppression, but publication: truth has no need to fear the light of day; fallacies wither under it. the unpopular views of today are the commonplaces of tomorrow, and in any case the wise man wants to hear both sides of every question.’ sir stanley unwin
