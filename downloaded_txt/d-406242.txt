							british antarctic expedition of 1907 hut at cape royds, 
							ross island. units of task force 43 may be seen several 
							miles off cape royds fighting their way through frozen 
							mcmurdo sound behind an icebreaker toward the base at 
							hut point. in the background mountains fifty miles away 
							in victoria land are pictured. picture courtesy 
							the naval history & heritage command - usa
 

the 
							erebus glacier comes down the slopes of mt. erebus 
							into the sea off the coast of ross island as an 11-12 
							km long ice tongue. it is a serrated, blue-rimmed "knife" 
							extending into the snow and ice-covered mcmurdo sound. 
							the smooth white expanse is the frozen southern ocean.
