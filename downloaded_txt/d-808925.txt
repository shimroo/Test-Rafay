i got this domain to further try and help animal rescue groups and foster organizations get their animals posted on the web. if you are an animal rescue or foster group and are in need of a website and can't afford a domain, you've come to the right place! thre are several ways to go about getting your adoptable animals on the web, and i am happy to help.1st - the easiest and most efficient way is to sign-up for a petfinder account, they are a wonderful, very well know organization that gives animal rescues free web space and hosting to post their adoptable animals online.
2nd - once you have a petfinder account. i can customize it for you and then list your site here for added exposure. i have been customizing petfinder websites for a few years now and it works very well because this way you are in charge of listing your animals. i can also set you up with a more customizable, unique, easy to remember name. as an example it could be http://bengalcat.rescuegroup.org or http://seniordog.rescuegroup.org. you would still post your animals on petfinder. this way you get the best of both worlds, a pefinder hosted website and a unique, easy to remember name.
3rd - if you already have a website and would like to get it listed in our directory. just fill out our form and we will contact you.
we'd love to hear from you with suggestions or comments so feel free to write us and let us know what you think. last but not least, a big thank-you to all the rescue groups for all they do!!
