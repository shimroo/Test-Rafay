creation 
				history | our story
							this 
							free online course will provide an overview of the conflicts that exist between the teachings of ânatural scienceâ and the bible. the goals of the class are 1) to confront the false teachings of naturalism that often impede or lead to a loss of faith and provide answers to these challenges, 2) to encourage students to trust in the bible as authoritative on early earth history and enable them to be a more effective witness for jesus christ. 1 peter 3:15 (always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks).
