welcome to the league for animal welfare!
for more than 70 years, the league has been helping homeless animals in our community
we exist to save homeless cats and dogs from the lives they were dealt, by providing the lives they deserve. as a privately-funded non-profit organization, partnering with our community is critical. you can get involved in a number of ways: adopt your next furry family member from our shelter, volunteer your time and talent, or donate funds to provide safe shelter, nutritious food and comprehensive medical care for our residents. you can also spread the word about our organization by talking to your family, friends and neighbors and sharing on social media. please explore our website and join us in transforming the lives of homeless animals in greater cincinnati!
