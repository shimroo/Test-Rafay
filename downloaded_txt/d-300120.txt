about your liver
you rely on your liver for over 500 essential functions. below are just a few of the more important functions that this vital organ performs:


aids your digestive system
                                your liver processes everything you eat and breathe. it produces and regulates the flow of bile, which enables you to digest and absorb fats and vitamins, as well as enzymes, hormones, immune factors, and cholesterol. almost everything you ingest, from the air you breathe and the food you eat to the lotions you put on our skin, is processed by your liver.
                            

produces useful substances
                                your liver manufactures a variety of important proteins, enzymes, hormones and immune factors that you need in order to survive.
                            

cleanses and detoxifies
                                it cleans your blood and removes toxins as well as a wide assortment of items that are harmful to your body.
                            

stores and replenishes
                                acts as storage center, storing important substances such as iron, vitamins, minerals and glycogen until they are needed. when you blood sugar levels drop and your body requires energy quickly, your liver converts the stored glycogen into glucose and releases it into your blood, so it can flow to where it is needed most.
                            

with such important roles to play, it is absolutely critical to keep your liver healthy and functioning at maximum capacity. even if you’re healthy, there are still ways that you can improve your liver function so you can live a longer, happier, and healthier life.
