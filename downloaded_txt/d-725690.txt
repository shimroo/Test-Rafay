lodging. dining. hospitality.






“the steamboat inn is a unique place in the middle of the umpqua national forest. the inn’s 60-year tradition of personalized hospitality and exceptional cuisine is kept alive by the woodwards, the current owners, for whom the inn is undeniably a labor of love. the steamboat inn offers a place to escape from the cookie-cutter chain hotels with disingenuous service, identical rooms, and predictable food.while the inn caters to fishermen, one does not have to be a fisherman to appreciate the beauty of the surrounding forest, the hypnotic umpqua river that flows beside each cabin, and meals that are creatively prepared by a kitchen staff that includes gourmet chefs.”
