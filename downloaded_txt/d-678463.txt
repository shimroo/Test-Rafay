subject: thank you for everything!
from: edt22730@aol.com
juraj,
i hope you had a safe drive back to kosice.
we can't thank you enough for everything you did for us.  we never   expected to find a cousin on the first day, and the second day, and the   third day (!), and it was only your intuition and experience that made   that happen.  your friendly demeanor opened doors to us that we never   could have even found, so thank you so much.  we will treasure knowing   the new cousins, and will send kim to you as soon as she can arrange the   trip!
best wishes,
becky
