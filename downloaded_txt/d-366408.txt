at madigan’s waterfront every dining experience is special and unique. dine by candlelight or the shimmering stars in season. the expansive partially covered outdoor patio and tiki bar is especially attractive on summer evenings, where you can enjoy drinks and food served in season, and watch for ospreys flying down the occoquan river. we have added fire pits to keep you warm on those chilly days where you can have you favorite drink, lunch or appetizer. our staff can set up great seatings for all occasions.
to improve our outside dining we have installed heaters and pull down windows to enclose the outside deck dining area during bad weather. you can now enjoy the river view while having a great lunch or dinner during those raining or even snowy days. 
if you are looking for entertainment and great bands then madigan’s waterfront is where you want to be. check out our calendar page for all the latest bands and events and come and enjoy our fully stocked bar and dance floor.
