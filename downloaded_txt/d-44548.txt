putting people and rivers together since 1976far flung adventures has been safely outfitting family and group river trips for over 45 years. over the last four-and-a-half decades we have run commercial adventures on dozens of rivers around the country and the world. while we continue to offer a long list of farther flung trips, our home base these days is in taos, new mexico – meaning that we concentrate many of our great offerings right here in the mountains and rivers of northern new mexico, because this is the land and the people we care most about.see all tripsthe far flung adventures experiencecheck out our videos to get a taste of what we offer!book a tripwhat travellers say about uscharlyfun on the chama


our three days on the chama river were fabulous, and our two campsites were fantastic. our guides impressed us with their organized deployments of our rafts and efficiency in setting up culinary centers to enjoy amazing camp cuisine. the crew could not have been more excellent!


debbyrio grande racecourse


the rio grande was low, but had lots of excitement for our 11-year-olds first time to raft. wild bill also made it fun with his knowledge of the river and the area. actually all the guides were great and navigated some tiny spaces between rocks. the reason we initially went with far flung during this covid-19 time was they were the only rafting company where the guides wore masks and you could wear your mask if you felt comfortable.


davidkayak rental


i was with a group of friends on a two hour self guided kayaking adventure down the rio grande. i would do it again in a heartbeat given the opportunity and also would like to check out their rafting guided trips. the boats were ready when we arrived at 8am and our transporter was very nice. we had a fun time together from 930am to 1130am enjoying all the scenic views.


rhmiddle box


excellent- just the right amount of adventure. we did the full day middle box trip on the rio grande. really a great experience. our guide, brian, was kind, knowledgeable and keep our group feeling comfortable with the adventure. the hike down was billed as “athletic” and that’s a good description. i’d do this again in a heartbeat. can’t go wrong booking this one.


jessicataos box


rafting the box was amazing! evan was a phenomenal guide, very informative and fun! i was apprehensive in the beginning as i am not a strong swimmer. they walk through several safety scenarios and my feelings quickly changed. i have a new found respect for the river!
