elite 180 provides a unique overnight recruiting experience unlike any other event in the country. 
our camp delivers the best opportunity for players looking to compete in the nescac and other elite diii schools. we do not run multiple events or have multiple locations. we pride ourselves on providing a sincere recruiting experience!
tournaments, while valuable, offer only one aspect of a player’s ability and potential. our camp showcases character, personality, lacrosse iq and skillset across six sessions providing multiple interactions unlike other showcases. our camp experience offers extensive individual coaching & performance evaluation, excellent competition and authentic off field interactions.
enrollment is limited to keep the athlete-to-coach ratio low in order to maximize exposure. each player at camp will have the opportunity to be seen and coached by every college coach. our staff is comprised of elite academic diii school coaches.
camp tuition, $710, includes overnight accommodations on campus and all meals!
all rising sophomores, juniors and seniors are invited to attend.

camp film from cross street sports: 
2025 film package options will be posted soon.
