the cactus combat match league is one of the oldest, largest and most active outdoor practical shooting organizations in the united states. we offer different styles of competition and instruction for all skill levels. our events are for recreation only and competitors must bring their own equipment (we do not sell firearms or ammunition).first time shooters at one of our matches (beginners or "new to our club") attend a new shooters meeting held at the beginning of the match. at that meeting, we can also team you with an experienced mentor who will assist you through your first match.
