praise for slewfoot: a usa today national bestseller!for all who enjoy historical horror with healthy doses of dark fantasy, witchcraft, and vengeance. -- booklist reviews"punctuated by moments of unanticipated levity as well as unmitigated terror, this clever and imaginative tale is not to be missed by fans of dark fantasy and historical horror." --library journal"slewfoot is a lusciously dark tale of witchcraft and devilry set in the unforgiving world of colonial new england. this book was tailor-made for lovers of folk horror and everyone who wants to live deliciously. come for the monsters, stay for the smashing of puritan ideals." —mallory o'meara, bestselling author of the lady from the black lagoon "which is worse? the devil of the forest or the terror of puritan village rumors, accusations, and lies? at the crossroads of victimhood and vengeance, abitha makes her choice—and blood follows." —richard kadrey, bestselling author of the sandman slim series"with echoes of the witch, the crucible, and pan’s labyrinth, brom’s slewfoot is a fast-paced, hallucinogenic fairytale. like many fairy tales, it doesn’t ponder complex ethical questions or bog down in historicity, but it does deliver likable protagonists, exotic beasties, and scoundrels whom we long to see at table with their just desserts." --christopher buehlman, author of the blacktongue thief"if quentin tarantino and guillermo del toro got together to pen a tale about puritans and witches, they could only hope the fruits of their labors would equal slewfoot. i loved this book. a roaring, bloody, beautiful work of pure imagination." --andy davidson, author of the boatman's daughter"brom has made a convert out of me with slewfoot, which takes hold of the maxim 'sympathy for the devil' and yanks hard on that literary taproot, unearthing a far more elemental and complex truth. demon or no, evil or not, the mighty stag slewfoot deserves our love and devotion. he's got mine now. all hail brom, all hail slewfoot!" —clay mcleod chapman, author of the remaking
