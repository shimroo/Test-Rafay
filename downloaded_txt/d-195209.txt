you must know my father, t f stern





i was on
the phone talking with my son on his birthday a little while ago.  the conversation turned to eating out on
valentine’s day.  neither of us had wanted
to take our wives to an overly crowded restaurant and decided to stay home or go
for fast food. i joked that i’d taken lucy to arby’s, a really nice place, one
that had free refills on soda.
i should
explain the joke.  lucy and i’d watched a
television interview where a young woman from the inner city was asked about
the kind of man she considered attractive when it came to dating. she thought
one of the ways to determine a quality date was being taken to a really good
restaurant, one where they didn’t charge for refills.  let that sink in for a moment.
william
acknowledged that arby’s made a pretty good ruben sandwich; but next time we
were in town we should go to victor’s sandwich shop for their ruben’s.  i’d have to agree, victor’s ruben’s was
better.  but that’s not what i wanted to
write about today.
several
years ago…why is it most of my stories start off with, several years ago?  anyway, back when we were still living in olde
oaks we had a family living close by and we would visit with them once a month
as part of what used to be called home teaching, an older version of ministering.  
terrell
hunt was an environmental lawyer as was his wife karen.  they met and hit it off despite social
norms.  it was a mixed marriage; terrell
was white and karen was black.  their
politics tended to lean left, which made it interesting since lucy and i were
more conservative politically.  it didn’t
matter all that much since all of us had a firm testimony of the gospel of
jesus christ and we treated each other as brothers and sisters.  any time we’d be shopping and see her mother,
i’d openly greet her, “hey, mom!”  there
was a special acceptance that permitted such a lighthearted meeting in public.
after a
couple of years of enjoying a mutual friendship, karen had become more
comfortable when we’d come by to visit. 
on one such visit karen explained that she’d been to victor’s sandwich
shop, and you were wondering how victor’s would figure into this; anyway, that
afternoon she went to pick up lunch. there was an informal retirement party going
on for a police officer with all his friends at victor’s sandwich shop.
karen
waded into their merriment and started off with, “you must know my father, t f
stern. he’s a retired cop too.”  mind
you, karen is an attractive middle age black woman and i’m a little past middle
age white guy.  some, if not all the
police officers who were enjoying the moment probably knew me as those words
rumble around in their heads.
one of
them responded with something like, “it must be a different stern from the one
we know”.  the smile on his face must
have been too much fun for karen.
“t f stern
retired a few years ago, you know, he’s also a locksmith, worked night shift
for hpd”.  she didn’t wait even half a
moment as she added, “he met mom when he busted her for prostitution and, well,
they hit it off and here i am.”  
i’d have
paid good money to have been a fly on the wall that day.  karen’s face was all aglow as she related the
encounter that evening.  i’m sure there
are police officers wondering to this day how much of that yarn was true. 
the glue
that holds friends together is, in part, a warped sense of humor and the
ability to bond despite social norms or expectations.
my friend
terrell suffered a major stroke a few years later and died.  this was about the time we moved to our
property in buffalo, texas.  we’ve since
lost track of karen but wanted her to know, she always has a place in her old
dad’s heart.

from approval to disgust in less than an hour





 various
articles get my attention while going down those entered on facebook.  today was no different as i stumbled across a
photograph of a rapper surrounded by five pregnant women, all of whom he had
impregnated.  most folks would grimace at
even the thought of being so reckless, much less bragging about it.  i just laughed, quietly remembering an
experience from many years ago.
i had
walked lucy into the front doors of the maternity section of memorial hospital
out off interstate 10 where the beltway now crosses.  we were about to celebrate the birth of our
second child as i proudly escorted her through the waiting room and left her in
the hands of the nursing staff. 
when i
went to find a chair to spend the rest of the afternoon in, i couldn’t help but
notice there was an older gentleman sitting across from me, probably a wwii
aged veteran.  he had watched as i
escorted lucy, proudly giving her a hug as she disappeared with the nursing
staff.  he gave me a big thumbs up as he
nodded in approval for having stood by my wife during her time of need.
a few
minutes later, it might have been closer to half an hour, my sister-in-law came
to sit by me in the maternity waiting room. 
she was also nine months pregnant as she leaned over to give me a
hug.  the fellow who’d given me a big
thumbs up earlier was no longer thrilled with my having ushered my wife past
the hospital doors.  no, he was decidedly
not thrilled.
it got
even better when my partner’s wife, that being my partner at the police department,
strolled into the maternity waiting room. 
she was also about nine months pregnant as she came over and gave me a hug
in support of our anticipated arrival.  
the look
of disgust from across the room was palpable. 
i’d gone from, “way to go young man”, to, “you low life scum” in less
than an hour.  
fortunately,
i didn’t let my warped sense of humor take over at that moment.  i was tempted to go over and ask the fellow
if he’d like to know more about the book of mormon. i’m sure my bishop would
have been proud of me for remaining silent as well.

it’s 908





while
cranking up my laptop this morning to catch up with email and news items, the
familiar warm-up screen presented itself letting me know what day and time it
was.  you know how us old people can
never be too sure what day of the week it might be, even wondering what year we’re
in.  it was reassuring to see president
ronald reagan addressing the press.a bright
blue screen announced that it was 9:08 on saturday, february 8th.  silly as it might sound, that always brings a
smile to my face.  it’s 908, much more
than telling me what time it might be; 908 was the badge number on the blue
uniform i wore as a police officer for the city of houston until i retired in
1992.
when working
the near west side of town in the montrose area, there was a young vendor who
frequented some of the same places i liked to visit for lunch.  i couldn’t say what his product was other
than he got around on a bicycle instead of a motor vehicle. he was a pleasant
individual whose lifestyle was a bit different than my own; nothing too wild,
just that he made it a point to let me know i was considerably more
conservative.
his greeting
was genuine each time we’d cross paths, “it’s nine oh eight!”, as if he didn’t
see my name tag, only my badge.  i’d
smile back and we’d continue our acknowledgment of each other.  i’d go on to explain that the local banker and
i were good friends, that each day he’d flash my badge number up on a big sign
atop his bank, once in the morning and then again in the evening.  he’d smile while shaking his head at such a
dumb response.
so, yes,
anytime i see a clock display the time, 9:08, i smile and remember having worn
the uniform, having stored so many memories and been able to share them with
folks who might enjoy a momentary distraction.

reality checks and bad habits





 while
watching the movie, a beautiful mind, there was an interesting exchange between
a fellow named martin who was interviewing professor john nash to see if he
might be an embarrassment were he to be awarded a nobel prize due to his
documented life of mental issues which included a full-time cast of imaginary
characters.  when asked about the
possibility of becoming an embarrassment, john responded, “i’m still crazy”, then
he added an important thought regarding his never-ending struggle to separate
imaginary individuals from reality.
“they are
my past. everyone is haunted by their past.” 
we all
have issues that would be embarrassing were they to be brought out on the
public stage. i suppose it would make a huge difference if that public stage
were broadcast to a worldwide audience as would be the case with accepting a
nobel prize.
nash then
clarified his ability to fit in with society, despite his ongoing mental issues.

“i’ve
gotten used to ignoring them, and i think, as a result, they’ve kind of given
up on me. i think that’s what it’s like with all our dreams and our nightmares,
martin. we’ve got to keep feeding them for them to stay alive.” 
that one
line could be applied to most of the bad habits we might have picked up over
the years.  it doesn’t eliminate bad
habits; however, it does place it into an isolation room, a place where bad habits
are less likely to be a daily challenge.
i remember
back in the mid-1970s being told by a doctor that because of having a collapsed
lung (spontaneous pneumothorax) i had to quit smoking cigarettes.  that was a bad habit i’d had for years, and i’d
tried quitting without success.  being
faced with a rather bleak future, were i to continue smoking, it was much
easier to place the urge to smoke in an isolation room way back in my mind
where it could be ignored. 
i took up
chewing tobacco as an alternative, dipping skoal was a natural extension of my
newest bad habit.  being crude and not
really caring about what anyone thought of my bad habit was an unexpected bonus.  if you wanted someone unpleasant to leave,
just spit and without much fanfare the individual would find an excuse to
leave.
then in
1978, when i was about to join the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints,
the missionaries teaching me of various rules and customs informed me about the
“word of wisdom” as found in the doctrine and covenants, section 89.  turns out tobacco products were not to be
used for smoking or chewing.  
some folks
would have had a problem deciding how to proceed.  would they continue using tobacco products
and ignore the newly discovered admonition to abstain or would they accept
reality, join the church and live in such a way as to be in accordance with the
will of the lord?
the young
missionaries were a bit surprised when i reached into the refrigerator for a
newly purchased roll of skoal that i’d purchased the day before.  upon handing the skoal over to them i
explained that i’d just quit and for them to do me a favor and dispose of it
for me.  i later found that they’d tossed
the skoal over the edge of a bridge into the bayou below while on their way
home.
as far as
my former bad habits regarding smoking or dipping skoal, “i’ve gotten used to
ignoring them, and i think, as a result, they’ve kind of given up on me.”

parrot and the plumber





 i thought
i’d written this story down years ago; but it isn’t in my files.  either it was misplaced or filed under a
title that didn’t match up with my memory. 
the cartoon image posted on facebook reminded me of something that
happened back in 1979 or 1980 soon after joining the church of jesus christ of
latter-day saints.
back then
there was a program called home teaching, basically ministering to members by
assignment in the hope that each would feel connected to the ward through a
monthly visit. i had an elderly woman under my stewardship and learned that she
was dating a fellow who was deaf. from what i could figure, she intended to
take the relationship to a higher level and perhaps even marriage.
the idea
occurred to me that i should take steps toward being able to communicate with
this fellow in order to more effectively complete the home teaching assignment.  that led me to find out where to take a
course in american sign language (asl). 
it turned out such a course was offered via the houston community
college that used the waltrip high school building for night classes; that was
only a couple of miles from our house in oak forest where we were living at the
time.
i can’t
remember if there was a charge to take the course, more than likely; but it
must have been nominal or i wouldn’t have gone forward with taking the class.  i showed up at 6:45pm for a class that was
scheduled to start at 7:00pm.  before
entering the classroom, i noticed several pink slips stuck to the frame
indicating classes which failed to meet the required number of students and
would be cancelled.  i didn’t see asl as
one of the cancelled classes and so i went in, finding there were only two
other individuals who’d showed up as yet.
i took a
seat behind them while continuing to wonder if this was the class for asl since
neither of them seemed to notice my entrance. 
i quietly asked, “is this the class for asl?”  there was no reaction from either; “must be”
was the thought that came to mind as i let out a soft chuckle.
the asl
class was a hoot from day one.  i learned
the alphabet along with a smattering of commonly used signs with each new lesson.  the instructor, make that instructors, since
members of the deaf community often gave the lessons that were wonderfully
entertaining; almost as if this were a late night television show.  they passed along jokes that could be made
along with cautions to avoid making signs near your nose as those often-had
sexual implications.
we were
encouraged to attend a deaf community’s performance of some russian play that
was put on at a small theater near washington avenue.  i’ll admit up front that most of the
performance went way over my ability to read their spelling of russian names
that flashed by me eyes so quickly as to be a blur.  
there was
a final exam that we needed to take to obtain a passing mark in the class.  we were to stand in front of everyone and
give a talk about anything we felt comfortable with, using only those signs we’d
learned in class.  i thought about what i
could talk about for a few minutes during the week prior to the scheduled exam.  that’s when i remembered a couple of the long-winded
jokes my father would drop on us while we were a captive audience driving
toward a vacation spot.  dad could draw
out a joke for a very long time, miles and miles of texas roads to work with
gave him all the time in the world to drop a really lame joke on all of us.
let’s see,
which one would be a good fit?  there’s
the ‘beer that made bill famous walk me’? no, how about the ‘cush maker’? no,
even that’s too lame; what about the ‘parrot and the plumber’?  bingo! that one could last at least four
minutes.
the night
of the exam we found out the judges would all be from the deaf community.  they’d determine if we’d learned enough to
pass the course.  
i stood up
in front of the classroom and began explaining about the plumber who had to
walk up several floors carrying his heavy toolbox to reach the apartment where
his customer was waiting.  upon reaching
the top of the stairs and being nearly exhausted, he knocked on the door. 
the customer
apparently was not in the apartment; however, there was a trained parrot who
inquired, “who is it?”  
“it’s the
plumber”, came the response.  waiting for
the customer to open the door and waiting some more since the customer wasn’t
in the apartment, the plumber again knocked on the door a bit more forcefully
this time.
“who is
it?”  the parrot inquired as the scenario
played out time and time again to use up the required number of minutes in
front of the deaf community.  i could
tell from the positive responses on the judges faces that my dad’s joke was
being well received.
getting to
the punch line, the plumber’s frustration culminated in his having a heart
attack and dropping to the floor outside the apartment door.  the paramedics arrived to treat the man and were
asking if anyone knew who he was.  the
parrot quickly responded, “it’s the plumber”.
i passed
the test according to the judges from the deaf community.  one of them came over to me expressing his
delight in my story about the talking butterfly.  you guessed right, i’d used the wrong sign all
through the entire joke.
oh, in
case you were wondering; that dear sister didn’t continue her relationship with
the deaf fellow.  i’d had a lot of fun
getting to learn asl and used those skills only sparingly over the years, to
the point of nearly forgetting most of what i may have learned so long ago.

between three and five worked





 yesterday
the check engine light came on in our hyundai sonata while we were driving near
palestine, texas.  we didn’t panic as we
were only a mile or so away from walmart where they have an automotive department.  they checked things out and found we were a
quart low on oil and suggested that rather than add a quart, perhaps it might
be better to do an oil change, replace the filter and check all the fluid
levels.  that sounded reasonable and we
handed them the key while we went inside the store to purchase some sneakers
and blue jeans.  they were finished
before we had even cleared the cash register.
the check
engine light was still blinking; but the fellow said that it didn’t appear to
be associated with anything major.   that
didn’t sound too reassuring so we decided to drive to o’reilly’s on our way
home where they could put their fancy computer diagnostic thingy on and tell us
exactly what was wrong.  
there was
definitely something wrong as we couldn’t get the car to accelerate properly.  we managed to get the car up to sixty-one
miles per hour; but no further.  the
speed limit on the road between palestine and buffalo is 70mph; going only
61mph made the hair on my back stand up.
the fancy
diagnostic thingy didn’t give much of an answer, only that it might be several
items that only the hyundai folks would be able to fix; but…and this was something
of a peace of mind moment…the car could be driven down to houston without
damaging anything, just no faster than 61 miles per hour.
it should
be noted that here in texas, if the speed limit reads seventy-five then folks
interpret that to mean eighty to eighty-five. 
folks in a hurry or just bored tend to push that up to 90 or 95mph which
tends to be the speed where the dps steps in and reminds them to be a little
less aggressive. anyone going less than 70mph is fair game for abuse or
worse.  
i decided the
best way to get the car into houston with the least amount of abuse would be to
wait until all the bars had closed before heading toward the freeway entrance
in centerville. this strategy was gained from working as a night shift police
officers; most drunk drivers have either been arrested for dwi, hit a tree and
gone to the hospital or gotten home before 3am.
i hit the
on ramp headed south just before 3am going exactly 61mph.  traffic was very light, mostly commercial
trucks that were widely spaced.  i figured
i could be on the north side of houston near the hyundai dealership before morning
rush hour started around 5am.
most of
the time while tooling on down the freeways the idea of having so many 18
wheelers to contend with wasn’t one of my favorite choices; but since these
trucks are, for the most part, driven by professional drivers who know the
rules of the road, then having them escort my crippled car down to houston was
just what the doctor ordered.
when i’d
see headlights moving up from behind at a quarter mile or so, i’d flip on the
emergency flashers for a few moments and then switch them off.  then, as the headlights got closer, i’d flip
the flashers on again so they’d figure out i was having some kind of
issue.  they were courteous, using blinkers
and moving over as they passed.  i
flashed my high beams letting them know they’d cleared sufficiently to return
to the slower lane.  this went on all the
way until i reached conroe or about an hour and a half from when i left centerville.
there must
be something about getting into a major metropolitan area that brings out the
beasts.  i had to be extra careful as
mario andretti’s kin folk darted in and out from behind large trucks that were
only going 75mph.  i had no idea that
many race car drivers were up practicing impromptu lane changes at half past
four in the morning.  
i arrived
at denny’s at 5am, right across from the hyundai dealership where i had my
appointment scheduled for 7am.  i managed
to loosen my grip on the steering wheel long enough to let the blood flow back
into those fingers.  
it’s hard
to beat a grand slam breakfast after passing the advanced driver’s test in
texas.  it was quite peaceful catching a
nap in the parking lot there at the hyundai service department waiting for the
sun to come up and be greeted once they opened for business.

another dr pepper if you please





some gifts
keep on giving long after first being shared. 
for example, this morning, as part of a habit after taking my vitamins,
i tore off a page of the calendar which has a trivia message as part of the
incentive to keep up to date.  if i’d taken
my vitamins, i get to read that day’s trivia.
today i
read, “vending machines kill more people than sharks per year”.
i was
reminded of an old police incident involving the “killer dr pepper machine”.  some of this incident was included in an
unpublished novel, pecaw’s gift; but that’s a whole other story as they say
around here.  
upon using
the search engine on an older thumb drive i was surprised to find my field
training officer’s (fti) report, the original as sent to the police academy
while a probationary police officer (ppo) was in training. if memory serves,
the rookie officer was dan starr, a fine officer and well worth having as a
friend all these years.
there were
25 areas of interest that needed to be addressed on a regular basis, documented
to show the department had fulfilled its obligation to properly train each
rookie police officer; his or her knowledge of laws, procedures, familiarity
with locations, map use and so on, each item matching a given number 1 – 25. 
it was fun
reading the summary as it was written, not complete sentences; but sufficient
information to cover the training.
 
self
initiated investigation accidental death of a juvenile 1601
pech
at 01:47 hrs. # 56396886.  fti heard call being dispatched
to
unit 5f22 and had ppo volunteer to take it (3,12,13,17,25). 
ppo
was familiar with the location (10) and drove to it in
reasonable
amount of time.  fti and ppo arrived to find that an
attempt
had been made to burglarize a soda machine but that the
machine
had fallen on one of the suspects causing his immediate
death
(6). ppo talked to hfd and determined that it was necessary
to
call the me and juv.  ppo was given instruction over the phone
as
to how to investigate and protect the crime scene (23).  fti
called
for csu and protected the scene while ppo was on the
phone. 
ppo talked with witness/(suspect) to determine what had
happened.   ppo showed good judgment and command bearing
while
interviewing
both family members and other police officers who
were
at the scene (1,4,24).  ppo kept extensive notes so that he
would
be able to make a report later on.  ppo and fti had to hold
back
the mother of the dead juvenile when she arrived to keep
her
from disturbing the body (22).  after the scene was secure
and
all the other support units had conducted their investigation
ppo
and fti transported "witness" to central so that he could
make
his sworn statement.  fti and ppo stood at a safe distance
to
avoid being stuck by lightning when statement was signed (4).
ppo
then finished his report (14,15,16). ppo left off weather
on
the front of report and also that the soda machine was a
damaged
article.  ppo then took the complete report to records
so
that it could be entered into the system right away (5). ppo
and
fti then took witness home and completed the call (18).  ppo
stated
he understood what was needed in homicide reports (2).
ppo
also looked up locations in key map (9)._____________
 
i’m told the
family of the deceased young man, the suspected burglar of a coin operated
machine, the one who got crushed under the soda machine; his family tried to
sue for damages on the grounds the soda machine had not been properly secured
to keep it from tipping over.  i never
bothered to find out if that information was accurate or not; i was too busy
laughing.
