good weather  / good timing guarantee!
      some folks like sun; some folks like rain; some folks like wind. and   sometimes things just happen that prevent you from using a reservation   you have made with us. we guarantee the weather you like! if you   reserve a space at abrams creek, and the weather doesn't suit you, or   for any other reason you cannot use the reservation you have made, let   us know, and you can apply those funds to a reservation any time in the   future here at abrams creek (major holiday periods excepted). 
      
      this   option is in addition to our regular cancellation policy.
