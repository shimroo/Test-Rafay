rare cancer support

the support area of our website offers rare cancer and tumor patients
several ways to find support. you may choose to join one of our many online support groups (see below, bottom) where you will find a safe environment for sharing information and mutual support.  our most up-to-date, extensive, online and offline resources can be found in these patient and survivor groups.
the cancer stories links will allow you to read about others with your cancer. you will find practical advice on helping yourself and finding support in some creative ways, including
starting a support group for your cancer, in the self support links.
the giving support links are extremely important to the growth of this website. a simple task, like distributing rca's flyer, can help another cancer patient. as author, webmaster, and maintainer of this website; i am grossly underpaid (free) and overworked and i can use all the help i can get! i need volunteers in all areas. please consider volunteering.
the research funds that i have listed are for medical research only. i welcome new additions to this page. in the purchase items link is 'in construction'. eventually it will house ways that will allow you to buy and sell items and have a portion of the proceeds go to rare cancer research.
