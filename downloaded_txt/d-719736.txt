important changes (rev. oct. 2020) - please read




if you are a resident of washington state, your 
northwest chess subscription includes a state chess 
membership. for wcf (washington) membership options, please continue to use this website. 
all wcf memberships are considered "premium," and include 
benefits such as free registration to certain seminars.
if you are a resident of oregon, your northwest chess 
subscription to paper copies includes a "premium" ocf state 
membership. you can also choose a "basic" ocf membership with 
online-only access to nwc magazine. for now, you should contact 
ocf directly if you want this option. also see the
ocf website.
for idaho (ica) membership options, please visit the 
ica website. 
these options include a "premium" membership with a nwc subscription.
for new subscriptions and renewals, 
nwc no longer guarantees that there will continue to be 12 
printed magazines each year. there could be 
fewer editions, and/or publication could be in an online format. 
at present, we expect that printed magazines will continue to be available 
for all 2025-dated editions.

in 2018, the nwc board decided to add "foundation" to its corporate 
name, becoming the northwest chess foundation. we will completely update the 
website once this name is officially registered with the state of washington 
and the irs. this does not affect the name of the magazine - it's still northwest chess!
