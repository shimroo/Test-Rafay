about himalayan rescue association
                        nepal
the himalayan rescue association (hra) is a voluntary non-profit organization formed in
                    1973 with an objective to reduce casualties in the nepal himalayas, especially keeping in view the
                    increasing number of nepalese and foreigners who trek up into the remote wilderness.
one of the most important tasks of the hra is to try to prevent deaths from acute
                    mountain sickness that confronts foreign trekkers and nepali people. for the last 43 years, the hra
                    has helped make a safer himalaya for tourism. since its inscection, it has manned a small aid post
                    in the khumbu village of pheriche at an altitude of 14,343 feet. the pheriche aid-post is manned
                    twice yearly during the trekking season by volunteer doctors.

2023-2026




it brings me great pleasure and joy to mention that the himalayan rescue association nepal has reached a milestone of 50 years of outstanding service. firstly, i want to express my gratitude to the members and supporters of hra for their trust in me and for electing me as the chairman of the association without any opposition. this year, as we celebrate our golden jubilee, i want to assure you that hra will continue to do excellent work in the mountains of nepal. we will continuously improve the medical facilities at our aid post in manang, pheriche, and the everest-er medical camp at everest basecamp. this is a commitment i make to you. hra has always supported the efforts of the nepal government in the himalayas, especially when it comes to providing medical care and ensuring safety in the mountains. as part of the current executive committee, we are dedicated to maintaining positive relationships with all embassies and consulates in nepal, following the guidance of the moctca's department of tourism.
