have questions? we’ve got answers
      
    








                      how will i get the most accurate internet speed test results?
                    




                    for the most accurate result, connect your device directly to your router using an ethernet
                    cable (if possible), disconnect from any vpns, and avoid using video or music streaming apps
                    while running the test.
                  






                      should i turn off other devices when doing the internet speed test?
                    




                    yes, to get a more accurate reading you should limit your use of the internet while conducting
                    the test. this includes turning off devices that are connected as well as not using your
                    computer or device while running the test.
                  






                      what does an internet speed test actually measure?
                    




                    verizon’s speed test checks how fast information travels from our servers to your device.
                    results are often lower than plan speeds due to wi-fi
                    conditions and device capabilities. this test is intended to measure results on your home
                    network, and should not be used on public wi-fi or cellular networks.
                  






                      is there a wi-fi speed test?
                    




                    you can use the test above to test your wi-fi connection. if your speed comes back slow, try
                    getting closer to the router or connecting your device to the router with an ethernet cable.
                    wired connections (by ethernet cable) are generally faster than wi-fi connections.
                  






                      will the wi-fi test also check wifi signal strength?
                    




                    no. wi-fi signal strength is different from internet speed. to learn more about your wi-fi
                    signal strength and troubleshoot problems, visit our support pages.
                  






                      what’s the difference between an upload speed test and a download speed test?
                    




                    you use the internet to both send and receive information. the download speed score shows how
                    long it takes to download or receive information, while the upload test measures how long it
                    takes to send information through the internet. our speed test measures and reports on both.
                  






                      what are good upload and download speeds?
                    




                    the fcc’s
                    standard for broadband internet is a download speed of at least 25
                    mbps and upload speed of at least 3 mbps. but the best way to determine how much speed you
                    need is to think about your data needs. the average household now has 25 connected devices,
                    from laptops and smartphones to smart tvs, headphones and gaming consoles. with so many
                    devices, faster speeds and more bandwidth work
                    best. explore verizon’s speed plans and see what internet options are
                    available in your area.
                  






                      what else might impact my internet speed?
                    




                    there are several factors that might affect your internet speed, including how many devices
                    you have connected, whether you’re using wi-fi or an ethernet cable, and even the device
                    you’re using to connect. see a full
                      list of factors that affect your internet speed.
