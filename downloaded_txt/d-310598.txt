how to open the first paragraph
you don't need to say much about yourself. it's better to say something you know about that employer and what there is about them that interests you.

what to do to prepare for tough questions
practice, practice, practice.make all your mistakes first with someone you know. give them the tough questions you might anticipate and answer with honesty and courage. keep practicing until you get comfortable with being able to admit there are things you just don't know. gracious, humble people are an asset in the workforce.

knowing how high to reach
some jobs have fixed salaries with no wiggle room. others would like to look that way, but they have some room to push the envelope. find out in the first interview what the "range" is. most importantly, don't answer the question in any direct way about what salary you will accept. if you get this question, say that you have a range, depending on a number of factors. then throw the range question back at them.don't get stuck in any salary negotiating until an offer is imminent.

do i need more to write than one resume ?
yes, absolutely. you should have a basic "set" of facts about yourself and your skills in a generic resume, and then you arrange the emphasis of skills (and other important information) according to the needs of the specific employer.
