                                        this order was for my sister clara hall on her 96th birthday. she is in a nursing home.
you say the order was delivered, but was it delivered to her?
or was it delivered to the nursing home? i wonder whether she actually received the flowers. i'd appreciate a response.

florist's response:

hello bill,
  i personally delivered the flower to the nursing home . it’s a locked building and i was let in and there was one of the employees that asked who they were for and o told them and they took them from me . i did not have an option to deliver them to her room . if they say she did not recieve them please let me know and i will call over there and talk to the nursing home manager . the person who took them even said how beautiful they were. 
    regards ,
  randy

                                        my friend loved the flowers.  i am from milwaukee and chose your shop because of your website and the unusual floral designs at reasonable prices.  the chase is just a mile away from my friend's home so i knew the flowers would be fresh.  

she loved them so much that now she is going to be a customer of yours when she needs to send flowers!

randy



                hi! i’m randy, the owner of the artistry florist. this floral studio started in 1983 as a “little flower shop” with the sole inspiration and goal being that i loved to make people happy via beautiful flowers. i had very little floral experience and if you ask my parents, they will agree, they have no idea where this talent and passion came from. but here i am thirty three years later with an amazing company that is so much more than a business. who knew that one tiny floral arrangement would blossom (yes, pun intended) into a phenomenal design studio with such a strong presence in st. louis. every day i marvel at the fact that i am so fortunate to have built such incredible relationships with so many of our clients. they allow us to make floral magic happen in their homes, for their weddings, special events and oh, don’t get me started on the gorgeous hotels i get to visit every week! creating floral arrangements that make so many people smile is truly a joy and an honor.

sharing this joy with my talented staff here at artistry florist makes this entire gig even better. i would not be here today without all of them…their dedication and astonishing creative talents amaze me daily and i am truly blessed to share this floral journey with all of them. it fills me with joy to see how they love artistry like i do and it definitely shows in every design, delivery and client interaction they have. whether they are delivering flowers for someone’s special day, setting up for a gorgeous wedding or decorating and accentuating mind-blowing hotel lobbies, they give our clients 110 percent.

when i’m not with my second family, you will probably find me with my incredibly supportive husband traveling to california and surrounded by our son and our loving parents.
