the landowners and i have designated a limited number of hunters per season, on each lease, to guarantee a non-crowded, highly productive hunting environment. we have properties with on-site lodging, or if you wish, you can stay in a hotel in the nearest town. the use of atvs is permitted and encouraged on all our hunting leases.
choose from one of several colorado ranches for elk hunting and deer hunting in game management units (aka hunt units) 4, 15, 23, 25, 26, 65, 81, and 211. depending on the lease, we have 4-6 hunters per group, for each of the rifle hunting seasons. we do not mix hunting groups. prices range from $2,500 - $3,500 per hunter. we collect one-half of the hunter fee as a deposit, and then we send you a contract for e-signature. in late july, we will send you an invoice for the remaining balance, which is due before september 1st.
