restoration techniques from professionals, find rare parts to help you fix your 
car, share your experience with others, and meet fun people from your area and

     the adirondack chapter is 
geographically located in upstate new york with members from as far south as 
newburg, n.y. and as far north as watertown . 

n.y. adirondack chapter activities include social events such as an annual 
formal dinner, bimonthly breakfast brunches, summer picnic, road tours, judging 
schools, and technical sessions. additionally, the adirondack chapter provides a 
meeting place for all chapter members who attend corvettes @ carlisle, the 
largest corvette only swap meet and car display in the usa. the chapter reserves 
two vendor spaces annually, 1-137 & 1-138, where chapter members can sell 
used or nos parts, relax, get out of the sun or rain, and socialize under the 
chapter canopy. all these chapter activities are scheduled around national and
