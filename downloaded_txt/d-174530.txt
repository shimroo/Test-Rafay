[interview] photography was a critical marketing    tool for financing with  transcontinental    railroad bonds – both    the cprr and uprr hired photographers to    document the progress of construction,    producing the numerous    stereoviews which now illustate this website. the camera    equipment of the day was so large and    heavy that a photo    wagon was needed. wet    glass plate collodion negatives    had to be produced in the field, required long exposures, and albumen    paper required    20 minutes in sunlight to make photo prints. today's digital cameras by comparison    are a marvel — to select the best camera to create photographs for    the cprr museum website, we found invaluable the extensive reviews on a    great site for digital cameras, digital camera hq.     © 1999-2025 cprr.org – by visiting this site you agreeto the terms of the cprr.org useragreement. permission to browse this website is contingent on acceptanceof the user agreement.          freight train rounding capehorn, 2487' elevation. (watkins' new cabinet series,detail).
