exclusive sailing experiences 




enjoy the best days of the year with a clear conscience and positive feeling: for more than 40 years, we have been pursuing the principle of sustainable tourism. traveling with a small number of guests creates space for great things. meeting people at eye-level in the countries you visit, experiencing cultures, appreciating regional values and creating added value for the
region. this is pointing the way ahead because it is in keeping with the times. because we are firmly convinced that traveling in harmony with nature is possible and necessary.
