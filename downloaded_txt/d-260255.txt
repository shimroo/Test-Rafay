history of basic west insurance

basic west insurance agency has been providing comprehensive insurance services since 1946.

our founder ben a. savelli was a world war ii veteran who graduated from uc berkeley and used his passion for sales in the insurance business.  he took a post war $5000 government business loan granted to returning servicemen and turned it into a thriving, multi-generational business. 

we were founded in the heart of san francisco and are currently located in the sunset district.  we remain family owned and operated, and continue to serve the san francisco bay area and beyond.
