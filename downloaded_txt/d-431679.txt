dc universe online! - 01/11/11





[eddy]the dc universe online game is out today and it's great to see it finally in-stores after 5+ years of work from concept art to cut scenes and everything in-between. the amount of detail and coordination that goes into a game like this is just staggering and i'm very proud to have had a tiny role in the whole thing!above is the official launch trailer that has a taste of the incredible cinematic trailer and actual gameplay too. after that, are just a few of the dynamic cut scenes illustrated by the wildstorm artists and i can't begin to say how awesome it is to see this finally come to life and into homes everywhere.thanks to jim and all the guys at wildstorm and sony online entertainment for a mind-numbingly cool fanboy experience!

rest in peace, irvin kershner





[livio] the world lost a great director last week with the passing of irvin kershner, the man who gave us "the empire strikes back." if you ever get a chance to read an interview with him, you'll rarely find a more intelligent, thoughtful and caring person. not to mention, a guy who really knew how to create atmospheric locations and stage amazing shots. i missed out on a chance to meet mr. kershner at a recent comic-con when his illness tragically forced his cancellation of attending the show. i had a feeling at the time that it would be my last chance to meet him, and this turned out to be true. though i did get to see lando calrissian himself, mr. billy dee williams, at the same convention. and this was a pretty great experience in its own right. i did this lando piece in an attempt to portray one of the human characters of star wars. the likeness is based on some photo reference of the main man himself. "empire" is a constant source of inspiration for me, and i thank irvin kershner for making such a great film.-livio

dream, death and friends





[oliver]hey ya'lls, here's a piece that i finally finished after working on it here and there for the past year. it's of my fave death and dream (my first time taking a crack at him) from sandman, which in recent months i've finally started to read thanks to the newly reprinted trades of the series.it was mainly done for fun and practice of some new techniques and styles with cool and warm gray markers and various inking tools, on a 15x20 hardstock art board. anyhoo, hope you like;)

sequentials








[oliver]hey ya'lls, since the blog posts have been nothing but pin-ups for a long time now i just wanted to post some recent sequential work. i did these five 'red robin' pages for fun and practice over the past week and a half at home after work.i gave myself deadlines on the pages and only allowed a certain amount of time spent per page to keep me on my toes.for all of you aspiring comic artists out there, please don't let the fact that you have a full-time day job discourage you from going home and drawing! even if you only draw a few hours a night, it all adds up and next thing you know you have sequential pages to show editors and those pages can be your big break. make sure to check back in the next few weeks for more sequentials. ;)
