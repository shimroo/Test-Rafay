mishmash web site 

mishmash is a web site i created when i was attending my master’s program at johns hopkins in the mid-nineties.  i was using an html editor.  after completing my master’s program, i took a course in html and started doing my own html coding.  i had quite a bit of content on my site.  a few years ago, i took a course in wordpress.  i upgraded both of my web sites to wordpress.  i have since created two web sites for my amateur radio club and developed my amateur radio site quite well.  the problem is that my old content i had created on mishmash.com is quite dated now.  i have made the decision to forego restoring all of that old content.  the only two pages i thought were worth keeping i have already put here.  i looked on my ipad and realized i have over four thousand images.  they would be some good site resources for mishmash.  so, i am going to try to create at least two new pages per month with those images.  if i can stay on track, i can get this site to grow.  
countdown to new president!
