gogle.com

gogle.com is visited by many internet users who are actually looking for google.com! are these people making a spelling mistake or typing error? or is it because of something else? this website discusses each possibility in details. (disclaimer: the following discussion may not be accurate anymore once any of the facts used to support the discussion changes.)






 please help us to understand how often internet surfers type wrongly in a search box when they are actually looking for google.com. thanks.   (  polls)



how can people reach gogle.com? there are three ways:



by typing 'gogle.com' in the address bar of their internet browser
possibility no. 1
														he/she is in fact looking for gogle.com.
possibility no. 2
														he/she is making a spelling mistake or typing error.



by typing' gogle.com' in the search box of a search engine
possibility no. 1
														he/she is in fact looking for gogle.com.
possibility no. 2
														he/she is making a spelling mistake or typing error.



by typing only the word 'gogle' in the search box of a search engine.
possibility no. 1
														he/she is in fact looking for gogle.com.
possibility no. 2
														he/she is making a spelling mistake or typing error.
possibility no. 3
														he/she is looking for gogle with a domain extension other than dot com like gogle.net, gogle.org, gogle.info, gogle.biz, gogle.co.uk, gogle.ca, gogle.tv, gogle.us, gogle.mobi etc.












general rule: if a person with a reasonable mind writes or types a word that has no meaning or does not exist at all, it can be due to two reasons respectively. either that word is a spelling mistake or typing error (possibility no. 2) or it is a word which he believes to exist (possibility no.1 and no. 3).  

now, we examine each possibility in details.

possibility no. 1: he/she is in fact looking for gogle.com.

											gogle.com actually redirects visitors to google.com. that is to say, this group of internet users does not even bother the difference between gogle.com or google.com. they just think that gogle.com and google.com are the same. option 1 of the poll above illustrates how often you can find someone who belongs to this group of internet users.


possibility no. 2: he/she is making a spelling mistake or typing error.

											popular online dictionaries like answers.com and thefreedictionary.com return no meaning for the word, gogle. words that can possibly be spelled or typed wrongly as gogle include google, goggle, goglet and gogel. according to  wikipedia.com, gogle is a common misspelling of google. since google is a word that is so much more popular than words like goggle, goglet and gogel, it is strongly believed that google is the word that has been spelled or typed wrongly as gogle. option 2 of the poll above illustrates how often you can find someone who belongs to this group of internet users.


possibility no. 3: he/she is looking for gogle with a domain extension other than gogle.com

some examples of other domain extensions are gogle.net, gogle.org, gogle.info, gogle.biz, gogle.co.uk, gogle.ca, gogle.tv, gogle.us, gogle.mobi etc.

											it is also interesting to know the history of gogle.com as well. below are a few dates showing how gogle.com looked like at that time.

oct 19, 2000, may 16, 2001, nov 23, 2002, dec 27, 2003, dec 30, 2004, dec 31, 2005, dec 11, 2006, aug 02, 2007, now

by comparing the history and current website of gogle.com with those of other domain extensions, it is submitted as a personal opinion that it is highly unlikely that an internet user will look for any other domain extensions of gogle other than gogle.com. in other words, possibility no. 3 will not really happen.


conclusion:

											only possibility no. 1 and 2 are applicable to internet users who visited gogle.com. 

possibility no. 1 is represented by option 1 of the poll above: i typed correctly in a search box and found this web page. i typed 'gogle' or 'gogle.com' and was actually looking for gogle.com. this group of internet users does not even bother the difference between gogle.com or google.com. either one will bring them to the same google.com.

possibility no. 2 is represented by option 2 of the poll above: i typed wrongly in a search box and found this web page. i typed 'gogle' or 'gogle.com' but was actually looking for google.com. this group of internet users has spelled or typed google or google.com wrongly as gogle or gogle.com respectively.

											in summary, anyone who visits gogle.com whether he/she has typed 'gogle' or 'gogle.com' correctly or wrongly, his or her original intention is to look for google.com.
