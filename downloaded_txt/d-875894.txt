about us



we believe in the complete working rottweiler - health, conformation, 
	character, working ability, versatility, intelligence, courage, desire to please 
	and willingness to work. we adhere to the 
	fci breed standard for the rottweiler. 
	we are members of the usrc (united states rottweiler club), 
	adrk (allgemeiner deutscher rottweiler-klub), 
	usca (united schutzhund clubs of america), 
	swdt sherwood dog training club and tmda (tri mountain 
	dogsport association) - a usrc member club. 
	we are an akc breeder of merit. we strictly adhere to the 
	usrc breeding regulations and membership agreement.

	we believe the best rottweilers in the world are bred in germany, the birthplace of the rottweiler 
	and the adrk has preserved the true rottweiler through their selective and controlled breeding 
	practices - by only breeding dogs that have been tested in temperament and working ability 
	by obtaining a minimum of a bh and ztp (zuchttauglichkeitspruefung) as well in health by being tested 
	for hip and elbow dysplasia. our dogs are german imports or direct descendants of german imports 
	out of our own breeding program.




	all of our dogs must have the appropriate ofa 
	health certifications for this breed and meet our standards in both conformation and temperament. our dogs 
	are selected and bred for the purpose of betterment of the breed, proving themselves 
	on the 
	schutzhund field, the obedience ring and the show ring. we actively train, trial and show 
	our dogs in many different venues which enables us to accurately and honestly evaluate our 
	dogs and our breeding program.

we selectively breed litters out of the highest quality dogs to produce top quality 
	rottweiler puppies. our goal is to produce 
	excellent rottweilers that consistently exceed expectations. we specifically breed for health, 
	temperament, type, versatility and working ability to produce balanced puppies suitable for show, 
	work or companion. puppies from our breeding are akc registered and sold with health guarantees.


	we occasionally have adult or youth rottweilers 
	for sale. we offer limited stud services to qualified females including shipping of fresh chilled 
	of frozen semen from our rottweiler stud dogs. 
	we also have a limited quantity of frozen semen 
	available from accomplished rottweiler stud dogs from the past. we are active in rottweiler rescue 
	and occasionally have rescue dogs available 
	for adoption.




	quality doesn't happen by accident, it is only through careful selection of genetically sound breeding 
	partners from many generations of proven dogs that a breeder can be assured they are producing specific 
	desirable traits. a "breeder" must be dedicated to the standard of the breed in character, conformation, 
	health and working ability. that is what breeding is all about.


	whether you are looking for a well bred, quality rottweiler for show, work, sport, service, 
	protection or a well bred, quality family companion, we can help select a rottweiler that will 
	be right for you. 


	we have been raising, training, showing and trialing rottweilers since 1983.
