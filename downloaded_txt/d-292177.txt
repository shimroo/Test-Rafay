								if you like golf podcasts, hack it out is tough to beat. lots of interesting info and it's very funny.Â  lou is one of the hosts along with greg chalmers and mark crossfield.Â  they love to give each other a hard time.Â  lou catches most of it, but he takes it well and dishes out his fair share.Â  great show.

 "5 minutes daily" practice challenge
by 


williet Â· 9 hours ago

								day 25 (15 feb 25) -Â a little background on todayâ€™s drill session. Â on the way to band rehearsal this morning i was listening to the guys on pga tour radio in the golf school segment and they got to talking about short game practice. Â as i love working that part of the game, my ears perked up. Â they were talking taking multiple clubs and doing pitches/chips from the same distance and learning how each flies the ball. Â so today was the start of the 8p54 drill (8i - pw - 54Â°).Â Â  set it up to hit two balls with each club from the same lie to a set distance. Â it really helps envision what i should see in each club. Â a sweet new twist to a fave drill. Â
