we believe welsh ponies and cobs are
the perfect equine for every member of the family.  welsh ponies and
cobs excel in nearly every equestrian discipline, plus their charming personalities
will win your heart.  welsh ponies and cobs range in size from about
11 hands in section a welsh ponies, up to 16 hand welsh cobs, which means
nearly everyone can find the welsh pony or welsh cob that is just right
for them!
