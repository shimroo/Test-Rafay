welcome to
ufowisconsin.com

ufowisconsin.com has many goals.  two of our foremost are to
further the awareness of the ufo phenomenon and to track the ufos
in our state's skies. here at ufowisconsin, you can report a ufo with
our easy online ufo reporting form, view our free ufo reports database
(both recent and archived ufo reports), get the latest on ufo news, see
ufo pictures & videos, find local ufo groups and hangouts, learn
about ufo's in wisconsin, and more, all in one place! unfortunately we
do not have the resources to investigate every sighting; if you are a
ufo investigator and are interested in following up on any of our ufo
reports, please send an email to: "director @ ufowisconsin.com" to
discuss the possibilities.
