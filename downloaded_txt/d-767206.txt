 our clients say


   
since i started going to shapes, i noticed i have more energy to get through my day, better discipline with my diet and better time management skills. i started at a faculty in university this year and going to shapes has kept me sane and on track. thank you shapes ". patricia hernandez
 
"i began by attending hot yoga classes often, and, after seeing the results, i amped it up to extra cardio and resistance training. zumba became a new love of mine! dancing is the most fun i could possibly have burning calories. everyday i go to shapes, i feel good." kristina gillich
 
"through the coaching of my trainers norman and valentine, i lost 40 pounds and proud to say, still losing. my pants size went down from size 20 to size 14. with great teaching and support from shapes, i am reaching my goals and feeling healthier and more energetic now." marie heyward
 “my weight started to creep up and hit my heaviest of 240 pounds. with my journey at shapes i started at a size 14 and am now fitting in a size 5 pant, with a total weightloss of 63 pounds. i love all the classes because they make me feel great after and just seeing the great results.
.” christine barnes
