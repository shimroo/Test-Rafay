event details
issaqueena’s last ride is a challenging, mountain ride through the beautiful blue ridge mountains and foothills of south carolina.
the three longer rides are highlighted by the climb to wigington overlook where one is rewarded with expansive views of lake jocassee and the surrounding carolina piedmont. the 30 and 52 mile rides stay in the flatter areas of salem and tamassee where the roads are gently rolling with no difficult climbs. all routes feature scenic rural roads with little traffic.
registration fee includes pre-ride coffee and baked goods, post-ride meal, t-shirt, cue sheets, sag, and fully stocked rest stops.
