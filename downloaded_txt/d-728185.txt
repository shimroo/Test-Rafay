ca bishops' letter on immigration 











we invite our catholic communities to follow the example of the good samaritan (cf. lk. 10:34) and show compassion for our neighbors, especially the most vulnerable among us. our parishes have the tradition of being havens of hope and solace for the lonely and the lost, embodying the peace that christ gives. may our lady of guadalupe, who reminded juan diego that he bore the image and likeness of god, remind all of us today and in the coming days that we are all beloved children of god, bearing his likeness, no matter our ethnicity or country of origin. may our care for each other speak to the dignity of every human being.
