mental health association in tompkins countyproviding advocacy, support services and education in tompkins county since 1954


















at the mental health association in tompkins county (mha), we’ve been dedicated to empowering individuals, families, and organizations in tompkins county for over six decades. drawing on both lived experience and professional training, we provide peer support, advocacy, and services that promote mental health recovery and prevent mental illness.our mission is to end the stigma surrounding mental health through open conversations and education. all of our peer support services are offered free of charge to the tompkins county community, reflecting our commitment to accessible care for all.services are free to the community with the exception of mental health first aid.


























what is peer support?



mha’s free peer support services provide an opportunity for people who who have been successful in their recovery process to assist others in their recovery journeys.  our peer specialists offer a perspective that is different from the traditional clinical approach. having guidance and support from someone who has “been there” is what many in recovery value the most about peer support services. peer specialists serve not only as mentors but also as sources of hope and inspiration to people who are beginning their journeys to recovery.
