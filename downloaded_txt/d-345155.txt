a1k9






the professional dog trainers






(established 1993)






a1k9 has a three-decade reputation of providing highly trained family and personal protection dogs.
we have achieved this by consistently producing excellent results with the dogs we supply and dogs we train, resulting in happy dogs and happy clients.

















a1k9's speciality






family & personal protection dogs supplied & trained by a1k9






as the longest-established supplier of personal and family protection dogs in the uk, it is perhaps unsurprising that we have many high-profile clients.
we provide top quality, health tested dogs and whilst the majority are german shepherds, malinois and other breeds known for this work, we have also successfully trained some less typical breeds, such as labradors, to protect their families.
we don’t have a ‘typical client’, other than they all seek to improve their family’s safety and security.
our dogs serve two roles; pet and protector. our training prepares the dogs for everyday life as well as the day none of us want to see, the day when criminality or violence visits our life. our highly trained dogs will confidently counter any threat, enabling our clients to remain safe whilst they summon assistance.
acquiring a personal protection dog is a big decision and when you visit us we will be able to make an informed decision, identifying the right dog for you, your family and your needs.

residential obedience training






a1k9’s residential dog obedience training programme is designed so customers can entrust their dog to us for a period of 4 to 5 weeks, during which time, we will train their dog to a high standard of both on and off-lead obedience. irrespective of the breed, we achieve consistently good results; the only requirement is that your dog must be at least 10 months of age to be enrolled.
