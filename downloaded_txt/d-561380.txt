from debut authors to pulitzer prize winners, writers on writing tackles a little of everything — novels, short stories, memoir, poetry, and more, as well as interviews with agents and publishers. unlike other shows dedicated to discussing books, we focus on the art, craft, and business of writing. writers appreciate the opportunity to talk about the artistic elements of their job — the thousands of decisions that must be made to produce a manuscript. there’s no aspect of craft, creativity, and publishing we don’t explore. we’ve hosted well over 1,500 authors on the show including elizabeth strout, s.a. cosby, ann patchett, amor towles, and george saunders. expert advice from some of the industry’s top writers allows us to offer a show that’s been called “your own personal mfa program” (with no financial strain).host: barbara demarco-barrett host: marrie stonemusic and sound editing by travis barrettsubscribe to the podcast on apple podcasts, amazon, spotify, stitcher, google, or your favorite podcast app.

    stephen dunn, pulitzer prize-winning poet
  





i have a christmas and hanukah gift for you: my show with stephen dunn.  this is one of my favorite shows and he was one of my favorite poets. he published something like 21 collections of poetry. the show you’re about to hear from 2001, the first time he was a guest on the show. writers on writing was on the radio then. podcasting wouldn’t be along for four more years and it would be a number of years—i’ve lost track—before my cohost marrie stone joined us.  i first learned of dunn back in the early 1980s. i was on a bus in san francisco,  looking up at the placards that lined the roof of the bus and there was a poem of his. it may have been his poem, “contact,” which he reads during the following interview. back then the city posted poetry on muni busses (i think it’s doing that again). dunn and i never met in person but he graced me and the show with his presence a half dozen times.stephen dunn was born on june 24, 1939, in forest hills, queens. he graduated from forest hills high school in 1957. he earned a ba in history and english from hofstra university, attended the new school writing workshops, and finished his ma in creative writing at syracuse university. dunn’s books of poetry include the posthumous collection the not yet fallen world (w. w. norton, 2022); pagan virtues (w. w. norton, 2019); lines of defense (w. w. norton, 2014); here and now: poems (w. w. norton, 2011); what goes on: selected and new poems 1995-2009 (w. w. norton, 2009); everything else in the world (w. w. norton, 2006); local visitations (w. w. norton, 2003); different hours (w. w. norton, 2000), winner of the 2001 pulitzer prize winner for poetry; loosestrife (w. w. norton, 1996), a finalist for the national book critics circle award; new and selected poems: 1974–1994(w. w. norton, 1994); landscape at the end of the century (w. w. norton, 1991); between angels (w. w. norton, 1989); local time (william morrow & co., 1986), winner of the national poetry series; not dancing (carnegie mellon university press, 1984); work & love (harpercollins, 1981); a circus of needs (carnegie mellon university press, 1978); full of lust and good usage (carnegie mellon university press, 1976); and looking for holes in the ceiling (university of massachusetts press, 1974). he is also the author of walking light: memoirs and essays on poetry (boa editions, 2001), and riffs & reciprocities: prose pairs (w. w. norton, 1998).about dunn’s work, the poet billy collins has written:the art lies in hiding the art, horace tells us, and stephen dunn has proven himself a master of concealment. his honesty would not be so forceful were it not for his discrete formality; his poems would not be so strikingly naked were they not so carefully dressed.dunn’s other honors include the academy award for literature, the james wright prize, and fellowships from the national endowment for the arts and the new jersey state council on the arts. he has taught poetry and creative writing and held residencies at wartburg college, wichita state university, columbia university, university of washington, syracuse university, southwest minnesota state college, princeton university, and university of michigan.dunn has worked as a professional basketball player, an advertising copywriter, and an editor, as well as a professor of creative writing. dunn was the distinguished professor of creative writing at richard stockton college and lived in frostburg, maryland with his wife, the writer barbara hurd. he passed away on june 25, 2021.he won a pulitzer prize for different hours, the focus for our talk on this day in 2001. we also talk about the poets’ state of mind, writing poems during and after the moment, existing in the world of ambiguity, being a retrospective poet, how his focus has changed over the years, how he taught poetry, good training for a poet, hearing from readers, national poetry month, and more.for more information on writers on writing and to become a supporter, visit our patreon page. for a one-time donation, visit ko-fi. you can find hundreds upon hundreds of past interviews on our website. if you'd like to support the show and indie bookstores, consider buying books at our bookstore on bookshop.org. we’ve stocked it with titles from our guests, as well as some of our personal favorites. and on spotify, you’ll find to an album’s worth of typewriter music like what you hear on the show. look for the artist, just my type. email the show at writersonwritingpodcast@gmail.com. we love to hear from our listeners!(recorded in 2001 in the kuci-fm studio at university of california irvine campus.) host: barbara demarco-barretthost: marrie stonemusic: travis barrett (stream his music on spotify, apple music, etc.)

    jonathan lethem, author of brooklyn crime novel
  





jonathan lethem is one of the smartest, riskiest, and most experimental writers working in crime fiction today. he writes about crime not only like a fiction writer with all that propulsive page turning thrill, but also like a sociologist, a psychologist, a historian and a philosopher. that might never have been truer of his work than his latest, brooklyn crime novel, which came out last year and is recently out in paperback. it's as much a book about gentrification, integration, race, class, economics, and all the things that come with coming-of-age stories like sex and drugs and skateboards and basketballs, as it is about what’s really a character in the book …. crime. jonathan writes about brooklyn the way tim o’brien writes about vietnam, with a kind of intimacy and respect and resentment and ambivalence for the way the place shaped who he became. he joins marrie stone to talk about the novel. he talks about writing a novel in fragments, how to access and harness memory in fiction, living inside and outside a space to write about it, and tackling experimental points of view.jonathan is the author of 13 novels, including his 1999 blockbuster motherless brooklyn, which won the national book critics circle award and was made into a film by the same name in 2019 by ed norton. fortress of solitude, published in 2003, also delved into the streets of brooklyn and race and gentrification. in addition, jonathan has authored 4 story collections, 10 other essay collections and other books. for more information on writers on writing and extra writing perks, visit our patreon page. to listen to past interviews, visit our website. support the show by buying books at our bookstore on bookshop.org. we’ve stocked it with titles from our guests (including many of jonathan’s titles), as well as some of our personal favorites. you’ll support independent bookstores and our show by purchasing through the store. finally, on spotify listen to an album’s worth of typewriter music like what you hear on the show. look for the artist, just my type. email the show at writersonwritingpodcast@gmail.com. we love to hear from our listeners.(recorded on september 30, 2024) host: barbara demarco-barretthost: marrie stonemusic and sound editing: travis barrett (stream his music on spotify, apple music, etc.)
