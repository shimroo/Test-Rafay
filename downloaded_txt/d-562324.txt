the group of seven
story of the group of seven
the group of seven was formed in 1920. the original seven members were franklin carmichael, lawren harris, a.y. jackson, frank johnston, arthur lismer, j.e.h. macdonald and frederick varley. after johnston left the group in 1920, a.j. casson was eventually invited to join in 1926. edwin holgate became a member in 1930, while lemoine fitzgerald joined in 1932.
tom thomson, j. e. h. macdonald, arthur lismer, frederick varley, frank johnston and franklin carmichael met as employees of the design firm grip ltd. in toronto. in 1913, they were joined by a. y. jackson and lawren harris. they often met at the arts and letters club of toronto to discuss their opinions and share their art.
although he died before its official formation, tom thomson is commonly associated with and had a significant influence on the group.
after j. e. h. macdonald's death in 1932, they no longer found it necessary to continue as a group of painters. they announced that the group had been disbanded and that a new association of painters would be formed, known as the canadian group of painters. the canadian group—which eventually consisted of the majority of canada's leading artists—held its first exhibition in 1933, and continued to hold exhibitions almost every year as a successful society until 1967.
