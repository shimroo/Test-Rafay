    what people say about us


    
  "we moved to owensboro from memphis and were having the worst of luck finding a rental property that were both pet friendly and carport equipped. we also don't have the best of credit. we drove around and happened upon a house in an area of town we liked and decided to give rose reality a call. even though it wouldn't be up for rent for another week, rose happily let us have the keys to check it out. we loved it, told her our situation and she was amazingly understanding. we're very happy with our new home here in owensboro. these guys are top notch. i'm only giving them five stars because i can't give them six."

  "i have rented from her twice on bittle rd & my son rented from her as well, i think very highly of rose, she has been such a godsend to me & my sons. being a single mom, she really looked after us. ( thank you rose)  i miss living on bittle rd, good family get togethers. i miss living in a home with a back yard, maybe one day we rent from her again. ðŸŒ¹ rose realtor, you can't go wrong. i give her (5) stars"
