almost time!












spring planting time is almost here!  looking forward to being out in the garden and under the warm sunshine.



dad was here a few days ago and we already planted some lettuce and spinach.  cleaned up the garden a tad and are now waiting for it to get dry enough for dad to till.



this is a picture of ash and brooke from a couple years back.  they were planting some sunflowers.



yeah spring!

dear god,meet me in thelaundry room.










"i am thankful for my piles of laundry because itmeans my loved onesare nearby."










in life, eventually things get ironed out.










"a renewed earthwill return.it will be like a childthat knows poems."















"family always and forever."





~prayer for my family~
dear god, our loving and merciful father, bring together and keep my family in perfect unity of love and mutual support. keep quarrels, bitterness, and pettiness far from us, and give us grace for forgiveness and peace. may we find true unity throughfaith in you.
amen.










please protect us st. michael the archangel, against violence, murder and robbery.  in your goodness preserve us today from all the malice of sinful and wicked men.  in your sleepless vigilance watch over the safety and welfare of our homes, and keep guard over our possessions.  ever hold in your special care, most triumphant st. michael, the forces of public order against the crimes of evil men, and defend all honest citizens in time of peril.  we ask this of you through christ, our lord.  amen.










protect us jesus.shield our families fromthe storm.











~this site is dedicated to the holy family~




solid st. peter, friend and brother to jesus christ,i ask for your prayers to god for the blessing of long life.  please ask him to let me see my great-grandchildren raised into adulthood so they can hear the lessons and stories only elders can tell.  ask him to let my friends and family live long in health and happiness so that we can all live to serve him through our days.

amen










~thank you st. joseph~~for our home~










life is a miracle, don't let it slip away, open your heart to others, give of yourself each day.  see the beauty in everyone, regardless of where they've been.  some have a difficult journey, and really need a friend.


share your gifts and talents, listen with your heart.  do the things you dream about, but don't have time to start.  pick a bouquet of flowers, show someone that you care.  be gracious and forgiving, life is never fair.


hold onto your courage, you may need it down the road.  we all have a cross to bear, it could be a heavy load.  if you practice all these things, no matter where you roam, you may find both sun and rain, but you'll never feel alone.


may god bless all of you.

and may you realize that life is a miracle.

"get rid of all bitterness, anger and jealousy. no more hateful feelings of any sort. instead, be kind and tender-hearted to one another, and forgive one another, as god has forgiven you throughjesus christ."




"to be able to dance in the rain. to be as free as a little child that knows no fear, no judgment, no shame for doing something that makes her happy.




"not caring whether she’ll slip or fall in the mud, not caring whether she’ll get drenched all over. when you dance in the rain, you remember once more how to dance in life, you remember once more the taste of heaven."




"your family and your love must be cultivated like a garden. time, effort, and imagination must be summoned constantly to keep any relationship flourishing and growing."

~john ruhn~
