enerjoyâ® radiant heat:
twice the comfort using half the energy 



imagine  the comfort you feel standing outside on a warm, sunny day. thatâs how  customers describe the luxurious warmth of enerjoy radiant heatmodulesâ®.  not only do  customers enjoy clean, quiet,  sunlike warmth of enerjoy infrared heaters, but  they appreciate significant energy savings.
energy savings with ceiling-mounted enerjoy radiant panels has been  documented by the us department of energy and the national association of  homebuilders, finding "thirty-three percent savings could be expected  by operating the radiant system instead of the heat pump and 52 percent savings  could be expected by radiant system operation in place of the electric baseboard  system..."*.
in addition, enerjoy ceiling-mounted  electric panels use less energy than concealed electric or hydronic radiant  systems, and the low energy draw makes enerjoy radiant panels perfect partners  for solar, photovoltaic or wind power sources.
decarbonize your environment! green  enerjoy infrared panels have a low carbon footprint and zero emissions; they  have life-of-building longevity and are fully recyclable. â
