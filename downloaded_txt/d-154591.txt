homeschooling is a lifestyle. the moment you welcome a child
      into your heart and in to your home, you begin to teach the child about
      the world around them.
      hands on homeschooling offers lesson plans and activities for
      preschoolers age 2 through 5 (kindergarten) that can bring purpose to
      your daily play. some people will choose to offer the activities as a way
      to keep a child busy during the day, some are looking for a way to
      prepare a child to enter a regular school system, and others may see
      this as the beginning of a lifelong educational experience. no matter
      where you are along this journey, hands on homeschooling has a lot to
      offer. 
      thanks for stopping by!
