the alsek river has it’s origins only a short distance from the tatshenshini but the difference between the two rivers is dramatic. starting in the rain shadow of some of north america’s tallest peaks, the alsek river flows through two glacial lakes with spectacular hiking opportunities. known for grizzly bears and wildflowers it is a must do for any naturalist.

our reputation speaks for itself 



more than 40% of our guests each year are repeat guests or were referred by a past traveler.  








"this was the adventure of a lifetime. from start to finish, from desk to raft, the personnel and organization were flawless; this is particularly impressive given the complexity of the enterprise. i am left with the sense that everyone in the outfit, the guides in particular, were genuinely motivated to provide us with a rich and memorable experience. the nahanni is beyond beautiful and nahanni river adventures has given us a genuine gift in immersing us in it in this fashion. thanks!"



richard condit













"the integrity of the guides, is unparalleled; their ability to guide us down the river and then become gracious chefs, make amazing meals is remarkable. after a great day on the river, sitting at our camp site, gazing at spectacular scenery and enjoying sumptuous meals made for one of our best trips ever."



louise klatzel-mudry













"every part of this river trip met and exceeded my expectations! from the beautiful alsek river and surrounding land, to the guides who were so open to sharing their knowledge of the area and their fantastic cooking, to the other guests who where so helpful and open. as a single person wanting to travel and explore the yukon and all its beauty i can’t recommend this trip enough. it was beautiful in every way!"

what you can expect from us 











what sets us apart from other adventure companies? passion, expertise and – most importantly – attention to the special details. we’ve been perfecting our trips since 1972 and it shows – our guest return rate of over 40% speaks for itself. 















							low ratio of guides to guest 						


						experience has taught us that one of the most important factors for a high-quality and safe adventure is the ratio of staff to guests – we operate with one guide per four guests maximum.					














							value						


						the north is not a mass-market destination ­– thank goodness! it’s not the cheapest region to visit, but the experiences found here are like nothing else in the world.					


















							knowledge						


						it’s our goal to have the most consistently knowledgeable staff in areas of local interpretation, such as: flora and fauna, geology and geomorphology, human history, unique details, stories, features of each region.					














							safe travels						


						we maintain the highest standards for river safety and we are proud to have a reputation for excellence in this area. we employ comprehensive and well-rehearsed emergency procedures and trip contingency planning in line with wilderness camping experiences.

your experience 











imagine the “land of the midnight sun”, a country of diverse land forms, wild flowers and new delights to the eye, every day. imagine rivers that flow through these lands in a sinuous manner, serving as a conveyor to move you from one delightful experience to the next. imagine rewarding hikes, with a range of distances to choose, to pick the one that’s right for you. 











your adventure begins before you even make it to the river 



after meeting your guides and fellow travellers at the rendezvous point, you will make your way to the river. this usually requires a charter aircraft to fly in, out or both. the flights take you over truly spectacular wilderness. have your camera handy for the flight! 









 

 

 
















 

 

 










relax, you’re in great hands 



our talented wilderness guides deliver our trips with an authenticity that mirrors the unspoiled wilderness we travel through. their passion for living, learning and teaching regional geology, wildlife and history is matched only by their sense of adventure, paddling skills, and leadership acumen. 











each day of your river journey will be memorable and will inspire stories to tell your friends for years to come. 



your time on the river each day will vary, leaving plenty of time for other pursuits such as hiking, fishing, and photography. many trips have one or more “lay-over” days when we stay put and enjoy camping two nights in a particular spot. 









 

 

 
















 

 

 










you’ll be fed meal after meal of impossibly fresh food, all prepared with a portable camp kitchen and open fire. 



the crowning touch of our river journeys are the meals. forget those old images of freeze dried backpackers fare. at the end of an active day in the fresh mountain air, you deserve to be rewarded by the aroma and taste of a great meal with fresh ingredients, perhaps with a wine you selected. you’ll be continually amazed at the variety and quality of the meals.learn more > 











you'll have opportunities to view northern wildlife and plants 



the north is rich with some of the most abundant and diverse plant and wildlife anywhere in the world. each of our river adventures is scheduled to allow for maximum opportunities to see the plants & wildlife of that particular area.learn more >
