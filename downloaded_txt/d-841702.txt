a good place – the midlands meander 
							the midlands meander in the heart of kwazulu-natal, is a collection of arranged routes that offer visitors hospitality in truly beautiful surroundings, outstanding accommodation, conference and wedding facilities, fascinating local events, fabulous cuisine and restaurants, revitalising outdoor activities and over-the-top adventure sports, historic landmarks, wildlife conservation, and best of all “shop-till-you-drop” unique arts and crafts. an easy one-hour drive from durban and four and a half hours on the n3 highway from johannesburg, there is much to explore and do in the midlands. for all that is on offer, life is lived at a gentler pace, we take time to chat to strangers in the trading store and we grow our own vegetables.

the midlands meander is a region in beautiful kwazulu natal that stretches from just beyond mooi river in the north, hilton in the south, karkloof in the east and the foothills of the drakensberg in the west.
