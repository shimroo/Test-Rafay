there is a difference! 






1) al's is a 48 year, 3rd generation, american family owned business. we strive to grow, harvest, pack and ship  the highest quality, local, florida fruit whenever possible. al's proudly features more local citrus varieties than anyone in florida's indian river growing region.
2) it all starts in the field with meticulous grove 
                      care. my youngest son matt, shares my passion for growing 
                      healthy trees. my grower friends round out my grove team, most having 
                      3 generations of local citrus grower experience.
                    				   gentle, careful harvesting by benito is essential in the field. next it's up to our experienced packinghouse team to make absolutely sure your fruit is carefully inspected! each sugarbelle, navel, honeybell, temple, valencia and ruby red gets checked a minimum of 8 times prior to packing.                    				my wife sharon even takes the extra time to make every batch of fudge herself!
                   				  our youngest son matt graduated in 2019 from fl southern college with 
              his citrus degree and  works fulltime as al's family farms packinghouse and  peach farm, production manager.
as for me- i'm still responsible for overseeing crop selection,  harvesting, washing, waxing & grading of virtually every piece of fruit we pick.
                    				   why do we control everything? it's simple. less mistakes. that's why we're able to back every shipment with our 100% no nonsense guarantee. grandpa al wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
and matt! 
p.s.- low shipping on all  our packages  makes it more affordable...especially when al's packs  20% more fruit into our trays and one delicious gift box satisfies the entire family!
