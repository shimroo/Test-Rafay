wisconsin federation of museums














supporting wisconsin museums and the wisconsin museum profession since 1975.it is with immense gratitude and humility that the wisconsin federation of museums acknowledges that our museums and institutions are located on the ancestral homelands of the menominee, ho-chunk, potawatomi, ojibwe, odawa, and dakota nations who are indigenous to this land. we also pay respect to the tribes, who after forced removal now call this land home, the stockbridge-munsee, oneida, and brotherton nations. we honor their ancestors past and present as we work within our fields to create a more inclusive and equitable space for all.
