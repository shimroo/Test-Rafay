latest wins









 
uk ends the age of dirty coal power
the uk has closed its last coal-fired power plant, pushing this climate-wrecking fuel off the grid for good.  

 





 
major legal win on oil drilling
a greenpeace-supported court case on oil drilling has ended with a big win for the climate. uk fossil fuel projects will no longer be allowed to ignore the emissions from burning the fossil fuels they extract. 

 





 
fishing ban helps protect puffins
puffins will be eating better thanks to a greenpeace-backed ban on sand eel fishing. sand eels are a vital food source for puffins and other seabirds. 

 





 
vape waste vanquished
no more disposable vapes littering the streets and filling up landfill sites. over 250,000 people signed a successful petition to end the sale of throwaway vapes, tackling a rising waste problem. 

 





 
historic un ocean treaty
following a worldwide campaign from greenpeace and others, governments agreed a global ocean treaty. the treaty paves the way for new ocean sanctuaries where sea life can recover and thrive. 

 





 
seabed mining moratorium
greenpeace supporters helped persuade the uk government to call for a global ban on deep-sea mining. that’s a big boost for the wider campaign to protect fragile seabed habitats. 

 





 
europe's biggest clean air zone
london made its ultra-low emissions zone 18 times bigger than before, after greenpeace investigations showed thousands of children were exposed to illegal pollution levels.
