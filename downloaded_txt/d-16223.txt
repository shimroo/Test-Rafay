																	hey paul 
																	(progressive 
																	epoxy 
																	603-435-7199), 
																	just wanted 
																	to drop you 
																	a line. just 
																	wanted to 
																	thank you 
																	again for 
																	your water 
																	gard 300 
																	underwater 
																	epoxy paint. 
																	as we have 
																	discussed in 
																	the past, we 
																	have a 
																	commercial 
																	steel pool, 
																	and no 
																	matter how 
																	well we prep 
																	it for paint 
																	each year, 
																	we always 
																	end up with 
																	a few rust 
																	spots part 
																	way through 
																	the season. 
																	once again 
																	your water 
																	gard 300 
																	came to the 
																	rescue to 
																	touch up 
																	some 
																	particularly 
																	ugly rust 
																	spots this 
																	year.

	
																	thanks 
																	again!

"professionals helping professionals,

since 1994"










progressive epoxy polymers, inc. is very different from other epoxy 
	vendors you will find online. we just don't sell a diverse line of epoxies, 
	we are also a leading source for informational and educational information 
	on epoxies and coatings (about 10 pages of information for each "sales 
	page"). this results in lots of internet links in order to direct people to 
	the information contained on our websites.
	
	we get a lot of calls and emails from folks wanting to "pick our brains".


 


we sell about 40 different products online, mostly epoxies (some very 
	unique), some polyurethanes, epoxy fillers and thickeners, and accessories 
	like brushes and rollers. as you can see with our website format, we are not 
	marketing or web design people. we are coating / resin professionals. we do 
	not squander our resources (and your dollars) with web design companies or 
	web sales consultants. that said, we  have been around long enough 
	(over 25 years) to know about posting legal disclaimers, terms of service, 
	refund policies etc. links at the bottom of key website pages (scroll down 
	and check it out!).


 

we are also known for our email and telephone support and help. it is 
	available almost all the time (almost 24/7/365 with brief windows of 
	"burnout"). this has been a key to our success and has resulted in a large 
	base of customers and support seekers (contractors, repair folks, commercial 
	maintenance people. etc. ) a very high percentage of our daily sales are from repeat customers 
	and friends. you will notice lots of customer feedback quotes scattered 
	throughout our websites. we also stay in touch with our customers and 
	friends with an online newsletter the comes out several times a year (if you 
	can't find us, we'll find you!). if you are not an existing customer, email 
	us to get on the newsletter list.
 
this homepage (epoxyproducts.com/index.html) - has over 20 years worth of 
	information on products, applications, and technical data. for a quicker 
	start use the marine and/or 
	non-marine /  commercial diy catalog links above, the hot spot 
	application table below, the
	google site 
	search link or call 603-435-7199 est.

shipping and best time to order

	we ship ups ground from new hampshire  (us mail on smaller packages) - 
	we do not ship outside the lower 48 states. most epoxies and coatings cannot 
	be shipped by air (without special certifications and training which we do 
	not have). typically you order on day 1, the order gets processed on day 2 
	and ups picks it up on day 3. the best time to call-in an order is about 10 
	am eastern time (603-435-7199) when we are putting together the list of 
	orders to process that day. later orders are collected for processing the 
	next day.



	 



	not in the "lower 48"?
	we will ship to a usa based freight forwarder that you find, select, and 
	deal with directly to ship outside the lower 48. note that most coatings and 
	epoxies are "hazmat" and the forwarder must be certified to handle these 
	goods. orders to canada require shipping to a usa address.

where to use 
				india spar varnish
our
			india spar 
			varnish has three primary applications. 1) applied over a thick 
			or thin layer of epoxy used on
			table tops and 
			bar tops. vanish provides necessary
			uv protection 
			that all epoxies need as well as a wear surface that can be polished 
			to a mirror finish. 2) varnish is used on 'natural' wood finishes on 
			boats. again, generally over epoxy (such as in
			
			stitch - and - glue  or wood strip construction)  but 
			sometimes directly on the wood. if you using our
			basic no blush 
			marine  epoxy (why not?) be sure to wash off and remove any
			amine blush 
			that might have formed on the surface of the epoxy before you 
			varnish it. note that spar varnish is a solvent based coating that 
			has been time tested for over a century on boats out in the sun and 
			weather 24/7. you won't find any modern "polyurethanes " on these 
			boats (keep the urethanes for indoor use - better still, use india 
			spar varnish on inside applications too). 3) use india spar varnish 
			over naturally finished wood floors, usually over an epoxy primer -
			esp 155 
			(or thicker epoxy like low v epoxy - used on shipping container 
			floors) applied over 
the wood and under the varnish.
 online store 
			purchase here - cannot be shipped to california. 




 
 

























																	 



3   
																	primary 
																	applications 
																	(that 
																	probably 
																	brought you 
																	here)

																	 



six key epoxy applications you are likely to have 
	contacted us about


1) 
	
	shipping container floors (the recycled shipping contain blogs send 
	their readers to us to seal the container floors from the poisons and 
	pesticides applied to the floors)
 


 







low v epoxy 
			- click 
			here for data/tech documents in pdf format. this link, and links 
			for all products, can also be found at
			
			epoxyproducts.com/datamsds.html . this is the epoxy used to seal 
			shipping container floors.


 

 





2) 
	
	floor epoxies 
	(garages, penny floors, shops etc. - this particular link takes you to our 
	epoxy floor page in our non marine catalog)




3) 
	
	swimming pool repair (we are the only folks that we know of that offer 
	and epoxy that you can apply to chips, stains, leaks in residential pools 
	without draining the water)



4) 
	
	bar top and table top epoxy surfaces (that thick or thin epoxy look on 
	tables or bars. we are the only folks that offer several different epoxy 
	resin options and not just one single product)



5) 
	
	resealing or creating pebble stone decks (every 2 - 5 years pebble decks 
	need to be resealed as the stones begin to break loose)



6) boats and marine stuff (broken down into the following)




																	 

																	 

																	 

																	 

																	 

																	 


          
	


 6a)

	boat building (this link points to stitch and glue construction)




           
	6b) 
	boat repair 
	(some specific examples of repairs made to boats. with all of our products 
	we have products used to repair and restore boats, even products to make 
	repairs underwater - there is even a book written "escape from hermit 
	island" about using our epoxies to save a sunken yacht in the pacific ocean. 
	order at amazon)



          
	 6c)

	barrier coat epoxy (epoxy barrier coating epoxies are used to slow or 
	stop the formation of blisters below the waterline of fiberglass boats. we 
	offer several options)



          
	 6d) 

	blister repair 
	(epoxy products used to repair osmatic blisters that can form below the 
	waterline in fiberglass boats)



           
	6e)

	potable water epoxy (we appear to be the only source for drinking water 
	approved epoxy for tanks as small as 50 gallons. all the other potable water 
	epoxies require tanks of 800 or 1000 gallons to meet the approvals)


           
	6f)
pontoon boat repair (we get a lot of calls regarding corroded and / or 
	leaking pontoon boats. we have products to deal with these issues




           
	6g)

	copper and epoxy (folks mix a special grade of copper powder into a 
	special low viscosity epoxy and apply to the bottom of boats to prevent 
	fouling. we sell the copper and the epoxy)






           
	6h)

	comparing marine epoxies and epoxy vendors (what to look for when 
	comparing and shopping for marine epoxy resins)



leaky basements, rot repair, leaking or rusty pipes, 
	delaminating spongy boat decks (or rv exterior skins), underwater gluing, 
	concrete crack filling, sun / weather resistant exterior coatings (doors, 
	signs, tables)  are just a few more of the projects we help our 
	customers with. we can probably help you too.

"hi paul, ---thank 
	you so much for all the info. each time i spoke with you, i found you to be 
	a very helpful, personable individual. you seemed genuinely interested in 
	helping me get the right products and making sure that i know exactly the 
	best way to apply it for optimum results.

	sadly, in today’s business world, those are not common traits. it definitely 
	was a pleasure to do business with you ( as cliche as that saying is.) i 
	definitely will recommend to anyone who needs your products. best wishes for 
	continued success. sincerely, julie" (6/2019)
