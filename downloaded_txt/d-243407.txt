sherwood partners launches sherwood advisory services 






sherwood partners today announced the launch of sherwood advisory services, a new advisory group that leverages the strength of sherwood partners’ platform to deliver tailored turnaround and restructuring solutions to middle market companies. sherwood advisory services will be led by spencer ware, a seasoned turnaround and restructuring professional, who brings over two decades of experience from alixpartners, zolfo cooper, and riveron to lead this new group.


























all about abcs






an assignment for the benefit of the creditors (abc) has become an increasingly well-known insolvency process. while an abc may have certain advantages for a particular company over other insolvency alternatives (e.g., a bankruptcy filing, foreclosure), the facts of each situation should be well understood and assessed by a company’s board of directors and officers before deciding which insolvency option to pursue. the benefits and limitations of an abc are important to understand before effectuating one.


























business is booming for silicon valley "undertaker"






"if there's no revenue incoming and there's no money investing, the company is basically insolvent and out of business," says sherwood partners co-founder martin pichinson. "we basically come in and clean up the messes." pinchinson says his firm usually does two-to-four of start-up wind-downs per week, but is now doing two-to-five per day.
