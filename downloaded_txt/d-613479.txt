the barnes family has been in the automotive business in western canada for the last 35 years starting with greg barnes purchasing a general motors dealership in camrose, alberta. in 1988 the family moved to prince george where a larger gm dealership became available for purchase. in 1992 the opportunity came to purchase pacific gmc in coquitlam so once again up we moved to the lower mainland where we have remained ever since.
