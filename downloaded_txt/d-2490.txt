jonny lang cancels all confirmed appearances


per doctor’s orders, jonny lang will be cancelling all confirmed appearances. over the course of the past year, medical challenges with his voice have not improved. there is hope for a natural recovery at some point in the future but until progress is witnessed no future plans will be initiated.  he is thankful for the support of his fans over the past two plus decades, and hopes to be in the position to return to the stage should he retain the ability to perform at a level his global audience has enjoyed night in and night out. as he navigates these challenges, further guidance will be offered at an appropriate time in the future. until then, all ticket holders will be refunded. guidance will be forthcoming from individual promoters imminently.

2020 tour update

over the last several months, jonny lang has been under the care of medical specialists in los angeles addressing vocal cord challenges. guidance has been received to postpone all february and march appearances in the interests of a return to full long-term health. he will spend the next eight weeks in treatment, alongside additional consultation with the primary interest of being healed by mid-april. over the course of his two decades long career, jonny has always made every effort to see through all confirmed engagements. in this instance the only move is to protect his return to being able to perform for decades in to the future without risking permanent damage.
please visit the tour page to see the updated itinerary, including rescheduled shows.
 

 

announcement concerning january shows

appearances scheduled during january have been impacted by a physical health issue. jonny lang will recover, but in the interests of long term well-being the prudent move is to reschedule where possible. 
from the start of his career he has always aimed to never miss a confirmed show, and personally offers a sincere apology to all fans impacted by doctor’s orders which came earlier today that jonny needs more time to heal his voice.
