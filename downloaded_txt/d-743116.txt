you don’t have to face this journey alone…

 

“i never once thought that i would find myself in need of a support system like womensafe with its network of advocates and kind-hearted families such as yourself; as i always thought "these things always happen to others". i know now that its not true…and listening to the stories and circumstances of others that i met at womensafe, i realize just how lucky and blessed i was when they extended a helping hand."— former womensafe client 



“this shelter, which i now call home, has been one of the biggest blessings i have had since the birth of my babies. i had lost everything and had nothing. but coming here, i gained hope, faith and reassurance that everything was going to be okay. i now know i can keep my son. and i now have the support that i needed that i never thought i would have."— former womensafe client 



“since the day we arrived the staff has encouraged, listened, sympathized, held our hands, showed us respect, rejoiced and even cried with us. i want you to know what a profound impact you all have had on me and my family. we are forever grateful for you and your help and support. the fact that you all cared about us has made a big difference in our lives."— former womensafe client
