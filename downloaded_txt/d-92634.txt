 announcing the newest book by randal churchill 
  
  



as we celebrate 57 years in the field and 47 years as a leading school, hypnotherapy is transforming many aspects of the health professions and is truly revolutionizing the counseling professions. we are honored to have a major role in this, leading the way with powerful, innovative therapy methods and by using the insights and therapy methods of ourselves and others to train thousands of graduates including many leaders in the field. new internationally valid certification programs are now forming, as we continue to forge new directions in an emerging field.see our course schedule.news: we’re expanding hypnotherapy in the developing worldthis is an excerpt from a recent newsletter. to sign up for our monthly newsletters, just give us your name, email and zip code. the use of hypnotherapy has been limited in the developing world, including as integrated into medicine, psychotherapy and other healing arts. the population generally has little understanding of its potential and many of those using hypnosis have only limited training. however, progress is being made.hypnotherapy has often been quite scarce in areas with even greater need. in last semester’s accelerated intensive, we were delighted to have students from various countries, including dr. awwad, a pediatrician who came here from bethlehem in the west bank. we also had a student from neighboring lebanon (now the 53rd country to have an hti graduate), which has been in a series of conflicts and wars for 50 years. dr. awwad's work is in a hospital in jerusalem, but palestinians have not been allowed there for over a year since the october 7, 2023 attack. we hope that policy will end very soon, along with a permanent ceasefire and return of the remaining hostages in gaza.

among the class members last semester, our graduate gary josephson returned for some continuing education. he has been doing hypnotherapy in uruguay since 2016. he describes these breakthroughs:"hypnosis is gaining acceptance as a therapeutic modality globally, and in uruguay it is beginning to be recognized within the psychological and medical communities. however, the public perception still leans towards viewing hypnosis as mind control. over the past eight years, i have navigated the government system to become the first registered hypnotherapist in the country. the government is actively seeking effective methods to improve psychological and medical outcomes for its citizens. currently, i am nearing completion of the necessary qualifications and am developing the only government-approved training program for psychologists and physicians in uruguay to effectively implement hypnosis in their practices. the education i received at the hypnotherapy training institute and the support of randal churchill have equipped me with the skills and confidence to pursue this mission.”-gary josephson, cchtpiriapolis, uruguay



current milestonesfounded by randal churchill in january 1978, hypnotherapy training institute is about to celebrate our 47th anniversary as a leading pioneering hypnotherapy school.randal churchill is in his 56th year in the field.our class location has been established at the beautiful five acre resort-like corte madera inn for 37 years.








people came to this accelerated class from many states plus 15 from other countries - from every continent except antarctica. in our intimate, supportive classes, randal churchill will recognize you and know your name by the 2nd day of class.








randal churchill is gathering information from the subconscious mind with exploratory ideomotor methods in this level 4 demonstration. the communication via finger signals led to regression to an early childhood trauma and a powerful healing.

     "when i started i was taking it for a thesis topic and only expected to complete the first level. the more i learned, the more i realized this is what i really wanted to do. by the time of my level 4 graduation, i felt this could be my profession. i quickly developed a full-time hypnotherapy practice, with at least 6-8 clients per day. i have referrals referring referrals!
     "you are both such wonderful teachers. your wise and tested methods have allowed me to work with the most basic issues and the very complex, with outstanding success."

the following person had completed years of graduate school plus substantial hypnotherapy training at various schools before he took our 200-hour program. he was so impressed that he returned and took our training again. here's his response after completing that. since he wrote this, he has completed our graduate clinical courses twice plus our hypnotherapy training a 3rd and 4th time!
     "this is to thank you for allowing me to take the 4 full level classes again and be a diligent analyst of your unparalleled methods. taking the full course again has been most insightful and rewarding on both professional and personal levels. although the program foundation is similar, the cases and studies in class have been rewardingly new and inspiring to me.
     "in order to attempt a similar education it took me over ten years and i had still felt i needed more. your classes have it all, direct, indirect, ericksonian, nlp and mostly results at such a comprehensive level. there is never enough education especially in this field and having taken highly regarded classes elsewhere, i can definitely attest to and endorse the highest standards of your school. going over your books under your supervision and guidance is limitless. i will definitely come for your graduate program and also plan to get there again for another accelerated intensive when this is possible."

”hello randal, i am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the invaluable support, encouragement, and guidance you and the other teachers have provided throughout these three months of study. your passion for hypnosis and engaging teaching style have deepened my understanding of the material, but also inspired me to incorporate hypnosis into my current private practice. i am very pleased to say that all of my clients, friends, and family members have thoroughly enjoyed hypnosis. thank you once again for your dedication, expertise, and support. i feel incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to attend hypnotherapy training institute. much love and continued success with you, and your institute. great memories!"

the following email is from a graduate who came to our school from africa.
     "i feel now i am ready to express an experience that has transformed my life and in the process the lives of lots of people! to begin with, i could not have imagined that i would no longer feel my (formerly) chronic backache. i have learned to relax the muscles and actually pass on the healing thoughts and energy to the pain areas. the changes in my life are nothing short of a miracle. healing my personal relationships has been the highlight....
     "bringing the learning to africa, where such methods are treated as esoteric, unacceptable and a taboo - i have managed to get people to experience the healing and believe in the modern "miracle" of hypnotherapy. a miracle which anyone can perform with his/her ingrained abilities.
     "with your unique ability and wide experience, you certainly are leaving a legacy in this world. your passionate and committed approach to focus on the healing aspect touched my heart. you have sown the seeds of this unique healing methodology and i consider myself very fortunate and blessed. thank you very much for everything and keep on inspiring and healing the world. we need you."
