about



the art presented here by pylon studios is exclusively the work of jp collins. jp works in mixed media. his current work is on high-quality, thick, cotton-rag, print making paper and incorporates gouache, colored pencil, and collage.
jpâs work is about material, texture, color, contrast of imagery and line, especially line. natural objects like seed pods, plants, fruit and vegetables are often presented in fragments and rendered in simple line or shape.
jp likes to transform the mundane into something remarkable by focusing attention on fragments of an object or reducing it to the basic elements of color, shape and texture. âbeauty is everywhere but we donât always stop and observe it. and although the things i present in my work may be beautiful on their own, my job is to use my vision and materials to describe things differently than the way we normally see them.â
jp received his bfa in conceptual design and painting at san francisco state university and studied painting with robert bechtel and cherie raciti.

lemons
gouache, colored pencil, graphite pencil on paper, 10 x 10 inches

in this piece i wanted to explore the density and flat texture of the gouache and reduced the lemons to just shape and texture and included enough of a contour line to define each lemon. because the background is dark and also very dense in its pigment color, i used a contour line to both reflect the lines used around the lemons and also to describe the shadow of the lemons.

magnolia
gouache, colored pencil, graphite powder collage on paper, 10 x 10 inches

this is part of a series of four works on paper exploring the shape and line quality of a magnolia seed pod. i also included drawings of other natural objects to offset the yellow painted line of the pod as well as a fragment of another drawing of a magnolia seed pod. i applied graphite powder to create a sheen on the dark, gouache background.

magnolia 2
gouache, colored pencil, graphite powder collage on paper, 10 x 10 inches

this is part of a series of four works on paper exploring the shape and line quality of a magnolia seed pod. in this piece i included drawings of other natural objects that are also seed pods from trees. i also included for disk shapes as a reference to printer marks found on packaged items. iâve used these in past works and sometimes add the actual printed box top into my collage elements. i felt that referencing them in this work was stronger and more appropriate.

magnolia 3
gouache, colored pencil, graphite powder collage on paper, 10 x 10 inches

this is part of a series of four works on paper exploring the shape and line quality of a magnolia seed pod. in this piece i decided to work in a brighter palette while using the same elements from the other pieces in this series.

oregano
colored pencil, gouache, collage: printed paper, vintage photograph, brass grommet, 8 x 8 inches

i love the contours and shapes of the flowers and leaves of oregano plants. this piece started out as a test and ended up a more realized piece with the addition of the collaged items and the brass grommet.

oregano 2
colored pencil, gouache, collage: printed paper, brass grommet, 10 x 10 inches

i love the contours and shapes of the flowers and leaves of oregano plants. like oregano 1 this piece started out as a test. it became a fully realized piece with the addition of, gouache painted over the drawing, collaged items and a brass grommet. and finally, i drew in a series of squares which are a reference to printer marks found on packaged items.

dandelions
colored pencil on paper, collage, 9 x 12 inches

this work is a result of a fascination with the strong and healthy dandelion plants i see growing out of the cracks of sidewalks in my very urban neighborhood. this piece is a mash-up, a combination of two pieces that i liked separately but didnât feel worked as complete works on their own. although i employ collage in dandelions, this is one of the few works in this collection that is colored pencil with no additional gouache or other objects.
