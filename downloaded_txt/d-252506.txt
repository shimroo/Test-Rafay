urgentit has come to our attention that scammers are impersonating law enforcement officials in order to scam residents. the scammers use legitimate names of officials telling people they have missed a court date or failed to show up for jury duty.  they are intimidating victims into paying bogus fines by threats of arrest.   legitimate agencies will never call or text you asking for any type of payment.  beware, if anyone calls or texts you asking for payment it is a scam.   if you have any questions about jury duty, court dates, or payments call the court directly at 504-407-0395.
