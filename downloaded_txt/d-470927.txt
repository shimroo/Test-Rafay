4000. crazy-fast ramen with bacon, egg and kimchi






2 strips of bacon, diced

2-3 scallions

kimchi, roughly chopped

a couple tablespoons of kimchi brine

a package of fresh ramen noodles

soy sauce

toasted sesame oil

rice vinegar

mirin

one egg

chile oil

toasted nori strips



first, sauté two strips of diced bacon in a skillet over medium heat. once the bacon bits are crisp, scoop them onto a paper-towel lined plate, then add two to three chopped scallion whites to all that delicious bacon fat in the skillet (save the scallion greens for later!). once the scallions start to soften, add a big handful of roughly chopped kimchi and a couple of tablespoons of kimchi brine straight from the jar. cook for another two minutes until kimchi softens, then remove from heat.



meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil. add a package of fresh ramen noodles and boil for just a couple of minutes until they’re springy and tender, then drain in a colander and rinse under cold running water. 



add the noodles to your skillet with the cooked bacon bits, some chopped fresh kimchi (for tang and crunch), and a splash each of soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, rice vinegar, and mirin. cook for a minute or two over medium heat, tossing until combined and noodles are warmed through, then transfer to a plate or shallow bowl.



poach an egg in a medium saucepan of barely-simmering water with a splash of white vinegar. use a slotted spoon to transfer the egg to your bowl of noodles, then top with some toasted sesame seeds, and those reserved scallion greens. add a dash of chile oil or some toasted nori strips if you’re feeling fancy.

3998. apple brown betty with maple-bacon frozen custard






yield: one 9 x 9-inch brown betty, about 10 servings


maple–bacon frozen custard:

3 slices bacon

1/4 cup brown sugar

1/4 cup maple syrup

1 tablespoon water

5 egg yolks

1/4 cup granulated sugar

1 cup heavy cream

1 cup half and half cream

1 tablespoon bourbon



apple brown betty:

1/2 cup granulated sugar, divided

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1/2 tablespoon all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon lemon zest

pinch cinnamon

pinch nutmeg

pinch cloves

6 tart apples (such as king david), peeled, cored, and sliced 1/4-inch thick

1 cup panko bread crumbs

1/4 cup grated aged cheddar cheese

1 tablespoon unsalted melted butter

butter at room temperature for prepping the cake pan



to make the frozen custard, preheat the oven to 350ºf. lay the bacon on a sheet tray and bake for 15 to 20 minutes until crispy. drain the bacon on a rack or paper towels and let cool. chop very finely and set aside.



place the brown sugar, maple syrup, and water in a small saucepan and heat to 250ºf. remove from the heat and add the chopped bacon. stir quickly to combine, then pour onto silpat or cookie sheet covered with wax paper. let cool. (this will take about 20 minutes.) when the mixture has cooled and hardened, break into pieces and store in an airtight container.



in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar. combine the heavy cream, half and half, and bourbon in a small sauce pot and heat over medium heat until just beginning to bubble. slowly pour the hot cream into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly. return the mixture to the pot and cook over very low heat, stirring constantly until the mixture coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. immediately remove from the heat and strain through a fine-mesh strainer. allow the mixture to cool in the refrigerator overnight. process the custard in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer’s instructions. mix in the pieces of candied bacon. store in the freezer until needed.



to prepare the brown betty, preheat the oven to 325ºf. mix together 1/4 cup of the sugar, lemon juice, flour, lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in a large mixing bowl. add the apple slices and toss to coat. in a separate bowl, mix together the panko, cheese, melted butter, and remaining sugar.



grease a 9 x 9-inch pan with butter. make a one-inch-thick layer of apple slices on the bottom of the pan. sprinkle with the bread crumb mixture. add another layer of apple slices and top with the remaining bread crumbs. bake for 45 minutes or until brown and bubbly.



to serve, scoop out individual portions of the brown betty and place on serving plates. top each serving with a scoop of maple–bacon frozen custard.

3997. maple bacon creme brulee





maple crème brulée

5 egg yolks

1/3 cup pure maple syrup

2 cups whipping cream (35%)

1/4 cup maple sugar (for the brulée)



maple candied bacon

6 slices thick cut bacon

2/3 cup pure maple syrup



maple crème brulée



preheat oven to 300ºf.



in a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks and maple syrup until the mixture is thick and pale yellow. add cream and continue to whisk until well blended. strain into a large bowl, skimming off any foam or bubbles.



divide mixture among 5 ramekins or custard cups. place ramekins in a water bath (large pan filled with 1 or 2 inches of hot water) and bake until set around the edges, but still loose in the center, about 50 to 60 minutes. remove from oven and leave in the water bath until cooled. remove cups from water bath and chill for at least 2 hours, or up to 2 days.



when ready to serve, sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of maple sugar over each custard. for best results, use a small, hand-held torch to melt sugar.



top with maple bacon.



maple candied bacon



arrange bacon in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. bake in a 400ºf degree oven for 15 minutes. remove from oven; drain fat.



reduce oven temperature to 350ºf degrees. pour maple syrup over bacon; flip to coat. bake, flipping bacon and rotating pan halfway through, until bacon is golden brown and syrup is thick, about 35 minutes. (keep a close eye on it for the last 10 minutes.)


transfer bacon to parchment using tongs. let cool to harden.

3994. maple bacon mochi pancake bites





makes around a 12-15 pancake bites, or one and a half pancake towers


for the pancake bites:

3/4 cup mochiko flour
1/4 cup all purpose flour
2 tbsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
pinch of salt
3/4 cup milk
1 egg
3 strips of thick cut bacon



for the maple glaze:
1/2 cup powdered sugar
2 1/2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp milk (if needed)




cook the strips of bacon till crispy. drain the excess oil, pat dry and let cool. chop the bacon into very small pieces. set aside.


whisk together the mochiko and all purpose flours, sugar, baking powder, and salt. in a separate bowl, lightly whisk the milk and egg. add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix well. if desired, sprinkle a few tablespoons of the bacon bits into the batter.


heat a takoyaki pan over medium heat. use a pastry brush to butter the pan. pour the pancake batter into each hole, filling just to the top but not enough for the batter to overflow. the batter will rise, and some of the batter will spill a bit onto the sides around the hole. when the bites begin to bubble, use a wooden chopstick or skewer to test the doneness of the batter that spilled around the hole. if it feels hardened but still slightly tacky, use your skewers to flip the pancake bite over. keep turning each bite in the pan until it is evenly golden brown. transfer the bites to a plate and set aside.


in a small bowl, whisk the maple syrup into the powdered sugar, one tablespoon at a time. pouring all the wet ingredients into the powdered sugar at once will cause the glaze to turn very runny. once you have incorporated all the maple syrup, add in the milk if the mixture is still too thick.


for assembly, stack the pancake bites in a pyramid. i did this by placing 5 in a circle and adding one to the middle. then add 3 more for the 2nd level, and one for the very top. drizzle the pancake bites with the maple glaze and sprinkle the remaining bacon bits on top.

3993. bacon cheeseburger poutine





4 pounds of french fries (about 8 cups) 

6 strips thick-cut bacon
1 pound lean ground beef
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon dried parsley
3 cups beef stock
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups white cheddar cheese curd
salt
pepper



start cooking french fries, however you have decided to make them, from scratch or store bought.



place bacon in a frying pan and fry over medium heat until crispy, turning regularly. when bacon is done, transfer to a plate lined with paper towel and place paper towel over top to blot grease. then cut into large chunks.



melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. once melted, add all-purpose flour and whisk thoroughly until all lumps are removed. cook for five minutes while the roux is bubbling. this will give the gravy a darker colour and will also cook out the raw flour. slowly add the beef stock to the roux, whisking as you do to avoid lumps from forming. once the stock has been added, reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking, uncovered. you need to keep the gravy piping hot so it will melt the cheese.



place olive oil in a large frying pan set over medium-high heat. when hot, add the beef, worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. stir to thoroughly combine all ingredients and continue to cook until beef is completely browned. taste, and adjust seasoning if necessary.



to plate, set a large handful of french fries on a plate or in a bowl. spoon about 1 cup of beef over top of beef and some of the bacon over top. top with cheese curds and then generously spoon gravy over top.

3992. bacon halloumi rolls with sage green beans





serves 2


200g halloumi cheese

200g streaky bacon

2 tbsp fresh chives, chopped

200g green beans, ends chopped off

1 1/2 tbsp flaked almonds

2 leaves fresh sage

1 clove garlic, peeled and cut in half

butter (from your pantry)

salt and pepper (from your pantry)



heat oven to 200ºc (400ºf).



cut the halloumi into sticks – about 1.5 cm wide. lay the bacon slices out on a board and scatter with chopped chives and freshly ground black pepper. roll the bacon around the halloumi in a spiral to cover the halloumi stick. place the halloumi rolls on a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes until the bacon browns and begins to crisp.



bring a saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil. add beans and cook for 2 minutes. once cooked, drain in a colander and rinse under cold water. set aside.



place a small pan on high heat and dry toast the almonds until lightly browned - about a minute. toss often to make sure they don’t burn.



put a frying pan on medium to high heat. add a few knobs of butter. when the butter has melted, add whole sage leaves and garlic and cook for about a minute. now add the beans to the frying pan and mix through with the butter sauce. scatter with the toasted almonds.


to serve, divide the beans between the plates and place halloumi rolls on top.

3991. asparagus, leek and bacon quiche





yield: 6-8 servings


1 unbaked 9-inch pie-crust

6 oz asparagus, ends trimmed off

1 leek

3 slices bacon

3 eggs

5 oz freshly grated monterey jack cheese

1 cup milk

¼ tsp salt

¼ tsp pepper



preheat oven to 350 degrees.



bring a large pot of water to a boil on the stove. once boiling, drop in the asparagus and quickly blanch for 30 seconds until bright green. quickly drain water and run cold water over asparagus. set aside to cool.



fry bacon crisp in a cast-iron skillet over low/medium heat. once crisp, remove from heat and set the bacon to drain on paper towels but do not toss the bacon grease! crumble or chop bacon once cool.



now, thoroughly wash the leek under cold running water. to do this most efficiently, peel off the first two layers and let water run all through. after washing, thinly slice the white part only of the leek.



reheat your bacon-greased skillet over medium high heat then drop in the thinly sliced leek. sauté for about five minutes, until leek is soft and translucent. remove from heat.



in a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, pepper, crumbled bacon and sautéed leeks. prick crust all over with a fork, then sprinkle evenly with the cheese. pour the milk and eggs mixture over the cheese.



slice the blanched asparagus into 1 1/2" pieces on an angle and scatter over the cheese in the unbaked pie crust.



carefully place filled quiche on a sheet tray and into the oven for 1 hour.


after 1 hour, the quiche should be puffy and golden. let cool completely before slicing.

3989. seared scallops with creamy bacon grits





makes 4 servings


1-1/2 lbs dry sea scallops

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon sweet paprika

1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1/8 teaspoon sugar

1 tablespoon butter

1 tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped



for the grits:

1/4 lb thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces

1/2 cup sweet onion, finely chopped

4-1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1-1/2 cups white (or yellow) corn grits

1-1/2 cups corn kernels (about 3 ears fresh corn)

salt and freshly ground black pepper


fry the bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, drain all but 2 teaspoons of fat from the pan and reserve the remainder for later use.



reduce the heat to medium and add the onion. sauté until soft and just starting to turn golden. remove the pan from the heat and set aside.



bring the chicken broth to a boil in a large saucepan. stir in the grits and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low. cook, stirring continually, until the liquid is absorbed and the grits are tender, 4 to 5 minutes.



add the butter, reserved bacon, sautéed onion and corn. combine well and season to taste with salt and pepper. cover and set aside to keep warm.



note: grits will stiffen up a bit as they sit, so you may want to stir in a little warm milk or water just before serving to restore the creamy texture.



pat the scallops dry with paper towels and arrange them in a single layer on a large plate. combine the salt, sweet paprika, black pepper and sugar in a small bowl. sprinkle the mixture lightly over the scallops, turn and repeat on the second side.



wipe out the pan you cooked the bacon in and heat the butter along with about 1 tablespoon of the reserved bacon fat over medium-high heat. add the scallops in a single layer and sear until they develop a pale golden crust on the outside, a maximum of 1-1/2 minutes per side.



scallops need about 3/4-inch of space between them in order to sear properly, so if the pan seems overcrowded, cook them in 2 batches.



transfer the cooked scallops to a plate and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. reserve the pan juices for serving.



to serve, plate individual portions of grits, top with scallops and spoon some of the pan juices over all. garnish with a sprinkling of chopped parsley and serve immediately.

3985. bacon and egg potato skins





4 eggs

2 potatoes

2 pieces bacon

4 small rectangular slivers of cheese (to fit into the potatoes)

salt & pepper

olive oil

parsley or cilantro to garnish

optional toppings: chili flakes, salsa, avocado



preheat oven to 375 degrees. microwave the 2 potatoes till cooked and cut them in half. scoop out the insides of the potatoes - making little "potato boats" in the process. add a sliver of cheese in each potato half and place potatoes on a baking tray. brush potatoes with olive oil. break an egg into each potato half and bake for 18-20 minutes. cook strips of bacon and drain well on paper towels. take the eggs out of the oven - making sure the whites are set. sprinkle the potato skins with bacon and salt and pepper and parsley and chili flakes; avocados and salsa would make some super tasty toppings too.

3984. bacon waffles with peanut butter-honey glaze





makes 8 - 4" waffles


waffles:

1 package bacon (about 10 slices)

2 eggs, separated

1½ cups buttermilk

2 tablespoons melted butter, cooled

1 cup all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon yellow cornmeal

1 teaspoon granulated sugar

1 teaspoon baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon salt



glaze:

¾ cup honey

¼ cup creamy peanut butter



waffles: cook bacon according to directions on the package. once it's cooked & slightly cooled, crumble or chop into bite sized pieces (about ½").



beat egg yokes, buttermilk and butter together in a large bowl. set aside.



combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl. gently add dry ingredients into the wet, mixing until just combined (do not over mix, there will be lumps).



beat egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks (if you turn the bowl upside-down, they should stay put). gently fold bacon pieces (leaving some aside for garnish) and egg whites into batter until just combined (there can still be lumps in the batter).



preheat the oven to 200 degrees f. then preheat your waffle maker & follow the waffle maker instructions to cook, as each one is different. pour the appropriate amount of batter into preheated waffle maker and cook until golden. after the first batch is done, place them on a rack or cookie sheet in the warmed oven in a single layer. keep all cooked waffles in the oven while you finish the rest and then make the glaze. don't stack the cooked waffles or they'll lose their crispness (unless you plan on re-heating them in the oven).



glaze: combine honey and peanut butter together in a small bowl. microwave for about 20 seconds and stir (if it's not warm enough, microwave it again for 10-15 seconds at a time, checking and stirring it each time).


whisk until smooth and pourable (you can add more honey or maple syrup also). top waffles with glaze.

3983. maple and candied bacon blonde brownies





makes 1–8 brownies, depending on how you cut them


2 1/4 cups blanched almond flour

1 cup (6oz) maple granulated maple sugar
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/3 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1/2 cup sustainable palm shortening or ghee
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 cup pecans, finely chopped

3-4 pieces of bacon
about 1/3 cup maple syrup



for the candied bacon: make the candied bacon before starting the brownies as it will need to cool down before breaking it up into tiny pieces for the topping.



preheat the oven to 375 degrees



on a parchment paper lined rimmed cookie sheet, lay out the strips of bacon. you want the rim so that your bacon grease doesn’t run down into oven and start a grease fire.



using a pastry brush, sweep a generous amount of maple syrup over each piece of bacon. you could also sprinkle maple sugar instead of using syrup, but i find that it takes less syrup and it goes on smoother and faster.



bake in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes. remove the baking sheet from oven and flip the bacon over. brush the other side with maple syrup and return to the oven for another 8-10 minutes or until dark and caramel-y. watch the bacon closely toward the end, it burns fast. times will vary from oven-to-oven. for best results use an oven thermometer.



remove from oven and cool.



cut or break the bacon into small pieces. if they are too large the brownies will be difficult to cut later.



for the brownies:



grease and line a 8×8 inch cake pan with parchment paper, leaving flaps on two sides of the pan for easy brownie removal. you don’t have to lay parchment paper both ways, just one set of flaps will suffice.



in a blender or coffee/herb grinder, pulse the maple sugar a few times to make it a finer grind.



using a small sauce pan over medium heat, melt the palm shortening/ghee till it just becomes liquid. you don’t want it to be hot, just liquid. remove from heat and let cool.



while the fat is cooling, combine the almond flour, sugar, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. now add the eggs and vanilla extract to the liquid shortening/ghee and lightly beat together.



combine the egg/fat mixture with the almond flour mixture, mixing till combined and there are no lumps in the batter. transfer the batter to the prepared cake pan and smooth the batter out as best as you can.



sprinkle the bacon and pecan pieces evenly over the top of the batter and bake for 22-25 minutes.


when they’re finished cooking, remove the pan and allow the brownies to cool. slice into squares.

3981. baked eggs with bacon-braised black-eyed peas





serves 4


2 cup black-eyed peas

3 slices applewood-smoked bacon cut into 1/2-inch pieces

1 small diced yellow onion

1 cup salsa

1/2 cup chicken broth (low-sodium)

4 large eggs

2 tbsp parsley freshly chopped for garnish

hot sauce for garnish



bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and season with salt. add the fresh black-eyed peas and boil for 10 minutes, or until just tender. drain and discard the water.



in a medium-sized sauté pan, cook the bacon over medium heat until the fat has rendered and the bacon is just crisp.



remove the bacon pieces from the pan and add the onion to the bacon fat. sauté the onion until tender and caramelized, about 10 minutes, stirring often.



add the cooked black-eyed peas and sauté for 3 minutes more. add the salsa to the pan along with the chicken broth and stir in the cooked bacon. reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, uncovered, to meld the flavors.



preheat the oven to 375°.



coat 4 gratin dishes with cooking spray. divide the black-eyed pea mixture evenly among dishes and make a small indentation in the center for the egg to rest in.



crack 1 egg into a small bowl and gently pour it into a gratin dish. repeat with the remaining eggs.



place the gratin dishes on a baking sheet and tent the baking sheet with foil. bake until the egg whites are cooked through, about 10 to 15 minutes. serve garnished with parsley and hot sauce, for those that like it hot.
