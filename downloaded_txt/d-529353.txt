the compressed air passing through the valve body and to the nozzle tip creates a vacuum in the liquid line which draws coolant from the tank. the coolant is instantly vaporized and forms a conical mist pattern. at the same time, the compressed air expands absorbing heat surrounding the tool and work piece. the result is a cooling effect as well as lubrication.
