five guys burgers and fries sucks 





yea i said it.   

so now i'm finally trying this five guys burgers place.  even though i'm getting burnt out on in n out, i have my west coast loyalties to uphold.   i honestly don't know what all the hype is about, but it's clear where the financial success comes from.  

the burger was good. but good in the same way a burger at a family bbq picknick is good.  i feel like i've had this burger 1000 times already.  everything seemed like you could go to safeway and buy it and make it yourself for like 8 dollars cheaper.  right down to the normal reynolds wrap foil wrapper.  if this burger came off a truck and had something distinguishingly special i still wouldn't expect to pay $7 for it. 

so the hype, here at least is that it's because not in n out, although it looks like one with the familiar red and white 50s decor. but the food isn't special... at all.  

the reason they're making bank is because of the generic cheap ingredients and unbranded foil wrappers, brown bags etc that they charge an arm and a leg for. can you say profit? 

i'll take in n out over dads birthday party bbq hamburger any day.  because it's something that you just can't duplicate. 

see this guys hilarious rant too http://steelcloset.com/2009/08/03/the-internets-secret-war-some-nutjobs-actually-think-that-five-guys-is-better-than-in-n-out/

"havin' yo salad tossed...."





here's some inside knowledge from a real life employee of in-n-out.originally posted at  "in-n-out's secret menu".http://www.badmouth.net/in-n-outs-secret-menu/author: misses bcomment:i have worked at in n out for 5 years now...the 1/2 tea 1/2 lemonade is just simply called that, or an arnold palmer..it prints out on the receipt as tea/lemonade or lemonade/tea depending on which way the associate types it in. in n out will now only make up to a 4x4..you can no longer go any higher than that. it was a rule set by the health department. the veggie burgers do not come with extra tomatoes, however, just like with all burgers, each bottom bun must be completely covered by each ingredient, so if the tomato slice is small, it will need another slice in order to cover the bun. as far as the "on the sal" thing goes, there really is nothing called that, but you can order a side of any item we have. so you may ask for a side of lettuce, tomoatoes, onions, pickles, etc, and if you wish you could build your own little salad. it does not cost extra to get a side of anything, you could just walk up to the counter and ask for those sides, as well as sides of spread. one thing i did not notice on this site was chile peppers. in n out has packets of chili peppers which upon request you can enjoy while eating your burgers and fries. also, you can request to have chili peppers chopped up onto your burger. you can also ask for whole grilled onions placed on any burger. they simply take a whole slice of the raw onions and put it on the grill before placing it on your burger. along the same lines as the fries well done or light, you can have your meat patty cooked well done or medium rare where they will pull it off the grill early. and you can always as for no salt on your meat or on your fries if you wish. also, you can ask for ketchup and mustard on your burger instead of the spread. i think that about sums it all up!thanks misses b!  so there it is folks, i'll credit b for the newest and probably the only fantasy menu item you'll actually be able to order.  "the free-side salad"  and if you add chili peppers, "gratis ensalada con chile".now i'm purely into fantasy menu territory... maybe could also order a grilled bun and chop it up for croutons, chopped up slices of cheese (cob salad style),  and of course use the free "spread" aka, thousand island dressing to finish it off.bonus news:i know this is kind of late but check the aug issue of maxim magazine for their article about in n out.  i was interviewed for it but all i got was a mention.  and sad to say no extra web traffic.  the writer of the article must have gotten confused because some fantasy menu items were mentioned as examples of "secret menu" items.  some readers/in-n-out purists were quick to call him out on it.

meat fries





all my life in n out has been just  our of reach to me.  i used to hear the commercials for it on the radio and wonder about this mysterious place in n out. it sounded delicious.  then a few moved in closer to where i lived, but it was a special occasion when we got to have in n out.  this added a sense of mystique to it that somehow in the back of my mind made it better.recently i moved and there's an in n out right down the road from me.  this excited me, and totally bummed me out because i thought it would make it less exciting and in-turn not taste as good.  but it didnt, i've had my usual double double animal style and cheeseburger a few times and its still kicking ass.maybe now that i have easier access, i'll get some balls and try to order off the fantasy menu.  probably not, but until then, i've thought of a new item. ... meat fries.you roll a ball of hamburger and mustard into a potato sized ball and freeze it. then with the fry press knock that ball into a batch of frozen meat fries. then cook as you would a well done order of fries.  top with animal topping and mix with regular fries.sounds good!

the everything





i was thinking that i haven't touched this page in a while and was thinking about a new menu item. the everything. (aka the mess)2 buns soaked in dr.pepper and then grilled, 4 mustard cooked patties, animal toppings, plus animal fries, 8 slices of cheese, extra sauce, extra pickles, extra raw and well done grilled onions, with a deep fried bun between the patties and cheese. all of this topped with well done fries and chocolate shake drizzled over the whole thing (will substitute for vanilla or strawberry)if you order this to-go it just comes dumped into a bag. then triple bagged for leakage.'bon appetit

hot ring





you ever get the hot ring from eating too much spicy food? sometimes referred as "the sting ring", its when you get burning diarrhea after eating something spicy or rich. a conversation on this topic,  inspired me to invent our latest addition to the fantasy menu™,  the hot ring. (yea thats right, i put the little trademark next to it. its mine bitches. )the hot ring. aka the ring o' fire, aka the johnny cash special consists of;one well done cooked pattie soaked in jalepeno juice with extra jalepenos on a toasted bun(add hot sauce where available. or byob hot sauce)

the twin towers





our friend jimbo sent in a couple variations with a patriotic theme.the twin towers before: two, 20x20's stacked high side by side.the twin towers after: a tray covered with a mixture of burnt and regular fries, then all other (non-liquid) ingredients chopped up and thrown on top, and topped off with condiments squirted in random piles for added effect.nice one jimbo! i think they should be called "world trade center" and "ground zero" but thats just my opinion.  either way, its a great meal.on a side note, me and my girlfriend hit up in-n-out on the way home from a baseball game.  it was a drivethru so i chickened out and ordered 2 animal style single cheese burgers. she ordered the grilled cheese.  pretty tame i know, but it was damn good eatin' .

thanks, and a new burger!





hey, thanks for the comments, keep spreading the word! and please, if you or anyone you know has attempted to order anything  from this menu send in your story!  also if you have any ideas for a fantasy menu item we'll add it to our list.  the only rule is that it can be made from ingredients found at an in n out burger and can be made with the equipment they have.i was thinking of what "ingredients" they actually have there and thought about using something they have, but typically throw away. the bag the buns come in.  this led me to thinking up the murder victim.   either way, it goes like this...  put all the ingredients of a double double animal style into the bag and then, holding it closed, hit the bag on the counter several times, add ketchup, then seal with the original bag tie. served on a bed of yesterdays lettuce with a broken fork.variations:the body bag: use a black trash bag instead of the clear bun bag. serve on a clean chilled food tray.the csi:  serve with a  fresh set of sealed to-go utensils and stack of napkins.

burritos?





so after thinking about the donut post, i thought, what if you rolled the buns out flat and grilled them?  you could make tortillas!   in n out burritos!!??  i think yes.   just pick your favorite fillings  and put them in a tortilla and have a burger wrap.  or chop up tomatoes, peppers, onions and salt  (pico de gallo) mix it with patties cooked with peppers and onions(carne asada), add some cheese and you've got a carne asada burrito!viva la fiesta!

donut burger





ok so there is this place near where my band practices that says "donuts and burgers" and i always thought that was an odd combo. but then i saw this story about a minor league ballpark slapping bacon, cheese and patty between two krispy kremes.   now, after our last post about in n out donuts, it got me thinking.  it might be a pain in the ass to order but you could do it.  have them coat some dough(bun?)  in sugar and deep fry it. then "have it your way" for the rest.   another option is the "byob" approach. bring your own donuts and bacon tell them to whip it up for you.or just drive to st. louis and get one at that baseball stadium.

donuts, new fantasy menu item?





this was posted in badmouths secret menu thread by a former employee that can confirm a new fantasy menu item has been invented, and has been actually made!"...when i worked there i worked with some legends; this girl made donuts out of the puritan hamburger buns. she would roll the dough into balls and then pour chocalate shake on them. next she would throw them into the frier and take them out later and put sugar on them. you can make them do this, if you talk to the right worker. the people that work at the register are usaully people that haven't been with the company! for to long. if you wan't to talk to someone who knows what they are doing, you should talk to somebody who works past 11 pm or from 10 am to 11 am. the people who open and close the store know about most this stuff..."donuts! freaking awesome. why didnt we think of that? also thanks for the tip about the more experienced workers.

did someone order a "dirty sanchez" ?





i get updates from  the badmouth  secret menu blog   when people reply to that thread. usually its  "wow 100x100 thats crazy" but last night i got a treat from somone named rich.rich  january 30, 2006 @ 7:51 pm  my fave was the dirty sanchez style. the register lady looked very confused, but finally got it. and like a good in n’ out employee, gave it to me just like i wanted. the $6 price was a bit higher than expected, though. will order again.he made no mention of this fantasy menu, but how else would he have heard of the "ds"?rich left no contact info. i added a comment so hopefully he'll see it and respond.

i had heard rumors of secret menu items like "animal style" and  "4x4"... but during a discussion on the subject, a friend who works at  in-n-out told me about stuff the employees make for themselves that  arent on the menu or the secret menu.  so that got me thinking of other things you could make with the  ingredients used to make the very simple in-n-out basic menu. that led  to this page.  the "fantasy menu"...things you wanted to order, couldn't, shouldn't and  probably still cant.
