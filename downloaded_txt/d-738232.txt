i was to be picked up at 10:30 pm but my flight was delayed and i did not get to the phila airport until near midnight.  my driver arrived promptly and was exactly where he said he would be.  he was pleasant and helpful.  i think his name was gino.  i want to applaud the service i received.  i always use de express and certainly will continue to recommend them to my friends.  thank you!
