lake murray  
was constructed between 1927 and 1930.  the dreher shoals dam formed 
a 48,000 acre lake in the heart of south carolina and only a short drive 
from downtown columbia.  the lake covers an area of 78 square miles with 620 miles of shoreline. 
the waters of the saluda river that feed lake murray supply energy to the 
saluda hydroelectric plant turbines and cooling water to the mcmeekin steam 
generating plant.  both plants are owned by south carolina electric & gas 
company (sce&g).  when completed, lake murray was the largest power 
reservoir and dreher shoals dam the largest earthen dam in the world.

today, lake murray stills supplies electric power, is the major source of drinking water for the city of columbia,  and has become the 
water playground for the midlands. the lake murray adventure means boating, 
sailing, canoeing, fishing, skiing, swimming, camping and just 
plain fun at one of the south's most scenic playgrounds.
