exchange 2013/2016
exchange 2016 was released in october 2015 and is the latest version of exchange. 64 bit only, an evolution of exchange 2013 and 2010, so many techniques for exchange 2010 and 2013 also apply to exchange 2016


exchange 2010
exchange 2010 was released in november 2009 and can also be found as part of sbs 2011. as with exchange 2013, it is an evolution of its previous version, so exchange 2007 techniques can apply to exchange 2010 as well. 


exchange 2007
exchange 2007, released in march 2007 was a complete change from the previous version. built on powershell, it introduced the three roles and was 64 bit only for production use. it is also found in sbs 2008 





exchange 2003
exchange 2003 is probably the oldest version of exchange in widespread use, either standalone or as part of sbs 2003/2003 r2. released in september 2003, it is mainly gui driven, and is no longer supported by microsoft.

outlook is the main desktop client for exchange. this section has guidance on using the client, including some advanced techniques.
