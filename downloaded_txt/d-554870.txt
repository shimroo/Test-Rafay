celebrating clients and honoring our historyin this video, our ceo, erica sessle, shares the journey we have taken from the beginnings of the hiv crisis to our most current work addressing the formidable health challenges facing our diverse community. 



who we arelifelong has always been an organization that stands up for communities facing barriers to living a healthy life.everyone deserves the chance to thrive, but that vision is out of reach for far too many people. for over 40 years, lifelong has fought for marginalized communities with relentless compassion—because no one should have to battle stigma, judgment, or the devastating effects of illness alone.
