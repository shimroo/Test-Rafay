hey kids!





nothing.  i just always wanted to use that title for a post. so what's up with you? me, not much.  i lost another half-brown, half-white hair today and i am seriously reconsidering my prior resolve not to colour.  i mean, when you're twenty-seven and you have three white hairs, that's one thing; but when you're staring twenty-nine in the face and have increasingly prominent white streaks in your crowning glory, it's quite another. how's this for surreal?  so i'm sitting at the circulation desk today, thinking about corporate jargon - you know, "leveraging", "the granular level", "best practices", "core competencies" "value-add", "operationalize", "actionable", "disintermediated" and my personal favourite, "going forward" (famously employed by a former roommate who fancied herself a future ceo: "going forward on the issue of the towels on the bathroom floor") -i'm sitting there, thinking, "gawd, what a load of bovine scatology", when i start to check in some "information resources" (otherwise known as "books").  and the title of the first book is, get this - i am so not making this up:leveraging communities of practice for strategic advantage.is it bad that i laughed?  probably.  but i couldn't help myself.  it's like back in my undergrad days when i laughed myself silly over the following fragment, gleaned from a volume of literary criticsm on jane eyre i stumbled upon in the concordia university library system:"...self-referential historiographic metaficition in the procrustean realist tradition..."let me tell you something: the only granular level i want to encounter is at the bottom of a coffee cup, and the best practice is the one that works, so shut up and get to fixin', before i disintermediate your face.i'm sure we're all on the same page.

busybusybusybusy





i've been pulling 11, 12-hour days all week so not much time to post.  i'm on lunch break now.  i just ate a huge, ginormous slice of chocolate-banana cake and i probably shouldn't have because now i'm obsessing about how many calories were in it.  probably around 300.  i can't eat like this anymore!  i haven't been running in weeks, due to my poor health/crazy schedule.  one more week of this and then i can breathe.  it's this course i'm taking - that and the bloody commute in the rain and snow which takes more than an hour, sometimes two.  i get home at 7 or 8 and feel positively antisocial. yeah, i don't have a lot to say right now.  my sore throat persists  to this day - not as sore, some days worse than others, but i'm too busy to care about it much. how's by you?

monday merry mausoleum





the live transit of venus webcast from down under begins tonight. miss it and you'll have to wait until 2012.

the first network color tv broadcast happened on this day in 1953. ford began designing the edsel in 1954. before who wants to be a millionaire, there was the $64,000 question. it debuted on this day in 1955.

happy birthday tom jones and prince.
give up your crackberry? you might have to. the us court of appeals hears arguments today that research in motion, blackberry's canadian parent, violated us patents. the plaintiff, ntp, seeks to bar the popular little wireless e-mail devices in the us. fortunately i lost mine in a cab years ago and i've already recovered from the withdrawal.

steve jobs is california's richest ceo, despite only getting $1/year in salary. jobs received $74.75 million in stock grants last year.


apple is expected to announce the launch of itunes europe on june 15.


pictures of apple's next g5 desktop have leaked out but no word on when it will ship. the next big apple event is the worldwide developer's conference june 28.


pop-ups are back. according to cnet news, advertisers have figured out how to get around the popular google toolbar and its pop-up blocking. other third party pop-up blockers are also less effective. i haven't noticed any problems with browser based blockers in mozilla, firefox, and safari, however.


cisco has released a patch for the linksys wrts54g 802.11g wireless router. the box has a flaw which gives an attacker access to the routers configuration page without a password. if you're using a wrts54g make sure your router's firewall is turned on or download the patch from cisco.




listen in tomorrow at 6:45a pacific for my weekly news commentary on kgo 810 am in san francisco.

call for canada





i'm very happy to report that i've agreed to host a daily show for g4/techtv canada starting later this summer. we'll produce the show here in toronto. i'll fly up one week a month to shoot. it looks like the format will be very similar to call for help, and, yes, we'll be taking calls. once we get the web site up and running there will be a place for you to submit your questions as before. 

pictured at left, my co-hosts (and actual canadians) the lovely jelena mihajlovic and the geekyandy walker. 

more details to come. stay tuned. now we're off to see the jays and the dodgers. i'll post pictures.
