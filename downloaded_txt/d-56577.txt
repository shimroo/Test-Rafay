spartans drum & bugle corps
the spartans drum and bugle corps is a community-based performing arts program in nashua, nh.  we are an independent, non-profit organization and not affiliated with any school or government institution. we are one of the most respected and established organizations in the drum corps activity.
the corps was founded in 1955 as a way to keep at-risk youth off of the streets. our organization is run by a dedicated group of volunteer parents and a professional teaching staff who work in close harmony with all members to create and maintain a proud, responsible youth organization.

be a spartan!
the spartans are made up of students from all over new england, the united states, and from all over the world!
most of our members have experience in their school’s marching band, drum corps, wgi, or other performance ensembles, but that’s not required. we are looking for dedication and drive.
it’s never too early. sign up now!
come celebrate our 70th anniversary in 2025 and march in the macy’s thanksgiving parade with us!
