up&up











the challenge
up & up was launching two new, premium variants of toilet paper. they wanted to not only drive awareness of the new product, but also drive trial & content (specifically reviews) to change the perception of the old product. they didn‚Äôt want to just drive switching amongst their current category shoppers, but instead drive organic category growth.











what we did

qualified 2,000+ households:

willing to try the new toilet paper
currently bought competitive brands x, y, or z
frequently shopped at target
but, did not currently buy the category at target


executed a trial campaign with 1,000 members
hand selected 3 paid influencers for custom content campaigns
captured & curated all campaign content (reviews & photos)

this tissue is great. the sheets are thick, strong and durable. i have always paid extra for competitive brand x, however i will be purchasing up & up¬†now, as it is the same quality for a significantly lower price.

i have to admit that i was skeptical at first. i‚Äôve tried numerous other brands and none have compared to the one that my family and i have used for years‚Ä¶ until now. my favorite brand of toilet tissue has finally met its match‚Ä¶

i have been extremely picky because i can‚Äôt stand that gross feeling of toilet paper breaking mid-use!! the only thing i have used for the last several years is competitive brand x. i am happy to say that the up & up¬†works just as well and i will definitely be buying it from now on. who doesn‚Äôt love to save money?!?! can you tell from the pictures which is which? my hubby didn‚Äôt notice the change either. üôÇ

the challenge
the what‚Äôs next awards is sebastian professional‚Äôs annual stylist competition seeking out the most cutting edge styles from the fiercest stylists in the u.s. ¬†sebastian asked us to create a platform that would allow stylists to showcase their best work and drive awareness, excitement & engagement behind the brand and their contest.











what we did
we created a robust contest upload and voting tool that aggregates, moderates, and curates the very best submissions. it allowed stylists to easily upload their creative masterpieces, then share with their friends and colleagues, allowing them to vote. all visitors to the site could vote for and share their favorite photos. the backend allowed us to track and analyze the submissions and makes it easy for the sebastian wna judges to choose the best ones.

the challenge
a national footwear brand was reinventing themselves and refining their target behind a new product innovation. they were due to launch within the next year, and had produced 800 pairs via a limited production run (100 pairs for each of 8 skus). prior to their full production & launch, the brand wanted to learn about the overall product appeal, the price ceiling, and the actual buyer profiles. 











what we did
with our transactional learning capability, we were able to build a custom pop-up shop and invite our members to shop the shoes. from this, we were able to know not only who bought, but who shopped and capture feedback from everyone throughout the experience. this was paramount in learning & iterating the total product proposition both during the test & prior to launch. 










results

2mm+ impressions
3k unique shoppers, representing all 50 states
200 orders fulfilled
1k non-buyers provided feedback
learnings from the test resulted in the brand changing the product name, refining the messaging, refining their target audience, and tweaking the design of the shoes.

fisher-price










the challenge
fisher-price laugh & learn smart stages was a new suite of educational toys that ‚Äúgrow with‚Äù your child.¬†because these toys were more premium priced, it was important to let moms test them out first hand. until you actually see your child laughing and learning, it‚Äôs tough to fully appreciate their value. also, because these toys were premium priced & large, a traditional 1:1 direct trial campaign was rather cost prohibitive for the brand.










what we did

qualified & selected 1,200 grassroots connector moms (6,600 applicants)
designed a custom experience ‚Äòplaydate in a box‚Äô for their kids & their friends, that included:

a variety of laugh & learn toys
games to play
branded keepsakes
coupons to share & more


captured, curated, & shared their experience broadly across social & within our community












results

hosted 1,200 toddler ‚Äòplaydates‚Äô
syndicated 1,500+ ratings & reviews
captured 2,500 pieces of ugc
delivered 13.3mm impressions

the challenge
newsy is a next-generation news network that is looking to truly disrupt the news reporting & content as it‚Äôs currently delivered today. they are all about ‚Äúnews with the why‚Äù, offering honest, in-depth context on stories that matter. it was originally built as a digital-based brand, but they were looking to expand into premium linear programming across platforms & content creation. in order to do this, they wanted to hear the voice of the consumer/viewer and let that influence the content & brand as its programming grew. they didn‚Äôt only want to hear from their current viewers, they wanted to hear from non-viewers too. they didn‚Äôt want to hear from people over-representing one party vs. another. they didn‚Äôt want to hear only from people in urban areas or just along the coasts. overall, they didn‚Äôt want one-sided or biased feedback shaping the story, content, or programming for the brand.
