	 measham ware teapot
	 
    





marc drogin has been collecting measham ware [1875-1914] for a few years and has some 20 pieces, most of them teapots and tea kettles bearing bespoke messages, two or so pieces from the brief revival in the 1970s, and a mug and double-spout teapot he’s not certain of.  they fill his kitchen and make him smile every time he walks out there for a mug of chai.

the photo shows him with his 24-cup 1.5 gallon 15-1/2 inch tall teapot inscribed borough of fowey 1797.  it’s a puzzler because the design didn’t come into existence until 1875 so it’s probably a piece ordered in 1897 to celebrate the centennial of... well, they forgot to say.  the history of fowey suggests the only thing worth raising a cup of tea to in 1797 was the founding of the congregational church chapel.  so that may have been the reason behind it.

the teapot sits on the hob beside another, a revival piece, only 4 inches high.

marc doesn’t know anyone who collects measham ware, so its a rather solitary existence.  and in all the world of reference materials there seems to be only one publication — a stapled slim paperback — devoted to it.  surely he can’t be the only american with such esoteric taste?

	 malevich teapot 2.0
	 
    





since its foundation in 1744 the imperial porcelain factory in 
saint petersburg, russia had been producing high quality porcelain 
exclusively for the tsar and the imperial court. soon after the 
bolshevik october revolution of 1917 the factory was nationalized and 
renamed state porcelain factory. the old traditional bourgeois order was
 swept away and a revolutionary director was installed who invited 
artists with radical, modernist ideas to design avant-garde ceramics and
 porcelain that was "revolutionary in content, perfect in form and 
flawless in technical execution".during a very short but intense
 period, between the end of 1922 and april 1924, the suprematists were 
allowed fearless experimentation with utopian, fresh, radical abstract 
designs based on square, circle and cross. the suprematism founder and 
prophet kazimir malevich (1878-1935), one of the most important pioneers
 of geometric abstract art, designed here in 1923 his famous innovative,
 suprematist teapot and teacups which were de-constructed arrangements 
of geometrical shapes.for some this irrational explosive teapot,
 with its shamelessly phallic spout, looked like a hurtling railway 
steam engine or it was categorized of "utilitarian irrelevance". only a 
handful teapots were made in 1923 because during manufacturing at the 
state porcelain factory they faced several problems. when the factory 
director noticed: "mr. malevich, your teapot does not pour 
well" malevich replied: "it is not a teapot but the idea of a teapot".today,
 with the revolutionary ceramic 3d printing technology, this 
challenging, complex teapot can now be manufactured in a totally 
different way without all the problems malevich faced back in 1923 at 
the state porcelain factory in saint petersburg. this 3d printed 
malevich teapot 2.0 is an improved, nearly identical reissue at 90% of 
the original size, of the original 1923 malevich teapot which was 
slightly adapted and optimized for 3d additive manufacturing 
printing technology. it is a functional teapot with lid, which will 
offer you in combination with the associated malevich teacups everything
 you need for the ultimate modernist tea ceremony.order your 3d-printed malevich 2.0 teapot directly from our geometric abstraction webshop at
 our licensed manufacturer shapeways who will process your order, print 
the goods and ship them to you from new york (to usa & canada) or
