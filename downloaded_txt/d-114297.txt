the evolution of team evergreen



team evergreen is evolving. as you may know, team evergreen is both a ride club and a producer of world class events like the triple bypass. but as our organization and impact has grown, the name team evergreen doesn’t accurately represent what we do. in an effort to create a more welcoming environment for all riders, reduce confusion, and to set both sides of the organization up for success, we have chosen to give each a unique name and identity.

shift events



at shift events, as creators of top-tier ride events including the triple bypass, the hundo, salida 76, session series, blue sky hill climb and the betibike bash, we believe that bikes build better communities. that is why we donate a substantial part of our earnings to support community improvement projects that make real differences in people’s lives.

evergreen ride club



evergreen ride club has the same ride calendar, events, and community that builds life-long friends and riding partners. but with this change, our intention is to set the club up for continued growth and success in the future. by shifting to evergreen ride club, we hope to encourage more riders to join us and share in the amazing community we have collectively built.
