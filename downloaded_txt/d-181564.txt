1.  please note try to give us 2-3 days notice in
advance notice for

2. 
any questions before placing
order, call 985-226-6444 kyle.



3.  some orders may
be filled on the same day if received early in the morning; however,
those orders need to be phoned in or placed on order form via website
night before.

4.  also keep in mind that we fill
our orders on a first come, first served basis.  the earlier

we
deal only in high quality live crawfish, wild (spillway) with unlimited
resources and the best service available throughout the
year, since 1990.

 

note: 
pricing is not the only variable that goes into shipping of live
crawfish.  other variables include quality crawfish that
arrive alive, crawfish shipped from new orleans
international (more flights than metro airports) or to door via fedex
priority overnight, crawfish shipped by
the most experienced live crawfish company in louisiana seven days a
week, and unlimited quantity; also other companies cannot
supply all year long as we can. 
please remember we
are the #1 shipper of live crawfish in the u.s., since 1990.  



note:
 please remember the normal person does not want to eat
small, dead crawfish.  after you calculate upset
guests
and dead crawfish, the cheaper price does not seem so cheap.

 


 


if you
want to purchase small, "field
run/straight run" crawfish,
buy from
our competitors.

if
you want to purchase large, graded, quality spillway swamp crawfish,
buy from us!

please
remember, you get what you pay for!
don't let your party turn into a disaster.
go with a proven company which specializes 
in the shipment of live crawfish since 1990!
the only

jim s:  mr.
leblanc:
i came to you with a
tall order:  for weeks, i'd been planning a
crawfish boil for about 40 people, and invitations were sent. 
so, i needed 90 pounds of live crawfish.  i
needed them delivered to milwaukee.  overnight.  oh,
and i also needed them over fourth of july weekend, a busy picnic
time.  and by the way, i needed them at a time when every
other site online that claims to ship live crawfish was turning me down
because flooding and high temperatures had depleted the
supply.  
and did you deliver?  did
you ever!  two bags of gorgeous crawfish...alive, and right to
my door.
myself and my co-host threw our
crawfish boil, as planned and on time.  as we promised, we fed
loads of hungry people a traditional louisiana crawfish boil complete
with your enormous crawdads, potatoes, corn, and your boil
spice.  they were thrilled, and so were
we.  and at the end of the day, we still had
enough crawfish left over that we plan to try out a few of the recipes
you were thoughtful enough to send along with our order.
i cannot recommend you highly
enough.  everything on your website is true, as
promised!  next year, i'm not going to bother searching
frantically online and making desperate calls looking for
crawfish.  next year, i'm only making one call: to kyle
leblanc.
thanks again!
