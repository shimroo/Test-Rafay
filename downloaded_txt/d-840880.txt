catamaran salty dog






we could not have had a better week aboard the salty dog!  we made memories that will last a lifetime.  gordon and jenine made our family, spanning ages 6-64 feel extremely comfortable and pampered all week.  the food was amazing, the service was amazing, the boat was amazing, the sights/excursions were amazing, and the company we shared was amazing.  gordon and jenine quickly became extended family members which made saying goodbye more difficult.  if you are on the fence about booking this trip, don't be!  you will not regret it!

catamaran moon shadow






the crew was fantastic. solid 10/10. they were knowledgeable, friendly, hilarious, and attentive to anything we needed or requested. not only were they expert sailors and chefs, but they were so much fun to hang out with.

the yacht itself was incredible. it was meticulously maintained, modern, and equipped with so many fun toys. our favorite part of the yacht (although hard to choose!) were the water toys and the sleeping accommodations. 

the itinerary was perfect. the crew set up a wonderful adventure for us and we got to see everything we wanted.

the food was michelin star worthy, and we cannot say enough good things about chef richard's recipes and presentation. he was also a blast to hang out with (as were they all!)

catamaran gambit






this trip was amazing! in spite of less than ideal weather (high winds and big swells) captain doug made it possible to experience all but anegada which would have been a long rough sail. doug always had a plan and discussed it with us each morning for our approval…gambit itself. meticulously maintained, beautifully decorated and homey. comfortable berths. always a convenient place to put things which is important on a boat! … our meals were also amazing! so tasty and beautifully presented by val.
