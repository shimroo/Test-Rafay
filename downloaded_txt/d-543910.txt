ray lynch best 
                          of, volume one
3 
                          new songs



          ray 
                    lynch's newest album features 3 exciting new songs — 
                    the upbeat and quirky ralph's rhapsody 
                    a playful and carefree piece named for a field mouse who resided 
                    in ray's studio as he wrote the song. the music of what happens, 
                    with spirited soaring violin improvisations and lots of rhythm, 
                    and a wild and crazy dance remix of celestial soda pop 
                    at the end of the album. all 3 songs showcase ray's musical 
                    diversity. 
          the 
                    album also includes 9 of ray's favorite songs, all digitally 
                    re-mastered from deep breakfast, no blue thing, 
                    the sky of mind, and nothing above my shoulders but the evening. 
                    add audiophile quality to the mix and you may hear things 
                    you've never heard before. . . ! the liner notes are extensive 
                    and informative, and give a lot of insight into what went 
                    into the music as it was being created.

nothing above 
                          my shoulders but the evening
       with 
                          members of the san francisco symphony



          the 
                    poetic title invites us to listen without the intervention 
                    of our minds getting in the way and showcases ray's classical 
                    music training. this lovely album offers a musical depth and 
                    emotional richness and marks the completion of a major phase 
                    of his artistic work. 
          beautiful, 
                    haunting melodies with songs her knees deep in your mind, 
                    the vanished gardens of cordoba, 
                    passion song, only an enjoyment, 
                    ivory, mesquite, and over easy, 
                    with members of the san francisco symphony on flute, english 
                    horn, oboe, solo strings, guitars, piano, brass, and ray's

the sky of 
                          mind
       ray 
                          lynch's debut album — available for download only



          enjoy 
                    the soft classical undertones with ray lynch's debut album 
                    the sky of mind, filled with 
                    rich, evocative strings, flute, cello, violin, recorders, 
                    and piano. soft tibetan bells usher in the first composition 
                    quandra, a soothing movement of rare beauty, 
                    followed by good news and green is here, 
                    the temple, too wounded, 
                    and pavane. 
          promoted 
                    by word-of-mouth alone, the sky of mind became an underground 
                    success, setting the stage for the platinum award winning 
                    album deep breakfast. a favorite for meditation, 
                    relaxation, and healing therapies.
