glenn's web
this has been my space on the internet for nearly 20 years, since the embryonic days of netscape 1.0 — when this was one of the first 100 "home pages" on the web. we live today in a dramatically different, net-centric age, one in which this fascinating medium is very much taken for granted and has become completely integrated into everyday life and commerce. but the internet is still a wondrous invention which epitomizes that technology is useful only when it makes a positive addition to the lives of people. so please enter and share with me these vignettes of my life, passions, family, interests and work.index





photography
i've been a photo buff since elementary school with a kodak instamatic camera. while the technology of photography has made snapshots vastly more accessible, the elements of a great photo remain composition, color and perspective, and are far more difficult to capture well. these are among my most prized photographs.gallery





genealogy
my genealogy endeavor initially started as a tribute to my father, gerry manishin — who always wanted to create a manishin family tree but sadly passed away before he could find the time to do so — and has expanded over the years as i became addicted to the challenge of tracing our roots and the thrill of finding more and more distant cousins around the world. this web-enabled database includes more than 900 relatives i have traced in my genealogical research. including the four principal families i have been researching since 1991 — manishin (manishen), baizman (bejzman), gordon and gilbert/silberstein ("pereplotcyzk" in the old country).family tree archives

journeys
some voyages, excursions, jaunts and travel dreams. these are vignettes of my favorite places on our globe over the years.



professional propaganda
my legal practice offers business, policy and litigation services for emerging growth enterprises and start-ups — bootstring to series a, ipo and beyond.



media
since the early days of the internet i've been involved in a number of high-profile legal cases leading to scores of appearances in the media.



index
a complete guide to all the content created over the years in my space on the web. (not all of them look as cool as this page.) 
















fear & loathing
my fear & loathing blog is an irreverent look at today’s electronic connected lifestyle — focusing on technology, politics, law and popular culture. launched in march 2003 and sacrilegiously brought to you ever since by one intrepid blogger.







glenn at tumblr
with the explosion of microblogging i've more recently taken to posting eclectic and typically serendipitous tidbits of digital lifestyle on tumblr. check it out. 







glenn at twitter
can't say much in 140 characters? not so some 15,000+ tweets later. i've been a thought leader of the real-time web and #hashtag communities since 2007. early adopter is an understatement.















for f1 aficionados
formula one art & genius is my celebration of the timeless qualities that have made f1 grand prix motor racing the sporting world’s most exciting spectacle for nearly seven decades. f1a&g does not focus on the breaking news stories of today, but rather on the ebbs and flows of personalities, teams and technology over the years that epitomize the f1 saga. with an eye towards history — against which all current f1 drivers must be measured — and with a keen appreciation for the legends of the sport, f1a&g offers a glimpse inside the power and glory of formula one..
