in bliss





i cannot even begin to describe my emotions right now but they are vicariously close to bliss.i received a letter yesterday from highlights magazine for children accepting one of my stories.ahhhhhhhh!i have been spontaniously erupting into squeals, songs or cheers ever since.such a small step but it's a milestone marker for me.

lost valentine





okay, my sweetheart isn't lost, in fact, he's working right now.  but i had to use the title because in spite of valentine's day we are having the lost party tonight.  or maybe it's to spite valentine's day.i love all things romantic, don't get me wrong.  i'm a girlie girl when it comes to that.  i love flowers; i love beautiful cards with more beautiful words in them; and i adore chocolate. but, i hate the expectation to do it on a certain day and how it makes people feel left out.  yuck!yesterday while i was waiting to pick up my teenage daughter, i saw girls walking out of the school building holding carnations.i cringed.did my daughter feel alone today because no one gave her one?  i suddenly had the urge to rush in and buy all the flowers to stop the madness. i spotted her walking towards me with her golden hair flipping in the wind and a red carnation in her hands.whew.ugh.i hate this.today she took money to buy flowers for her friends who may not get one.  now that is a sweet heart.for anyone that's feeling lost on valentine's day, come on over.  we can eat heart-shaped pizzas together and laugh at stupid consumerism.

warmth on a cold day





remember when you were thirteen and your mom was an idiot?  well, now i'm that mom.  and while i embrace my idiocy with open arms like paying for fast food with a baggy full of quarters or singing disney songs at the top of my lungs in the house, car and perhaps it's even escaped my lips in a store or two; i still want to believe i'm a pretty cool mom.now sure, being the mother of a newly turned thirteen year old, definitely has its share of battle scars from wars fought over the normal (and sometimes not so normal) teenage struggles.  but this morning as my daughter exited the car with fellow students swarming around her, she called out loudly, "i love you, mom."  the door slammed shut as she strolled off to the school building.  and although it was crazy cold at 7:34a.m., i suddenly felt warm--and fuzzy.

lost again





tonight was the premiere of lost.  weirdly enough, i wasn't overly anticipating it throughout the day.  but i was glad when it was time to start and the lost clubbers arrived.  my excitement rose as the opening credits began but the episode didn't move my world, so to speak.  it probably didn't help that i read rave reviews about it beforehand, so my hopes were high--a bit too high.  sigh.a neighbor lady stopped by before it began needing to borrow something and asked if it was someone's birthday.  i explained that we were watching the show lost together.  she exclaimed that she loved lost (who couldn't?  besides you, kyle) so i invited her to stay.  she didn't take me up on my offer.  of course, we might have scared her with our over-enthusiastic enthusiasm.  but it just goes to show you never know who the lost are around you. wink.  okay, it's a lousy pun.  but i'm compelled to make them with a name like that.

library contest





the library is having a fiction contest and i'm having a fit deciding what story to turn in.  i believe i have the perfect one and at the end of the day i edit it and think, "this!  this is beautiful".  then i wipe a lonely tear from my eye and go to bed happy.in the morning i wake up to re-read my amazing masterpiece only to find that through the night some elf broke into my computer to demolish it because now it's crap!  so i start over again, or scratch that story altogether, and hunt through my neatly arranged files attempting to find the next available contestant.i find it.  this!  this is the one.  and once more, i go to sleep happy. but in the morning that nasty little elf has done it again and i'm completely mortified.so i've decided to deliver my next piece to the library in the evening before it can be destroyed - that'll show the little elffing thing!

about me




literaturelover


i'm an extroverted introvert who is becoming more truthful with myself and others.  i love stories.  writing is an obsession.  i also sing constantly and tend to be compulsive about finding one song i listen to over and over driving my family to the brink of breaking my c.d.s.  i'm an okay mom who adores her kids.  i'm glad to have a  patient husband who still, after seventeen years of marriage, gives me goosebumps with his kiss.
