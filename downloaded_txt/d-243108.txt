tanger 5k registration link


















the babylon breast cancer coalition (bbcc) is a grass-roots, volunteer based nonprofit group begun by three friends sitting around a kitchen table in babylon village.  from that conversation, over 25 years ago, weâve grown and changed, but our goal remaining the same. our goal is to strive to help by assisting women/men/families in our babylon township community. in 2007 we continued to expand from breast cancer finding an urgent and pressing need to include our community members diagnosed and currently being treated for gynecological cancer.







this program was founded in 1996. our l.a.h.h. program continues to be the driving force of our nonprofit; it is where our heart lies. with this program we help alleviate the added stressors of a diagnosis and the journey of our clients. our l.a.h.h. program is funded through sponsorships, grants, donations and fundraisers. through this program we have the capability of providing needed transportation to and from chemotherapy, doctorsâ appointments, radiation visits and other services. the clients we assist are in active treatment and reside in the township of babylon.







at the bbcc we also offer high school scholarships for children from our township that meets our coalitionsâ criteria. we promote legislation to increase funding for environmental research and provide funding for breast and gynecological cancer projects. we participate in research, looking towards the future and striving for a cure.
