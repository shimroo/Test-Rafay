assistive technology of ohio is ohio's a.t. act program. 
our mission
at ohio's mission is to help ohioans with disabilities learn about or acquire assistive technology. assistive technology refers to devices, equipment or services that assist individuals with disabilities to function independently in the areas of work, home or school. we offer several programs and services to achieve that goal. we also keep up with current legislative activity that affects persons with disabilities, and educate legislators about the needs and concerns of citizens with disabilities.
assistive technology of ohio (at ohio) is a federally funded nonprofit organization that is part of the college of engineering at the ohio state university. at ohio is the officially designated tech act program for ohio.;
the federal agency of health and human services provides funding for all tech act programs. each state and u.s. territory provide appropriate services under the guidelines of the assistive technology act of 1998, as amended in 2004.

please note: we are not a grants-giving or funding organization. we do not assist in financing the purchase of adapted vans or any assistive technology.. if you need funding for a device, we might be able to direct you to resources that may provide funding, but we do not fund for finance vehicles or devices. 

we do not accept medical devices as donations. this includes wheelchairs, hospital beds, bedside commodes, cpap devices, etc. we may accept assistive technology, such as speech communication devices, video magnifiers, and of course, computers.. if you wish to donate an assistive technology device please contact us at atohio@osu,edu to see if we can accept it.
to learn more about assistive technology programs in other states, please visit the association for assistive technology act programs (atap) the national web site for state-designated assistive technology programs.
