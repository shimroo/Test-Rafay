day 135: my day hour by hour



these beautiful tulips had yellow on the inside.. it will be my 'yellow' photo of the day.the extra theme for the day was to take a picture every hour, so i set my cell phone to beep every hour on the hour, and i took a picture no matter where i was. so you won't see absolutely everything i did, just what i happened to do when the alarm went off.6 am: the day started with the alarm clock and migraine meds:7 am: it's a good morning, big kids are already done with breakfast. i am still making lunches:8 am: big kids are off to school, time to check email:9 am: doing the never ending laundry:10 am: in the bathroom at the doctor's office:11 am: just getting started with wednesday's bookkeeping work:12 pm: break for lunch!1 pm: taking a walk with dear husband and baby:2 pm: back to work:3 pm: editing photos from today:4 pm: time to head out for errands and to pick up big kids:5 pm: almost at the dry cleaners:6 pm: dinner time:7 pm: dishes and kitchen clean-up:8 pm: saying good-nite to big kids, littlest one already asleep:9 pm: on the road:10 pm: still on the road:11 pm: crashed in bed:

ephesians 1:11-12 (from the message)

it's in christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for. long before we first heard of christ and got our hopes up, he had his eye on us, had designs on us for glorious living, part of the overall purpose he is working out in everything and everyone.
