did you know  that . . .



nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the u.s.
        is believed to be shy?
on the average, shy men marry later in life?
shyness is on the increase--approximately 10% over the
        last decade or so?
shyness causes shy people to miss out on opportunities
        that others would embrace?


     welcome to "shake
          your shyness"--  

          a web site dedicated to helping people overcome
          shyness through education. on this site, we will explore the origins of shyness,
          treatment alternatives and resources available to help. but most
          importantly, you will see that shyness does not have to rule your life.
          in fact, we the shy people of the world are the true "silent
          majority," because somewhere over the course of our lifetime more
          than half of the adults in the united states and many other countries have
          struggled with shyness in one area of their life or another including . . . barbara walters,
          johnny carson, henry fonda, former president and 
          mrs. jimmy carter, 
          farrah fawcett majors, 
  
             sigourney weaver,
 nicole kidman,sally field, 
            ella fitzgerald, 
            gloria estefan 
            and many many more. so, if you're one of the "silent
            majority," welcome to the club and know that you're in very good company.   
            i know, because i'm a 
"recovering"shy person myself.


      
what is shyness, anyway? 
--  
shyness
          is feeling uncomfortable in social situations in ways that interfere
          with our ability to enjoy ourselves, to perform at the level we're
          capable of or that cause us to avoid social situations
          altogether.


                   
            shyness can vary from feeling mild to moderate discomfort in one or more areas
            of our life (e.g., meeting new people, public speaking, attending social
            functions, dating, making cold calls at work) to debilitating levels of
            anxiety that impact us in almost everything we do.   when shyness is more intense, it is often
            described as social anxiety, social phobia or panic disorder. the latter
            terms are diagnostic terms used by health care professionals who treat people
            struggling with more intense forms of social discomfort.


               
            
                
          because shyness can affect one area of our life and not others, it's possible
          for shy people to appear outgoing to people looking in from the outside.
          most of you have heard of actors who go on stage and deliver a brilliant
          performance, but are shy and timid in their real life. some of you will
          be able to relate, because you're able to be more outgoing at work than you
          are in you personal life.; but why?


                 
          the answer is simple. when we're at work, we're given a role to play
          that role legitimizes us in our own eyes and the eyes of others. we're
          not calling for ourselves, we're calling on behalf of our company. if
          we're rejected the company takes part of the fall. but when we call on
          our own behalf, whatever rejection may follow is far more
          personal.


     shyness and me --  

          let me introduce myself. my name is 
          dr. renee gilbert. i am a licensed clinical psychologist and 
"recovering shy person." 
 i say "recovering," because like so shy many people,
          i've never completely overcome my shyness. just when i think i've licked it,
          something comes along to catch me off guard and those old familiar feelings of
          wanting to hide, dive under a table or run for cover come rushing
          back. you know the feelings--the ones where your heart races, your body temperature rises
          and it feels like your stomach has dropped down to your feet. it's just that most of
          the time, these days, those feelings are only a vague memory. but when
          they do come back--when i do feel shy, my shyness no longer rules my life--not
          for long anyway. these days i know i can do something about it.
          and so can you. you just need to know where to start.


               shyness and
          you --  i'm not going to kid
          you.  it takes time to get over being shy. it took me years.
          but then again, i didn't have anyone to guide me. i had to learn
          everything the hard way. but the good news is, the farther along i got, the
          better i felt. i felt better at the end of year one than i did before i
          started and better at the end of year two than i did at the end of year one. you
          get the picture.


                  when you've
          been living with shyness a lifetime, it's unrealistic to think
          you can get rid of it overnight.  but if you make a commitment to work a
          program year after year, the results can be dramatic and you don't have to
          wait until you've finished learning everything there is to know to reap the
          benefits.  most people notice a difference right from the start. 
          it's just that you don't get "over" being shy all that
          quickly.


                    as a former
          guitar teacher, i think about shyness the same way i used to think about
          learning to play a musical instrument. you don't have to be a
          virtuoso to learn a few things that sound pretty good and can go a long way
          toward impressing your friends. and so, too, by learning a few social skills
          and strategies for handling your anxiety---and in some cases, exploring the
          possibility of medication---many of you will experience relief early on.

          but to truly get over your shyness---know that it takes work, time, commitment
          and a plan---and it helps to have a little support along the way.  when it
          doubt---heed this message--get help!  the help can help!
        it is my
          hope that this website can point you in the direction of some of the things
          you can do to overcome your shyness.  it is a work in progress and i hope
          that as you return you will gradually see new and different things that can
          help you along your way.


               
                     
                          
                          
                          
                          
                          
                          
                          
                      

        best wishes to you on your journey
