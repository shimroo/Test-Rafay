    about our fabrics

 all of our fabrics are up to code with the current flame resistant tests.

we also offer intelligent fabric features on some of our fabrics that include:

 
      

  antibacterial / antiviral
in the healthcare sector, fabrics need to offer even more functionality, this feature is the solution for hospitals and everyone who places gerat emphasis on hygiene. the number of germs and bacteria on textiles is reduced by more than 99%.

  water and oil repellant
a new method of making fabric that repels oil and water could help fabric become more environmentally friendly and sustainable.  an oil/water-repellent material is designed to prevent one or more types of oil or water from adhering to, or absorbing into, the material's surface.

  acoustic
rooms that need to look particularly prestigious often have high levels of background noise. textiles featuring this acoustic function not only offer added value in terms of aesthetics but also have a positive impact on a room's acoustics.

  air purifying
whether or not you feel at home in a room, depends on a variety of factors. in addition to the visual impression, the ambient air plays a major role in creating a pleasant atmopshere. the air-purifying function of this feature means that fresh ambient air is a given at any time.

  blackout
blackout curtains reduce energy costs by cutting the amount of sunlight and uv rays that enter the room. in addition, they protect furniture and floors from sun damage and fading, which makes these high-cost products more durable.
