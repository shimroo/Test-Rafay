compiled and released to coincide with the major new exhibit “time is a mirror” at the country music hall of fame & museum in nashville, tn, the essential collection is a definitive look back at 40+ years of rosanne cash’s recording career. the music herein traces her artistic journey from nashville to new york city (by way of los angeles) while celebrating her incredible commercial success in both country and americana music. from “seven year ache,” her first of an astonishing ten number one country hits to the 3x grammy-winning the river and the thread, the collection is both a staggering overview and a perfect introduction for new and casual fans.“rosanne cash may be her own best curator. born into a beloved and daunting family, she first kept her distance from that history, then chose to explore and reshape it. she picks up, and then turns sideways from, assorted musical legacies: country music, pop sounds of the moment, singer-songwriter conventions get probed and upended in her work.  no simple timeline will do. she – like country music and the constitution – is a living record.rosanne cash – essential collection creates a space, one in which cash, who began making records in the late 1970s, controls the stories she tells, the masks she wears, the light shed.”-from the liner notes by rj smith (country music hall of fame & museum)“two discs, forty years. sometimes i felt it didn’t matter, and then one of you—maybe one of you who is reading this right now— told me after a show or wrote me a letter saying that one of these songs helped you through a break-up or a death, or was played at a wedding or a funeral, or maybe that it just soothed you at the end of a grueling day, or inspired you to write your own songs. thank you. i heard you.i couldn’t have done anything else in my life but write songs and make music, so i’m lucky i was able to carve a spot and have it held open by so many people, most especially the fans.artists do evolve— if in nothing else, then in gratitude, and in the realization that time is the most precious resource.i don’t enshrine the work here, but i treasure it.this is how i spent my time.”-from the liner notes by rosanne cash
