welcome to the gm service technical college
the primary goal of the award-winning general motors service technical college (gm stc) training program is to ensure that each service technician in more than 4,200 u.s. dealerships is thoroughly trained to fix increasingly complex vehicles right the first time and deliver an exceptional customer service experience.

training goals
this comprehensive service technician training is a blended, performance-based curriculum that drives technicians toward achieving annual service training standards (sts); these standards align to ase certification categories. the curriculum enables techs to conveniently take training in-dealership, at off-site training centers, and via mobile (i.e., tablet and smartphone). the delivery mix includes web-based, online instructor-led, hands-on, video on demand, performance support objects, interactive video, and diagnostic exercises. this media mix enables technicians to improve their product knowledge and advance their repair and diagnostic skills while spending less time away from the dealership.
gm stc helps service technicians achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction in dealer service by structuring their training around a standard performance-based curriculum. the curriculum provides a blended approach to training, dividing training between in-dealership and off-site locations. with the right mix of training methods, a growing number of technicians are able to demonstrate they are ready to “fix it right the first time!” 
improved service quality leads to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty to the dealership and the product; improved customer satisfaction also helps the dealer achieve long-term profitability.
