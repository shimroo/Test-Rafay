47 years of history
davis auto sales

what customers say about
							davis auto sales










i've had my duramax for a little under a year now and she's been everything i could ask for and more. the davis team made the process of buying out of state quick and painless, i still check back on the website from time to time to look at the new inventory coming in, hands down some of the nicest, cleanest used trucks you could find, highly recommend.

gail and j.w. made an easy purchase experience for their expertise: a ford excursion. nick even brought it to the airport for us! the truck is clean and has been touched up throughout, and flip is good on their warranty. this family business represents everything that is good about the south - honesty, integrity and respect - thank you!
