4.5see all reviewswrite a review4.9see all reviewswrite a review4.1see all reviewswrite a reviewmichael c.14:54 20 may 24great location, tough to beat. but the front desk needs some training. asked for few bottles of water and he looked terrorized.  he was very hesitant and said "well, we have sink water to drink".  are you kidding me? we paid $415 plus taxes for one night (a wee bit overpriced lol) and it was root canal to get a bottle of water or two. he looked so irritated.  absolutely incredible. i suppose they have no real competition. room was nice overall. old building w low ceilings. tv was outdated/slow. great view.tara l.02:57 22 apr 24we’ve stayed here numerous times and absolutely love it. my oldest child is 4 and loves coming to the beach; when we pull into the parking lot, she literally smiles and says “feels like home!”… the entire hotel is beautiful and immaculately clean. the front desk staff is attentive to every need. the food at the hotel restaurant is top notch, plus they offer room service (and we love kathy!). the rooms are clean and the oceanfront views are perfect. this is our favorite place to stay in ocnj, and we keep coming back for more!mark h.19:18 03 mar 24had a great breakfast with the best view in town. highly recommend
