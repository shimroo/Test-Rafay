green mill jazz

welcome!
if you’ve been to the green mill, you probably know a lot of the stuff written here.  but if you haven’t been to the green mill, here’s stuff you are going to want to know:
in general, the green mill hours are sunday through thursday, 4pm to 1:11am (yes, we mean 1:11 am, that is not a typo); friday, 4pm to 2am and saturday, 1pm to 2am.  we have live music seven nights a week.  for the uptown poetry slam sundays (the third sunday of every month), the green mill will open at 2pm. and we take cash only.
fun stuff you should know:  bands play from 8pm – midnight.  tuesday and thursday nights we feature bands that play dance music.  this means you can dance on tuesday and thursday nights.  we have a parking lot.  and we take cash only.
other stuff that’s not so fun you should know:  we do not take reservations. we don’t make drinks with egg whites.  we don’t make mojitos. and we take cash only. 

keep checking our website to keep up with our changes.  and keep coming back to see us, have a drink and listen to some good music, comedy or poetry.  we hope to see you soon!
