scottish land rover owners club

a warm welcome is extended to you from scotland’s longest established land rover club with events to cater for most types of off-road driving.
the land rover owner’s club was started in the 1950’s and in october 1958 the scottish sector was formed, later to become the scottish land rover owners club.
over 400 members range from race enthusiasts (who find handling a v8 special more exciting, and often cheaper, than rallying or circuit racing) to the majority, who have standard, production, vehicles for work or pleasure and just want to have occasional fun without much risk of damage.
a number of members do not have a land rover at all, but join to enjoy the company of friends and simply like to be involved.
