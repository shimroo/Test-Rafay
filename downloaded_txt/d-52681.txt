how slavery continues to undermine american democracyamerica
is not now and has never been a democracy. the american system of
government was originally designed by slave holders specifically to
protect slave-holding from popular opposition in a country were the
majority of people opposed slavery. prior to the civil war american
politics was dominated by the south, despite the fact that 70%
of american citizens lived in the free north. this wasn't a fluke,
it was a feature.
