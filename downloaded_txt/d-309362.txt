(imi), a global electronics manufacturing expert and zero motorcycles, a california-based manufacturer of 100% electric motorcycles, yesterday inaugurated the first high powered e-motorcycle manufacturing assembly line at the laguna technopark facility of imi. the historic ribbon-cutting ceremony was led by arthur tan, ceo of imi; sam paschel, ceo of zero motorcycles; heather variava, deputy chief of mission of the us embassy in the philippines; gov. marjorie ramos-samaniego, department of trade & industry – board of investments, corieh dichosa, executive director of the philippine board of investments; gen. james andres melad (ret.), assistant secretary for road transport and infrastructure of dotr; and vivian santos, deputy director general for operations of peza. the strategic manufacturing collaboration between the two companies will help address the global demand for high-powered motorcycles and will increase access to the world’s full-sized all-e-motorcycles, with a projection of about 16 thousand bikes per year in 2025. showcased during the inauguration was the full electric motorcycle assembly, the battery assembly set-up (modules and electronics) as well as the first units that were assembled in the country. “the partnership will further strengthen our firm commitment in carrying out the development of ev ecosystem in the philippines while securing a greener future for the filipinos,” asserted tan. imi is uniquely positioned to have both the competency of electronics manufacturing as well as e-bike assembly under one roof,” he added. “for us, imi is a perfect partner to expand our manufacturing in the region, a good place to build a global base,” said paschel. this complements imi’s manufacturing and supply of ev chargers which are currently integrated and installed by greenstrum in more than 50 sites across the country. earlier this year, the signing of the memorandum of agreement between the two companies was witnessed by president ferdinand marcos jr. last may in washington, d.c. the cooperation agreement has a projected amount of usd65 million annually to support the philippines’ development of its electric vehicle ecosystem.  imi continues to strengthen its presence in the ecosystem through its partnership with greenstrum while powering these charging systems and ensuring a sustainable and reliable...
