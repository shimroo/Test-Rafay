welcome to heartsite.com
this web site was designed to provide information to patients who are being evaluated and treated for a heart-related complaint. all contents are reviewed by physicians to ensure accuracy. our objective is to educate. the information on this web site is meant to supplement and not to replace those obtained from your personal physician. please consult your physician because a specific disease, test or treatment may not be applicable to your case. to facilitate understanding, tools and lectures were designed from the ground up instead of scanning in traditional textbooks or videotaping a slide presentation and then modifying it for use on the internet. this site includes panoramic views, 3d animation, online lectures, narrations, streaming instructional video, and easy to understand animated examples.

all of the material on this web site is made up of original work designed by the web site team and reviewed by the medical editor (see below). 





  
 heart basics 101  provides the viewer with fundamental information about the structure and function of the heart. 




  
 history of illness: the cardiac evaluation begins with the patient being interviewed by the physician to obtain a detailed history of his or her illness. 






  
 physical examination: during this phase of the cardiac evaluation, the patient is examined by the physician. 




  
 chest x-ray: this test helps answer questions about the size of the heart, fluid in the lungs, pneumonia and multiple other abnormalities that may be accounting for the patient's problems. 






  
 ekg or electrocardiogram: the electrocardiogram provides important information about the presence of coronary artery disease, heart rhythm and other cardiac issues. 
 


  
 echocardiogram: this test is uses ultrasound to examine the heart chambers, valves and the lining of the heart. 






  
 tee or te echocardiogram: tee uses ultrasound to examine the heart with the use of a probe that looks at the heart from the back. 



  

stress echo: this test is uses ultrasound to examine the heart, before and immediately after exercise or chemical stress and uncover problems such as coronary artery disease. 







 
 treadmill test: the patient walks on a treadmill while the blood pressure and ekg are monitored. it evaluates the heart's response to exercise and helps uncover problems such as coronary blockages and heart rhythm abnormalities. 



  
 chemical stress test: the test is similar to the treadmill test (left), except that chemical stress is used (instead of exercise) to help uncover problems such as coronary blockages. 






  
 isotope stress test: an isotope tracer is used to increase the accuracy of a stress test in helping diagnose coronary artery disease. 
 


  
 tilt table test: the test is used to diagnose a specific cause of syncope or black out spells that is known as neurally mediated syncope or nms. 






  
 holter monitor: this is a 24 hour tape recording of the patient's ekg. it is used to diagnose the cause of symptoms such as black outs, dizziness, irregular heart beats and coronary artery spasm. 



  
 cardiac cath or angiogram: a thin and flexible tube or catheter is inserted into the blood vessel of the arm or leg and guided to the heart with the use of x-ray. contrast or "dye" is injected to help diagnose heart disease. 






  
 ptca or balloon angioplasty: a thin catheter is guided to a coronary artery blockage. a small balloon at its tip is then inflated and deflated to open up the coronary artery blockage. the balloon catheter is then removed. 



  
 coronary stent: this technique uses a stent or narrow stainless steel wire mesh to open up a coronary blockage. the stent is delivered to the site by a ptca balloon (left). 






  
  drug coated stent: the stent is coated with a medicine to reduce the chance of a coronary artery blockage from returning in the same area. 
 


  
 coronary artery disease: the onset, symptoms and treatment of this disease is discussed. 






  
 heart attack or acute mi: this section provides fundamental details about a heart attack together with its cause, symptoms and treatment. 



  
 heart failure or chf: using easy to understand examples, this section provides fundamental information about congestive heart failure, together with its cause, symptoms and treatment. 






  
 on-line lectures: this uses a familiar classroom lecture format. we balance simplicity with the needed depth of information. animations and common analogies are used to illustrate points. 



  
 site info: this section provides information about heatsite.com to our valued visitors.
