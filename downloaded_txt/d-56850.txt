 the amc difference
     

our name
our standard  
 amc is an internationally recognized brand that stands for quality and independence in the mining industry. it means that when you see the amc logo on a report, you know it’s a report that you can trust.

 and when the decisions you make today can affect the future value of your mine, you need to know you are basing decisions on reports with mining solutions you can trust.


 ↓




  

driven
by data  
 every report produced by amc is underpinned by our smartdata™ — the world’s most comprehensive site-level, validated, data set.

 our smartdata™ is filled with mining cost and productivity data across mining methods, commodity types, geographies, and more — collected and validated at site level to ensure accuracy.this data enables us to rapidly benchmark and cross-check new data, providing an unprecedented level of insight and accuracy in our mining strategy recommendations. it also drives our two world-leading cost modelling systems, which regularly deliver estimates within 5% of actuals.


 ↓




  

frontline
experience  
 recommendations long in theory and low in practicality destroy more value than they create. that's why we only employ career miners with exceptional experience and the highest integrity to unearth the most value out of your mine.

 people who understand both the art and science of mining, who won't avoid the reality of the challenge - because while our data and systems are world-leading it’s still our people who define us.

 lidya madencilik san ve tic as hod maden project "amc has made valuable contributions to our project team in successfully completing the critical design phases of the hod maden project. amc played an important role in getting the investment decision of the project by successfully performing resource modelling, geotechnical assessments, underground mine design, production planning, ventilation, dewatering, geometallurgy studies and economic analysis. in all processes, amc provided full support at any time of need, as well as effective communication, problem-solving and result-oriented work in a team spirit." -
