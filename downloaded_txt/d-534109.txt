proclaiming christ in word and sacrament
we are a global missionary communion that is orthodox in doctrine, anglican in practice, and catholic in order.





;








word

the holy scriptures are god’s word written. the scriptures contain all things that are required as necessary to be believed unto salvation.





sacrament

the sacraments are more than just mere symbols, the sacraments are a means of grace. the sacraments of baptism and holy communion are “generally necessary to salvation.”
