casper aviation platoon



















origin & brief history
casper aviation platoon was the only separate aviation platoon in the united states army during the vietnam war.  casper was organized with the 173d airborne brigade on okinawa in 1963 and arrived in country with the brigade on may 5, 1965 becoming the first united states army ground unit committed to the vietnam war. casper platoon supported the brigade until they all left vietnam in august 1971.  
casper flew almost every type of heliborne mission there was including resupply, visual reconnaissance, snoopy, nighthawk, dust off, command & control and combat assault missions.  besides loyalty and dedication to their job, caspers had the highest "extension" rate in the brigade.  casper platoon veterans served the 173d airborne brigade proudly during their "tour of duty" and continue to be honored today for their service in vietnam.
"this website is dedicated to all of the men who served in casper aviation platoon"






lz english, bong son, 1969
during our tour of duty in vietnam, the casper platoon was relocated four times and finally called lz english our home from early 1968 to 1971. casper's "ghost town" was located on the east side of lz english and right next to what we called  "sniper village.â this was a popular vc area after the sun went down.

about our patches
casper the friendly ghost was our original call sign.  it was shortened later in 1965 to just "casper.â  from that point on, our helicopter group was proudly known as the casper aviation platoon.
the original casper platoon "ghost" was first painted by a pilot in early 1965. it was then quickly used by all of the caspers after that. 
there were at least three different casper platoon patches that crewmen wore in vietnam from 1965-1971:
