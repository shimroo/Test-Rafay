crime scene analysis and shooting reconstruction




my primary interest is in the reconstruction of shooting incidents, the human and mechanical dynamics of shooting and the science of wound ballistics which relates to the use of firearms against humans and specifically to the interaction of projectiles and the human body. i perform firearms and ballistic research with high-speed video, still camera systems and a doppler ballistic radar system.i am also a  forensic photographer specializing in crime scene, evidence, and wound photography, digital imaging --  and video, photograph, and image analysis.
