	 kirk complains that dog bites man? giannoulias and brady pay only the required income taxes
	 
    


alexi giannoulias, meet bill bradythe big issue in the u. s. senate and gubernatorial races in illinois continues to be why didn't the candidate pay more in taxes than he was legally required to pay. doesn't john q. citizen do that? not really, but it is argued that your average taxpayer has salaried income and no business losses, so he can't understand how a pol who gets a salary doesn't pay income taxes on that salary. a few months ago it was state senator and illinois republican gov nominee bill brady who was taken to task by gov. quinn and the pundits for paying little or no income taxes in certain years because his business losses offset salary income received for his state senate duties. he had no net income so he paid no income taxes.  what a sin! brady could have imitated steve martin and said: "well, excuuuuse me."a few days ago, state treasurer and democratic u. s. senate nominee alexi giannoulias disclosed that he paid no income taxes because his big time losses from the broadway bank failure swamped his state treasurer salary, meaning like republican brady, he had no net income for 2009, and therefore owed no income taxes. mark steven kirk: better than your average pol or just not a businessman? cong. mark kirk (republican nominee for u. s. senate) tried to be "fair and balanced" by stating in yesterday's news conference that both brady and giannoulias should have found a way to pay income taxes on their government salaries. yes, i suppose they both could have sent a check to illinois and the feds (or not asked for a refund) for the taxes that would have been due on their government salaries, had they incurred no business losses.  but, then logically, shouldn't kirk have examined gov. quinn's income tax returns and if quinn had taken say, a deduction for charitable contributions in excess of that taken by the average taxpayer, shouldn't kirk have gone after gov. quinn, too.further, what if cong. kirk had taken a mortgage interest deduction in excess of that of the average taxpayer, should senate candidate kirk have gone after cong. kirk for not paying more in income taxes that he was legally required to pay.now is the time?  or, do you suppose voters would rather hear cong. kirk and treasurer giannoulias talk about their specific positions on past, present and future tax increases or tax decreases? i mean now that kirk has almost dropped, sort of, for a while, his attacks on giannoulias' broadway bank sub-par lending performance and giannoulias has almost dropped, sort of, for a while, his attacks on kirk's misrepresentations of his military and teaching experience, is it time to start focusing on national issues such as unemployment, tax rate change, government spending, illegal immigration, iran's acquisition of a nuclear capability,  etc.?i mean i am just asking. is it time?

	 should carol marin have challenged alexi giannoulias’ facts last night? did she?
	 
    


the carol marin interview last night on chicago tonight seemed, on its face, to cover all bases.  you wouldn’t say that marin was throwing softballs at alexi giannoulias, state treasurer and the democratic party's u. s. senate candidate nominee.  but, as you watched the twenty-three minute interview, you had the impression something was amiss.  do giannoulias’ facts hold up? and, that something is this statement by alexi, less than 9% were loans that were initiated [by me] during the time…i think it’s in the realm of twenty million dollars worth of loans that are now non- performing…so approximately twenty million dollars [of our family bank’s current non-performing assets were initiated by me] …the non-performing assets are in the range of $240 million dollars. [emphasis supplied]questions berkowitz would have asked if he had been co-hosting with carol berkowitz: so, let me get this straight, alexi, it was reported last december and in january:from 2002 to 2006, alexi giannoulias increased construction & development loans from $80 million to $356 million – expanding such risky investments from 25 percent to 46 percent of the bank’s total loan portfolio. (chicago reader, alexi’s albatross, 12/3/09)from 2002 to 2006, alexi giannoulias increased the bank’s brokered deposits (also known as “hot money”) fourfold to $640 million. the typical bank at this point was growing brokered deposits at about 9 percent a year. (“as lender, senate candidate impacted bank woes,” new york times, 1/30/10)when alexi giannoulias left the bank, the ratio of brokered deposits to total assets at broadway was 68 percent, according to fdic records. the average for all federally insured banks nationwide was 4.5 percent. (chicago reader, alexi’s albatross, 12/3/09)[hat tips for all of the above to rich miller’s capitolfax blog, kirk for senate press release and of course the chicago reader and the new york times]. berkowitz: so, alexi, how do you square those facts with your assertion that you “initiated only 9% of your family bank’s current, non-performing loans.” i mean the risky construction and development loans more than quadrupled during your tenure as chief loan officer, right?berkowitz: and, during your tenure as the chief loan officer, alexi, the hot money brokered deposits increased fourfold, right? berkowitz: further, if you were going to be able to pay higher interest rates to attract the hot money, you had to issue riskier loans to get the higher rates of return, right?  berkowitz: so, it doesn’t make any sense that you could be responsible for only 9% of the bank’s non-performing loans, does it?  i mean, when were all the bad loans made? in 2007 and 2008? i mean, the bush bailouts started in fall, 2008, so your family bank only had nine months, at most in 2008 and all of 2007 to make those bad loans. berkowitz: unless you are telling me the bad loans were made prior to 2002? is that your argument?berkowitz: or, are you saying that you weren’t really the chief loan officer in 2002 to 2006?  but, didn’t you say you were when you ran for state treasurer in 2006? **********************************************challenge, probe and follow-up well, maybe alexi giannoulias has good answers to the above. and, maybe the questions are based on erroneous premises.  but, if so, the only way to find out is to ask the questions.  challenge, probe and follow-up. isn’t that what medill teaches?   *********************************  the secret to a good interviewabout a decade ago, i asked the late john callaway, the original host of chicago tonight, “what’s the secret to a good interview.”  mr. callaway said,” start with a script. if the guest gets engaged, throw away the script.”  words to live by. i try to follow them every week on “public affairs with jeff berkowitz.”well, when alexi came up with that 9% statement, that was the big number of the night.  whatever i had planned or scripted, i would have tossed that out. because the guest had become engaged with the 9% number.  so, engage alexi. that should have been the show. i think that’s what john callaway would have done. at least for five minutes. i mean, we had twenty-three. carol marin and i would make a good team. that’s what i think. a good cop and a bad cop routine. i’m not sure if we would always play the same role. perhaps we could take turns.  but one thing is for sure, the show would be engaging. don’t you agree?  **************************************more than 120 of our shows from the last two years are posted on the public affairs youtube page . now streaming is a 45 second clip of berkowitz questioning obama; and our most recent shows including a show w/ state rep. julie hamos; a show w/former state senator steve rauschenberger, (r-elgin)state senator and state treasurer candidate dan rutherford (r-pontiac); a berkowitz exchange w/10th cd republican primary candidate beth coulson [clip from 2000] and berkowitz exchanges with the republican primary candidates for governor;  pat hughes (hinsdale), u. s. senate candidate in the republican primary;  republican primary gov candidate dan proft; paul vallas, supt. of the recovery school district of new orleans;  10th cong. district republican primary candidate arie friedman, m.d.

and his views on tax increases, school choice, charter schools, the size of the state budget deficit and dealing with the state budget deficit.  dan proft, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding alleged illegal campaign contributions received by mckenna's campaign, the il gop "getting its brains beat out by voters," proft's assessment of mckenna and proft's proposed income tax cuts.   sen. bill brady, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding his views on school choice-school vouchers, tax credits for a parent's school tuition costs and dealing with the state budget deficit.   dupage county board chairman bob schillerstrom, who withdrew on jan. 22, 2010 as an il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses zero based budgeting, his willingness to sign the americans for tax reform pledge not to support net increases in taxes and dealing with the state budget deficit.  former two term attorney general jim ryan, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses his 2007 statement to jeff berkowitz that he favored increasing illinois taxes by more than five billion dollars; his current position that he would not increase taxes in illinois; whether he is willing to pledge not to increase taxes for four years and the impact of the state of the economy on his views about increasing taxes. ryan also discusses his historical relationship with stu levine, who was convicted of public corruption; his views about people trying to "smear him," why sen. bill brady wanted ryan's endorsement in 2006 for governor and whether or not "ryan brought levine to then gov. jim edgar," and "would it matter if ryan had."  state sen kirk dillard,  il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding his proposal for meaningful tax credits for a parent's school tuition costs, his opposition to tax increases and why he thinks he would be the best republican to take on the democratic candidate for governor in the general election.   adam andrzejewski, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding his views on how to deal with the state's budget deficit without raising taxes and in particular how he would cut state spending in the range of ten billion dollars.   all of the above discussions by the seven candidates for governor in the il republican primary consist of video clips from press availabilities on january 13, 2010 that took place in the abc-7 chicago studio after a debate sponsored by abc-7 chicago, the league of women voters of illinois and the better government association. bob schillerstrom, chairman of the dupage county is included in this afternoon's program even though he withdrew as a candidate for governor, subsequent to the taping on january 13, 2010.      ************************************     the public affairs show featuring the il republican primary candidates for governor and state rep. beth coulson, a 10th cong. district republican primary candidate, airs this coming monday night, feb. 1, 2010 throughout the city of aurora and surrounding areas at 7:30 pm on actv-10. the program also airs at 3:30 pm on next tuesday (election day) in aurora on actv-10 and surrounding areas.  the aurora station, actv-10, aka aurora community television, comcast cable ch. 10, reaches all of aurora, bristol, big rock and parts of oswego, sandwich, sugar grove and montgomery.**************************************************the public affairs show featuring the il republican primary candidates for governor and state rep. beth coulson, a 10th cong. district republican primary candidate, is being cablecast in a special election week time slot throughout the city of chicago on this  afternoon at 5:00 pm on cable ch. 21. ******************************************public affairs airs on all cable outlets into the above referenced areas, but we do not air on satellite transmissions, e.g., dish and directtv.****************************************more than 120 of our shows from the last two years are posted on the public affairs youtube page . now streaming are our most recent shows including a show w/state senator and state treasurer candidate dan rutherford (r-pontiac);

	 quinn puts hynes away at wvon: game, set and match
	 
    


if gov. pat quinn has any competence and any discipline left in his tired bones and intellect, notwithstanding what harold washington said to joel weisman twenty-two years ago about that, pat quinn will be the democratic nominee for governor this fall.  you can take that to the bank, maybe even alexi giannoulias' broadway bank, and still collect interest.   *****************************in what was apparently the final debate of the democratic gubernatorial primary, illinois’ current accidental governor, pat quinn, caught a break yesterday and probably will ride it home to victory on tuesday. neither of these candidates has a lot of charm, but quinn showed what he had yesterday. rich miller cites to abc-7's charles thomas, in yesterday’s capitolfax blog post by miller about the 4:00-5:00 pm debate at the black owned and largely black run [with black talent] radio station on the south side of chicago, wvon, for the proposition that the host, cliff kelley, is a big time supporter of governor quinn. kelley didn’t mind letting his bias show, as he tag teamed with quinn—leading the pounding of state comptroller dan hynes pretty good. the below is a transcript only of one segment toward the end of the show, but it probably was enough to carry the day with a substantial, but not exclusively, african-american audience. for most of the remainder of the debate, kelley was a more balanced host.  abc-7's charles thomas gives hynes credit for showing up to a debate that hynes knew would be a two on one, at least for part of the time. i also give hynes credit for showing up. but, i give him and his staff low marks for preparation. yeah, comptroller hynes faced tough and biased questioning from kelley. but, he could have come up with much better answers. hell, my cats could have come up with better answers. after this, quinn should do very well with the black vote on tuesday. with four days left, no matter what the polls say, this election is still pat quinn’s to lose.  he still could lose it. but, if quinn has any competence and any discipline left in his tired bones and intellect, notwithstanding what harold washington said to joel weisman twenty-two years ago about that, pat quinn will be the democratic nominee for governor this fall.  you can take that to the bank, maybe even broadway bank, and still collect interest.   ***************************************************         dan hynes: i laid out a proposal when i started this campaign to eliminate the deficit over three years. the deficit has grown under quinn from 9 to 13 billion dollars under one year. cliff kelley:  [analogizing hynes argument, above, to what they say about obama, kelley argued], “you’ve got to spend some money to get out of a recession.”illinois needs large deficits to grow its economy?pat quinn: yeah, they say the same thing about president obama and i think he defended himself very well [last night]. president obama asked me out to the white house when i was sworn in because he was happy i became the governor.  you know, we work very well together. just today we got 1.2 billion dollars for high speed rail, some of which will be spent right here in englewood and put a lot of people to work.pat quinn: the same with thomson prison, the president asked me to allow his officials to inspect it to buy that prison from illinois. it will create 3800 jobs, i’m working with president obama on that and it will bring a billion dollars of new income to our state. i was down there this week with rev./senator meeks when ford picked illinois as a place to create 1200 new jobs. quinn, the name dropper? dan hynes: anybody keeping count of how many names the governor drops. he is breaking a record. pat quinn: how about the defender, they endorsed me today. since 1905 the defender has been the voice of the african-american community, not only in chicago, but in the south during the bad days. the pullman porters would throw the defender off the train in order to get people the truth down in the south. kelley asks hynes: you agree your tv ad is horrific?cliff kelly:  we have gotten so many calls and so forth…in addition to all three of our congressmen and jackie grimshaw and they just thought it was horrific that you would [run this ad about what harold washington said about quinn]. do you agree—well, just comment on the piece itself.  hynes: well, its natural for the question to come up because it’s a powerful message and the words of harold washington are very powerful.  they speak to the fact that the governor was fired from his job for his inability to do his job. mayor washington …spoke of quinn’s inability to run the dept. of revenue and that he was more concerned about public relations than solving problems. and the reason that it is relevant is because that’s exactly what we’ve gotten in the last year under the governor—an inability to deal with problems—and rather a focus on public relations.hynes tries to explain away his “youthful indiscretion.”  kelley: now, if that’s true, i think that dan the people have a problem because your dad was certainly not a supporter of harold washington and you ran against barack obama [for the u. s. senate democratic party nomination in 2004]. what i am saying is [was] the intent to try to divide the black community or to draw votes from people who are racists [and] who didn’t want washington in office in the first place?dan hynes: no, the intent was to explain to people the governor’s inability to solve problems and his lack of competence…kelley tries to minimize what washington thought about quinncliff kelley: but that was years ago.dan hynes: it is not just a one-time situation. that’s the reason he was fired by mayor washington at the city of chicago department of revenue. cliff kelley: twenty years ago.dan hynes: a job that’s very similar to the job he has now.  you brought up my father and let me just speak to it. …when he ran for mayor, i was 18 years old, and i support my father and i love my father.  but, my father is not running for governor. i’m running for governor. cliff kelley: you were in the commercial. dan hynes: pardon me. cliff kelley: you were in the commercial. your father’s commercial. dan hynes: right, like i said, i support my father. cliff kelley: right. right. but, you were in the commercials where he was attacking mayor washington. dan hynes: right, i was 18 years old and i love my father and i loved him then and i support him, but the point of this commercial and the powerful nature of mayor washington’s words are very clear. it is about the fact that: pat quinn was fired from his job. because he wasn’t able to do his job and he was more concerned about public relations and that’s exactly the problem we have now in his one-year in office. cliff kelley: well, he’s had a number of offices since then and he’s done very well at them so i’m just saying to go back—dan hynes: and, people can factor that in and make a decision for themselves. kelley asks quinn to respond after kelley responded for himcliff kelley: …governor, you want to respond?pat quinn: well, i did a good job, an honest job and that’s what the people want in the governor….this is a divisive commercial, and he knows it. i was 18 years old…i worked for bobby kennedy—he was trying to bring people together when he ran for president…and i believe when you are 18… you make up your own mind. the fact is that dan hynes left the democratic party to go and try to unseat harold washington as mayor …i worked for harold washington in every single election he was in…now mr. hynes’ father who [dan hynes] supported and campaigned for… called harold washington sleazy and i think that was just plain wrong…we’re not going to let anyone go back to those days of 1980 …when people were divided… and i always was with harold washington and [dan hynes] never ever voted for harold washington nor did his father who was calling harold washington terrible names. dan hynes: …i think that, again, we’re not trying to be divisive. we have presented these words of mayor harold washington, which are directly relevant to the fact that the governor today has allowed our problems to get worse. he was fired from his job because he was not competent and he wasn’t doing a good job and that’s exactly what’s happened today. cliff kelley: but, since then he has been elected to two statewide offices…dan hynes: so, people can evaluate that. they can- cliff kelley: they have, i just wish—dan hynes: they can listen to the words of harold washington and then they can discount it or factor in…but that doesn’t mean that the words of harold washington shouldn’t be heard. and, i certainly don’t think that what my father did has anything to do with it.pat quinn: i think it is important that comptroller hynes doesn’t put his picture on those commercials that he was running…the reason is that the hynes family fought harold washington every step of the way in the 1980s when we made progress…i’d rather lose the race for governor than divide the people of illinois along the lines of race. that’s what my opponent is doing…kelley to hynes: have you ever done anything of note? cliff kelley:  …this question comes from an email from someone asking [dan], what have you done in the past? [pat quinn] has already mentioned the citizens utility board, which we all agree has helped a lot of people. …but the point is that [pat was also] able to reduce the size of the legislature through referendum—there are a number of things that pat has done, tell us, dan, what you have done? dan hynes: i have been the comptroller for 11 years.  i have been the lead voice of fiscal responsibility in this state…[many of the newspapers agree] i have the better plan to get us out of this budget mess that is growing worse under pat quinn… we are unable to make the investments [we need to] in education, in healthcare, in human services and these are the real consequences for a budget deficit that i warned about for many, many years…quinn, 11% unemployment and he is the jobs governor? pat quinn: in eleven years, he hasn’t created one job. …and, today, with the announcement of president obama…helping me as governor, i think its 5500 jobs that are going to be created by the high speed rail…we passed a job recovery bill to rebuild our schools…and to rebuild our water systems and healthcare and so on, that’s going to create 439,000 jobs; i’m the jobs governor… **************************************************

	 reflections on the wttw, channel 11 republican and democratic gubernatorial primary debates: winners, losers and media bias?
	 
    


links to short videos of questioning of mckenna, ryan and proft added at 2:00 pm on wednesday.   ***********************there were several clear winners coming out of the last two nights of debates held by wttw—ch. 11, one of the two public tv stations in the chicago metro area. monday night the debate was for the democratic nomination for governor between governor pat quinn, who moved into the position from lt. gov. in early 2009 when rod blagojevich was removed from office by the impeachment process. tuesday night it was for the republican nomination for governor, with the candidates being senator bill brady, senator kirk dillard, businessman adam andrzejewski, former ag jim ryan and media personality/political consultant dan proft. winning format the first winner was the wttw format: no league of women voters stuffy “we all take turns answering the same question,” with formalized time limits for the answers. no silly openings and closings. much more of a conversation between the moderator and the candidates, and sometimes the candidates threw questions at each other, sometimes the moderator would follow up—sometimes the follow-up would be by the moderator of a candidate’s spontaneous question.carol marin moderated on monday night and phil ponce on tuesday night. i can quibble with some bias in some of the questions and would have liked to see much more follow-up, especially by marin. but, that is a criticism on the margin. over-all, wttw, marin and ponce get a big thumbs-up for a much better format than that of the league of women voters, which sadly has almost a monopoly on these debates.  i understand one exception to that monopoly is the debate among the republican gov candidates which thom serafin moderated a few weeks ago in the western suburbs. i have not watched the video yet but have been told by many it was suburb, and like wttw, its format was a free flowing, much less formalized conversation. winner jim ryanthe second winner was probably jim ryan. putting aside the content of his and his competitor’s answers, the man just has a strong presence that commands respect both by his competitors and no doubt, the tv audience. [but, watch ryan questioned by berkowitz for four minutes on taxes- a little bit like trying to pin jello on a tree].   winner dan proftthe third winner was dan proft.  the polls, money raised and name recognition put dan in the second tier in the republican gov primary race. however, the consistency, logic and thoughtfulness of his ideas put him in the first tier. he also is developing a stronger presence and softening his hard edges. when the five candidates were asked who they would support if they couldn’t vote for themselves, jim ryan got two votes, proft got one and there were two no votes. that vote by the candidate’s peers may tell us something. [but watch the sharp tongued proft rip mckenna for two minutes for having been part of the dysfunctional il gop political establishment and for having accepted illegal campaign contributions]  mckenna, a big loser the big loser of the evening was andy mckenna, who was a no show. phil ponce reported that mckenna said he could not be there due to a conflict, i.e., mckenna was campaigning in central illinois at the time of the debate. however, ponce noted that the invitations for the debate went out on november 13, 2009.  during the debate, mckenna’s opponents ripped him for his ethical violations as state gop chair, which the republican state central committee determined occurred and for which mckenna publicly apologized.  mckenna was also ripped for not campaigning with the voters and for not showing up at other forums, as well.  mckenna was further ripped for accepting illegal campaign contributions and not returning them. you wonder if any of mckenna’s opponents has the money to turn those debate segments into an ad blasting andy. ripping mckenna was perhaps the best example of the common ground reached by mckenna’s opponents. [watch mckenna questioned for five minutes by berkowitz and others-- this performance could be why his handlers kept him off wttw last night].  liberal media bias appears again? the oddest part of the two debates was that on monday night quinn and hynes both discussed their plans to raise taxes by about four billion dollars. marin questioned them about the differences in their tax hike plans. and hynes lamented that quinn would not say he would support hynes if hynes won, with hynes worrying about the cuts in spending the republicans would make.  hynes noted that those cuts provided a good reason for quinn to say he would support hynes, if quinn lost. quinn, in another part of the debate, defended his efforts to deal with the deficit, saying he had made the cuts he could make in spending, about 2.5 billion dollars and that he could cut no more. hynes didn’t seem to differ with quinn on that. the question marin omitted so, why didn’t marin say to both hynes and quinn, if the deficit is 13 billion dollars as they argue, and each would raise taxes by only 4 billion dollars, how would they fix that nine billion dollar deficit, without “hurting real people.”  borrow nine billion dollars? if not, make cuts of nine billion dollars?  wouldn’t that be a lot of pain?  marin never asked. certainly she never pressed them on it.but, ponce led with that questionyet, ponce, on tuesday night, virtually led by asking the republicans how they could deal with that 13 billion dollar deficit “without hurting real people.” each of the republican candidates tried to discuss the cuts in spending that were necessary to deal with the deficit, and ponce essentially belittled the responses. of course, there was none of that on this issue by marin with quinn and hynes. i’m not saying there was liberal media bias in the different treatment of the issue by marin and ponce. i’m just saying. *********************************************more than 120 of our shows from the last two years are posted on the public affairs youtube page . now streaming are our most recent shows including a show w/state senator and state treasurer candidate dan rutherford (r-pontiac); a berkowitz exchange w/10th cd republican primary candidate beth coulson [clip from 2000] and berkowitz exchanges with the republican primary candidates for governor;  pat hughes (hinsdale), u. s. senate candidate in the republican primary;  republican primary gov candidate dan proft; paul vallas, supt. of the recovery school district of new orleans;  10th cong. district republican primary candidate arie friedman, m.d.

 included below is the "public affairs," airing schedule for the show we taped with il republican primary gubernatorial candidates being questioned by jeff berkowitz on january 13, 2010 and an interesting clip from september 14, 2000 of state rep. and now 10th cd republican primary candidate beth coulson explaining to jeff berkowitz why she was declining to endorse george bush for president and mark kirk for congress, in the general election.   note, the airings start this evening, at 8:30 pm or 9:00 pm (depending on the suburb) with comcast cablecasts into 35 chicago metro suburbs, mainly in suburbs north and northwest of chicago, and continue in ten north shore 10th cd suburbs up to the election. the program airs on comcast cable ch. 19 or cable ch. 35, depending on the suburb, as listed below. the program also will air in aurora, rockford and chicago (special airing), as listed below. the program is also streaming, now. ************************************************************************the above discussed show is now streaming.  ****************************      our show with clips of our 2000 interview with now 10th cd republican primary candidate beth coulson and clips of questioning of the il republican primary candidates at january 13, 2010 pressers is airing tonight in 35 chicago metro suburbs; on this wed., fri., sat., sun., and mon., in 10 of those suburbs again; and on this thur. night throughout rockford and surrounding areas; next week in aurora and surrounding areas; and on this saturday afternoon throughout the city of chicago, as listed below for all of these airings.  we may have some supplemental airings of this show and we will advise you of those as they occur.*************************************************************************this week's chicago metro suburban show featuring state rep. beth coulson interviewed on september 14, 2000 by jeff berkowitz and the seven republican primary gov candidates (as of jan. 13, 2010) questioned by jeff berkowitz, joe ryan [daily herald], jim anderson [illinois radio network] and others can now be watched in individual segments by going to the public affairs youtube page  and scrolling to and clicking on the politician of your choice.  please note that clicking the picture of coulson labelled beth coulson, il 10th cd cand. (r) will pull up the three and a half minute clip of coulson and that clicking the picture of coulson labelled coulson, 10th cd cand.(r) and 7 il gov will pull up the entire thirty minute public affairs show, airing this week in the suburbs. ***********************************************************    state rep. beth coulson (r-glenview), now an il 10th cd candidate in the republican primary, declines to endorse, on public affairs, in a show taped on september 14, 2000, george bush for president and mark kirk for congress. mark kirk, at that time, had won a ten candidate march, 2000 republican primary and was involved in a close general election with then state rep. lauren beth gash (d-highland park) to replace then cong. john porter (r-wilmette), who had decided not to seek re-election after holding the seat for 21 years. cong. porter's endorsement of mark kirk was thought to be a significant factor in kirk's primary win in 2000. cong. kirk is now seeking the republican nomination for the u. s. senate in illinois that was previously held by president obama.    as noted by the host, jeff berkowitz, in an introduction taped on jan. 17, 2010, republican beth coulson followed her non-endorsements in 2000 with similar statements on public affairs on august 22, 2002, in which she declined to endorse in the general election then republican candidates for governor, jim ryan, and for attorney general, joe birkett. in what may be considered an odd twist, cong. porter has recently endorsed beth coulson in her bid for the 10th cd seat. of course, coulson is now touting the significance of the porter endorsement, even though in 2002 she argued her voters were sophisticated and knowledgeable and didn't really need her advice on who to support for president and for 10th cong. district congressman in the general election.  state rep. coulson also discusses, in 2000, her "pro-choice," views on abortion, parental notice and "republicanism."     andy mckenna, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding alleged illegal campaign contributions received by his campaign; and his views on tax increases, school choice, charter schools, the size of the state budget deficit and dealing with the state budget deficit.  dan proft, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding alleged illegal campaign contributions received by mckenna's campaign, the il gop "getting its brains beat out by voters," proft's assessment of mckenna and proft's proposed income tax cuts.   sen. bill brady, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding his views on school choice-school vouchers, tax credits for a parent's school tuition costs and dealing with the state budget deficit.   dupage county board chairman bob schillerstrom, who withdrew on jan. 22, 2010 as an il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses zero based budgeting, his willingness to sign the americans for tax reform pledge not to support net increases in taxes and dealing with the state budget deficit.  former two term attorney general jim ryan, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses his 2007 statement to jeff berkowitz that he favored increasing illinois taxes by more than five billion dollars; his current position that he would not increase taxes in illinois; whether he is willing to pledge not to increase taxes for four years and the impact of the state of the economy on his views about increasing taxes. ryan also discusses his historical relationship with stu levine, who was convicted of public corruption; his views about people trying to "smear him," why sen. bill brady wanted ryan's endorsement in 2006 for governor and whether or not "ryan brought levine to then gov. jim edgar," and "would it matter if ryan had."  state sen kirk dillard,  il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding his proposal for meaningful tax credits for a parent's school tuition costs, his opposition to tax increases and why he thinks he would be the best republican to take on the democratic candidate for governor in the general election.   adam andrzejewski, il gov. candidate in the republican primary, discusses issues regarding his views on how to deal with the state's budget deficit without raising taxes and in particular how he would cut state spending in the range of ten billion dollars.   all of the above discussions by the seven candidates for governor in the il republican primary consist of video clips from press availabilities on january 13, 2010 that took place in the abc-7 chicago studio after a debate sponsored by abc-7 chicago, the league of women voters of illinois and the better government association. ************************************     the chicago metro suburban episode of "public affairs with jeff berkowitz," featuring the il republican primary candidates for governor and state rep. beth coulson, a 10th cong. district republican primary candidate is airing tonight, tuesday night, jan. 26 at 8:30 pm on comcast cable channel 19 in buffalo grove, elk grove village, hoffman estates, parts of inverness, lincolnwood, morton grove, niles, northfield, palatine, rolling meadows, wilmette and tonight at 9:00 pm on comcast cable ch. 19 in  bannockburn, deerfield, ft. sheridan, glencoe, highland park, highwood, kenilworth, lincolnshire, riverwoods and winnetka.and tonight at 8:30 pm on comcast cable channel 35 in arlington heights, bartlett, glenview, golf, des plaines, hanover park, mt. prospect, northbrook, park ridge, prospect heights, schaumburg, skokie, streamwood and wheeling.  and on wed. night at 8:30 pm, fri. night at 8:00 pm, sat.. night at 6:30 pm, sun. night at 8:30 pm and mon. night on comcast cable ch. 19 in bannockburn, deerfield, ft. sheridan, glencoe, highland park, highwood, kenilworth, lincolnshire, riverwoods and winnetka********************************************************the "public affairs," show featuring the il republican primary candidates for governor and state rep. beth coulson, a 10th cong. district republican primary candidate, airs throughout the city of rockford (and in surrounding areas) this thursday night, january 28 at 8:00 pm on comcast cable ch. 17. the surrounding areas reached by comcast cable ch. 17, in addition to rockford, include byron, cedarville, cherry valley, loves park, machesney park, mount morris, new milford, portions of ogle county, oregon, polo, stillman valley, winnebago, portions of boone county and poplar grove.****************************************************************the public affairs show featuring the il republican primary candidates for governor and state rep. beth coulson, a 10th cong. district republican primary candidate, airs this coming monday night, feb. 1, 2010 throughout the city of aurora and surrounding areas at 7:30 pm on actv-10. the program also airs at 3:30 pm on next tuesday (election day) in aurora on actv-10 and surrounding areas.  the aurora station, actv-10, aka aurora community television, comcast cable ch. 10, reaches all of aurora, bristol, big rock and parts of oswego, sandwich, sugar grove and montgomery.**************************************************the public affairs show featuring the il republican primary candidates for governor and state rep. beth coulson, a 10th cong. district republican primary candidate, will be cablecast in a special election week time slot throughout the city of chicago on this saturday afternoon at 5:00 pm on cable ch. 21. ******************************************public affairs airs on all cable outlets into the above referenced areas, but we do not air on satellite transmissions, e.g., dish and directtv.****************************************more than 120 of our shows from the last two years are posted on the public affairs youtube page . now streaming are our most recent shows including a show w/state senator and state treasurer candidate dan rutherford (r-pontiac);

	 the 10th cd race: could coulson's sep. 14, 2000 failure to endorse bush and kirk on tv be the deciding factor? watch and you decide. cable/streaming
	 
    


i know that coulson's non-endorsement of kirk was way before his moderation was demonstrated,  but still, republican primary voters might ask, mark kirk, that's the guy republican coulson thought was "too conservative," for her to risk endorsing him over democrat gash in coulson's liberal state house district, and coulson wants us to support her as the republican nominee for  congresswoman from this district?**************************************september 14, 2000 and republican beth coulson hadn't picked between bush and gore?jeff berkowitz: i assume you are supporting george w. bush as the presidential candidatestate rep. beth coulson [r-glenview, il., 57th dist.]: i am not supporting any particular presidential candidate. watch the coulson-berkowitz clip hereberkowitz: you are not? you are not supporting the republican candidate in the presidential election?coulson: i didn’t say that.berkowitz: all right, what did you say?coulson: i haven’t picked. it is my private vote; just like it is your private vote. i have to wait and see where they are on some of the issues that are important to me, and, that is my personal opinion, but i also need to wait and see, and my attitude is my voters have the decision to make, so i don’t think i should endorse any particular candidate.berkowitz: and you don’t think you will prior to nov. 7.coulson: no, i don’t.sep. 14, 2000 and republican state rep. coulson hadn't picked yet between lauren beth gash (d) and mark kirk(r)? she didn't know where they stood?jeff berkowitz: and, in the 10th cong. district race, where mark kirk is the republican candidate and lauren beth gash is the democratic candidate, are you making an endorsement or your preference known publicly there?coulson: once again, i don’t know exactly where they stand on some very important issues that are important to me and important to my constituents. so, i can’t say that i won’t, but i have not yet [as of sep. 14, 2000].berkowitz: but you might, before nov. 7 [2000]?coulson: i suppose i might, if it would really make a difference. i am not sure that it would.berkowitz: well, beth, you carry a lot of clout in this area. i think you are underestimating what you could do. i am serious.coulson: i feel we have very sophisticated, educated voters and they usually want to make decisions for themselves.*******************************************************september 14, 2000 and beth coulson (r) couldn't decide between bush and gore because she was "not privy to the federal budget." jeff berkowitz: i think george w. bush—here is a little secret—i have heard him speak, i know you have and it sounds to me, if you have to pick between george w. bush and al gore, and one of your criteria is whether the candidates believe in limited government, then, you know, it is somewhat of a joke, but it is somewhat true, people are saying-- al gore wants a trillion dollar spending program and george w. bush wants a trillion dollar tax decrease. pretty stark choice there, so if you believe in limited government, as you said, less government, i assume less spending, less taxes, everything else equal, then i would think you would favor george w. bush.coulson: i think that may be true, but i don’t know what he [george bush] wants to spend it on and what they want to cut and i am not privy to the budget in the federal government...again, to me, it is a private vote that i am going to be making. i don’t think i need to endorse a particular candidate.from "public affairs with jeff berkowitz." the interview with state rep. beth coulson (r-glenview), transcribed, in part, above, was recorded, live to tape, on september 14, 2000.watch the coulson-berkowitz clip here******************************************************beth coulson: shockingly neutral on party identification or loyalty?well, you have to admit, no matter who you support in the 10th cd or even if you are indifferent to who wins in the 10th cd, the above exchange is quite shocking. most, if not all, officeholders or people seeking office in the general election support or endorse members of their own party, and most of them support their party's presidential or congressional candidates for the district in which they reside. at least, this journalist thinks they do.of course, the context here is that coulson got elected and re-elected six times in an increasingly, liberal democratic district. first, it was the 57th state house district and then it was re-districted in 2001-02 as the 17th state house district by long time speaker mike madigan, and his worker bees, to be even more democratic.coulson kept getting re-elected. one thing she did, which many republican candidates do in democratic districts, was to send out, often, campaign literature without a party identification. another thing coulson did, at least while on our "public affarrs," show, was to decline to endorse bush for president in the general election, and much more shockingly, she declined to endorse mark steven kirk, a slightly right of center but clearly socially liberal, even in september, 2000, 10th cd nominee of the republican party. further, coulson(r) declined to endorse in the general election, on august 22, 2002, on "public affairs," republican jim ryan for governor and joe birkett for attorney general.yes, kirk was less socially liberal then than he is now, but still, do you think any other republican state rep. candidates in or around kirk's cong. district at the time would have declined to endorse him for congress in a general election? as i wrote in 2002, "we discuss- you decide."****************************************************************a close race between dold and coulsonreliable sources in the 10th cd say next tuesday's election is likely to be a close one between thirteen year state rep. beth coulson (r-glenview) and kenilworth small businessman bob dold. dick green has put almost a half million dollars of his own wealth into this race, but the other ingredients for a win don't seem to be there. dr. arie friedman has an impressive style, personality and background but he probably started too late to be competitive on the fund raising and organization side of things. paul hamann doesn't have the required style, personality, resources and organization to be competitive.although coulson said on "public affairs," in 2000 she doesn't get any support from the republican party, it looks like times have changed.  beth has much of the establishment wing of the republican party supporting her now. lots of elected officials in the illinois legislature and congress are stepping up for beth, and some of those folks may have some resources to throw her way in the 10th cd primary.dold, on the other hand, has a lot of the rank and file giving him a hand, e.g., the powerful new trier township republican organization and the vernon and elk grove republican township organizations, have lined up behind him. when mark kirk won a close general election in 2000 over state rep. lauren beth gash, it was by the razor thin margin of two points, and new trier gave kirk a good chunk of that margin, a 3300 vote spread, or about 60% of the 5500 vote margin.edgar and portercoulson has the last former illinois governor not to be indicted, jim edgar, supporting her. and, more seriously, edgar is a very popular guy across illinois and no doubt in the 10th cd. even more popular in the 10th cd, as of nine years ago, when he gave up the 10th cd seat, is former congressman john porter. both have endorsed beth coulson and that helps. but, political assets, like all others, deteriorate with time. neither edgar nor porter has spent much, if any, time in the 10th cd during the last nine years. porter, intentionally so, as to not infringe on cong. kirk's "ownership" of that district. indeed, both edgar and porter made essentially "in absentia," endorsements. so, how much do the edgar and porter endorsements help? they are positive, no doubt. but, clearly porter's endorsement of kirk in his 2000 primary helped kirk much more than this one helps coulson.lugar, quayle and the tribuneboth senator lugar (r-in) and former senator quayle (r-in) and the chicago tribune have endorsed dold. those folks and that entity are quite influential in the 10th cd republican primary.rep. beth coulson has always been a personable, smart and tenacious campaigner. she has had at least two very tough general elections (2002 and 2008), and she won them both, the earlier one by less than 700 votes.bob dold has demonstrated during this campaign he is no slouch on the campaign trail. he also is smart, articulate and polished. he knows how to take a mike and wade into the crowd. he has a law degree and an mba.both coulson and dold can handle themselves in forums and walking precincts. it's a race.mark kirk, the guy who, like bush, was too conservative for coulson to endorse?it could come down to what do republican primary voters think about a republican state rep. who declined to endorse her party's nominee for president and for congress. even when the nominee was the quite moderate, if not liberal, mark steven kirk. the guy who turned out to be so pro-choice, pro gun control, pro environmental, pro israel, pro gay rights, pro public school teacher that he kept the 10th cd seat, even though the 10cd had gone democratic long ago and the republicans had extremely tough years in 2006 and 2008. and, ultimately kirk was so moderate that he opposed bush's surge in iraq and he was one of eight republicans to vote for speaker pelosi's cap and trade, a bill that barely passed the house.i know that coulson's non-endorsement of kirk was way before his moderation was demonstrated,  but still, republican primary voters might ask, mark kirk, that's the guy republican coulson thought was "too conservative," for her to risk endorsing him over democrat gash in coulson's liberal state house district, and coulson wants us to support her as the republican nominee for congresswoman from this district?that might just be a too tall drink, as cong. peter roskam (r-wheaton, 6th cd) might say, for 10th cd republican voters to swallow. but, as this journalist wrote in 2002, we discuss, you decide.  but, first, before you decide watch the coulson-berkowitz clip here********************************************************
