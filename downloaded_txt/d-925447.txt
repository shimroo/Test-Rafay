we had an awesome tour of buck island! our crew was made up of miles, amanda, and avery! they were awesome to spend the day with! my friend and i had never snorkeled before and they went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable! they guided us through the underwater trail making sure we were doing good the whole time! we went to the other side of the island and checked out the beach for awhile and then headed back! there were a range of people from children to a few older people and also some who didn’t speak english! from the smiles on everyone’s faces getting off the crew did an amazing job! a shout out to avery, amanda, and miles for the fun day! i can’t wait to bring more visitors for a tour!

we took the 1/2 day trip to buck island. it is a must. the water is amazing and snorkeling was great. the departure was right on time and so was the return. the crew went out of their way to help myself and my two teenagers who haven’t snorkels before. their divers will pull you along and guide you through the reefs so you can see everything. moe towed us and let us hold onto a lifesaver to help us until we felt comfortable enough in the open sea snorkeling. the captain was great. so friendly and so very helpful making sure everyone felt comfortable. the island is gorgeous and the beach is breathtaking.

our sunset sail on the last evening of our trip was wonderful. captain john and morgan were great. it was a gorgeous sail from christiansted almost to buck island just in time for the sunset. plenty of drinks served onboard and our choice of music. and we saw 2 sea turtles which was perfect. wave dancer was a nice size for our family of 4…not too big but not so small that the boat would get tossed around by the waves. would easily hold a larger group, too. wonderful way to end an amazing week! ⛵️
