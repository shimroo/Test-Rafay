testimonial




"in the fall of 2022, francesca handled the sale of our family home of 54 years, and i can't recommend her highly enough. francesca is the consummate professional. she has a wealth of experience in the industry, and it shows in her mastery of the process, in her knowledge of the area and the real estate market, and in the many connections that she's established over the years. more than that, it was a real joy to work with francesca. as someone who places a high premium on responsiveness, availability, conscientiousness and reliability, i was so impressed and pleased. francesca is a person of integrity, kindness and good humor, and we could not have chosen better." deborah goldstine
