what if almighty god had made it our obligation to protect and care for each specific blossom as it appeared on the tree, requiring that it should be tended during the process of flower to fruit that includes pollination,
fertilization, development of seed, falling off of petals, up until the time of full development of fruitâs core and eating part?

oil and gas fields provisions from god

if almighty god had not created subterranean reservoirs in porous rock formations for oil and natural gas, how can 
mankind extract millions of barrels of crude oil on a daily basis? 









article 3
water filtration through evaporation

if almighty god had not made saline sea water into fresh water through the process of evaporation and condensation, then how would precipitationârain, snow and hailâbe of any use for human consumption? 









article 4
had god let infant mortality cut our lives short

had god let child or infant mortality cut our lives short before reaching our fifth or even first birthday, or had our childhood be afflicted by paralysis, various types of childhood disorders and disabilities, or had he deprived us of becoming literate or receiving any education, what would have happened then? 









article 5
