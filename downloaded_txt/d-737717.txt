streetcorners 
    ministries is a non-denominational registered christian charity, established 
    as a society in british columbia, canada on march 1, 2000.
our purpose: 
    streetcorners ministries exists to proclaim the person and message of 
    jesus christ to all people, to disciple those new to the faith, to encourage 
    consistent fellowship of believers and to meet practical needs as a way of 
    demonstrating the love of christ.  our priority is to reach those not 
    being reached through the present efforts of the church.
at present there 
    are two full time missionary couples and numerous volunteers working under the 
    direction of a local board of directors.  at this time we are working 
    in the bulkley valley and northwestern british columbia and our 
    headquarters are based in telkwa, british columbia, canada.
