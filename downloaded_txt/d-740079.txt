for a variety of reasons, i've switched from 5e to old school essentials . to that end, i've created a pdf for using mythosa with ose, including house rules, what optional rules are used, and similar things. the pdf is available from the downloads  page.

very minor edit; the label for the vhallosean sea  had somehow disappeared. this is pretty common, actually. almost always when i edit something on the map in wonderdraft  somehow a label disappears on the map. not sure if this is user error or a bug in the program. this had been sitting out there for awhile, but it should be fixed now. still a program i highly recommend. knocking around ideas for future development, though the only thing on the horizon at the moment is a new mythosa  player's companion  for  old school essentials .

the first post of 2022! also over six months since the last post; i really need to post more, but i always say that.  anyway, i've updated the codex, the player's companion, and the world map. the changes are summarized below: removed the "house rules" page from this blog and moved all that material to the player's companion . added some additional material to the player's companion . moved the deity summary from the codex  to the  player's companion . updated the map to move zarinth and cythicus, added var naroth and the arcane sovereignty, and fixed some glitchy labels. updated the codex  for the changes to the regions in the unhallowed wilds. this should be the last arbitrary change to mythosa's kingdoms/states; i was never quite happy with the unhallowed wilds, but what i have now i like. things may change in the future, but they will be the result of historical events either due to what happens in our rpg campaigns or the natural progression of ev...

did a little tweaking of the world map. nothing really changed, just trying to clean up a few things. it seems wonderdraft  works a little better on windows than mac, so i moved it over there. i also updated the hex grid to use 24 mile hexes rather than 25 mile; this fits in better with the standard 5e normal overland movement (24 miles in a day in non-difficult terrain).  the maps are on the downloads  page.

a few updates this time around:  mythosa codex the codex continues to be a "living document", which was always the intention. though i do need to find a different application for the layout; right now, i just use pages which means that when i change the entries it screws up the entire format. i'll have to take a look for some open source solution. anyway, this time around i've tweaked the chronology - the months and the days of the week. calendar:  my old design was one of those "this works out great" ideas and then turned out to be a little too pat (i.e.; contrived). kind of like the "one deity per alignment" i originally liked and stole from scarred lands  and then soured on years ago. i was also inspired by glorantha's use of "seasons" rather than "months", though for my design i have something in-between. days of the week:  changed to fit a more religious origin, though the dow are pretty much just a common point of refe...
