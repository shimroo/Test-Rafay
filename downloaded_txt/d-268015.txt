	 paypal receives banking licence
	 
    


the online payment service paypal has received a banking licence in luxembourg, promoting it to the status of a bank. as a consequence paypal will move their headquarters to luxembourg.since 2004 paypal had the status of an electronic money issuer supervised by the u.k. financial services authority. having an official bank status opens new prospects for the company: "this will allow us to actively scout retailers in different european countries. with our british licence, we could only do that in the u.k. itself, and in other countries we could only react to requests of the retailers themselves," christopher coonen, general manager of paypal southern europe and benelux, explained.the change will not affect existing customers dramatically says coonen: "we are going to inform them of the new status, and they will have to accept our terms of service again." he also said that for now, there were no plans to use the new licence to offer traditional banking services, but the possibility was being evaluated by paypal. working with local partners would be an option to accomplish this, according to coonen.the british newspaper the daily telegraph speculates that the move is part of a strategy to compete with google's payment service google checkout, which launched in the u.k. last month.paypal has 130 million users worldwide, and 35 million customers in europe. payments via its mother company ebay continue to make up 60% of paypal's revenues. more than half of britain's internet users have a paypal account.

	 japanese boy brings severed head of his mother to police station
	 
    


a boy from aizuwakamatsu, japan a town just north of tokyo, has walked into the local police station with a sports bag which police say contained the severed head of his mother."if it's true, then it is horrendous," said cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki, the head spokesman for the japanese government.police say that the 17-year-old boy told them that he killed his mother monday night, and that he acted alone. police later found the mother's remains inside the boy's apartment. police say that an object much like a knife was used to sever her head.there have been a series of murders involving the dismemberment of body parts in japan in the past few months. a leg severed from an unknown body was found in tokyo inside a trash bin on monday. a woman, 32, was arrested in january when she admitted to murdering her husband, dismembering his body, then placed his remains around several spots in tokyo.

	 nokia n80 - just another n-series phone...or is it?
	 
    


author: keith rickwoodone of the most anticipated and over-hyped phone, nokia n80 falls quite short of expectations for many. theoretically, the phone's anatomy has been engineered to almost perfection, but when it's handed over to its users, this phone won't really be classified as 'the prized possession'. that is, if the user is not a typical user.nokia n80 has an innovative exterior, with a classy slide-up design. this makes the smartphone compact and attractive. but despite this effort, nokia n80 fails to compete with 'the lords in the game' – samsung. the slide-up mechanism of nokia n80 is not as smooth and good as that of samsung. also, the slide opens by itself many a times, which might lead into automatic dialling. the only resort thus, becomes the manual keypad lock.one of the lightest smartphones available - weighs around 134g - nokia n80 has successfully carved a niche in the genre of light smartphones. being a 3g smartphone, it takes good care of personal and business requirements. the phone offers a wide array of multiple softwares, excellent functionality and good connectivity. it also has a wireless lan, enabling fast connection to a pc, broadband internet and other wi-fi devices. but the blot here is its slow pace, both in boot up and in operation.it has a superior lcd display and video quality. but despite having a 3 megapixels camera, it cannot compete with nokia n90 and sony ericsson w900i (both having 2 megapixels camera). and if music runs through your blood, this phone is a celebration for you. it comes with an advance music player, great audio quality, stereo handset and a great storage capacity.concept wise nokia n80 is par excellence and we just hope that the firmware upgrades will make it more reliable and user-friendly.mobile phone dealsnokia n80 this article is free for republishingsource: http://www.articlealley.com  occupation: webmaster keith rickwood is webmaster of http://www.mobilerainbow.co.uk/. this website deals in contract mobile phones and sim free phones on major six mobile networks in uk. there are best mobile phones deals with latest handset and cheap mobile phone plans on popular mobile networks. http://www.mobilerainbow.co.uk
