                begin mountain relocation and resizing project
the
              forest service, working in cooperation with the bureau of land
              management (blm), and sublette and sweetwater counties, have begun
              a project to relocate and restructure local area mountains in western
              wyoming. 
the
              ambitious project was conceived when a wealthy businessman recently
              purchased a local ski area and wanted to make the terrain more
              challenging,
              especially for extreme skiers. phase 1 of the plan is to create
              an experience
              similar to those who climb
              to the top of
              the
              tetons
              and do dare-devil skiing and snowboarding down steep narrow rifts
              in the mountain face. 
"our
              ski area will become the ultimate destination for  extreme skiing
              and snowboarding," said pinedale
              ski hill manager ron jacobs. 
right
                now, the mountain terrain is a little too gentle to entice those
                thrill-seeking skiers and snowboarders.
the
              new owners are bringing in huge cranes that will move, pull up,
              and stretch the existing mountain tops to elongate them and
                create the
                desired topographical elevation and steepness. "it's
                state-of-the-art, never-been-done-before technology," jacobs
              explained. the local ski area advisory committee did not want to
                stop at just "snow
              making," they  added "mountain making."
"we
              are pleased the forest service supported our ideas and enthusiastically
              agreed to allow us to modify our special use permit to create new
              topography
              and
              high elevation
                recreational  terrain," he said.
expanding
                the plan the forest
              service and blm have been so excited about the prospects of this
              new mountain moving and growing technology, they are implementing
              a
              grander
              expansion
              for this project. 
"the
                    upper green river valley in western wyoming is a very unique
                    ecological habitat," resource manager clifford crawford said
                    in
                a recent interview. "it has been declared an essential element
                of the 'serengeti of north america' by environmental groups wanting
                to preserve vast herds of deer, pronghorn, moose, elk, and wild
                horses." since
              the upper green river valley is already hemmed in on three sides
              by three mountain ranges on the west, north and east, the two government
              agencies have decided to add a fourth mountain range to the south,
              creating a wonderful enclosed bowl that will provide a buffer to
              allow the valley to become even more prime wildlife habitat. using
              the same mega cranes as described above, they will relocate some
              available mountains from the nearby area and do some vertical stretching
              of the existing terrain to create the new range, which will be
              called the "green river mountains." 
the new
              range will run east-to-west, just north of the interstate 80 corridor,
              from fontenelle to just south of farson, and over to south pass.
              "now
              when people drive over south pass, they will have mountains
              on both sides so they won't be confused and will know they are
              going through a real mountain  pass,"
              said wyoming department of transportation highway
              engineer
              john jones. 
once
              the new mountain range is in place, the communities of rock springs
              and green river  already have plans
                 to create several new ski areas on their side of the
              mountains.
 "now
              when i-80 is shut down for weeks at a time due to harsh winter
              conditions,
                  we'll have a great place for all those truck drivers to go
              and get some exercise while they are waiting for the roads to reopen,"
                rock springs mayor bob smith said. 
green
              river mayor samuel
                    baker said it will be a real boost to all the i-80 corridor
                local
                  economies, and added the new tree-covered, snow-capped mountains
                  will greatly improve
                  the
                  scenic
                  view year-round for
                  travelers in southwest wyoming.
