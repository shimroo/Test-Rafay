upcoming in worship
calling generation fifty one
most scholars date jesus’ birth to around 4-6 b.c.  so splitting the difference – 5 b.c. – and given that luke tells us that jesus was about 30 when he started calling disciples (25 a.d.), then 2025 marks the 2000th anniversary of the first time jesus said, “come, follow me.” if a biblical generation is understood to be 40 years, then 2025 also marks the beginning of the 51st generation to respond to jesus’s call.  how will we respond in 2025? join us for a message series beginning january 12 as we consider afresh what it is to follow jesus today – calling generation 51!
