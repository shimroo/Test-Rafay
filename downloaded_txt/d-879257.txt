dear friends,
writing on the run is the art of simultaneously living, 
                        observing, and writing about life as it happens. it 
                        means to free your creative writer -- the part of you 
                        that cannot, will not be deterred by society, sickness, 
                        humiliation, or lack of time -- to express thoughts, 
                        emotions, and wisdom any time, any place.
we welcome you to writing on the run â¢ -- the 
                        natural way to write any time, any place.

                        you would answer "yes."
















 


writing on the run quiz
____  do you want to write but don't have the 
                        time to fit one more thing into your busy life?
____  are your home and family responsibilities 
                        keeping you from finding time for having a creative 
                        outlet, such as writing?
____  do you have a job that requires a lot 
                        of attention and long hours, leaving you drained and 
                        only wanting to vegetate when you have time off?
____  are you feeling guilty about spending 
                        time and taking up space for writing when your family, 
                        job, friends, health, etc., etc., etc. should be coming 
                        first?

                        on the job destroying your love of writing?
____  do you believe that writing is a waste 
                        of time unless you're being published or getting paid 
                        for it?
____  are you getting lack of support, or even, 
                        hostility from others whenever you make attempts to 
                        carve out time and space for your writing?
____  are you in an environment where others 
                        don't realize how important writing is to your peace 
                        of mind and need for self-expression?
____  has a teacher or someone in authority 
                        told you that you don't have writing talent and need 
                        to find yourself a "real" job?
if you have answered yes to any of the questions 
                        above, are you ever going to love writing on the run!
if you're like us, you have to write through a busy 
                        schedule, a full household, and loads of self-doubt.
when our children were young, allen worked the "graveyard" 
                        shift as a police officer. linda had the demanding responsibility 
                        of being the literary manager for a regional theater. 
                        in addition to chauffeuring our children and pets to 
                        appointments and trying to have quality family time, 
                        we wrote in the early morning and late evening hours.
in 1996, we formed ourselves into a writing team 
                        and began to write, publish, and promote our first website, 
                        printed newsletter, book proposal, and book. to work 
                        as a team, we had to become even more proficient at 
                        writing on the run.  
we are eager to show published, prospective, and 
                        hobby writers how to creatively find time and space 
                        for writing their way through:
 
     
                        family obligations,
      
                        employment responsibilities,
     
                        sickness and health 
                        challenges,
     
                        lean financial times,
     
                        less than ideal circumstances.
  
 
 
 
why bother?
because writing is how many of us understand and 
                        complete the experiences of our lives.
because studies have proven that writing is an antidote 
                        to depression; people who write about their painful 
                        life experiences recover from them more easily and quickly.
because writing is a lifeline of communication to 
                        people all over the world.
because writing can provide additional, even full-time, 
                        income.
because writing is a fun and enjoyable way to express 
                        your thoughts, feelings, and insights - even if it's 
                        only to yourself.
most of all, keep writing in 2012.
sincerely,allen and linda anderson
