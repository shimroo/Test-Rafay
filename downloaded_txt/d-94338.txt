our testimonialswe take customer satisfaction seriously. here are a few words from our customers.
just a great experience and i look forward to practicing and using the skills i learned. i would highly recommend to any golfer looking to improve their game.
dewayne naylormarch 22, 2024
very clearly identified what i needed to change, how to do it, and how to practice it. i found the 3 day investment very valuable. for the first time ever, i am excited to practice. and the fact that i was there with 3 friends (and there were only 4 of us total) made it even better.
lisa saueraugust 3, 2023
great course.  well worth the money.  i played 9 holes the day after the course and could already see marked improvement in my short game.  i wish i had taken this class years ago.  
judd herbsterjune 10, 2023
my wife and attended the school together, and it was an excellent experience for both of us.  we now have a consistent way to approach short game shots, which we never had before.  i believe we will use what we learned forever.  hope to see improvement in our results as we practice more.

time very well spent. i wouldn’t hesitate to return for further instruction as needed. hands down the best golf instruction i have received.
