explore the planet
the oldest network for urban explorerslocal and around the globe.














the urban explorers network was created in 1999 by paul allen rice following his creation of the underground mailing list in 1997 where vadders could discuss college tunnels and any manmade underground structures. the mailing list and website were for urban explorers to share their experiences and network among themselves in further explorations. after paul passed away in 2005, the urban explorers network passed to me and i have maintained it to this day in his memory and for the future of urban exploring. it continues to be alive and well today because of the shared experiences of all of the urban explorers around the world and for their adherence to a strong ethic as portrayed in our creed.
