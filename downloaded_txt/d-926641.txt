 a collaboration of some of the finest thought on today's world 


 top shot crybaby number one  
tuesday, october 11, 2011
i am not sure if you watch the history channel's "top shot" program or not, but it is pretty good.  this show pits marksmen against one another and themselves to narrow down a competent field.  in the end, the winner gets $100,000 usd and whatever prizes that they have collected along the way.there is one "competitor" on the show that is an absolute bitch.  his name is jake zweig and claims to be a former navy seal.  having spent any decent time around the community will instantly get the proverbial hackles up about this claim.  this zweig character is a loud-mouthed crybaby that is a quitter.  as a matter of fact, on the latest episode of top shot, he did quit.  while everyone is glad, there is more to the story.  as it turns out, jake zweig also quit the navy seal program citing racism or some lame ass excuse.  funny, he claimed the same thing while attending the naval academy.  the end result is that i am glad that he left the show.  jake zweig is not that great of a shooter to begin with...he spends a lot of time talking and not enough listening.  jake quit the show because he is a crybaby and not a good shooter.  jake quit the navy seals because he is a crybaby and couldn't hack it.  that is not to say that he doesn't get props for completing buds, but despite that...he is still a whiny bitch.  piss right off you crybaby, whining sore loser.  you jake, are a piece of shit.minus

 look yourself in the nearest mirror and scream "dickhead!"  
saturday, july 16, 2011
the title is the clearest set of instruction that i can possibly give to democrats and liberals these days.  instead of working to create a budget (they have not passed one in years although required by law), their tactic is to lambaste the gop for everything.    why even write about it?  well, it is because this blog generates a tidal wave of emotion and political action every time it is read.  so, in a nutshell, this entry is to let people know that democrats and liberals as of late, are complete dickheads.minus

 representative of what, exactly?  

in no surprise, rep. sheila jackson lee (dummy-texas) is insinuating that congress is complicating the debt ceiling issue because barack obama is black.  if you are totally stunned, here is a link to the article.  if you are not at all stunned and may have a betting pool going as to how long it would be before this slimy, ignorant, bigoted moron actually did play the race card: pat yourself on the back because you won.whether it's quoting herself or being a shitty boss, this person is batshit crazy.  how is it possible that in 11 years there have been 11 chiefs of staff (highest staff turnover in congress?) and someone with clear racism and mental issues has been in business since 1995?  is the entire 18th congressional district a bunch of complete morons?  they must be."is the entire 18th congressional district a bunch of complete morons?  they must be."--minusi just quoted myself and confirmed...it is stupid to do so.minus

 what a crock  
friday, july 15, 2011
the article is titled "new state law requires lgbt history in textbooks." in a word, this is garbage. i would find it hard to believe that the lgbt community is accepting of this drivel. as much as the cry of "no special rights, just equal ones," is said this law would not hold water. in no surprise, governor jerry brown signed a bill to add this to the social sciences curriculum.brown is quoted as saying that "history should be honest." well, yes but should it also apply sexual orientation as a qualifier of achievement? no. to wit: "alan turing is the father of computer science and greatly contributed to the creation of the modern computer." that's honest and says nothing about turing's homosexuality...and why the hell should it? brown is looking for voters. that's it. historical? i can assure you there is nothing historical about california blowing things out of proportion. minus

 if biden wore a vagina...

he would be named debbie wasserman schultz (dummy-fla.)  think about how lucky we conservatives are to have this crackpot hypocrite as the head of the dnc!  at this rate, the conservatives need only to field either a dung beetle, or a department store window dummy to reign in the country again in 2012. nobody wants another four years of this utter failure of an administration.  things are looking up, i just hope that the conservative set will not foul it up, either.minus

most of the readers of this blog will most likely not be keeping up with events in baltimore.  nor should they; baltimore is a cesspool of fail.  one can easily guess that the "charm city" is a hoax and is staffed by complete muppets.  while doing some reading, i came across an interesting legal case that is unfolding.  the details in the case are vague in some instances, but what is known (according to the articles) is the following: the defendants are two jewish brothers, avi and eliyahu werdesheim.  the plaintiff is a 15-year-old black kid.  according to one article, the 15 year old kid was beaten for simply walking through the wrong neighborhood.  from what i have read, eli werdesheim was formerly part of the israeli special forces and now owns his own security company; he is 23 years old.  in addition, the two brothers are part of a neighborhood watch group called shomrim, or "the guards."  shomrim is a group that essentially watches over portions of northwest baltimore's jewish communities.naturally there are elements of the african-american, or black communities that are insistent that this was racism and a "hate crime."  this is quite laughable considering that shomrim was born out of necessity.  northwest baltimore has many depressed areas that shelter a specific type of citizen.  what much of the articles on the subject are not putting forth is that this poor little 15-year-old black boy has a rap sheet as long as a giraffe's neck.  just the week prior to getting put in his place, he had stolen a car.  it will come out in the coming weeks that this wee thug intended to do harm to the werdesheim brothers by hitting them with a 2x4 that had nails through it.  what's odd, however, is that the board cannot, for some reason, be used in the trial (scheduled for may sometime).  upon detecting the danger, eli and avi defended themselves which is still legal in some parts of this country.  good on the werdesheim brothers and shame on the truly whiny thug community because a punk got put in his place.  there have already been threats if the werdesheim brothers are acquitted (which, in my opinion, they should be) then there will be riots, etc.  what a farce.  these ignorant folks have zero respect for the reason that shomrim was created in the first place, nor the process of law.  they seem to think that the black panthers are acceptable while a jewish group of a protective vein is not.  ignorance and hypocrisy.*there are numerous articles on the case, look for them yourself.  this one is just one of many.  there will be some interesting details to come before the trial...whatever the case may be, hopefully justice will be served.  i have my doubts...minus

 doma  

this is a little late, but a few days ago the obama administration announced it would no longer defend the defense of marriage act (doma).  its position is that the act is unconstitutional, and as such will no longer use the doj to enforce it.while i'm no fan of doma for a couple reasons, this announcement strikes me as pretty unsavory for two main reasons:1)  it smacks of serious executive branch overreach.  our constitution created a system where the legislative passes laws, and the executive enforces them.  its up to the judicial to settle debates on the constitutionality of those laws.  with the administration in effect nullifying a duly passed law, it subverts this system.  screwing with the careful balance of power crafted by the constitution is always a bad idea.2)  the goddam hypocrisy.  the people cheering obama for this decision, are the exact same people who advocate strict gun control.  how can any reasonable person say that the constitution protects gay marriage (!) and at the same time say that it contains no individual right to bear arms?  it takes a pretty strained interpretation of the document to say that it guarantees the right for two guys to get married.  to be able to wring that out of it, but still have the audacity to ignore something a prominent and simple as the second amendment-- well, that takes some pretty serious chutzpah.i like gingrich's approach, that the legislature should man up, and use its power of the purse to make the executive branch enforce its laws.  a congressional act revoking all funding from the doj until it starts to do its goddam job should do the trick.  anyone want to lay a bet on that happening?  i'll give some pretty long odds.....yk

hopefully this isn't the start of a trend-- but a leading tea party representative is showing that she can spend and spin with the best of them.as i've been reading, almost exclusively, libertarian news and opinion lately, i acknowledge that i may be a little more paranoid and cynical than usual; and that the tea party is really going to stick to its limited government principles.  stuff like this, however, makes me nervous.oh, and in case you haven't seen it, reason tvs 3 reasons the midterms didn't change anything:nemesis
