science together
with land stewardship


























 engaging at the scale needed for change»

as an internationally recognized  research station  with over 60 years of experience studying fire-adapted ecosystems and advocating for prescribed fire use.
as a national hub for prescribed fire science, bringing fire managers and researchers together to identify and fill the gaps needed to increase the pace and scale of prescribed fire use.
as a  bobwhite quail research program working to recover this fire-adapted species throughout its range, by leveraging the land stewardship investment that comes with hunting opportunities.
as regional experts on management for many of the  rare species  associated with the fire-dependent longleaf pine ecosystem.
as one of the largest  regional land trusts  in the nation, permanently protecting over 145,000 acres of private land in the red hills and albany regions.
as a local landowner directly managing over 13,000 acres in north florida on our tall timbers and  livingston place  properties.
















 building on fire history 
 tall timbers is widely considered to be the birthplace of prescribed fire science. our founders, including herbert stoddard and the komarek family, were among the first to apply empirical research techniques to better understand the role of fire in nature. they also launched a critical series of fire ecology conferences in the 1960s that provided the setting needed to establish the field of prescribed fire science, during a time when fire suppression ideology ruled. these interactive timelines provide a look at the history of the land tall timbers is built on and the organization that was established in 1958. 











explore the red hills region»
the red hills region is a 300,000-acre conservation focus area located between thomasville, georgia and tallahassee, florida. recently referred to as the “100-year experiment,” much of the land has a management history that was heavily influenced by herbert stoddard’s arrival in the 1920s. these exceptional lands, with their nearly continuous fire history and conservation minded owners, are important for our fire and wildlife research, as well as a focal area for our land conservation work. the region serves as a lifeline between coastal and northern wildlands, providing important wildlife corridors. explore more of the natural, historical, and cultural wonders of the red hills.

say no to a new toll road in jefferson county

the m-cores program, which includes the proposed suncoast connector toll road in jefferson county, passed through the florida legislature at breakneck speed with little review or analysis. tall timbers has a number of concerns given the potential for significant and wide spread impacts. these include fragmenting public and private conservation lands, robbing business from main street monticello, impacting our rivers and other water resources, and making prescribed fire more difficult and costly.
join us in asking the jefferson county board of county commissioners to oppose the suncoast connector toll road and its path through jefferson county.
take action now with our easy email form.





send an email to all five jefferson county board of county commissioners with one click!



 

























your email is ready to go! feel free to review and edit below.

<pre>dear commissioner,</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>just say no! i am writing to ask you to oppose the suncoast connector toll road proposed in jefferson county. the suncoast connector and two other proposed toll roads were approved by the florida legislature with virtually no analysis or demonstration of need.</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>jefferson county and the big bend are already served by us 19, which is an excellent four-lane highway that is lightly traveled and operating at a fraction of its capacity. building a new (and unnecessary) four-lane toll road through jefferson county would directly affect the aucilla river, one of the most scenic rivers in the state and the site of many important archaeological discoveries. construction of a new highway would also affect the flow of water to our rivers, wetlands, and coastal fisheries. with billions of tax dollars being invested in restoring freshwater flow to the everglades, why would we risk the same outcome in our backyard?</pre> 
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<p>construction of the suncoast connector toll road would fragment wildlife habitat along a 150-mile corridor and threaten publicly conserved lands enjoyed by residents and visitors alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the suncoast connector would also be a limited access highway ― the road would bypass existing communities along its path, such as monticello. this would reduce traffic to local businesses along the us 19 corridor including through downtown monticello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>jefferson county and other rural communities certainly have infrastructure and economic development needs. let’s work with the legislature to strategically address these needs in a fiscally responsible manner that does not jeopardize the natural resources and historic downtown that make jefferson county so special.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i urge you to oppose the suncoast connector toll road and its path through jefferson county.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you!</p>

the conserved lands of the greater red hills region are found on working, income-producing properties that support agriculture, forestry, and recreational hunting. these properties contribute $272 million annually to local economies and support 2,300 jobs. [link to planning & advocacy section] the landowners’ strong stewardship ethic preserves their working lands while replenishing drinking water supplies, protecting water quality, and providing wildlife habitat for dozens of rare and endangered species.  tall timbers’ conservation easements on these working properties encourage landowners to retain their traditional livelihood by keeping farms in family ownership.


			×			





home to world-class wild quail populations, the greater red hills region contains the largest concentration of gamebird preserves in the united states. these preserves also support the largest community of red-cockaded woodpeckers on private lands. indicators of high quality habitat found here include the gopher tortoise, bachman’s sparrow, fox squirrel, and many amphibians.  tall timbers’ conservation easements identify and protect the critical habitats of these species.


			×			





the region also boasts outstanding aquatic resources. large river systems, like the flint/apalachicola, ochlockonee, and aucilla, flow from georgia and feed into the gulf of mexico to support some of the world’s most productive estuaries. large disappearing sinkhole lakes, like iamonia, miccosukee, and jackson, provide habitat for an array of aquatic species and migratory birds.  tall timbers’ conservation easements protect these vital watersheds and wetlands that are the lifeblood for the ecological health of the region.

once dominated by longleaf pine, our pine woodlands support abundant wildlife and local economies. these forests need prescribed fire to stay healthy. herbert l. stoddard and his associates ed and roy komarek were pioneers in this emerging scientific field during the mid-20th century. tall timbers continues that legacy with applied research on prescribed fire and land management. today, there is a tremendous need to expand prescribed fire use beyond the red hills to ensure ecosystem health and reduce wildfire risk. additionally, tall timbers uses conservation easements to permanently protect private woodlands while balancing the need for economic return from selective timbering.


			×			





tall timbers hosts the premier fire technology transfer organization—the southern fire exchange. this jfsp funded effort helps connect research to management through webinars, workshops, and support of the prescribed fire science consortium.


			x			






the longleaf legacy landscape prescribed fire burn team arm of wildland fire science works directly with landowners and partners to effectively put fire on the ground and promote prescribed fire throughout the region.


			x			





staff and researchers support federal fire training by serving as a cadre for nwcg training courses, ranging from basic wildland fire to advanced fire effects.


			x			






(pftc) specializes in training fire fighters the principles and techniques of prescribed fire through practical hands-on experience. https://www.fws.gov/fire/pftc/


			x			






private land owners are the largest source of prescribed fire in the country. these land owners and the culture of fire that was maintained by them during decades of suppression are a part of why tall timbers is a world-wide center for prescribed fire science. workshops and fire training are a critical focus of the longleaf legacy landscape burn team and our support of the georgia forestry commission prescribed fire center in marion county.
