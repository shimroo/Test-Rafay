your body is yours. you deserve to know how it works.
















in the world that we are building, people learn about and love their bodies.
















people feel whole, birthing people are supported and we are unashamed of the process of menstruation.
















we teach and encourage each other to advocate for ourselves and we accept the invitation to be in healthy relationships with our bodies. 












every day we have the opportunity to make choices bringing us closer to this reality. join me.
