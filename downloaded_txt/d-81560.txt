what's new?











the stock market gameâ¢ works.













                            at the beginning of the game i was more concerned with the questions students had
                            for me that i was afraid i couldn't answer but i've learned through playing the game
                            that the questions that the students asked can be turned into research projects.

                            you're not learning in class anymore, you're in the computer room, and suddenly it's
                            not the computer room anymore, it's the stock market game room. you learn it without
                            even knowing you're learning. in the end, when the smg is finished, you're like
                            "wow! i want to play again!!"

                            it's more than just paper and pencil math. the students are very engaged. they like
                            looking at different things that will allow them to understand why we do the math.
