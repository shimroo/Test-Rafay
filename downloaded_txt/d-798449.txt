financial education courses and seminars
empower yourself to make wise financial choices for you and your family.










in-person financial workshops

at money management international (mmi), we believe that financial education, including budgeting, saving and credit education, can truly improve lives. and it goes beyond simply understanding how to create a budget. 
the path to nearly every “big picture” goal begins with smart money management. the ability to comfortably and confidently handle money reduces stress and helps prevent financial anxiety from distracting you from your personal and professional responsibilities.

we offer in-person financial workshops in select locations across the country. our passionate and experienced educators provide hands-on instruction on budgeting, homeownership, identity theft, credit usage, family finances and so much more.
