1 in 3 people won’t hear the good news . . . ever . . . unless you help!


god’s passion is our passion. is it yours?



the good news
god’s passion is that no one departs from this life without making things right with him, but many are not hearing that message. the good news is about how god has made a way to make things right through jesus!




reaching, planting and mobilizing
wec’s objectives are to share that good news around the world (reaching people), help gather new believers into churches (planting churches), and help churches at home and abroad raise up more workers to fulfill god’s passion (mobilizing for missions).




will you join us?
in matthew 9:37-38 jesus said to his disciples, “the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. ask the lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.” workers are needed. will you join us?

tears of the saints
thanks to asia link and history makers for expressing our heart to reach the lost.
the need for reaching out to the world is not finished. the work of bringing the gospel to the world and planting churches must continue. are you willing to send, pray or go?







our objectives



what is reaching people all about?
reaching people is sharing the best news ever heard with those who have never had the opportunity to hear it until now. it’s about leading people to faith in jesus so they can be forgiven of their sins and begin an eternal relationship with him.




what is planting churches all about?
planting churches is about gathering believers together as they learn to obey all that jesus has taught us. a church is a local community where people support each other as they learn and grow together.




what is mobilizing for missions all about?
mobilizing is raising awareness among god’s people of the need to complete the great commission and equipping new workers whom god is calling to go to the unreached.
