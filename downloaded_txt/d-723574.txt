												welcome aboard!

whether you're a novice or an 
												offshore expert, here's a great 
												place to start. see the full 
												fiorentino rigging set-up at 
												work. to learn why the 
												para-anchor  ("parachute 
												style" sea anchor) can be used on any 
												type of boat 
click here.










basic operation 
												 


   



you'll need a fiorentino 
												parachute sea anchor, fiorentino deployment rode and a fiorentino trip line. simply 
												drop the parachute sea anchor off the bow of 
												any large vessel or any 
												small boat and your're done. anything  
												after that is 
												optional.... for example,

sailboat owners may prefer to
												birdle 

their parachute sea anchor for a 
												more comfortable ride as seen in 
												the sailboat illustration below.
												






												how much anchor rode 
most average size trawlers and sailboats will pay out 300' to 
												600' of rode. sport 
												fishermen will pay out an 
												average of 20-100' of rode:

a: retrieval float: 




													the last float marking the 
													tail end of the fiorentino 
													trip line. the benefit: 
													high degree of visibility 
													allows a skipper to easily 
													motor toward the retrieval 
													float to capture the trip 
													line. large enough to 
													prevent the parachute sea anchor 
													(para-anchor) from 
													sinking too deep under the 
													water when anchor rode is 
													slack. handy tip: 
													your own boat fender may be 
													used in place of a 
													fiorentino retrieval float.











													 









														b: trip line support 
														float


														a small float secured in 
														the center of a 
														floating trip line. 
														the benefit: 
														provides necessary 
														tension in trip line to 
														avoid slack. also serves 
														as an excellent marker 
														to help determine 
														para-anchor depth.
														











													 





													c: fiorentino trip line 


													used to help in deflation 
													and recovery of the 
													para-anchor. trip lines vary 
													in length from 50- to 100-feet on typical vessels, and 
													up to 1,000-feet for those 
													with deep drafts and high 
													freeboards. the benefit: 
													enables the top of the 
													canopy to be pulled more 
													easily to the boat. handy 
													tip: why not build your 
													own trip line? to learn how 
													see 


zack's 
													faqs 
													for complete instructions. 
													but, if you don't want the  
													fuss of rigging, you can 
													also purchase a "rigged and 
													ready" trip line by 
													fiorentino. 










 





d: use 
													a heavily built anchor or 
													add chain. 


 

all 
													parachute sea anchors must 
													properly be weighted down. 
													to accomplish this task 
													you'll need to add two or 
													three feet of chain to any 
													lightweight sea anchor. to 
													avoid the use of bulky 
													chain, deploy a compact 
													heavy built parachute sea anchor like
													


													fiorentino's offshore anchor.
													the benefit:  reduces 
													parachute rotation and 
													prevents shrouds from 
													twisting. weight placement 
													aids the parachute sea anchor's 
													capabilities by holding it 
													deeper beneath the water and 
													away from dangerous breaking 
													seas. 












the 
												secret's in our orignal 
												



												para-ring hardware -- made 
												affordable to all boaters!

 





e: 
													fiorentino para-ring® 
													hardware (exclusive 
													innovation) 
serves 
													as an attachment point for 
													the anchor rode and 
													maintains a wide spread of 
													shroud lines, which enables 
													the anchor stabilizer to 
													more easily self-adjust. the 
													anchor stabilizer rotates 
													and tilts as environmental 
													forces penetrate the canopy 
													and produce potentially 
													damaging energy that is 
													transmitted through the 
													shroud lines to the 
													para-ring®. the benefit: 
													in boiling seas and strong 
													ocean currents, the 
													self-adjusting para-ring® 
													prevents the elements from 
													pushing, rolling, or 
													spinning a parachute anchor 
													out of control, which can 
													lead to a tangled parachute 
													or blown out canopy 
													panel.  parachute 
													sea anchor balance 
													is achieved as the para-ring® 
													self-adjusts to uneven shock 
													loads that are carried down 
													the shroud lines from the 
													canopy. the tilting of the 
													para-ring® neutralizes the 
													mixed energy to create an 
													even pull on the parachute 
													canopy. this prevents 
													breakage and chafe. 
















f: 
													choose a rope
(rode)

nylon 
													rode is a well estabished 
													industry standard. or you 
													can use fiorentino's 
													innovative 
													strong, braided dacron/nylon 
													mix rope 
													that connects the parachute 
													anchoring system to the bow 
													of a vessel. the 
													amount of rode needed during 
													deployment depends on a 
													vessel's response to various 
													weather conditions - usually 
													10-feet of rode for every 
													foot of boat. the 
													benefit: because it 
													stretches under tension, the 
													rode absorbs massive shock 
													loads.  









 





g: snatch block 
.

														a stainless steel swivel 
														block, with a hinge or 
														sliding plate shell that 
														opens to allow a bight 
														of a rope to pass 
														through. the benefit: 
														the block's ability to 
														open allows the block to 
														be clamped over anchor 
														rode in the event that 
														rigging a bridle becomes 
														necessary.  











 






h: 
														fiorentino pendant line
														

 


														a stiff length of rope 
														with a block at the end. 
														the diameter of the 
														pendant line matches 
														that of the anchor rode. 
														line length is dependent 
														upon size of the vessel.
														the benefit: when 
														attached to the anchor 
														rode, the pendant line 
														can be connected to a 
														stern winch to form a 
														bridle, which is then 
														used to hold a vessel in 
														a heave-to position 
														during heavy seas. to 
														position multihulls and 
														trawlers into the 
														weather secure the 
														pendent line to a bow 
														cleat.  handy tip:
														why not build your 
														own pendant line? to 
														learn how see 



														zack's faqs. 
														but, if you don't want 
														the fuss of rigging, you 
														can also purchase a 
														"rigged and ready" 
														pendant line by 
														fiorentino. 










													 







i: pendant line
														support 
														floats


														one or two small floats located 
														near the snatch block.
														the benefit: 
														these floats keep the 
														pendant line afloat 
														whenever it becomes 
														slack. 









													 






j: 
														chafe gear  


														wrapped around the 
														anchor rode or pendant 
														line, this 
														chafe protection reduces 
														wear caused when the 
														line rubs against the 
														vessel and her rigging. 
														fiorentino's roderaps 
														have proven to be very 
														durable and 
														long-lasting.
														option: 
														
														conventional rubber 
														hose.
