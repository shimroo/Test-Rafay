and when you go through our process as a home seller…

you won’t waste time finding seller agents who will not sell your house fast because of escrow on the sale of your home.
you won’t need to sign a contract that binds you to a listing agent for a six-months.
you won’t deal with the hassle of posting listings on the mls, property inspections and appraisals for every buyer, showings every weekend, and then praying your house will sell after all.

sometimes, home sellers are too busy to do everything necessary to sell a house or they simply don’t want to deal with the situation any longer. they’re tired of the hassle of selling their property the traditional way…

frequently asked questions about selling your house in san diego county to sunnynest

“i need to sell my house fast in san diego county“
i need to sell my home as i am relocating from beautiful san diego county. how can your business help me sell my house for cash?
first of all, we completely understand that relocation to another city or state can add a great deal of stress to selling a house.
usually, people have to move because they got a new job, they’re retiring empty-nesters that don’t need a large house, or they just can’t afford their property in san diego county. do you have to unload your house fast for one of, or any other, those reasons?
and most home sellers can’t afford to buy another property in whatever city they’re moving to plus keep paying their mortgage on their first house.
so, that’s where a sunnynest homes’ cash offer comes in because we can give homeowners a cash offer plus several types of additional offers…
of course, there’s always fast cash in as little as 7 days. plus, our company has up to 9 real estate solutions to help you, such as:

if you want full value for your house, we can pay a significant amount of money upfront. so you can pay for your move and cover your mortgage for several months if you have to. then, we’ll pay you every month until you actually get more money than if you sold your house through a real estate agent because of their commissions and fees.
“seller financing” in which you’re essentially the bank. we’ll actually pay you more than your home is currently worth. yes, you read that right… we’ll pay more for your house if you give us time to pay.
lease options, where we’ll find a “tenant-buyer” who wants to buy a house but doesn’t have the credit score for a mortgage. we’ll help them as we help you. win-win-win!
or about 5-6 additional creative financing options to fix your situation.

so, if you’re looking to sell your house fast while choosing the option that’s right for you, let us help.


if you want to sell your home super quickly, let us help.
if there are repairs needed, shouldn’t you always fix your house before you sell?
yes. you should.
but some people just don’t have the time or money to fix it up.
if your house needs repairs, a typical renovation on a 3 bed / 2 bath house takes 3-12 weeks.
and the typical renovation costs about 10% of the after repair value. with an average home price of $340,000 in the united states, you’d have to invest about $34,000.
but you can sell it to us as-is because we have investors that trust us to repair your house.
and remember that we have 7-8 other options for you where you can even get more than your house would be worth after it’s fixed up.


houses are getting expensive in san diego county california
i want to sell my home in san diego county fast because i can’t afford it anymore but i’m being foreclosed on. can you still help me?
abso-freakin-lutely!
unlike realtors or agents who won’t be able to help, we work with an expert that has a highly effective process to stop foreclosures quickly.
then we can make a deal where we’ll help you get caught up on your mortgage payments and we’ll buy your house. we’ll deal with title issues, code violations, tax liens and more.
how awesome is that?


we pay cash for houses in san diego county california even in poor condition like this
can i really get a fast cash offer and sell my house fast in san diego county in as little as 7 days?
once again… abso-freakin-lutely!
to begin, we know your time is valuable, you might be in a tough spot, and you want it to be over asap.
that’s why we promise to perform our inspections quickly, make our cash offer as fast as lightning, and get the deal completed like quicksilver… usually within 7 days of you choosing to do a deal with us.



why shouldn’t you choose a discount brokerage, real estate agent, or realtor if you wish to sell your house quickly in san diego county? wouldn’t they get you the most money?
first of all, we think discount brokerages are the worst option because while real estate agents and realtors have higher fees, they usually my you a lot more.
agents average around 10% more than discount brokerages and realtors average around 10% more than agents.
so, our opinion is that if you have the time and money to fix and sell your property, you should choose a realtor. they’ll usually get you top dollar.
plus, when you sell your house, you’ll pay 10% in closing costs. for an average $650k home in our hometown of san diego that would be about $65k!
on top of that, remember that if your house needs repairs, that could be another $65k plus 3-12 weeks.
then selling your house in san diego county takes an average of 25 days but closing escrow could take up to 90 days.
so, selling your house via this route is a ton of work that can take up to 170 days.
oh, and during that time, you’ll have to pay your mortgage payments which, if it’s equal to the market average in this example, would be up to $19,000!
or worse… you could be on the hook for up to six payments on two houses at a cost of around $38,000!
after you do the math, via the traditional route your house could sell for $650k but you’d subtract

$65k for closing costs
$65k for renovations
and $38k for mortgage payments.

that leaves you with $482k… or 74% of the after repair value.
on the other hand, if you want cash and sell your house to us, we can pay you up to 70% in as little as 7 days.
is a measly 4% worth all that time and aggravation?
that said, if you do choose the traditional route, hire a realtor because they get the best results even though realtor fees are twice as much.
but we find that most people who come to us would like to sell their house quickly to avoid pressure. unlike typical house buyers, san diego county, we buy properties in any condition.


at sunnynest homes, we’ll treat you with respect and we won’t pressure you.
if i want to sell my house in san diego county fast, why is your home buying company different than others?
