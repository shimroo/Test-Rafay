welcome to f.c. kerbeck!


in 1899, the patriarch of the kerbeck family, the great-grandfather of the 3 kerbeck brothers who are the present-day owners, began bringing his dream of providing quality transportation to the growing philadelphia-area population. he sold horse-drawn buggies to well-to-do families, and when their chauffeurs would bring the buggies in for repair, or to change their configuration from season to season, charles f. kerbeck provided overnight lodging for them.
horse drawn carriages evolved into coaches powered by gasoline engines, which evolved into automobiles. over a century later, the kerbeck dealerships are among the most prominent and successful in america, with 14 highly successful franchises, 12 different brands and eight separate showrooms. it is one of america’s great success stories.
