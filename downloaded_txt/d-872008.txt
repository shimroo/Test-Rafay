inventing the phone

1843 samuel fb morse had invented the telegraph
making it possible to transmit instantenous messages of two distant points.
the invention required hand-delivery of messages between telegraph stations.
messages cound be only send in one way at a time.
alexander graham bell was working on an idea on improving this way of communication. 


1876 february 14   11h30 am alexander graham bell 
filed a trademark for the invention of the phone.
it was the 5th trademark application of the day. 
1876 february 14 1h30 pm elisha grey, 
another inventor filed a similar trademark  (39th trademark application of the day)

1876 march 7 trademark patent no. 174,465 granted to 
alexander graham bell, a 29 years old inventor.

1876 march 10, three days later 
"mr watson come here i need you"
after years of efforts  suddenly was placed the first telephone call
alexander graham bell talking to his assistance thomas watson
in his boston laboratory


a special connection with brazil

1876 april alexander graham bell was a teacher for death mutes in boston.
dom pedro ii (1825 - 1891), the emperor of brazil visiting the united states
came to boston university and visited bell's class of deaf-mutes.
the experiance later resulted 
 in the first brazilian school for deaf-mutes in  rio. 



1876 mai 10 opening of the centenial exhibition of philadelphia faimont park. 
alexander graham bell presents the phone to don pedro ii, emperor of brazil
the attention don pedro gave to bell's invention 
was influenced by the fact they had already met at boston university.

while the exposition judges initially paid little attention to bell's invention
the vip celebrity of the expo's guest of honor, 
the brazilian emperor had a 
 huge marketing impact.
noticing the attention  don pedro
 paid to bell
the judges changed their mind 
and bell's phone 
 won the gold price,
the  price made the invention world famous.

don pedro is the first exterior investor 
to buy shares.

one of the first  telephones in a private residence was installed in petropolis 
in the home of 
dom pedro. 
from the first 5 cities where the telephone was used,
4 were in brazil. 



visiting paris and cremerie de paris 




1881 nov 
bell travelled to paris for the internation exposition of electricity
held at the palais de l'industrie avenue des champs elysees.
at the expo he met werner von siemens who presented the electric tramway
and gustave trouve who presented an electric car.





 
bell stayed at the hotel continental on rue de rivoli, 
20 min walking distance from cremerie de paris.
at the time the eiffel tower did not exist yet
but another spectacular construction attracted every visitor.
the pavillons baltard facing cremerie de paris.
the pavillons were imagined 
by the former empress eugenie and constructed all in iron and glass. 

the video shows paris during the times
alexander graham bell came to visit.

it is not clear if bell had been inside cremerie de paris, at the time a milk store at the foodmarket
but he later described the beauty of les halles to aimée sotto maior. 
bell probably did not know about cremerie de paris centuries old telecom history
going back to the year 1671 and the royal french postal services
operated by the pajot & rouillé postmasters exchange partner of and the thurn & taxis. 



a summer home in cape breton, nova scotia, canada
beinn bhreagh 



1885 bell discovered baddeck during vacation.
1886 bell bought  land and started building a mansion
   later completed by a laboratory.
the property was named  beinn bhreagh which in gaelic means beautiful mountain
inspired by the scottish highlands.

meeting aimée sotto maior 

1921 young aimée sotto major accompagnied someone from the braganca family 
on a trip to the us east cost. they made an excusion to nova scotia, canada
where they visited alexander graham bell.

alexander graham bell always surrounded by young people
gives aimée an advise:
"to stay young you need to have young friends"







1891 don pedro dies, 
                              but the braganza family stayed in contact with bell.

                              over a hundred year later the bell braganca
                              connection would have an
                              impact on a new telephone product 
                              the brazilian whitepages

1998 (eventually 1997 have to verify)
                              the editor of this article happened to spend a biarritz summer vacation
                              with aimée sotto maior / aimée de heeren
                              and 
                              isabelle orleans braganca / countess de paris (1911 - 2003)


                              isabelle was the great-granddaughter 
                              of alexander bell's 
                              friend and sponsor
                              don pedro ii of brazil

                              don pedros daughter,
isabel princess imperial of brazil 
                              was the mother of pedro de alcântara,
                              the father of isabelle orélans branganca.

                              unfortunately at the time he did not know 
                              about the connection
                              between bell and the bragancas.
                              

                              it would have been very interesting
                              to see if don pedros great-granddaughter 
                              would know anything about him.

                              isabelle orleans braganza 
                              was the mother of henri count of paris (1933 - 2019)
                              and the stepmother 
                              of the lovely micaela, 
                              countess of paris. (1938 - 2022)

                              does anybody know what happend to 
                              the shares don pedro 
                              owned in the bell company ??
                              they must have turned into a fortune. 










death and burial
1922 august 2 bell died from   anemia  and diabetes at his estate beinn bhreagh.
1922 august 4 the funearl was held at his property.
during the funeral all north american telephones stoped working for one minute.
a little over 14 million phones were used at that time. 

according to john wanamaker leas 
one of those that carried the coffin was john wanamaker
the later grandfather in law of the beautiful brazilian girl aimée sotto major
john wanamaker (1838 - 1922) was the grandfather of fernanda wanamaker heeren,
aimées later mother in law.

 centenary of the phone 

1976 the us postal services issued a stamp for the telephone centennial


bells keeps having an impact on 
his young 
   brazilian friend
leading to the invention of a new telephone product 


aimée sotto maior never forgets the impression bell had left on her.
she also stays connected to the braganza family
even though she leaves brazil in 1938.



johannes thurn und taxis, son of maria ana of braganza (1899 - 1971)
was part of the braganza family through his mother. 
maria ana braganza was the grandaughter of king miguel i of portugal (1802 - 1866)
a cousin of emperor don pedro ii
   of brazil
this is probably how he met aimée sotto maior / aimée de heeren
that had worked as a brazilian secret service agent in paris during world war ii.
getting older aimée loved spending three weeks each december 
at the home of thurn & taxis in regensburg, germany.

johannes thurn & taxis was very smart and  educated.
he had a fascination telecommunications background much older than the telephone,
going back to the 1290 invention of the  postal services buy his fathers ancestors.
1700s his 6 x great grandfather 
anselm franz von thurn & taxis,
the red man with the posthorn you see in the logo of the whitepages,
came to vb / cremerie de paris by horse
to discuss mail transportation issues.


1869 the thurn & taxis telecom company was taken way by the state of prussia 
turning into the german ptt.

1980s johannes  had 
   the vision that telephones
- blocked by ptt (poste telephone & telegraph) state monoplies  - were full of future.

like bell he liked to be in contact with young people.
he met them out of the blue 
and just like alexander graham bell 
he loved to use a tiny bit of his wealth 
and his connections
to push them so they would 
make a little sucess story of their own.



through johannes thurn & taxis a young  student in paris,
today's editor of vb.com and the whitepages from many countries
had the chance to meet 
 aimee sotto maior.
it was the same aimée now called aimée de heeren 
alexander graham bell had met 65 years before. 

1986 june 7 following a party for his 60th birthday,
thurn & taxis organised a diner and sat the student next to aimée.
"i want you to make a good impression on my friend,
she could become a springboard for you"

aimée on her side followed 
alexander graham bell's advise 
"to stay young you need to have young friends"

the result of the diner was a new friendship 
that would never come to an end.



both thurn & taxis and aimée sotto major
pushed the student into 
telecommunications.
the adventure started with a small repair shop for avant-garde sony phones 
right next to a former postal center and telecom landmark 
the 
hotel de villeroy bourbon vb / cremerie de paris
facing the former pavillons baltard bell had admired when visiting paris. 

talking to the student  aimée  sometimes mentioned a fascinating inventor 
she had met when she had the  same age.
the inventor loved to be around young people.

the former student always wanted to know the name of the 
inventor
but he had to wait for 20 years
until august 2006, 
a few days before aimée de heeren left this world.


the name of the inventor:
alexander  bell 
would have revealed 
aimées best kept secret,
her real age ... 
decades older ...
that people beleived 


exept aimées sister vera, 
nobody from aimées later life knew about her bell connection.

as a former world war ii secret service agent 
that stoped brazil from an alliance with germany
she knew to keep secrets 
and how to change the birthday in her passport 
.... 



starting the whitepages project



2005 aimée sotto maior / aimée de heeren and ben solms at cybercafe de paris,
when the idea came up to create whitepages.
the evening of the photo 
was attempted 
register  the brazilian whitepages domain,
whitepages.com.br
.
at that moment 85 years had gone by since aimée de heeren 
had met alexander bell ...



2004 mai 26 french whitepages, whitepages.fr 


2005 september 26 brazilian whitepages, whitepages.com.br



whitepages.de
whitepages.es
whitepages.ie
whitepages.in
whitepages.it
whitepages.jp
and many more



alexander graham bell would have enjoyed to know
that many 
					of the young people around him 
					would come up with cool invention, mainly in aviation.

he would probably not have expected that the less technical one of them
the young aimée 
that hardly spoke englisg at the time they met 
would one day be a friend of a man that was on the first flight to the moon.
and that she would 
initiate a new telephone project.
almost a century after they met.

such things can only happen
if you follow his advise,
to stay young
you need to have young friends 

helping someone much much younger
to bypass the barriers of time.
