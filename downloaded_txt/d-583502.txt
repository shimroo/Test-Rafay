explore the art world of vision, light, and creation with wiesław sadurski
online since 2000-07-17 


vision - a tool of cognition; light - the source, means and purpose; creation - the inborn state of life.
 
in a search for the meaning of life
                      
                  art is in direct relation to everything
grows in darkness, flies to light,
loves the unknown, makes me free

 vision, light and creation  are both philosophical and fun to explore, as they are the keys to understanding the world
vision in art: beyond perception and imagination
at wisarts, vision transcends mere sight, offering profound insights into the essence of nature and reality. the paintings are not just dreams or fleeting thoughts; they are tangible manifestations of vision, brought to life with every stroke of the brush on canvas. in this journey, discover how love intertwines with visual expression, creating art that speaks to the soul.
light: the essence of artistic inspiration 
                    in the world of wisarts, light transcends its physical properties, symbolizing a beacon of hope, wisdom, and spiritual awakening. it's not just a blend of waves and particles; light is the cornerstone of existence, the ethereal brushstroke that paints the universe. my art captures this quintessence, weaving light into every creation to illuminate the depths of the human spirit.
creation: the heartbeat of innovation and art 
                    at the core of wisarts lies creation – a celebration of the new, the unseen, and the transformative. an artwork is a chapter in humanity's grand narrative, a blend of tradition and innovation. through creation, i delve into the realms of imagination and reality, intertwining light, matter, and color to craft visual stories. it's a journey that brings laughter, reflection, and an appreciation for the intricate dance of life.
