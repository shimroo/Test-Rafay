	 amazing differences between gm and wal-mart employment
    


title: why you shouldn't shop at wal-mart on friday
source: robert reich in the american prospect
date: november 23, 2012

from the article:a half century ago america’s largest private-sector employer was general motors, whose full-time workers earned an average hourly wage of around $50, in today’s dollars, including health and pension benefits.

today, america’s largest employer is wal-mart, whose average employee earns $8.81 an hour. a third of wal-mart’s employees work less than 28 hours per week and don’t qualify for benefits.

there are many reasons for the difference—including globalization and technological changes that have shrunk employment in american manufacturing while enlarging it in sectors involving personal services, such as retail.

but one reason, closely related to this seismic shift, is the decline of labor unions in the united states. in the 1950s, over a third of private-sector workers belonged to a union. today fewer than 7 percent do. as a result, the typical american worker no longer has the bargaining clout to get a sizeable share of corporate profits.

	 the 1 percent’s problem
    


title: the 1 percent’s problem
source: vanity fair
date: may 31, 2012

from the article:let’s start by laying down the baseline premise: inequality in america has been widening for dec­ades. we’re all aware of the fact. yes, there are some on the right who deny this reality, but serious analysts across the political spectrum take it for granted. i won’t run through all the evidence here, except to say that the gap between the 1 percent and the 99 percent is vast when looked at in terms of annual income, and even vaster when looked at in terms of wealth—that is, in terms of accumulated capital and other assets. consider the walton family: the six heirs to the walmart empire possess a combined wealth of some $90 billion, which is equivalent to the wealth of the entire bottom 30 percent of u.s. society. (many at the bottom have zero or negative net worth, especially after the housing debacle.) warren buffett put the matter correctly when he said, “there’s been class warfare going on for the last 20 years and my class has won.”

	 u.s. pensions plundered by corporate greed
    


title: u.s. pensions plundered by corporate greed, author sayssource: yahoo financedate: september 26, 2011from the article:meanwhile, new york times columnist and economist paul krugman, noted in a piece last week titled "the social contract," that while the middle gets squeezed, the rich keep getting richer in both real and relative terms."...the congressional budget office — which only go up to 2005, but the basic picture surely hasn't changed —show that between 1979 and 2005 the inflation-adjusted income of families in the middle of the income distribution rose 21 percent. that's growth, but it's slow, especially compared with the 100 percent rise in median income over a generation after world war ii. meanwhile, over the same period, the income of the very rich, the top 100th of 1 percent of the income distribution, rose by 480 percent. no, that isn't a misprint. in 2005 dollars, the average annual income of that group rose from $4.2 million to $24.3 million."if the average worker didn't have enough to worry about, ellen schultz - an award-winning wall street journal reporter and author of retirement heist: how companies plunder and profit from the nest eggs of american workers -- says that in some instances the fat paychecks of the top paid executives are coming directly out of the pocket of average workers.

	 the drudge report trumpets the concentration of wealth
    


this is what the drudge report web site looks like today:the main link in red leads to this article:census: us poverty rate swells to nearly 1 in 6the ranks of u.s. poor swelled to nearly 1 in 6 people last year, reaching a new high as long-term unemployment woes left millions of americans struggling and out of work. the number of uninsured edged up to 49.9 million, the biggest in over two decades.another link:u.s. poverty climbed to 17-year high in 2010 as household income fellthe u.s. poverty rate rose to the highest level in almost two decades and household income fell in 2010, underscoring the lingering impact of the worst economic slump in seven decades.data released by the census bureau today showed the proportion of people living in poverty climbed to 15.1 percent last year from 14.3 percent in 2009, and median household income declined 2.3 percent. the number of americans living in poverty was the highest in the 52 years since the census bureau began gathering that statistic. those figures may have worsened in recent months as the economy weakened. this is exactly what would be expected when the wealth of the nation is concentrating. since the drudge report is a staunch proponent of policies that help wealth to concentrate, we must assume that this home page for drudge is good news - a mark of accomplishment. poverty is the expected and desired result of policies that concentrate wealth.

	 academics critical of skyrocketing pay for ceos
    


title: academics critical of skyrocketing pay for ceossource: thestar.comdate: january 3, 2011from the article: “it’s just breathtaking,” hugh mackenzie, economist for the ottawa-based non-profit research group, said in an interview. “the skyrocketing level of executive pay in canada and the u.s. is the primary factor that lies behind growing income inequality.”the typical explanation — that companies need to offer their chief executive millions in order to attract, keep and motivate a suitable leader — doesn’t hold water, mackenzie said.“you could ask how motivating is it for the average employee, who is actually the person who generates the income for the corporation, to see that their ceo is making 300 times what they are. i would think that would be kind of demotivating.”

	 huge bonuses at fannie mae, freddie mac
    


title: u.s. promises unlimited financial assistance to fannie mae, freddie macsource: washington postdate: december 25, 2009from the article:the obama administration pledged thursday to provide unlimited financial assistance to mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac, an eleventh-hour move that allows the government to exceed the current $400 billion cap on emergency aid without seeking permission from a bailout-weary congress. the christmas eve announcement by the treasury department means that it can continue to run the companies, which were seized last year, as arms of the government for the rest of president obama's current term. but even as the administration was making this open-ended financial commitment, fannie mae and freddie mac disclosed that they had received approval from their federal regulator to pay $42 million in wall street-style compensation packages to 12 top executives for 2009.

title: why people are going hungry in the land of plenty - a look at living wagessource: alternetdate: july 4, 2009from the article:the u.s. government’s official poverty line in 2008 was $10,590 for a single person, $13,540 for a couple, $16,530 for a family of three, and $21,203 for a family of four. and the census bureau estimated that over 37 million americans (including noncitizen residents) were living at or below these income levels. but that only hinted at the growing scale of american poverty. economists such as bob pollin, codirector of the political economy research institute at the university of massachusetts, believed many tens of million americans more were living on incomes that, while they might meet a denuded government “minimum-wage” threshold, in reality couldn’t be expected to meet a family’s basic needs.pollin’s team calculated that a single person needed to earn ten dollars an hour to achieve even a semblance of economic security; and, as with the poverty line, so with this measure, which he called a “living wage,” the dollar amount would go up as the number of people in the family increased.

title: golden parachutes: how the bankers went downsource: mintdate: 2/24/2009from the article:when high-ranking executives are fired from a company, for whatever reason, they don’t go to the back of the unemployment line. instead, they typically receive compensation in the form of the “golden parachute.” golden parachutes can include severance pay, cash bonuses, stock options or other benefits. in the case of the financial crisis and the ensuing bank failures, if it seems like these executives are being rewarded for poor performance, you may be right. here’s a look at what some bankers made on their way down.
