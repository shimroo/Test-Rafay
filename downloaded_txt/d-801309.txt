cern and the world-wide web

        the cern softball club was the first softball team to publish a home page on the
        world-wide web.
        the reason for this is that the web was originally created here 
        at cern. if you would like more information regarding the history of the 
        development of the web at cern (yet another good reason to support 
        fundamental research), i suggest the following resources:
