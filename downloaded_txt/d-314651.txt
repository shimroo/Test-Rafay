from an old monmouth county horse farm to a national award-winning institution of learning, over 60 years in the making.




early in 1958, a group of devoted laymen realized the need for an all-boys catholic high school in monmouth county. with the approval of bishop george w. ahr, they initiated a drive to raise funds for the purchase of whitney greentree stables in lincroft. the brothers of the christian schools agreed to staff the school and finance its construction, and the rest is history. today, cba is a two-time winner of the national blue ribbon school of excellence with over 11,000 proud alumni.
