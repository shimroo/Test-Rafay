there were so many party fouls last night it was ridiculous.i woke up with a horrible headache and no pants on.two 40oz will do that to you.god bless you mickeys.someone stole my weed and my fucking piece that richard brought me back from europe.i know better than to get attached to a pipe, but it's hard not to be sad over it since dick got it for me.i now have zero weed.i miss my pipe.thanks whoever decided to get fucked up and got through my bag.assholes.

marijuana, pink floyd, and radiohead are what fuel me lately.i wish i knew more dependable people that sell bud.people suck so much sometimes.i miss playing frisbee.i miss david.i wish i saw richard more.i wish me and jessie found more time to hang out.there are so many things i miss.so many things i desire.but i'm holding on.making the best of things.still loving life."breathe, keep breathing,don't lose your nerve.breathe, keep breathing,i can't do this alone."-rh
