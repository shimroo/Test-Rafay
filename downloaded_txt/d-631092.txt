spiral dance
songs of
   magick,
myth 
   & legend
as powerful as any equinox and as magical as any inspired ritual, spiral dance offers up rich vocals, delicate melodies and rousing jams all invoking the pagan world at the dawning of its rebirth. spiral dance plays high energy pagan folk rock that combines an eclectic blend of powerful self-penned songs and tunes. spiral dance are the song catchers of magick, myth and legend.
the band was formed in 1992 as a project to explore some of the more mystical elements in life and has drawn its energy from the song-writing and vocal skills of adrienne piggott. adrienne’s haunting lyrics and paul’s innovative accordion tunes are carefully arranged to blend acoustic folk- rock with lush celtic harmony, creating an almost tangible musical aura that envelopes the audience.

starting on the snare drum as a youngster, matt soon expanded his interests to playing the drum kit and dove headlong in to the world of classic rock.
enjoying the music of jimi hendrix, led zeppelin, the doors and cream, he found a large jazz influence in the drummers of those bands which led to listening to all sorts of jazz, blues, funk, latin, fusion and progressive rock music.
over the years matt has played in many different groups and genres of music, including developing a keen interest in playing the bass guitar and dabbling in a bit of banjo. influences and inspiration have come from listening to lots of indian music, celtic, folk and other world music styles across the decades.
the exciting thing about playing in spiral dance is the ability to be able to draw upon all the styles and influences he has absorbed in over 30 plus years of immersion in the music world.simon started learning violin as a young child, later studying at the australian national university in canberra and the sir zelman cowen school of music and performance in melbourne.
simon has played violin and viola in orchestras as far afield as ontario, canada and sao paulo, brazil.
wanting to branch out from the world of classical music, simon performed violin, guitar and vocals in punk, rock and country bands in canberra and melbourne, most notably the orphanage and patches, selling out iconic melbourne rock venues like the workers club and the old bar.
after moving to adelaide, simon joined spiral dance in 2022, where his alter ego the scrubwren feels at home with the band’s strong connection to the earth and its stories.adrienne piggott
 

residing in naarm/melbourne, rena has been involved in musical performance on stage and behind the scenes for over 40 years. her styles have mostly centred around rock, pop, folk and blues.
her first public performance was playing bagpipes in adelaide’s christmas pageant, aged 10, which launched her lifelong addiction to entertaining audiences. rena spent her teenage years busking in adelaide's rundle mall every chance she got.
in addition to her work with spiral dance, rena has collaborated on projects with members of f.a.b., seven stories, colcannon and the steve brown band. she was a founding member of the long running live-to-air radio show the hillbilly hoot (three d radio) and also made musical guest appearances on am adelaide and children’s tv show the music shop (including some with spiral dance!).
“i love playing live! you pour your energy into the performance, the audience amplifies that back and you keep lifting each other until it hits them – they are part of the band.”spirit of the green

through fire light and dark the winter calledcome greet an early morning with the frost upon the landa halo binds the moon with ice crystals in the airand the skeletons of trees like guardians do stand
the harvest is long over and we’ve passed through samhain’s gatethe misty woods are sleeping, for bridhe’s sweet kiss they waitthe wind it cuts like a knife, for the bones of jack frost keens and the winter king will soon bow down to the champion of the green
and the lord of the woodland is waiting in the leavesthrough the forest and the hedgerows the song of life he weaveswith his feet deep in the soil he watches over the greenwoodhe’s a messenger from nature this ancient wise god
hey oh it’s the green man jack, running through the woods singing up the summertimeand you know you will never look back from where the spirit of the green will take you
there’s poetry in the breezes that tell of things to comewith dancing corn and swaying wheat beneath the summer sunlay down among the blossoms sacred to the flower bridelost in scented fields where meadowsweet runs wild
lady of the lakes and fields, lady of the woodsi feel your verdant energy pulsing through my bloodyour silver skin of bark and moss upon your thighswith ivy twirls and briar curls you watch with hidden eyes
can you tell the green man is waiting in the leavesthrough the forest and the hedgerows the song of life he weaveswith his feet deep in the soil he watches over the greenwoodhe’s a messenger from nature, this ancient wise god.
hey oh it’s the green man jack, running through the woods singing up the summertimeand you know you will never look back from where the spirit of the green will take you
strength of oak and sage of yew, rowan, ash and thornthe summer king has claimed his bride so all will be rebornthe spirit of the wildwood calls, in the language of the trees protect the woodlands of the earth is the forest gods’ decree
without the essence of the green our world can never bedrawing breath around us from the sun into the leaves from soil and shoot, stem and root, by leaf and bark and limbwe keep alive the wisdom of the lord and lady green
and the wildman of the woodland is watching from the leavesthrough the forest and the hedgerows the song of life he weaveswith his feet deep in the soil he watches over the greenwoodhe’s a messenger from nature, this ancient wise god.
hey oh it’s the green man jack, running through the woods singing up the summertimeand you know you will never look back from where the spirit of the green will take you.hare spell

i am the wind across the seai am the bard of poetryi am the lake upon the plaini am the storm that brings the raini am the roar of the ocean tidesi am the stag of seven tines
i am the heat of the noonday suni am the dusk when the day is donei am the salmon of the wisei am the queen of every hivei am the dark of the mountain strongi am the flowing river’s song

when the chill winds blow in and there’s flurries of snowinto the woods the wren boys will gothe smallest of birds with feathers of brownwith their bows and their arrows they’ll hunt the wren down 
thirteen notes between the winter and the springin the holly and hedgerows hear the druid-bird singat the coming of yuletide the hunt will beginfor the wren, the king of the birds, king of the birds
flushed from the bramble and chased from the gorsewith sticks and with stones taken by forcethe quest for the wren as he draws his last breathin a bier of ribbons paraded in death 
chorus
your time is slipping by, four seasons in your songi’ll listen tiny bard as you sing all winter long<the pattern you wove, high above the groundwhy try to win with strength when there’s wisdom to be found
chorusto dream a raven
adrienne piggott
it’s a melancholy autumn, can you feel late summer’s breathdusk has come a chasing the light is fading in the westshe waits outside my widow crying in the forest tonguethe time has come for endings you know it won’t be long
old norfolk pine stands sentinel he watches over my homehis branches all lie silent now the ravens have all flownbut come he calls and rest a while in amongst my boughsthe sky is waiting for you and there’s omens in the clouds
sleek of wing, white knowing eye yes it’s you i seei’m longing to fly with you into eternityand in the waning dusty days there’s a message in your songcome lie beneath the fallen leaves and sleep ‘till winters gone
light splinters through the trees as sharp as any thornand the prism of your tears are rainbows waiting to be bornso it’s time to draw the curtains on life’s dark pantomimeall that’s left is a suitcase of memories locked in the attic of time
chorus
always trust your intuition the raven said to mefor you know the whispers from your heart foretold a prophecy and you’ll see that everything passes nothing forever lastsso take the mantle from the gaslight and bury the bones of the past
chorusblack water deep 
adrienne piggott
close your eyes against the sunlight where scarlet pools lie deeplike the rivers and the lochs where the water spirits sleepbeneath the rocks and stones there's secrets that they keepdown below black water below black water deep
beneath the lowering sky where darkness reaches greenon a hill above a burn a proud horse was seenwild were her eyes her flanks were strong and leangazing down into black water into black water deep
ride kelpie ride the wind is at your sidetake the wanderer on your back into the waters divebide kelpie bide in the lake cold and widedark shape shifter of the tides
along the open road a traveller came by and by a darkling pool the proud horse he did spygrazing all alone with no one by her sidedown beside black water beside black water deep
his journey had been long the travel had been slowand weary were his feet with many miles to gohe thought to take the horse and upon her back he'd goand ride away from black water from black water deep
chorus
so to the horse he came with freedom on his mindand holding to her mane upon her back he climbedbut kelpies won't be tamed so never shall he rideaway from black water from black water deep
her scream pierced the sky worse than a banshee's shriekthe mare reared up high as sparks flew from her feetand with a roar like thunder from the bank did leapdown into black water into black water deep
chorusthe seven sisters
adrienne piggott
dusk is falling round your eyesheart is beating in your chestin the north i see your risebut you run towards the westhow long must i hold the skybefore it's time for you to fleeif the hemispheres ever collideperhaps then you’ll l be free
cold star cluster beautiesice blue jewels in flightin your celestial realmdon’t let him see your lighthe'll steal what you won’t give himand he’ll strip your spirit barethere’s a chaos in his lovein a line of song so rare
running in darkness alonestruggling now to forgetmemories into black holes are thrownstardust shelters regretand to me you will always be lostheart and spirit now tornonce my last thought every nightonce my first thought every morn
chorus
i see you my beautiful sistersrunning reckless across the night skiesin the present we’re all seeking peacebut fear what the future decidesand when i’ve been gone a thousand yearsyour shining youth wouldn’t have diedstill on your dark soul journeywaiting for the hemispheres to collide
chorusto the wild
adrienne piggott
the musk of earth the musk of deeri turn, i run i show no fearwith velvet tines and head held highsmell the breeze taste the skywith thunder hooves beneath the mooni know the hunt is coming
on silent wing the flight of owlwith star filled night the wild dog howlof feather beak black eye and clawof scale and talon bone and furi live and dream within the wildand with the wild i journey
i run with hoof i run with horni shed my skin i am rebornit’s to the wild that i am sworn and to the wild i am returning
with sunlight’s ray the day is newupon my skin the morning dewdamp leaves cling to skin so fairtwigs and bark knot chestnut hairi hear the song of stag and hind and know my heart is singing
chorus
moon’s crystal kiss on spider weavesilver caress on darkling leaveschill nights breath on rock and stonedancing mist the way is shownwithin body and within soulthe forest now is calling
and when dawn wakes me from my dreami’ll taste the clear of mountain streamsoil and leaves fall from my face of human form there is no tracewhat binds me has been left behindi see the track way i must followmurrundi song

chorusswords of wayland
adrienne piggott
through the mists of long ages pastin a time of great gods and alchemybeneath dark hills and caverns deepworked a strange and mystic sorceryborn in thunder from the mountainawakened by an ancient flameforged by immortal powerthe mighty swords from wayland came
white metal upon the anvil ringsshining steel upon the iron laycooled in the dew of early morningrunes of prophecy carved along the bladewho has seen this shadowy smith?from the dwarves of iceland learned his tradethe noble craftsman of magic metal workthe mighty swords of wayland came
and in the dusk you’ll hear the hammer strike the anviland break the silence that lays on white horse hillnever still the hand that forges ironthe ghostly blacksmith is with us still
follow along the old track wayto where the silent long barrow liesthe stones hold his secrets closetimeless voices still sing his praisefor such power won't stay hidden through timewithin the secret of the bladesfrom the blacksmith of the immortalsthe mighty swords of wayland came
chorusdark night of the soul
adrienne piggott
the silver moon lay upon the black waterupon the black water that covered the lakeshe stepped over stones and walked down to the shallows to ask the bright lady what path she should takeand the silver light crept into all the dark places into her heart and into her mindstorm clouds will gather the moon will be waning come drink from the cauldron to see what you’ll find
deep in the silence of snow covered mountains and down to the valley a glitter with frostin the depth of the night she searched for the tinder to try and rekindle the embers she’d lostbut the fire had died and the flames were all ashesthe rose and the briar no longer entwinesomewhere there’s a dream that’s suspended in amberand the scar on her heart will be there for all time
drops of rain gather on the heart’s cold bare branchesweather the storm and your leaves turn to rustsing into the wind and cast words to the ether dance in the passion then choke on the dusta new story has risen but who writes the endingthere’s thorns in the heart and storms in the headfingers would dance across a cold fret boardthe lyrics were there but the music had fled
many winters have passed and the summer comes bringing warmth and a start to a new melodyshining notes scribbled across the soft vellumwords written in tears will sketch new memoriesa soul slick with heartbreak lays on the dark pavement the trek back up the mountain has been a harsh climbonly the gods know the length of the journeyand the wind whispers there’s no going backward in time
a dragon fly danced across the blue wateracross the blue water that covers the lakeshe stepped over stones and walked down to the shallows to ask the bright lady what path she should takeno point gathering thread to mend what was brokenor remember the feel of that final embrace.the bright ladies beside you the full moon will guide youthe journey has ended and the story has changed.let it all wash away
adrienne piggott
there’s an old river redgum standing close to the waterroots down deep into the bank are boundand a ripple of song from the river god’s daughterfollow the lyric to where your story is found
she calls ‘come, step into the shallows’leave your shadow behind for there’s darkness belowshe’ll sing you a charm she’ll sing an enchantmentstep away from the past and dive into the flow
let it all wash away, wash away cleansing your soullet it all wash away, wash away making you whole
let the flow take you between the old tree rootsdeep into the bank between water and earthcome face the challenge of all that is shiftinggive yourself to the river give yourself to rebirth
come into the womb of magical imagining a slick salty path to the cauldron withina sea that’s awash with bright inspirationrelease what was broken let the journey begin
chorus
swim with skin changing deep in mind reachingdance with the pull of the moons wax and wanevision unfolding and change is upon youfor the dark goddess has spoken your name
with invisible strings the wind harp calls to youthe warmth of summer on your skin where you laydrink from the cup filled with liquid sunlightthe sheoak whispers ‘tis a new day …
chorusman of straw
adrienne piggott
on a hide of land next to a woodfrom spring through to harvest a man of straw stoodsways with the breeze and looks over the wheatas the shadows of summer fall at his feetand the wind shakes the barley and rattles the ryeand scarecrow looks on as the year passes by.
burnished thistles float through the airchallenge the crow with a cold lifeless stareno one thinks of you through the long sun kissed daysnodding away in the summer time hazeand the wind shakes the barley and rattles the ryeand scarecrow looks on as the year passes by.
scarecrow old scarecrow you look so forlornthere alone in your field of ripe cornand when all lies silent and there’s no crows to scarewho lays the stalks into patterns so rareand when the wind becomes restless and the harvest is doneyou can dance like a dervish beneath the bright sun
when the winter winds howl and the hearth fire burnsfrom beyond the dark woodland the wild hunt returnsthe hide lies in silence, the crows have all flownwild seed and thistle to the four winds are blownyour coat is in tatters, straw in decayyour season is over you’ve seen the last day
heavy the plough that furrows the earthsoil rich and black filled with seeds of rebirthacross the sky dances a pattern of rain sun in his zenith will ripen the grainand in the spring when all is reborna new man of straw watches over the corn
