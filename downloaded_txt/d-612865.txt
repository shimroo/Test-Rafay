is there a world for butterflies?
the book
a world for butterflies is a profusely illustrated primer on butterfly biology and insect conservation. to illuminate the plight of insects in general the book examines the lives and conservation issues faced by the "charismatic megafauna" of the insect world, the butterflies. five chapters introduce butterflies and insect conservation, and consider their diversity, their worldwide distribution, their day-to-day lives and intriguing behaviors, and conservation issues specific to butterflies and other insects.
with 320 pages and more than 300 beautiful full-color photos of butterflies in nature, taken by some of the world's finest butterfly photographers, the book provides insight into the lives and behaviors of these fascinating creatures. by examining the forcesâboth good and badâacting on them and their immature stages we learn that our knowledge of most insects is woefully incomplete. how do we conserve what we do not know?
