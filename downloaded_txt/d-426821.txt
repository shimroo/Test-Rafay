an august midnight- poets.org - poetry, poems, bios & more

to mr. hardy from chris murray:

here, inside the infinitely repeating
apartment complexes
of fabulously airconditioned texas,
we cannot find a dumbledore
or moth or even a bitty fly.

but if they could find their way 
past the hermetically sealed thresholds,
it's almost certain they would fall madly
in love with our panels of flux,
our attentive, gorgeously
backlit screens.

oh, haha: more weather report from beijing, china: not windy today, a little cloudy.  not so cold!
& in class, cool to warm: a nice reading aloud from robert b. reich's 2000 essay, "the nationalism we need" (american prospect, 1999).  a lot for students to take in there--did you know "nationalism" has "two faces"? (or, it occurs to me now, it is "two faced"  hmmm interesting trope, there). good thinking and questioning going on in the students' reading journals.  reich is definitely no stranger to rhetorical means of digging in and making one think over/about the scaffolding of macro strategy, as it were, in a given nationalistic rhetorical situation.  i liked it.  i like it.  good thinking goin' on!
