it suddenly seemed like a good idea to set up an rowanette blog ring. i mean why not, i spend all my time trying to keep track of them all.just a few rules (for now).1. blog ring for rowanettes. it's mostly knitting but can be other stuff too (gardening, cooking, etc). as long as there is no objectional material, it's cool. what do i mean by objectional? not sure, but when i see it, i'll know.2. blog can be in any language.3. active blogs only. blog must be updated regularly. by regularly, i mean at least once a month. blogs not updated after 2 months will be banished.4.  please feel free to design another button for the ring, if it please you.  i'm all for creativity and i know that the current button isn't all inspiring.
