we litigate nationally recognized class actions


burr & smith, llp represents employees and consumers in class and collective action cases which have the potential to impact the lives of our clients by changing the way corporations in the united states treat their employees and consumers.  we make changes by taking a small number of impact class actions each year and using all of our resources to maximize the likelihood of prevailing on these cases.  each of the attorneys in the firm participates in national, state, or local bar associations and works with these associations by drafting treatises that are helpful to other lawyers litigating similar cases, lobbying for changes in the law, making presentations on legal issues to attorneys throughout the united states, and serving in leadership roles in these associations.
 
our firm has received numerous accolades including being given a âfoot soldiersâ awardâ from the naacp for âadvocacy on behalf of many who are without means of redress,â being recognized for âoutstanding achievement in public accommodationsâ from the washington lawyersâ committee for civil rights and urban affairs, being identified as a tier 1 law firm among firms nationwide by u.s. news and world report, and receiving recognition as legal elite from corporate america news with an âaward for excellence in complex class actionsâ and identified as âbest for wage & hour law â florida.â





the goal of each lawyer at burr & smith, l.l.p. is to positively impact the lives of as many people as possible by offering proficient and focused legal representation of the highest quality. we believe we can best accomplish this goal by representing plaintiffs who are suing on behalf of themselves and all others who have experienced similar violations of their rights. this is why our attorneys focus on complex public interest class action litigation, collective and multi-party actions.
 
in order to ensure that the attorneys can devote the necessary time and attention to accomplish this goal, they engage in intensive research and investigation before accepting any case, and strictly limit the number and types of cases they accept. each attorney at burr & smith, l.l.p. has demonstrated a commitment to promoting employee rights and civil rights through membership and participation in various organizations and activities, including the national employment lawyers association and its florida affiliate chapter and the national association for the advancement of colored people and the washington lawyers' committee for civil rights and urban affairs.
