new single release“love like ours” out everywhere nowi’m thrilled to tell you that the first single ‘love like ours’ from my forthcoming album just dropped!! you can find it online everywhere! it’s a song very near to my heart. it’s an ode to everlasting love that transcends time and the physical form. it was written for my father who was swiftly taken from this world by pancreatic cancer when i was 10 weeks pregnant with my son. it is dedicated to anyone who ever lost someone they hold dear. this song is a promise between souls to reunite on the other side. it's a prayer and a declaration of love sent to the farthest corners of the universe. it is a summoning of spirits to join us once again. this song is an altar built to honor love that never dies.here’s to everlasting love, and to you dadi hope you enjoy..special thanks to everyone who made this recording possible:produced by david simon-baker, craig morton, danny uzilevsky and essenceessence goldman: vocalsdanny uzi: dobro & vocalsgary kaye: banjoandrew gootnick: vocalsmaurice tani: vocalsdavid simon baker: bass drumand extra special thanks to stephen jarvis














father’s daughteressence’s forthcoming studio album covers a lot of miles. a collection of hard won wisdom captured in songs that could never have been written without real life living. it's an honest and at times humorous account of her losses and wins, to the bone and from the heart. steeped in the traditions of the appalachian, americana and roots music that essence grew up on with timeless dobro guitars, aching pedal steels, rolling banjos, and rich vocal harmonies on beds of church organs. on a road filled with searching these songs are mile markers along the way. you are cordially invited to listen to a sneak preview of our new album, father's daughter.
