do you prefer your beetle classic or pimped?







classic or pimped?


the vw beetle is an iconic symbol of german engineering. a vehicle that was designed and built to last that is still very much loved and used daily all over the world to this very day .



some people love their beetle in it's original classic factory fitted state, others pimp them with lowered suspension and 'bling' to bring them into the twenty first century.



...some just like them rusty. what flava are you?

cool vw volkswagen camper logo t-shirt for people who love vdub's







chill out in this vw volkswagen camper t-shirt for people who love vdub's

100% cotton shirt is also available in seven other colours.  the design shows the evolution of a camper van driver with the vw mascot behind.

i love this unique 'old skool' design as it has a fun humorous element and will definately suit anyone who is a fan of these old vehicles.
