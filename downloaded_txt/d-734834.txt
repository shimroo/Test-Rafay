important message 
dear friends and supporters, vrra is facing the dilemma of too many rabbits. many of our foster rabbits are being returned due to people starting to travel. we have no room for new rabbits. this is very hard on us because we have to say no. we simply cannot save them all. 
when we turn people down they say things like “you are supposed to be a rescue”. we are and we take our mandate seriously. we cannot look after the rabbits we have if we become overcrowded. a rescue with too many animals is no longer a rescue but a hoarder with animals that need rescuing. so please understand our predicament. if you really want to help, become a foster person (if you can), and one that will keep the rabbit until adopted.
if you’re thinking about contacting us for any reason please read about/contact before you do.

follow us on vancouver rabbit rescue & advocacy vrra on facebook or instagram to find out about our next bunny rabbit event.  

adopting or fostering a bunny
if you are interested in adopting or fostering a bunny go to the adoption and foster info page, read the introductory material and then complete and submit the adoption application or foster application form on their respective pages. we will contact you to set up an appointment to visit our shelter and meet the bunnies.
we are currently in need of foster homes! fostering saves lives!
we appreciate you doing your bunny homework (research their health, housing and social needs) in advance of submitting an application. watch this video to help with your decision.




better with two


rabbits are social animals – most crave the companionship of another bunny. rabbit pairs groom each other, sleep, eat and play together. they keep each other company when you are busy or out of the house – companions against loneliness and boredom. bonded rabbits form extremely close attachments and their happy, hilarious and sweet interactions will expand your heart and life. but don’t worry that two bunnies will ignore their humans – they will give you double the love and fun of one!
adopt a bonded pair. adopting an already bonded pair is a great way to bypass the dating and bonding process. it’s a sweet deal: you get to take home two loving rabbits whose relationship is already sorted out and established. we currently have several bunny pairs ready for adoption – in the toolbar above, click on pairs to scroll through their bios.
adopt a friend for your single. if you already have a spayed/neutered rabbit in your family, adopting a friend for them is something we can help you with.  give us a call and we can arrange a time for you and your bunny to come to our shelter for a meet-and-greet with prospective pals.
important: rabbits are territorial and their choice of a new best friend may be different from yours. as adorable as bunnies are, they can seriously harm each other if introduced improperly. introductions between rabbits should be done gradually and should be supervised by someone experienced with bonding bunnies (that’s us!). the house rabbit society has very useful articles about the process of rabbit bonding.

volunteer at vrra
volunteers are the heart and soul of our organization. we especially need help in keeping our shelter clean, and providing socialization and enrichment activities to the bunnies. cleaning duties mainly involve keeping their cages and outside exercise pens clean, so that our bunnies enjoy happy and healthy lives. we also need people who can handle bunnies so they can be moved from their inside cages to outdoor exercise pens. most cleaners learn to do this as well. if you would like to volunteer, find out more by completing this form.
