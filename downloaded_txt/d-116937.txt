the new york state board of law examiners
			the new york state board of law examiners is responsible for administering the bar examination to candidates seeking admission to practice law in the state of new york.  the board has been in existence for more than one hundred twenty five years, having been created by the new york state legislature in 1894.  the operations of the state board of law examiners are overseen by a five member board of attorneys appointed by the new york court of appeals. the board maintains a business office in albany, new york with a full-time staff that oversees the bar examination.  the bar examination is administered twice per year, on the last consecutive tuesday and wednesday each february and july. in 2024, the board processed 16,574 applications for the bar examination and examined 14,354 applicants.


            recent news and notices - updated january 9, 2025



			
            the new york court of appeals announced on january 8, 2025 that new yok has adopted the nextgen bar examination, effective with the july 2028 exam administration. the notice issued by the new york court of appeals is available at https://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/.
            



  new limit on applications from repeater applicants with four or more unsuccessful attempts on bar examination
 pursuant to section 6000.4(c) of the rules of the state board of law examiners, effective december 1, 2024, applicants with four or more unsuccessful attempts on the new york bar examination may file an application for re-examination only for the february administration of the bar examination. 

            this new policy was necessary to address the increasing number of applicants for the july administration of the bar examination, which is impacting the boardâs ability to procure a sufficient number of seats at its test sites. the new policy will permit the board to better manage its existing resources (i.e., test sites, equipment, proctors, etc.). the board also hopes that this policy will encourage repeater applicants to utilize the additional time between examination attempts to better prepare for future attempts at the bar examination.
            

            applicants with four or more unsuccessful attempts on the new york bar examination are not precluded from taking the bar examination in another ube jurisdiction in july, and if they achieve a passing score, transferring that score to new york.
