loyal readers, you'll be pleased to know that i'm actually capable of taking a photo with my mouth closed.  :-)we just launched a new website, where the david krane bio page demonstrates that such a feat is possible...!

	 cool google-inspired contemporary artist...
	 
    

i've had the great pleasure to recently get to know ken solomon and his work.  his latest show just opened at the josee beienvenu gallery in chelsea.  love that he's obsessed with google image search results pages, and facebook profile oddities!  my personal fav is his air jordan/lichtenstein mash-up...  (also, a similar take, styled after the work of piet mondrian)peter kafka/allthingsd.com did a nice feature on ken's work here...

	 remembering rajeev motwani
	 
    

official memorial website celebrating the life and legacy of rajeev motwani went live late last week.friday's memorial service was unforgettable (see the official program, for more info.).  the mercury news covered it very well on the front page of saturday's paper.  om malik's follow-up post on the importance of living life is also not-to-miss.

earlier today, a friend inquired via my facebook page as to why this page has gone silent for so many moons.  the simple answer -- the convenience of (even more) modern publishing has grabbed my attention.@kraneland is where i hang my hat most often these days.(www.twitter.com - for those who are left wondering what this means!)i'll continue to check in on this space from time to time...
