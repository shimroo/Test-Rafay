	list of  ontario rallies for  cas
		  accountability, 2013.

		  rallies for past years:
		  2010
2011
2012.
		  
purpose
	 fixcas aims to reform the children's aid societies of the province of
		   ontario.

		   formerly dufferin voca, our connection with dufferin is now mostly
		   historical.	our efforts  at reform through	a membership drive  have
		   been outlawed through changes to  the bylaws, so reform can now  only
		   be achieved through the provincial government.
		   
experiences:
	 here are some experiences with the society.

		   click here for  a synopsis
		   of dufferin cases.
here are several specific cases:
alain,
		   amanda,
		   anne,
		   arrowsmith,
		   burke,
		   carol,
		   carter,
		   cassandra,
		   dunn,
		   ellis,
		   father,
		   hamilton cas,
		   howard,
		   krista,
		   laurin,
		   long,
		   marcia,
		   matthew,
		   mcquaid,
		   nick,
		   norris,
		   skinner,
		   shawn,
		   stevenson,
		   tomkinson,
		   wigston

our platform:
	 
the best interest of the child is in keeping his parents.
		   let parents answer charges before losing their children.
		   cas should abide by its agreements with parents.
		   cas should never suggest divorce.
		   children should not go from two natural parents to foster
		       care.
		   
link  for a  comprehensive	list  of
		   reforms.
		   
what you can do:
	 we try to post  as many documents  as possible about children's  aid.
		   if you are willing to give us photocopies, please call.

		   we welcome  reports from	all sources.  if  you are  a current  or
		   former child-protection  worker  or foster  parent,	we welcome  your
		   comments as well.  full confidence can be maintained where necessary.

		   from time  to time,  there  are rallies  supporting protection  of
		   families and children  from children's aid.	 these are an  effective
		   means of getting the  attention of legislators.   come to as many  of
		   them as possible.

		   for suggestions on how  to save your own	family from cas, try  help.

	 our	   masthead	shows	  a	painting     by     nicolas  poussin,
		   created in the 1630s and now at the musã©e condã©, chantilly.	 viewing
		   nearly four	centuries ahead,  he  depicted what  a child  protection
		   worker thinks  is rescuing  a  baby from  an abusive  mother.  for  a

a  new  page for  mobile  devices  with  small
		   screens shows the news page  only.
		   with positive feedback, this will  be improved and expanded to  other
		   pages.

		   fixcas pages will now  format themselves for mobile devices,  even
		   better with javascript enabled.  since  the development site is in  a
		   cell-phone shadow, we need feedback from mobile users.
