dear subscribers and friends:


   as an editor approaching eighty-eight this
   coming year, i am lucky to be here and healthy, but, need to say
   goodbye to flavor and fortune
   because our research and editing are not what they were and need to
   be. for two years we looked for a replacement editor to no avail.

   
   flavor and fortune extended
   free copies of the late 2019 issues to those who were paid almost to date. we are
   fund-less, but will pay a fin for each issue due after the december
   2019 issue which will be our last issue.

   
   flavor and fortune has published one hundred and one issues to date
   over twenty six years. in 1994, the first year, only one issue was
   published. after that there were twenty five years of continuous
   publication as a quarterly 40-page chinese food magazine.
   the early issues were twenty pages long. with volume 6 flavor and
   fortune grew to 32
   pages and then to 36. in the tenth year it grew to
   forty pages. past issues thanks
   to f&f's web manager (who is sixty five) will remain available
   on line so you can continue to read, prepare, eat, and enjoy the
   cuisine.


   thanks to all writers, and others, who did work pro-bono work
   since joining. we thank all for that; and thank the hundreds of
   loyal subscribers for their support these years reading and
   replying to this, the only english-language chinese food magazine
   published in the united states.


jacqueline m. newman, editor-in-chief.
