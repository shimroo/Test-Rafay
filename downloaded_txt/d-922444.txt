noodtoonist says... 


some
people may remember several years ago when i used to produce a variety
of naturist web comics - firstly loxie
& zoot, then its spin off the
bare pit, plus a bunch of single panel toons titled bare manors.

but then i stopped making them - mainly becasue it was a ton of work
producing regular updates plus it was stressful and various other life
things happened. boo hoo, i know.

the bare pit and bare manors then went offline two
years later becasue unfortunately
the person who hosted the site passed away and his very cheap hosting
sites also closed. at that stage, and for the last few years i haven't
been in the frame of mind to fix that problem or even make an 
announcement about it... no doubt alienating 98.6% of my readership in
the process. sorry.




you ask...


so where are the cartoons
then?
yes, there used to be a good
several hunderd pages or so... but they are all currently offline.




that's no good to me. when
are they going to be "currently online"?
probably never. sorry.
however i am considering ways and means to hard copy print and sell
them. please stay tuned for more details.




are you ever going to get
off your lazy @$$ and make more?
at these stage i'm not planning to, but if circumstances change over the next few years anything is possible.




didn't you already have a
book for sale?
yes - the koala bares - thanks
for asking... it's awesome!
