welcome to the city of locust, nc
locust is one of the fastest growing cities in the county and in the state of north carolina. our rural setting offers a broad range of housing and great schools. the close proximity to charlotte, makes us appreciated by residents, businesses and visitors alike. we as a city are very proud of our heritage which dates back to 1869. we strive to keep the small town feel that we all hold near and dear to our hearts, while also offering all the conveniences of shopping and dining. we are proud of our city and hope that you will take time to see why.
