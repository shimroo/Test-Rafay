welcome to
        michael
        brito's rock
        concert  photos web page. before viewing photos of concerts 
you have been to, check out this one-of-a-kind photographer with some of his favorite
        musicians.


 the rock and blues musicians in this 
        rock concert photos gallery portray 
my favorite artists doing what they enjoy most - performing on stage for 
knowledgeable music fans like you and i.  these rock concert photos that i have taken 
over the last 30+ years are reflections of the love and respect i have for their 
amazing contributions to rock and roll music.



when sitting in the first ten rows, i 
        am constantly approached by disappointed fans wishing they too had 
        brought their camera with them.  neil young 
        sings "this note's for you."  well, these rock concert photos and 
        memories are for you.
