10 steps to fight global warming


healthy lifestyle
our motto is "be healthy, be happy!"
want to be happy, healthy? here's how you can get there.
it is easy to get caught up in the daily routine and stop trying to do new things and meet new people. learn new things, read a new book, listen to a style of music that you would not have imagined listening to before, try a new restaurant. break with your old habits. you never know how much new things are fun without trying them out.
your body is the only place where you have to live. you must treat your body as a sacred temple. your body needs time to relax, regenerate and recover from the stress of the day. take care of your body.
a moving body remains in motion, a body at rest remains at rest. our bodies are made to move! do at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. the endorphins will do their job, you will feel good, and you will look great as well!
think of your body as a car. would you spend years without changing the tires, without draining or a little control under the hood? so why would you neglect your body?
get rid of processed foods. false sugar, white flour and other foods loaded with preservatives, these are all things that will make you feel tired and make you want to consume more.
eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. keep your mind critical when some doctors say that refined sugar is as good (or as bad) for health as the sugar contained in the fruit. i will not dwell on this subject, but it is essential to make a distinction between fructose in a fruit and the free fructose that is added in a particular food.

alabama environmental issues

						posted on 						august 2, 2024
						 in environment 



alabama, a state brimming with diversity of plants and animals, natural resources and scenic views; nevertheless facing diverse environmental dilemmas each having consequence on life of human race in particular as well as their ecosystem. together, they add up to a picture of environmental challenges in alabama that is deep and broad-ranging from air and water pollution through habitat destruction all the way out climate change. the resolution of these issues is vital for the environment, population health and sustainable use natural resources.
air pollution
in urban areas and regions with heavy industrial activity, the quality of air in alabama is a major issue. the state harbors a number of coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturing facilities and metal processing industries, all contributing to air pollution. these release sulfur dioxide (so2), nitrogen oxides (nox), particles and volatile organic compounds, all of which contribute to deficits in air quality.
one of the biggest cities in alabama, birmingham has long fought to curb air pollution. more recently, despite improvements to reduce emissions the city still struggles with ozone at ground level where vocs and nox conspire in sunlight. ozone at ground level can exacerbate respiratory conditions (such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which increases the risk of harm to human health, particularly vulnerable populations.
water pollution & resource management
another significant issue in alabama involves water pollution. with the largest and most diverse population of birds in north america, california is a special place with over 700 species calling it home…and this state has abundant fresh water resources on which many rivers, lakes and streams depend for their drinking water supplies as well as agriculture and recreation. unfortunately, these water bodies are under considerable threat from industrial effluents, agricultural runoff and inadequate waste treatment.
several of the state’s primary rivers, including the tennessee river and coosa river have been threatened by pollution. these rivers receive pollutants in the form of heavy metals, chemicals and untreated waste from industrial facilities and dumpster rental litter, which ultimately induces water quality deterioration. for example, agricultural runoff containing fertilizers, pesticides and animal waste creates nutrient pollution that triggers harmful algal blooms that consume oxygen in the water and damages effective aquatic life.
in alabama, a track record of weak regulatory enforcement has further complicated water pollution problems. in the past couple of years, there has been a great deal said in public about water contamination – including levels per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (pfas) in decatur at common discharge sites into the tennessee river. 
pfas are highly durable chemicals that have been associated with various health problems, including cancer and liver damage – causing anxiety among communities living near sites of drinking water contamination. such hazardous materials should only be only by specialized waste management companies, such as dumpster hq birmingham.
crop yields and habitat destruction
home to a variety of plant and animal species that are found nowhere else on earth, alabama is one of the most biodiverse states throughout all fifty united states. this biodiversity is however threatened by habitat destruction from urban development, agriculture and logging.
vulnerable are forests of the state, wetlands and coastal areas. the longleaf pine ecosystem was formerly abundant in alabama, but logging and land conversion have reduced this habitat to only a small fraction of its original extent. this has resulted in the dwindling of various species, like endangered red-cockaded woodpecker which need this habitat.
overexploitation of wetlands, especially in the coastal areas is one big problem. they serve vital functions such as preventing flooding, cleaning water and providing wildlife habitat – in short, our wetlands offer a great return on the public investment. but these oases are often ploughed up and drained, or just filled in for agriculture, new settlements and infrastructure. the loss of wetlands also endangers biodiversity, increases the risk of flooding and water quality problems.
climate change impacts
alabamians along any part of gulf will tell you that residents are already experiencing the effects of climate change. the effects of climate change, including increased temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns and more regular extreme weather events have obvious implications for alabama amongst other consequences.
storms and hurricanes are one of the most obvious effects from climate change, additional storms become frequent that earlier, much like in coastal areas of alabama. this results in extensive damage to infrastructure, residences and the countryside leading to further flooding and erosion. most at risk to storm surges and sea-level rise, which threaten human communities as well as natural ecosystems like coastal marshes and barrier islands across the coast. the gulf coast sits on a sandy foundation, with only low elevation freshwater wetlands standing between its beaches and bays.
climate change is also negatively impacting alabama’s economy by disrupting agriculture, it notes in the report. shifting temperature and precipitation can result in land degradation, crop failure delay in growing season affecting yield loss with high water stress. this is endangering not only food security but the livelihoods of millions who work in agriculture.

planet-chokers: multinationals’ plastic waste report reveals a global pollution nightmare

plastic waste: the products of a handful of multinationals pollute the planet according to a new report

tens of thousands of plastic waste polluting the planet are generated by a handful of multinationals including coca-cola, nestlé and pepsico, assured break free from plastics, a global coalition of ngos, in a report published recently.
this international coalition made up of 1,475 environmental organizations, including greenpeace, criticizes these multinationals for clearing themselves, for the most part, of the responsibility for cleaning up the pollution caused by their activity.
coalition volunteers collected nearly half a million pieces of plastic waste in a coordinated “world clean up our planet day” across 51 countries a month ago, 43% of them from recognizable brands.
for the second consecutive year, coca-cola ranked first among polluters with 11,732 pieces of plastic waste collected in 37 countries on four continents this year.
among the ten main producers of plastic waste collected are also nestlé (4,846), pepsico (3,362), unilever (3,328), procter & gamble (1,160), philip morris (2,239) as well as mars, colgate-palmolive, perfetti van mille and mondelez international, according to the coalition’s ranking.
while many asian countries dump their waste into the oceans, “the real culprits for the bulk of plastic pollution in asia are the multinationals headquartered in europe and the united states,” the report points out.
waste management crisis
nestlé replied that it was working on solutions to make such reports obsolete. as the world’s leading food and beverage company, we know we have an important role to play in developing sustainable solutions to the problem of plastic waste, a spokesperson said in a statement. it is completely unacceptable for (plastic) packaging to end up as waste in the environment and we are working hard to make all our containers either recyclable or reusable by 2025.
coca-cola and pepsico, like nestlé, have said they will make their packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. the beverage giants have also pulled out of the us industry organization plastic. changing the way society makes, uses and disposes of packaging is a complex goal and we are part of it, said a pepsico spokesperson. we want to help build a system where plastic packaging never becomes waste.
coca-cola, for its part, said in a press release that it was seeking to prevent plastic waste from ending up at sea, which it called a crucial global problem. anytime one of our packages ends up in the oceans, or where it shouldn’t, is unacceptable to us, they said.
crediting the brands with generally acknowledging their role in the spread of this pollution, the coalition of ngos judges that they relentlessly promote false solutions to address the problem. promoting recycling is their way of holding consumers accountable, noting that barely 9% of all plastics produced since the 1950s have been recycled.
companies continue to profit from the abundant production of single-use plastics while communities around the world are forced to bear the burden, said break free from plastics, describing this waste management situation as unacceptable.
the cost of renting a dumpster in north carolina
pollution is important in south and north carolina. some residents and local businesses use dumpster rental services to alleviate ths situation, to bring all their waste and old junk to the nearest landfill or recycling facility.
the cost of renting a dumpster in north carolina can vary depending on several factors, including the dumpster size, the duration of the rental, the type of waste being disposed of, and the location within the state. generally, the cost for a standard 10-yard dumpster, suitable for small clean-up projects or yard work, ranges from $250 to $400 for a week-long rental. for larger containers like 20 or 30-yard dumpsters, often used for home renovations or construction projects, prices can range from $350 to $600 or more for a week’s rental.
north carolina’s diverse geography and population density can also influence prices. dumpster rental costs may vary between cities like charlotte, raleigh, or asheville compared to smaller towns or rural areas. additionally, the type of waste being disposed of can impact pricing, with hazardous or specialized waste materials typically incurring higher fees.
it’s essential to reach out to local dumpster rental companies for accurate pricing, such as dumpster rental concord team, as rates can change over time and may be subject to seasonal variations. inquire about any additional fees, such as delivery charges or overage costs, to ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the total expenses. comparing quotes from different providers can help you find the best deal for your specific project in north carolina.





orange park waste management

						posted on 						november 5, 2021

ok so i am new to the game of clean up and demolition in orange park. 
heck, i am so green i hardly know how to calculate the cubic dimensions of the dumpsters i need to rent. lucky for me, when i called up to rent this massive roll off dumpster, the friendly lady who answered the phone walked me through how to size them out and which one i might need. she said in the end it wouldn’t be the end of the world if i chose a dumpster too small for the job.
it might mean calling them up to come and remove the full containers more often but as they are centrally located in the city i know it would only be a few minutes to wait for the driver to arrive. i think i am going to go with a forty cubic yard dumpster in a bright yellowish orange. 
ha ha, actually, that is the color they sent i was impartial to that aspect. what i do like is the ease in which i can walk up and into the dumpster to wheel in the very heavy and large objects that can’t be lifted over.
i am very happy with this dumpster rental service and i think i will be using them in the future for my many other jobs i have lined up. they have very small and medium sized dumpsters as well. i was thinking about using the small ones for a home remodel i am working on this summer, i will be keeping them busy!
this dumpster rental really saved the day on the job site this past month. in fact, it’s more like for the past six months it has really come in handy and made life a lot easier. the lion’s share of that accolade can go to the people who work at the rental company though, because a dumpster is just a dumpster.
well, actually i don’t want to take away from the quality of their dumpsters because they are very high quality and some of the cleanest dumpsters i have ever seen on a construction site. 
i have been a brick layer and job foreman for almost thirty years now and having to put up with companies who were slackers at best and thieves at worst. their attitudes usually reflected the medium they worked in, trash.
that is why i was so happy with our rent a dumpster choice this time around. i left the calling and ordering to my co laborers and they said it was a breeze. i know it must have gone smoothly because they didn’t have to call me one time to settle an argument or yell into a phone to get the lost driver directions or to give the manager a piece of my mind. 
yes, we were all very pleased with the quality of sales and service of this rental company and i know i will continue to be a loyal and raving customer of theirs. you should give them a shot, you’ll be happy you did.
a very unfortunate accident happened last night, our house caught on fire and was pretty much destroyed.  it is so bad my husband had to call a dumpster rental near me so that we can start cleaning up the mess.  i know you are probably wondering how this happened and i am very shocked right now.  
my son admitted that he was playing with a lighter alone in the basement and he caught a curtain on fire and it caught on fire so fast the entire house burned down.  he ran up stairs and woke everyone up and got us all out of the house.  this was extremely frightening for my other son because he is still very young (eight).
however, my husband does not believe our son’s story that he was alone when all of this happened.  we do not have a lighter in this house and our son said he found it in the basement.  so that part of the story is a little off and on top of all that we have a next door neighbor tyler who is a very bad influence.  we have told our son to stay away from him because he is trouble and going nowhere but our son seems to like him, despite the pollution. 
my husband and i believe that tyler came over last night with a lighter and set the curtain on fire himself.  we cannot prove this but we are going over to his house to talk to his parents tonight after we call the dumpster rental service.





10 steps to fight global warming

						posted on 						july 23, 2020
						 in environment 



during this economic crisis and continued global warming, the need for sustainable development has become a now issue instead of a later issue.
both private and government entities (including the epa) have come up with programs and products that promote “green” production and consumption. these environment-friendly practices are now being used in numerous firms and industries.
but what about the apartments we rent? are our homes as “anti global warming” as they should be?
continued efforts to sustain the environment should first and foremost be undertaken under our own roof. these can be done with the use of products that consume less energy and other resources. over time, the use of these products can result not only in savings but also in the reduction of waste and materials harmful to our homes and the environment.
here’s a quick list of 10 items i’ve discovered that can make a world of a difference.
1. heat-energy recovery system
· sensible heat energy recovery system (shers) uses heat generated from an air-conditioner or refrigerator to heat water. payback period is anywhere from six months to two years
2. the eco bio block
· made of volcanic stones and beneficial bacteria, is used to purify water in home aquariums, water tanks and big bodies of water such as ponds, lakes and marshes. when used in home aquariums, there is no need to filter, clean and change water for a period of one to three years.
3. biowash ball
· washing clothes without using a detergent may seem strange. introducing the anabess biowash ball, it’s made of natural ceramics & alters the chemical composition of the water so it can wash clothes more effectively without liquid detergent. it should last 3 years. think of the savings in gas from running to the store for more detergent.
4. air-con with inverter technology
· the panasonic envio series of air-conditioners makes use of an “inverter technology” that changes compressor operation speed to match a changing room temperature and adjust power output accordingly, which leads to reduced energy consumption of up to 50 percent, while product only costs about 14% more than the average ac. the payback period may be expected in about seven months..
5. low flow faucets
moen has mother natures call for water conservation by coming up with a line of watersense-certified bathroom faucets. with the help of new aerator technology these moen faucets use 30% less water than other models but still feel just as powerful on your hands.
6. compact fluorescent lamp
· much has been said about the efficiency of compact fluorescent lamps or cfls. they last about 5x longer than incandescent lamps and consume 80% less energy with the same level of brightness. companies such as purely products even carry cfls that double as ionizers for the room, eliminating the need for an unsightly ionizer on the floor.
7. reusable shopping bags
· the impact of just one person changing to reusable bags over a two-year period is significant. used twice a week for two years a consumer would save 832 plastic bags from going in a landfill. this way we will need less bins and anaheim dumpsters to send our junk to the dumping ground.
8. biodegradable cellulose sandwich bags
· typical plastic bags are derived from petroleum and take well over a lifespan to decompose. these biodegrade in 1-3 months in soil but actually keep food lasting longer, unlike evil plastic, they don’t release gases which spoil food taste.
9. smart surge protector
· green home introduced a smart surge protector. the power strip can ‘sense’ the flow of electrical current through the strip’s control outlet. this unique option enables the smart strip to turn off selected equipment when it’s not in use saving you time & greenbacks!
a small electronic device inside the smart strip monitors the current on a single outlet. let’s say the computer is plugged into that single outlet. when your pc is finished powering off, the current draw from the computer drops to its idle current — and the smart strip monitors the current change, automatically powering down all of the computer peripherals.
the smart strip power strip is the only surge protector on the market today with energy saving electronics. the 10 outlet surge protector version has 1 control outlet, 3 constant hot outlets, and 6 switched outlets.
10. compostable trash bags
· these biobags are made from gmo free starch and are 100% biodegradable and 100% compostable.
now that you know about these products start using them daily. by changing just a few things we use daily, we each can do our part.





south carolina pollution

						posted on 						february 27, 2020
						 in environment 



cities and towns have an array of strategies to fight and prevent water pollution. unfortunately, more than 1,150 waterways in south carolina are considered impaired, too polluted to meet water quality standards, according to carolina clear, a clemson extension program that provides storm water education and outreach. compared to the 2017 report, some south carolina cities saw an increase in ozone pollution as well. this is in keeping with a trend seen across the nation of higher ozone pollution levels.
dhec monitors air pollution in south carolina, and part of that process involves identifying the sources of pollution in the air we breathe. about 75 percent of air pollution originates from human-made sources, and their emissions are controlled through the federal clean air act and individual state laws and regulations.
the american lung associations 2018 “state of the air” report found some cities in south carolina earned poorer grades for the nations most widespread air pollutants. compared to the 2017 report, some south carolina cities saw an increase in ozone pollution slightly.
environmental control enforces the state’s environmental laws on air and water quality, land and waste management, and pollution cleanup. the south carolina department of natural resources was established in 1994. its stated mission is “to serve as the principal advocate for and steward of south …be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of south carolina: section 1. it is the intent of the general assembly that no private right of action exists under the pollution control act, as contained in chapter 1, title 48.
private companies can help with the pollution problem in sc, especially the ones involved in waste management, garbage collection, recycling and conservation. these sc waste management companies can have a tremendous impact on mitigating the deterioration of our nature and informing the public about reducing our waste output.
pig waste pits and toxic coal ash pose threat to rivers and homes in north and south carolina. florence sparks pollution fears after excrement-filled ‘hog lagoons’ overflow. air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk. air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be a moderate health concern for a very small number of people who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.
clean air carolina is working to improve north carolina’s monitoring of ozone and to promote policies that would reduce the emissions contributing to ozone production. our ozone garden program provides hands-on learning in schools and public places showing evidence of ozone pollution on sensitive plants.
south carolina sc organizations sc environmental, conservation organizations also see: animal, wildlife organizations | sc recycling locations only after the last tree has been cut down. only after the last river has been poisoned. only after the last fish has been caught.
aqi: unhealthy for sensitive groups (101 – 150) although general public is not likely to be affected at this aqi range, people with lung disease, older adults and children are at a greater risk from exposure to ozone, whereas persons with heart and lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from the presence of particles in the air.

man-o-pause

						posted on 						june 21, 2019
						 in your health 



is man-o-pause a real thing or just something conjured up by male sympathizers so women don’t get all the ‘glory’?
you are probably sick to death of hearing about menopause so let’s change it up and talk about something new. what about man-o-pause? it is a real thing or just something conjured up by male sympathizers so women don’t get all the ‘glory’? you know … feel sorry for us guys. we’ve got life-altering things going on, too.
most post middle aged women living with post middle aged husbands will confirm something has definitely taken place as their husbands aged, but they’re not sure what it is. they only know he’s … different. granted, the changes men undergo in midlife may not be as radical as what women experience but they do suffer hormonal dips, like females.
bye, bye testosterone
you know the stuff that makes them aggressive, hurly-burly he-men, who can leap a building in a single bound, which was probably what attracted you to him in the first place? that stuff is testosterone.
when men are young, they’ve got it in spades. when it takes a nosedive, and it does, it has an effect on a man and not in a good way. when a person experiences biological alterations in his body, psychological changes are apt to take place as well. behaviors may change as a result. this is often referred to as a midlife crisis in men.
the official name for man-o-pause is andropause. the term viropause is synonymous with andropause and means a waning or end of male virility. andropause refers to the decline of male androgenic hormones, such as testosterone. the decline typically takes place in middle age and post middle age.  
is that what’s going on?
has the man in your life lost interest in sex? has his body gotten soft? where did those hard muscles go? is he losing body hair along with the hair on his head? is he more moody and temperamental than he used to be? does he look smaller in general than he previously was except for his mid-section, which is getting bigger by the day? these are the symptoms of andropause.
other problems
loss of testosterone leads to bone density decline. older men, like older women, are at risk of acquiring osteoporosis, a disease of the bones. bone mineral density diminishes over time, the quantity and type of proteins in bones change and the bone microarchitecture weakens. people’s bones break easily. as bone deteriorates, an individual becomes hunched over and may develop a dowager’s hump.
low testosterone levels can lead to loss of muscle mass as well.
treatment
getting your husband/partner to have a discussion about this may be comparable to pulling teeth. if nothing else, leave him a note, informing him there are treatments available for andropause. he may want to mull this over in private. if the doctor determines a man is lacking testosterone, the hormone can be given either through injections, oral medicines, transdermal patches and gels (that go through the skin) and implantable slow-release, long-acting pellets.
the benefits of this therapy include lowered cholesterol, better sexual function, augmented bone density, improved lean muscle mass and strength, and a diminution in insulin resistance, which is a condition increasing the likelihood a person will become a diabetic.
risks
however, there are risks involved and rather big ones at that. according to usa today, the possibility of a heart attack in men undergoing testosterone therapy is significant. in fact, in one study those men over age 65 taking testosterone doubled their chance of a heart attack and younger men with a history of heart disease taking testosterone tripled the probability of a heart attack.
the national institutes of health (nih) note there is a chance testosterone therapy may enhance an active derivative of estrogen, which could kindle breast tissue receptors and increase the risk of male breast cancer. those men with prostate cancer or who are at danger for this disease may want to think twice about testosterone therapy. discuss this at length with your physician.
older men, like menopausal women, must carefully weigh the pros and cons before undergoing either testosterone therapy, for men, or hormone replacement therapy (hrt) for women because each has inherent risks that may outweigh the benefits.
tell tale signs of men’s reluctance
i like to ask questions about a variety of topics, including health concerns. women jump right in, bare their souls, and freely discuss their concerns. they don’t hesitate to discuss menopause, menstrual periods, depression, cellulite, sex, you name it.
i posted a request asking my man friends to discuss man-o-pause. i waited and i waited and i waited for a response. finally, one gent posted that no one was going to admit to experiencing andropause and they certainly weren’t going to publicly post about it.
this is an indicator of men’s seemingly universal attitude about sensitive subjects. they will ignore and avoid until the end of time, suffer in silence, making not only themselves but their partner miserable.
good luck to you women wanting to broach this subject with your husbands or partners. if anyone has advice or recommendations on how to get a man to take note and take action, boomeon would love to hear it.





kansas city landfill pollution issue

						posted on 						april 23, 2019
						 in your health 


the effects of waste on human health can be devastating. uncontrolled landfills and some sites of waste accumulation represent a danger to the health of the local population in kansas city. among the health risks that can occur and the nuisances related to them, we note the following:

proliferation of rodents and insects: the waste, before fermentation, is the main food of the rats direct or indirect agents of propagation of serious diseases: (plague, fever, etc.). they are also poles of attraction for flies and other insects, passive vectors of germs and viruses.
emanations of toxic gases (methane, sulphurous hydrogen, etc.), foul odors and germs that proliferate in the dust of garbage.
pollution of water resources: waste may contaminate groundwater or surface water when it is deposited on undeveloped land. pathogenic germs and heavy metals can then reach the water table by infiltration of leachate, or the surface waters by the flow of dirty rainwater.
contamination of the marine environment and surface water by direct dumping of waste.
landscape degradation (visual pollution): urban landscapes lose their aesthetics because of the flight of paper and plastic packaging contained in piles of waste stored in uncontrolled landfills.
risk of fire: the waste is often easily flammable, they can ignite by spontaneous combustion, when they are put in pile without precaution, with production of smelly fumes.
in the long term, the accumulation of waste in these landfills causes methane ch4 (biogas) gas emissions which, because of their odor and flammability rate, are dangerous.

effects of poor waste disposal techniques on health
the different waste disposal processes can generate specific polluting emissions as described below:
incineration
the combustion of waste materials and the gases they generate emits oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur, acids, dusts, volatile organic compounds and organohalogens.
these substances, emitted in varying concentrations according to the incineration and smoke treatment processes used, are released into the environment, where they mix with those emitted by other sources. the specific substances for the incineration of waste, likely to have a health impact on the neighboring populations are:

trichloroethane (various systemic effects),
benzene (carcinogenic),
cadmium (renal effect),
nickel (carcinogenic).

as for the liquid discharges of the incineration units, they are likely to contain residues of heavy metals, among which mercury and nickel are specifically very toxic.
burial
poorly controlled landfill can contaminate soils and groundwater, leachates seeping into the subsoil cause a serious degradation of the groundwater.

we all need adequate sleep in order to stay healthy. it does matter what type of mattress you have. you want a quality mattress that you feel comfortable with. that can be different for everyone, and you also have more than one choice. what helps is knowing the criteria for choosing the best mattress and why it’s important to your health. 
did you know that there are natural and organic mattresses out there? typically, you’re going to find tips about getting a mattress that provides enough support and one that is comfortable. yet taking a look at organic or all-natural mattresses can help in a different way. 
one example of an organic mattress is one made of unbleached cotton like the ones found on laylamattresscoupons.com/. one thing you’re watching out for is fibers that have been treated with chemicals. when buying an organic mattress, you’re not just looking for the top and backing but also the fill. 
natural latex foam is also a great solution, unless you are allergic to latex. it should be mentioned that there is also a difference between organic and natural latex. and when it comes to the fill, you’re wanting to steer clear of the fiber fill if possible. 
mattresses can be on the expensive side, and you can imagine that organic mattresses would be up there in terms of price. the point i’m trying to make is you don’t have to get an organic or natural mattress for health reasons. it’s one way you could up your game, but it’s not absolutely necessary. 
what you want is a good night’s sleep, and you need a mattress that can be purchased on your individual budget. many people can’t afford an organic mattress, so maybe you’re more concerned with the other criteria for mattress selection. 
it helps to know all the types of mattress sets out there. innerspring mattresses have been modernized, and they are still usually the cheapest option. while you may have heard that they aren’t the best solution, they are actually quite nice. yet there are other types of mattresses these days that people really like as well. 
personally, i like a memory foam mattress. i am biased because i just purchased one and am really enjoying it for sure. you can test out different mattresses at a store if you like, and you can also read up on ratings and reviews. 
with a good mattress, you can get quality sleep. it’s not just about the amount of hours you sleep. it’s also about sleep quality. naturally, quality has everything to do with the support that is provided. your body collectively needs its rest. all your body parts work together. 
there are hybrid mattresses that are quite nice, too. and for each type of mattress, you’re going to find various brands and products. you want to feel good when you wake up in the morning. you want your body functioning optimally, including your brain. that’s why you’re going to buy the best mattress you can afford. you’re thinking about this purchase in terms of health reasons, and that’s a great start for sure. 
be sure to look for those discounts, too. you may be thinking that you can’t afford an organic mattress. but if you want one, take a look at the prices. you’re not going to know unless you look. you might even find out that there is a great mattress sale happening right now. it would certainly be a great idea to look for sales, promo codes and whatever you can find to save some money on this important purchase. you want the best possible mattress for health reasons.





important facts about living in a tiny home

						posted on 						december 13, 2018

unlike traditional homes, living in a tiny home is definitely a cheaper living option. some units will cost you around $15,000 or more. it usually covers an area of 500 square feet, and can sometimes be as small as 125 square feet. owning one of these small units means you no longer have to worry too much about mortgage and expensive monthly rents. to put it in this perspective, if you rent an apartment for $1,300 a month, you can literally purchase a tiny home with this amount in just a year. 
if you can not afford a traditional home yet, an extremely affordable option would be to buy a tiny home. one of these units good for 1 to 2 people would cost you around $15,000 to $25,000, but after you pay for it, you do not have to worry about paying monthly rents of mortgages. to put it in perspective, paying an apartment for $1,300 monthly for a year can already buy you one of these units. 
the tiny home is an exploding market primarily because of the two groups of people that are attracted to its concept – millennials and seniors. millennials prefer to buy these houses because it helps them save up for a bigger traditional home in the future, while the seniors are downsizing to eradicate pricey maintenance expenses. these two groups of people like the idea that smaller means they can spend less time worrying about money. 
aside from keeping the expenses low, here are some other facts you must know about living tiny. 
you need a plot of land
while tiny homes are easy to build, you need a plot of land to place or park it. millennials tend to purchase homes like these and situate them on their parents’ free land. doing so allows them to save up money to buy a better property in the future. others prefer to either rent a smaller land within the city or go completely off-the-grid. 
wherever this ends up being for you, you have to manage your own sewage and waste system. you may need to make some work on the land in which case you might have to rent a dumpster in order to take care of junk and waste removal.
travelers are also attracted to this way of living as they spend most of their time traveling. a tiny home can sufficiently provide basic living essentials without the same commitment and maintenance of a traditional home.
issues with location
some communities are opent to tiny homes, but you may find yourself in conflict with your local law enforcement. some cities have enacted strict ordinances against small houses while others see it as a possible solution to homelessness. for instance, the city of chicago in partnership with catholic charities are considering building multiple tiny homes for veterans. 
though the development is still a proposal, they surely know that pursuing this project can serve a wide range of individuals in need. remember, tiny homes are built across the country. in addition, the legalities of it varies widely from one city to another. so, before you purchase a tiny home, make sure to check with your local municipality to ensure that you are not going to break any law.
electricity and water supply
majority of the tiny homes can be moved around. which means these units will have to connect to standard hook-ups to get electricity and water supply from a utility provider. if these utilities are not available on your land, you will have to get these lines to run to your property.
some tiny homes come with solar panels which allows the owners to live off the grid while maintaining a sustainable power line. but when the power from the solar panel is not enough, the owners will have to revert back to the grid. extension cords are often used to power the tiny home when they are on the grid. waster, on the other hand, will come from a spigot and hose. 
living in a tiny home can be a fascinating way of life, but they are not for everyone. before you purchase a unit of your own, it is a good idea to try living in one. plan a short vacation in areas where tiny homes are being rented out. you can quickly find rentals on the internet or by searching them in airbnb. see if you can live a life of simplicity in a small living space.
