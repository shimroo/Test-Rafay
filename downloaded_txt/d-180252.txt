mario 
								puzo spent the last three years of his life writing

								and morality in america. 


puzo also worked on
							

the family (2004) -- about the infamous borgias of 15th century rome -- for two decades before his death. the compelling novel was completed by his longtime companion 
							carol gino, author of the new memoir,
							

me & mario (2018).
