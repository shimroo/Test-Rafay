 about our schools 



 







 community 
the experience of a catholic boarding school allows our students to build unique relationships with their peers and faculty. these relationships grow into something greater than ordinary friendships, they become family. young men and women from all over the world push away inherent cultural difference to ultimately find that they share common goals and aspirations.






 







 excellence 
cbsa member schools strive to teach our students how to develop the strategies and mental skills to become confident, able-minded individuals. our qualified faculty and resident dorm parents work to set the foundation that will enable our students to find success far beyond their high school education. cbsa member schools pride themselves in creating life-long learners who are articulate, compassionate and have a greater sense of the world around them.






 







 values 
the member schools believe in an education that promotes the development of sound moral values. these values are uniquely fostered in a catholic boarding school through the combination of the in-school experience and the residence life program. this environment provides a natural setting for sharping an then practicing making decisions based on solid principles.
