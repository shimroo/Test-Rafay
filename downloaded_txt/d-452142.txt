in
                    memoriam
                    to and special recognition
                    of peace officers around the world


what started out to be a (one) page entitled "a

couple of cop poems" in 1997, has turned into the internet's largest police
                poems site called   "policepoems.com"
                further, you can now use a search engine to
                find just the right poem!special thanks  to the
                authors of the poetry and prose on this site. their talents are a compilation of "very
                    real & meaningful poems." some will bring to memory
                those who  made the "ultimate

sacrifice" for us, some will bring you to tears, some  will
                keep you safe on the front lines,  but all will touch the inner depths of your
                heart.


if  you are a

family member, a partner, a loved one, or friend, then i pray

that the right poem(s) will help to bring some relief and closure

to the ever continuing loss that you are going through. it is a

"void" that never can be filled. for additional support you may wish to go to "your closest back-up"

 if


you are a member of the general public, then i pray that these

poems will bring a greater understanding of just who it is that

we are, what it is that we do and a proper respect of those who "protect &

serve."



thanks  also for the many
letters from those who have been touched deeply  through this site -  you are
the reason and inspiration!


visitors
                since june 28, 1998 can't be wrong!



those poems with a  have music (midis) with them. music adds another dimension to the
written script, so if you don't have the free 
crescendo
midi player  make sure you download it! this background music is usually at the
choice of the submitter of the poem.

~ how to 
			submit a poem ~



 generally
-
i need at least the "required" 
items below completed. submissions should be police poems
about all kinds of law enforcement. i may accept some poems that are a 
little more "broader" if they of the type that lift up, give
support, help in the time of hurt and can be easily understood to be doing just
that. 
 if  you would like to have your poem
or prose posted here, please e-mail me with your particulars for inclusion at
the address below. i use a standard
copyright © disclaimer for your protection.  while not all
information is not "required" it does help me to present your work in the
most appropriately way, with the feeling and effect you desire. items that are
not required may be left up to my discretion.
 time 
- working full-time now for the u.s. marshal service (cso), maintaining a motor 
vehicle collision reconstruction business, amongst other life that i am 
full-filling may require a bit of time to get your poem up, but it will be done!  
there are times when i get behind, so bear with me brothers and sisters.
 what i'll do is put the 
name of the poem in the index above along with a "coming" notation and a 
. when you see it hyperlinked and a
, it's up and running! (i'll take the time 
to send you an e-mail to let you know.)   here is what i need:
 
required (at least please)


your name  - (you can still write
          under a different name below) 

name of poem  and author?
      - (again
          you may use the name you write under) 

date written?
      - (the
      year or as close as you
          can get in that this will be used for
          copyright © information.) 

credits? - (name, e-mail and/or url address - this will be
          used for people to contact you  for permission to use your poem and to
      connect to those you are honoring.)

e-mail address?
      - be sure to give me an address i can reply to.  if you have aol
      or a similar internet provider, be sure to set your preferences for me to
      be able to e-mail you back!  i've had a few where i got rejected from
      replying.

send the poem by e-mail or direct
          me to a internet site. you may use the
          following formats:  e-mail (plain text, .rft and html),   ms word (*.doc),
          

          wordperfect (*.wpd),   lotus amipro (*.sam), lotus
      wordpro (*.lwp),  rich
          formatted text  (*.rft) and anything from   ms notepad or   wordpad.

important - please keep me
informed of any changes in your site location and/or e-mail address? i'll need 
the names of your poems you have posted here, so that i can find them easier.

submissions click here
or use the following e-mail address and submission subject line:
submissions@policepoems.com - subject: re: police poetry or prose submission





recommended (to
personalize)


background graphic  or color scheme to
      personalize the presentation of your talent? (departmental colors,
          emblems, badges, background, etc.) - but, not required - it's your poem or we
      can communicate via e-mail, icq, aol, yahoo or msn messengers to decide -
      i'll always contact you when it's up on the net and ask for your approval.
      this is why a "receivable" e-mail address is important.

please do not 
		embed your graphics in a document, but send them as an attachment or 
		give me a location to grab them. embedded graphics may look good in the 
		document, but come out very substandard on the internet.

 dedication
      or in memoriam? do you want this?
          (to a particular
          person(s), department, division, etc.)

graphics (departmental logo,
          patch, etc.)

music? (midi) - (a particular
          song that relates to the poem, the person you are writing about, a
          favorite of that person or the
          situation. i will try hard to find that song, if available in the midi
      format.)

i want your poem to be right for you, so don't be afraid
to request any changes.  no changes are too big or small for me!
if  you have a poem on your site and like your own style
and site, i can link directly to your site if you would prefer?  if you
have a poem site with "police poems" on it i would be love to give a reciprocal
link to you! (please use the logo above and/or text link to this
page.)   
if  one of your poems is here,

please e-mail me also so that i may give you the proper

credits and permissions for inclusion, especially if your

name is anonymous or unknown!
 gold stars with the "simple
criteria" of the response from numbers of those who read them,
appreciation for your work, and especially on how the poem spoke to them in
their time of need. poems dedicated to those who made the "ultimate
sacrifice" will always receive the "ultimate respect"
with a gold star designation.
