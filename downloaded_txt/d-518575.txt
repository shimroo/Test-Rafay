ozedweb
                is a 'frames' based web site. 




while
                    there is general agreement that good netiquette means providing
            for viewers who are unable to see the effects afforded by more recent
            browser technologies (such as frames, java and dhtml)...or  who
                    (worse still)  are unable to
    see anything as a consequence of their use, i have found the use of frames became essential to navigation
            ease. frames
            offer significant advantages, especially in 'stability' in
            viewing. the borders of a frames page (holding navigation links) remain static
            at all times and only the pages with content changes. 






any
            browser after explorer 3 or netscape 2 also allow the use of frames.
            if
            you want to upgrade an 'ancient' browser
            so that you can access webs that use more recent technologies, you can link from
            here. netscape 6.1 and explorer 5.5 are powerful browsers and although
            both are relatively large, both are 'free'.
