the paraclete

'second coming' of jesus in paraclete
“the theological discourse surrounding the paraclete—the one whom jesus promised at the last supper—remains one of the most profound mysteries of christian eschatology... however, a deeper and more precise exegesis reveals that the coming of jesus in the paraclete signifies a distinct, divine personality arriving in the age to come—one who completes the mission of christ. that figure is none other than shri mataji."

the paraclete

advent betrayed by peter-judas disciples
“the story of shri mataji nirmala devi and her disciples is a harrowing tale of betrayal, denial, and abandonment that echoes the tragic narrative of jesus christ and his closest followers. just as judas betrayed jesus for thirty pieces of silver and peter denied him three times, shri mataji's disciples—her supposed sahaja yogis—have committed a far greater betrayal. they have reduced her divine mission to a mere”

the holy spirit

exposes christianity's betrayal of jesus
“christian eschatology has collapsed under the weight of its own ignorance. the expectation of divine intervention in some distant future is a hollow delusion, a refusal to accept that the promise has been fulfilled and opportunity squandered. the paraclete has come, fulfilled her mission, and departed. those who continue to wait for what has already occurred have condemned themselves to an eternity of spiritual ...”

the ruha d'qudsha

feminine holy spirit of aramaic jesus
“this divine presence, central to the transformative experience of being "born again of the spirit," is deeply rooted in the aramaic language and cultural context of jesus' teachings. unlike the later church, which often portrayed the holy spirit as a male entity, jesus himself referred to the holy spirit in feminine terms,... this feminine aspect of the holy spirit is encapsulated in the aramaic term ruha d'qudsha, where ruha ...”

the divine mother

reveals through direct experience
“deepak's book aligns deeply with the understanding that the divine feminine is the one who communicates, who nurtures, and who reveals truth directly to the seeker. gyana is the state where the mind is not separate from the divine—it is in direct communion. unlike male gods, who are often approached through intermediaries, the mother is immanent—she speaks, guides, and reveals herself to those who seek with ...”

the divine feminine

develops a personal internal relationship
“many people are spiritually and religiously interested in topics that provide meaning, guidance, and a sense of connection to the divine. some of the most common spiritual and religious interests include: 1. the afterlife & what happens after death 2. god & the divine 3. prophecies & end times 4. spiritual awakening & self-realization 5. religious texts & their true meaning 6. morality & the purpose of life 7. miracles &”

the paraclete

ushers new religious consciousness
"john hogue, a leading nostradamus scholar, emphasizes that the prophet's apocalyptic visions are not solely about doom but also herald a transformative spiritual rebirth. nostradamus explicitly foresaw the rise of a new religious movement distinct from established faiths, flourishing before the end of the 20th century. “throughout the prophet's visions of apocalypse, the theme of a new religious ...”

the ruh: holy spirit

upholds jesus as sign of hour to muslims
“he [jesus] is a sign of the hour. have no doubt about it.” (surah 43:61) if jesus is the sign of the hour, then who declares its arrival? allah (swt) makes this clear: “what are they awaiting but for the hour to come upon them suddenly? its signs have already come. what good will their reminder be to them when it does arrive?” (surah 47:18) abdullah yusuf ali (1989) explicitly identifies an-naba as the message of the resurrection.

eternal mother tao

the sanctuary where all things find refuge
“among the great world religions, the teachings of lao-tzu and taoism stand out as uniquely feminine in their essence. unlike traditions that often prioritize the masculine as the primary force of creation, taoism embraces the subtle, receptive, all-encompassing power of the tao, likening it to the mother of all things. lao-tzu exalts the female as the mother, making clear that without feminine, existence itself is incomplete.”

the paraclete

reveals urgency of jesus' ax laid at root
reza aslan vividly describes jesus' urgency: “and the reaper is nearly here. god's will is about to be done on earth, just as it is in heaven. so then, take your hand off the plow and do not look back, let the dead bury the dead, leave behind your husband and your wife, your brothers and sisters and children, and prepare yourself to receive the kingdom of god. already, the ax is laid at the root of the tree.” (aslan 2013, 124)

the ruach ha kodesh

hebrew and aramaic holy spirit is feminine
“the term ruach ha kodesh is the jewish expression for the holy spirit. the word ruach meaning "spirit" or "breath" is grammatically feminine in hebrew. this linguistic reality reflects the ancient jewish perception of the spirit as a nurturing, life-giving force. the holy spirit, often equated with shekinahâthe indwelling presence of god—was described in rabbinic and mystical texts as a divine feminine presence that ...”

the paraclete

jesus too met same reaction, rejection
“the paraclete will come, just as jesus came, sent into the world by the father. it is said that the disciples will know the paraclete and the paraclete will remain with them... the reaction of the world to the paraclete will be much the same as the world's reaction was to jesus. the world does not know or accept the paraclete, much as it remained ignorant of jesus' true identity and rejected him (5:43; 12:48) in many ways the ...”

the counselor

upholds jesus as son of humanity
“but i quickly learned that christianity has no monopoly on jesus. hindus understood him as an avatar, buddhists as a bodhisattva, and both muslims and jews as a prophet of god. even agnostics found something fascinating and admirable in him. they were not all that attracted to christianity, but they were all drawn to jesus for his exemplary courage, his compassion for the disinherited, and his willingness to ...”

the paraclete

brings blessings of eschaton
“because of the presence of the paraclete in the life of the believer, the blessings of the end-times — the eschaton — are already present. at times john speaks as if that final consummation of history is still a future event conceived in terms typical of apocalyptic though, both jewish and christian: the end-time will bring the coming of christ, the resurrection of the dead, judgment, and eternal life for believers”
