thursday...and all is well in juigalpa





it has been a good day. it has begun to heat up a little more the last day or two. the breeze is not near as consistent as it was.  think it spoiled us. the institute is still going well. they niccas (local nicaraguens) are still dedicated to the study and great students.we are headed to muan this afternoon/evening . we will be partaking in a thanksgiving feast with them in celebration of a woman that was very sick and th lord healed. it should be a lot of fun. it is such a beautiful village.your prayers are appreciated as there is only one more day left in the institute. pray that we finish strong and that god works inspite of us. we trust that he will use this teaching to impact many lives. thanks for everything.-the gringo's

more from wednesday





the week is going well. the weather has been warm but not intolerable thanks to a consistant breeze, which the locals tell me is not normal for the dry season here. it is actually cooler than we were anticipating. we are running between 75-100 people at the bible institute. the students at the institute are being very attentive and working hard. i don't think that i could find 100 people in conway that would come and sit in a crumy wooden chair in 90 degree hear under a pole barn and listen attentively all day to teaching abut the bible for a single day...let alone for an entire week. their dedication both inspires and convicts me.jack and hope have had good progress on the school front. they are set up to teach at both chirstian school and one of the local schools that we found last trip. this morning they went to an orphanage that is next to the camp where we are holding the bible institute and checked into doing some things there. there are a lot of possibilities. hope has been working on her spanish. jim tells everyone that she meets that she can speak spanish and to please help her practice. she is doing great! she did all of the translation when they went to the orphanage.tonight we are going to pastor saturnino's church here in juigalpa and jim is doing a baby dedication. then tomorrow night we are going to muan. it is the city up in the mountains where that cooked the shoat(sheep/goat, aka peligrew) for us last year. they say that they are going to fix another one. it should be wonderful!on the topic of food...hope managed to acomplish what jack and i could not. she got jim to eat "juevos de torro"!!!! i never thought that i would see the day. we all had some. it was pretty good. we had it as cerviche, maybe we will get it (them?) fried next time.the hotel is nice and is working out well. we are actually eating breakfast right there at the hotel. we will not be coming back any skinnier that is for sure! we are eating well, having a lot of fun togeter and enjoying the fellowsip with our brothers and sisters in nicaragua!thanks for the prayers keep them coming! glorio de dios!!!
