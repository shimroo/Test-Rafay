what our program participants say




i have been a part of pci for many years. the extra income each month is helpful and totally worth the 10 minutes i spend entering my meals and attendance each day.




i have been a child care provider for 22 years and have been on the food program the entire time.   it has been a great addition to my business.   it provides an extra support system and is such a great way to keep the kids eating healthy and trying new foods.




the staff at pci are super friendly and knowledgeable.  i have been a member for years, and i still have occasional questions.  they always treat me, and my daycare children, with respect and kindness. 




i have been on the providers choice food program since 1986 and it has been such a good experience. pci has provided us with many helpful tools - one of my favorites was the twist &  sprout cookbook where my kids and i found many yummy new recipes.
