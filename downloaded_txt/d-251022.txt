welcome to hanna auction services!
 
     we are a family owned and operated auction company serving new jersey and pennsylvania.  started in the early 1970s by arthur hanna, jr., we have enjoyed the small country auction atmosphere through the years.  in 1996, tammy hanna, arts daughter in law, joined in the fun.  our forte is doing on-site auctions.  however, from time to time, when the site isnt suitable, a hall can and will be secured.
 
     our honesty, integrity and reliability are unmatched.  we conduct estate sales, moving & household sales, farm auctions, business liquidation and real estate.  tammy is a licensed real estate salesperson as well as an auctioneer.  we also perform appraisals as well.
 
     we have been known to secure record setting bids for our clients.  most recently, we sold a fern coppedge oil painting for an auction high price of $152,000.00.  that painting was sold at an on-site country auction in pittstown, nj.   
 
     new jersey and pennsylvania checks are accepted with a current photo drivers license.  any checks from another state must have a current bank letter of credit.
 
 we look forward to seeing you soon!
