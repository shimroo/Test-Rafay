read more about welcome to otherpower! 

we are a group of alternative energy enthusiasts who want to spread the message that it's fun and easy to make your own electricity from scratch. otherpower headquarters is located in a remote part of the northern colorado mountains, 11 miles past the nearest power pole or phone line. all of our houses and shops run on only solar, wind, water and generator power...not because we are trying to make some sort of political or environmental statement, but because these are the only options available. and we refuse to move to town.
