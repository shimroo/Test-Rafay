the stadium pizza legacycrafting victory,one sliceat a time  



stadium pizza has been a pivotal part of the temecula valley sports community for over two decades, establishing itself at the vibrant intersection of jefferson and winchester as a beacon for sports enthusiasts, teams, and families alike. our commitment extends beyond serving exceptional pizza; we're deeply involved in supporting local schools, sports teams, and community events, fostering a welcoming atmosphere where each visit feels like a celebration among family. since our inception in 1988 and expansion into wildomar in 1990 as home run pizza, we've grown significantly, especially under the stewardship of sandy and rick kordick. in may of 2012, the locker room was introduced, creating a beloved community hub for craft beer lovers and sports fans. this micro-brewery addition quickly became a local favorite being the first of its kind in the city of wildomar. in 2017, we further extended our family to lake elsinore, bringing our legacy of sportsmanship, family-friendly dining, and community involvement to new heights. each location thrives as a vibrant part of the local sports scene, celebrating every game with signature enthusiasm. stadium pizza is more than a pizza place; it's a venue where sports, community, and delicious dining converge, inviting everyone to join in the legacy where every slice tells a story of victory and unity.
