fraternity & sorority life history at owu
scholarship





lead. serve. belong.
as a member of fraternity & sorority life on campus, you will be called to lead, serve the owu campus, local, and global communities, and create lifelong bonds with members of your chapter and the larger owu greek community. 
roughly a third of students at owu participate in a fraternity or sorority, with many of them belonging to other athletic teams and student organizations & clubs also. owu's six fraternities and five sororities are culturally diverse, reflecting the global society that calls owu home.
owu fraternities and sororities are affiliated with the national panhellenic conference, north-american interfraternity conference, and the national pan-hellenic council, ensuring that the local chapters adhere to greek standards across the country. these national groups also help local chapters promote the value of greek life through college and beyond.
after you have left your mark on-campus, you'll move into a strong network of greek alumni who will be valuable as you pursue professional and personal goals post-graduation.
