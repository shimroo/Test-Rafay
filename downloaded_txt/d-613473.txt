welcome to webdav resources



					this site is being produced for the webdav
					community as a central resource for
					documentation, specifications, software,
					mailing lists, and other useful items.
					

what is webdav?

					briefly: webdav stands for "web-based
					distributed authoring and versioning". it is
					a set of extensions to the http protocol
					which allows users to collaboratively edit
					and manage files on remote web servers.
					


					we have prepared a
					frequently asked questions
					page as a quick introduction for dav newcomers.

the extended mkcol for web distributed authoring and versioning protocol specification has been approved by the internet engineering task force
			as rfc 5689. this protocol extends the mkcol method so that it can set a range of
			properties upon collection creation. mkcol thus acts like a combined mkcol +
			proppatch request. congratulations to cyrus daboo for his work on this protocol!.
scanner pro, by readdle
			 turns an iphone into a document scanner, able to save scanned pages off to a webdav server.
the latest version of mac os x server (10.6) provides support for carddav,
			which provides remote access to address books, using webdav. information about
			carddav can be found at the carddav resource
			web site, and in the latest specification.
december 18, 2008
the webdav current principal extension
			to the webdav access control (acl) protocol has been approved by the internet engineering
			task force as rfc 5397. this protocol permits a webdav client to discover what principal (user)
			the server thinks is currently authenticated. this is useful in providing full-service client
			implementations that use the acl protocol. congratulations to wilfredo sanchez and cyrus daboo
			for creating this protocol!
dav-e is a webdav client for iphone, with
			free and full versions. it provides remote file browsing via webdav, and can be used to
			upload pictures taken with the iphone. brough to you by <green/>bytes, which hosts an
			excellent webdav resources page.
google calendar now officially supports caldav. 
			tidbits writes that, after several months of unofficial support for caldav, google calendar now
			officially supports the webdav calendaring protocol, caldav. in practical terms, ical users on the
			mac can now sync their calendars with google calendar. in related news, the zimbra
			open source shared calendar server for linux and mac also has 
			caldav support.
milton is a java-based open source 
			server-side webdav library. a developer would use milton to wrap an existing data source,
			such as a database or content management system, and expose it via the webdav protocol.
			it has been tested to work with windowsxp, linux, and mac os x.
instaviz is a graph drawing application for
			the iphone. it can store the graphs you create on a remote webdav server. see a video of instaviz in action.
real time logic has released a free version of the barracudadrive application for linksys nslu2. the nslu2 is a device made by linksys that makes usb flash memory and
			hard drives accessible across a network. the barracudadrive application makes the nslu2 accessible
			via webdav, and also provides content management system and message board capability. when used with
			usb flash memory, the nslu2 has no moving parts, and would be expected to have a long lifetime.
			that's a lot of capability for appx. usd $60.
november 21, 2008
the dav searching and locating (dasl,
			or webdav search) protocol has been officially published by the internet engineering
			task force as rfc 5323.
document editing and personal notetaking software voodoopad has 
			added 
			webdav support in version 4.0. any documents you edit using voodoopad are automatically synchronized to
			a remote webdav server, providing remote access from any machine. this is an exciting use of webdav for

			company that provides webdav support
			with its usd $15/month power user account. parascale provides
			software that allows users to create and manage cloud storage. it has standard support for webdav.
october 2, 2008
the dav 
			searching and locating (dasl) protocol has been approved by the internet engineering
			steering group (iesg) as a proposed standard. the protocol permits remote clients to
			perform sql-like queries of the properties defined on resources on webdav servers. this
			substantially increases the value of properties, as they can now be efficiently searched
			by webdav clients. congratulations to julian reschke for pushing this protocol through to
			proposed standard!
the xdb 
			(extensible database) has been released as open source software by the nasa ames research center.
			xdb is an architecture for storing and
			retrieving semi-structured, schema-less
			data. users and applications store and
			retrieve information resources in xdb using
			the webdav protocol. these resources may be
			documents, such as html, xml, or microsoft
			word documents, but may also be individual
			records from a relational database converted
			into an xml record or e-mail messages from an
			e-mail archive. xdb decomposes the resources
			into atoms of content in a hierarchy defining
			the context of the atom. resources and their
			contents are retrieved via a simple web query
			interface that produces xml, text, or
			processed through a server-side transformation
			(xslt) module for arbitrary output formats.
			it can use can use mysql, oracle, ms-sql, or sqlite as the storage engine.
			if interested, contact chris knight, <cknight aaat hotcat dot org>.
mozilla weave is a plugin for firefox 
			that aims to provide a "blending of the desktop and the web 
			through deeper integration of the browser with online services." the general idea
			is for browser metadata to be stored remotely (and encrypted) in the cloud, via the webdav protocol.
			this includes browser bookmarks, history, and customizations. wherever a user gets online,
			they will retrieve this information from the cloud to their current browser, providing 
			the same browsing experience even if using firefox from multiple locations. 
			ars technica gives the service high marks, calling it "already effective and easy to use."
idrive oss is a cloud storage system designed
			from the ground up as a native webdav-supporting service, ensuring that it is open,
			and standards-based. the architecture is designed to scale, and the operators have
			experience managing petabytes of data in online storage services.
p300 is a free file-sharing tool for private networks and vpns. it
			is multi-platform, and supports access to files on webdav servers. its latest release also
			implements the dasl protocol, allowing clients to search for resources on peer machines. 
			congratulations to markus götz and sebastian breier for developing this tool.
the community information sharing service digg wrote a piece
			on how digg works, describing its technical
			infrastructure. at the heart lies danga's mogilefs,
			which digg describes as a distributed webdav cluster, and is used to serve story and user
			icons.
