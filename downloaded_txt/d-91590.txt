the tooth fairy was generous





tater lost his front two bottom teeth.  i noticed friday at dinner that here was an empty spot in his mouth.  we think he swallowed the tooth.  that boy needs to chew his food better.  the other was on saturday while eating a snack.  he just pulled it out.here are a couple of pictures from friday:here's a cuter picture:now here is the second tooth pictures... notice he is holding it in his hand!and here is a picture from today:my little boy is growing up.  getting adult teeth, 1st grade, 4 feet tall... man oh man... what happened to my little michelin man?  oh, that's right... he is money man now.  he got $1 for the first tooth and for some reason the tooth fairy visited him twice last night and he got $2.  $3 for just two teeth.  geeze.

a new record - and not a good one





seems i have finally broken a record i worked hard not to beat.  i am over 160 pounds now.  i have no excuse.  i was stressed, when stressed i pick sweets to eat and not good food.  i know better.  i have never found a quick weight loss program that works for me but i did see it work for a guy at work.  eating right, and exercise always takes the weight off.  usually i count calories as well.  lately, i have thrown it all out of the window.  no longer.  i need to get back on track.  vitamins, exercise, and good food.  it won't be easy... but i'm going to give it a shot.  i am not as brave as t1g and will not be showing my weight on the blog.  though i have heard over and over that is a good way to force yourself to focus and take it off.  not going to do it.  will let you know if i ever get below 150... but don't look for it anytime soon.

five questions





mom grind asked five questions of her readers.  i thought they were pretty funny... i am answering them here for my sons to get a laugh out of it in the future...1. toothpaste - do you squeeze the tube from the bottom or from the top? bottom 2. morning person or a night owl? morning person - though the boys are making it a little rough.. 6am ok, 5:20am... not so ok. 3. sweet tooth or not really? sweet tooth. chocolate and sugar mixed... yep... sweet!4. can you carry a tune? no.  my mom, sisters, children... have asked me not to sing.5. do you have a favorite color? if you do, is it really your favorite color or did you feel compelled to choose one because people ask this question so frequently? my favorite color changes with my mood.ok, go ahead, give it a try.  answer the questions.  ;-)

cool gadgets for your blog





i was over checking out raspberry road design and saw a cool translator gadget on her website.  it is now on my website.  i also so the writeup for a spider gadget.  i realized if i added that to my website, i would probably lose a couple of people from visiting ... that i would like to continue to visit.  maybe for halloween?  check out googles gadget site.  i thought the translator worked fairly well.  have not tried out any of the others.  i might have to go to a three column website so i can put cool gadgets on the right side and leave all my other stuff on the left side.  what do you think?

a particular memory of europe with hubby





while we were not married at the time... my soon to be hubby came to visit me in europe in the winter.  we had a blast.  here is a picture of one of the castles we went to see... nope, didn't write it on the back and i don't remember the name of it... anyone out there recognize it?  i believe we were in salzburg at the time, but not positive.and while running around the city, a bus stopped and let a bunch of people off to do the tourist kind of thing... hubby could not resist getting his picture by the bus:i wonder how long before the kids get the humor of that picture?  and i had no idea that the gargoyles on some churches were actually rain spouts.  very cool:as you can see, we had a fun time running around.  i was there six months, my hubby joined me a couple of times.  i'll have to see if i can find more pictures with info on them to put out here.

memories of moving





nope, i'm not moving anytime soon.  but i can guarantee that if i move again, i will pay for someone to move me.  whether it is moving pods or a moving company.  i refuse to do what i have done in the past.  i have used family and friends to move me.  after about 3 of those kinds of moves, i have lost more stuff than i thought possible.  it is not their fault, but my own.  you would have thought after the first time, i would have caught on... nope.  and i am an organized person.  i label stuff... but when you have people who are moving you that are limited in time or are not the same kind of organizer you are... things disappear.  i wouldn't be surprised if one year, all the stuff shows back up... maybe from the 10th dimension.what about you?  have you moved lately?  would you use a mover or family and friends?  any funny stories?  i always offered food and drink (usually pizza and beer) when someone helped to move me... what about you?

remember when i was in europe?





no?  well that would be because it was many many years ago.  i wrote a lot of emails to family and friends about my trip.  i had even printed a bunch out... but they have gotten lost in all the moves i have made.  i wish bou or my mom still had them!it was fun and exciting getting ready for the trip.  how much money do i bring?  how many suit cases?  what about travel insurance?  (luckily my company and the health insurance i had covered all i needed... but i didn't know until i did some research).  where is my apartment?  what will i get to go see?  is it true that the stores aren't open on sundays?  fantastic experience that i will never forget.  but how to write about it for my kids?  that is the question.  the bike rides when it finished snowing.  the castles where they had fingers in jars out for display.  the beauty of the churches on the inside and out.  the foods, the people.  hmmm... where to start?  look for a story or two about my life in europe to be showing up soon.  i'm just trying to figure out which ones!

when did birthday parties get so carried away?





this last weekend, there were two birthday parties to attend.  11am to 1pm and 1pm to 3pm.  the first was a wizard party.  hosted by a company called oogles and googles.  tater and tot were both invited to this one.  here is a few pictures i took with my phone camera... and tater:now the next one was at a private house.  this was a classmate in tater's class.  this is just one of the activities they had in their backyard:wow.  for a child who turned  6 years old just before school started and is now in the first grade.  tater asked if we could do that at his next party.  the answer was absolutely no.  don't get me wrong, this was a great party for kids.  and if you have the money for it, go for it.  wow.  the parents were extremely nice and fun to be around.  it took me a while to find them, as there were a ton of people at the party.   maybe i'll be lucky enough to be invited to another one with tot in tow.  he would have loved it as well.  after attending those parties, i remembered how excited i was that we got to go to a gym for tater's party.  no clean up, kids entertained, tired out, and good company in the parents.  it was a little more than if i held it at home, but not that much more.  worth it for me not to have all the prep work and cleanup after wards.  my party was nothing like those... and i really enjoyed both of them... i just wonder how i got so lucky????  and when did the kids parties get this carried away?  or is it just me?

humor for dreaded wednesday





note: i found it funny that i knew was going to post this today and found a serious question about aging here.  hope this helps everyone enjoy aging another day.the  older crowd  a distraught  senior citizen phoned her doctor's office.  "is it  true," she wanted to know, "that the medication you prescribed has  to be taken for the rest of my life?"    "yes,  i'm afraid so," the doctor told her.  there was a moment of silence before the senior lady replied, "i 'm wondering, then, just how  serious is my condition because this prescription is marked    'no  refills'."    *********************************************an older  gentleman was on the operating table awaiting surgery and he  insisted that his son, a renowned surgeon, perform the operation.  as he was about to get the anesthesia, he asked to speak to  his son."yes, dad,  what is it? ""don't be nervous, son; do your best and just remember, if it doesn't go well, if something happens to me, your mother is going to come and live with you and your  wife...."    ***************************************************************************************aging:eventually you  will reach a point when you stop lying about your age and start bragging about it.      ******************************************************************************************the older we  get, the fewer things seem worth waiting in line  for.  ************************************some people try to turn back their odometers.  not me! i want people to know "why" i look this way.  i've traveled a long way and some of the roads weren't paved.****************************************************************when you are  dissatisfied and would like to go back to youth, think of algebra.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~you know you  are getting old when everything either dries up or  leaks.  *********************************** one of the many things no one tells you about aging is that it is such a nice  change from being young.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ah, being young is beautiful, but being old is comfortable.************************************************first you forget names, then you forget faces.then you forget to pull up  your zipper.it's worse when you forget to pull it  down...  :-(     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ long ago when men cursed and beat the ground with sticks,  it was called witchcraft...today, it's  called golf!     ********************************************************************************************** two old guys are pushing  their carts around wal-mart when they collide.  the first old guy says to the  second guy, "sorry about that. i'm looking for my wife, and i  guess i wasn't paying attention to where i was going."  the  second old guy says, "that's ok, it's a coincidence. i'm looking  for my wife, too. i can't find her and i'm getting a little  desperate."  the first  old guy says, "well, maybe i can help you find her. what does she  look like?"  the second old guy says, "well, she is 27 yrs old, tall, with red hair, blue eyes, long legs, and is wearing short shorts. what  does your wife look like?"  to which the first old guy says,  "doesn't matter, --- let's look for yours."

mamaw heads home today





lots of stuff to post about not enough time.  mamaw and i discussed starting a petition.  you'll see more on that in a couple of days.  spent most of the day talking, most of the evening annoying my husband at scrabble... mamaw is an excellent scrabble player.  she can see more words in those tiles than anyone else.  very awesome time.  busy with her today until flight time... later!

instead of a daily prompt...





i have been watching tink, my sister, write using a daily prompt from her digital scrapbooking group.  i kept thinking it was a cool idea.  she is putting down stuff about her and her life for future reference to her children.  since i actually save my blog to cd every couple of months, so that my kids can have it when they get older... i have wanted to start doing more of the same.  but i just couldn't get into the prompts.  they are interesting and would force me to answer questions but i just didn't do it.  then i found out about payu2blog.com from a couple of bloggers.  i decided to give it a shot and i love it.  it is an odd twist... i may not necessarily buy from any of the links i put into my posts, but it forces me to think about something to write to fit the need of the paid post.    hence, in the future i will be posting more stories.  you'll still get pictures and opinions and a few other odds and ends as usual.  just an extra post or two.  in twenty years, when my kids actually load up my old posts and look at them, those links will probably be gone.  the stories will still be there and hopefully, they will enjoy them.  oh... i hope you enjoy them now!
