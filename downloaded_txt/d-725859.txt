another view of one of the f-86s (the australian ca-27 variant) in that location i was asked not to divulge by the owner from the “boneyard” book, but never shown online. shot a few minutes after yesterday’s post, facing the other way, just after midnight in march 2011. stormy, cold, and camera-killingly windy. 3:13 of […]

f-86s, stored in that location i promised not to divulge as part of my permission to enter. on a bitterly cold and windy winter night in 2010. a 2-page spread in the “boneyard” book, but not posted online before. 257-seconds of full moon and a little led flashlight bounced around.

here’s another favorite from one of those broiling hot summer nights in 2012 at aviation warehouse. never online before, but in the “boneyard” book. broken airliner landing gear tower over the endlessly shifting dunes. 25-minutes total exposure (in several stacked images) with blue and pink from the protomachines flashlight, and then layered together in photoshop.

the mojave consumes a neighborhood on the north edge of newberry, east of barstow. a slow motion tsunami of sand, this is the top of a collapsing two-story house. night, two-minutes of full moon behind the clouds, with red and white led flashlight. shot march 2019.

i shot this, one-handed, about 30 minutes after falling and tearing my rotator cuff in july 2019. just another amazing pile of movie prop junk, destined for the shredder, at paul’s. four minutes of full moon (most of it spent doubled over in pain) and some led flashlight from a couple of directions. and yes, […]
