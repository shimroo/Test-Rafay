publisher's message & editorials




on these shoulders we stand
by suzanne gillis
proudly and sadly we say good-bye to vermont woman, for this is the last issue.
letting go is tough. anytime a newspaper closes, the community it served loses.
as a niche publication specifically for vermont women, this loss is bound to be felt deeply by those of us who have contributed to it, and by you, the vermont woman readers. we hope you are as proud as we are that vermont woman ends as the longest running womenâs advocacy newspaper of its kind in the nation.

vermont woman â spanning 34 years, 1985 to 2019




when a community loses a newspaper, a little bit of its soul goes with it.
a good paper serves to connect its readers, to provide a public forum for different opinions, to profile as many community members as possible, and to provide a venue for businesses to reach the best market for their goods and services. a newspaperâs editorial content should inform, inspire, and educate, bringing public awareness to issues of concern and highlighting achievements. and from time to time, a good paper should agitate and infuriate.
as a womenâs advocacy publication, vermont woman published vermont womenâs points of view on issues ranging from the arts, aging, business, education, and the environment to finance, health, politics, relationships, and sports. we set out to bring womenâs opinions and voices shedding transparency on every male-dominated institution, shining a glaring light on the inequities suffered by women.
we did not cover fashion, diets, or hairdos. and we rarely included menâs viewpoints, as they were already massively covered in the dominant male-owned and -staffed media, locally, regionally, and nationwide. we wanted to be provocative and take on some tough topics, such as the politics of breast cancer prevention, women and aids, domestic violence in vermont, the trans community, women in prison, and incest survivorsâwhile, at the same time, spotlighting womenâs challenges, achievements, and breakthroughs.
finally, vermont woman editors brashly conducted and published opinion surveys, made political endorsements, and took an editorial stand on relevant issues that affected womenâmost specifically but not limited to work, education, money, health, politics, sexuality, relationships, and family. vermont woman was created to be a player in the vermont media mix, to publicly connect women to one another and to those who had the power to effect change.

women's rights â where do we go from here?




by cary brown




who hasnât looked back on their past and thought about how things might have gone if they only knew then what they know now? itâs a question that inevitably leads to other, tougher questions. have i come as far as i thought i would? what about my entire generation? what have we done to make the world a better place than it was when we arrived?
in my high school yearbook, i stated my ambition: âto reform the world.â i wanted to fix things, to make things the way they were supposed to be, because i was so sure that things should be fair, equitable, peaceful, smart, and compassionate.
i was a teenager and came of age in the â80sâright around the time vermont woman newspaper was born. as a teenager, many things enraged me. my sense of justice (and injustice) was highly personal, but i could also see how it extended beyond the individual and into the social. i had many thoughts and opinions about how the world needed to be reformed.
at some point in my childhood i realized that the default human being was, in everyoneâs view, apparently maleâfemales were extra add-ons, not the regular kind of person but some variant. this fed a swiftly growing sense of outrage and injustice that fueled my interest in politics and my engagement in social justice. not to mention my engagement in hours of heated debates with boys in my high school classes. (another peek into my senior yearbook: i was awarded âclass arguer." )
it wasnât just the belief that men were the default that enraged me. it was, much more, the result of that. men seemed to have so much more power than women, so much more control over everything. it seemed as though the whole world was built around this idea that men deserved the power and women didnât. as a teenager, i took it pretty personally.

ten vermont women of achievement, then and now




by cynthia close





in november 1985, sue gillis launched vermont woman, with rickey gard diamond as founding editor. at that time, the paper carried a subtitle: âfor vermont women of achievement,â chosen by gillis. diamond said she expressed her concern to gillis that the publication would only focus on the traditional version of success: well-coiffed upper-middle-class women in business suits, valuing only money and status. but no, gillis also believed that achievement meant a great deal more than that, and so âwe titled our first cover âwomen: redefining achievement,ââ said diamond. in remembering that decision-making process, she said, âwe found [achievement] meant different things to different women, and so the cover includes a woman farmer and an athlete and a mom with her family and a teacher, an artist, and more than one activistâwomen of many shapes, sizes, colors, and ages, including our first female governor. it still makes me smile when i look at it.â
 the 15 women of the original editorial board generated the idea of many photos on the cover and came up with suggestions for categories and particular women, with gillis and diamond making the final determination of who would be honored as women of achievement. by casting a wide net, they were able to present well-known women like madeleine kunin from the political arena alongside ellen smith, an administrative assistant with the abenaki self-help association. the cover communicated to the potential vermont woman audience that the publication would practice inclusivity and that all women would be valued for the kind of work they did, whether it be in business, sports, the arts, education, politics, or the home.
that philosophy has been maintained throughout the past three and a half decades, through a series of editorial and staff changes and a changing sociocultural environment. the one constant has been the guiding hand of founder gillis, whose integrity and tenacity to continue publication of a newspaper for and about women has survived personal, political, and technological upheavals.

five women at work, with passion & commitment




by diane debella





in a head nod to vermont womanâs first issue, which featured an eclectic group of 10 women, we interviewed five vermont women who have made outstanding contributions in a wide variety of fields: thea alvin, stonemason; mari cordes, state legislator; katrina ducharme, state trooper; peggy luhrs, activist; and linda schadler, scientist. these five women talk about how they chose their paths in life and what keeps them going, what keeps the passion alive.
thea alvin: stonemason, sculptor, teacher
when a fire becomes hot enough, even stone will crack. a stone structure, once solid and resilient, can collapse into a heap of dust. internationally acclaimed stonemason and sculptor thea alvin, 51, knows firsthand the devastation of fire. in december of 2017, she was enjoying the creative community of artists who had come to live with her and her partner, sculptor michael clookey, at their home in morristown. they shared meals together and focused on creating their art, which they displayed and sold in the rock, paper, scissors gallery on the property.
all that changed when a fire destroyed the barn, gallery, and part of the main house a day before the winter solstice. a beloved herd of goats and most of the chickens perished, as did countless antiques and much of alvin and her husbandâs life work. anyone experiencing such trauma, loss, and grief would be tempted to collapse into a heap of dust. yet alvin woke the next day and put one foot in front of the otherâsteadfast, strong, and resilient.
âi look at this renovation and rebuilding in the same way that i look at any sculpture. now i am building a sculpture to live in, and every aspect has been curated and carefully thought out,â she says. âi walk through the home i am creating in my head in the process of designing it, and i imagine it during the different vermont seasons; i think of all the people who have helped, and those who will share meals and make memories in it, and i process it like any other sculptureâexcept this is a wood one that i will live in.â

a short history of the lesbian feminist origins of gay liberation in vermont





by peggy luhrs




it was 1972 and i was living in burlington with my friend sally and her daughter. i had just broken up with my husband, and we were sharing custody of our son, justin. two single moms living together meant we could take turns with the kids, enabling us each to go to the fresh ground coffee house, which in 1972 was meeting central for burlington feminists and leftists. at the organizing meeting for the first vermont womenâs conference in 1972, i met and befriended george, one of the few lesbians i knew then. she invited me to come over to her old north end apartment the next day.
no sooner was i in the door when she held up a small magazine, âlook at this.â it was a copy of amazon quarterly, the first literary magazine with a lesbian perspective, started that very year. wow! aq with its amazing and iconic cover image of an amazon on horseback. iâd never seen pictures of these spear-wielding women. my generation grew up with leave it to beaver and father knows best. it is hard to convey how startling and exciting this image was to me at that moment, one that stays with me still.
coming out
i began my first lesbian relationship and a lesbian rap groupârap as in talk freely and franklyâon the same night in march 1973. my friend and soon-to-be-lover faye speed and i organized the first lesbian rap group. it was a success. nine women showed up at my st. paul street apartment. we could talk about being lesbians, what that meant, and how we would navigate our new path. having overcome the greatest obstacle, coming out to ourselves, we delighted in one anotherâs company and support.

what would an economy of our own look like?




by rickey gard diamond




iâm not an economist; i donât even play one on tv. iâm a writer, an educator, and a business owner who, like most, has learned economics the hard way. yet iâm bothered that most womenâs eyes glaze over whenever i talk about the unâs national accounts and the gdp, monetary policy and the federal reserve, or something called public banking. what, they seem to be thinking, could be more boring?
in 2008, we found out just how exciting economics can be. over two and a half million us jobs disappeared, and a third of us real estate value flew out the window. it took a decade for the us median household income to pass what it had been in 2008, now at $60,336. meanwhile prices have gone up and threaten to go higher with washingtonâs trade war.
over the past 35 years, so-called free market changes in the rules of our money system and tax policies have reliably moved dollars up to those already with a surplus. if you havenât enough savings to pay for a college degree, a car to get you to your job, or a house, you must borrow. businesses and governments borrow too. with interest reliably doubling debt, the upward movement of our systemâs pyramid scheme hoists dollars up to the unneedy. this is aided by wall street bro-bloviation, and sometimes corruption.
