what to do with teenagers when roller skating gets old? skyzone!







as the mother of a teenage daughter, figuring out activities that give me a break, are nearby, don't involve computers and cell phones, and don't cost an arm and a leg can be difficult. yes, the roller skating rink worked until she was about 13 - she and her friends would meet there and feel grown up that we parents would leave them there for a couple of hours on their own. but that faded, especially after our local roller skating rink added a bar serving alcohol, and the median age of the skaters went up dramatically. it wasn't a safe place for young girls to be anymore.

enter skyzone! not only is trampoline jumping good exercise, but they have to put down their phones to do it. lol. last night we attended the skyzone kennesaw vip event where folks of all ages jumped, tossed dodgeballs, jumped into a giant foam pit, and shot hoops -- all while bouncing like crazy on the 34,000 square feet of trampolines. insanely cool.

if you have a teenager - or if you still have a love of trampolines, i highly recommend spending some time at skyzone.

jump jump!

salesforce implementation





okay, blog sisters. here is another promo just for you. for the month of january aspiratech will be offering a special discount to anyone mentioning this blog when inquiring about a salesforce implementation project. the discount is a whopping 25%, so don't delay. it will apply for any project that has signed paperwork in the month of january 2013.

there was great response to our offer of free training last fall, so we are back extending the hand to our sisters once more. there need to be more women in technology, and more women making technology decisions for their firms in whatever industry. let's stay connected, and keep the knowledge flowing.

as a note to those of you who have no idea what a salesforce implementation even is, it means implementing a customized crm solution for a company or non-profit. this allows companies to maximize the relationships they have with their customers, clients, vendors, partners, and even competitors, all the way from marketing, through sales, accounting and support. whether a one-person enterprise or a multinational corporation, most businesses can benefit from having such a centralized and user friendly database that can be accessed from any web browser, with exceptional security and levels of access controls for different staff positions. 

don't be shy to use the form on the aspiratech website to ask questions if you would like to know more about salesforce implementation, including if you are interested in work in the field yourself. (we also give 10% referral bonuses for all initial salesforce.com projects, which can mean hundreds or even thousands of dollars for just an introduction with your name.)

salesforce training gift for you





i have been a contributing member of this site for so many years, and realized that though i've given so many free offerings to others in my community, i've never done so with you blog sisters. so here goes: for the next month, i will provide a free one hour salesforce training session to any sister who wants one. it can be either the user or the admin side, your choice. we will use a remote training app so that we can share a screen and work together.

now is a good time to build your job skills, whether you are currently employed or not. i always love supporting women in technology, so don't be shy. if you really want to learn, august 2012 is apparently the time! just visit the website linked above then submit the price quote request form and enter "blog sisters" in the field for how you heard about us. happy summer, ladies.

summer. it's a time of  complete and utter top-down disruption of my otherwise fairly routine schedule. it means i drive this one here and that one there. it means i space work in between the flow of life, like commas and semi-colons. it means i stay up too late and lose time in the morning. it means i really should be sleeping - right now. goodnight one and all.
