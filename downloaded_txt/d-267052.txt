“i met pipp a little over a year ago. having recently opened an office in brooksville and needed an online presence. pipp built a website for me and created a strong local search presence for me. i now appear on the first page of search results for all my important keywords on google and the other major search engines. additionally we are doing online video marketing allowing me to have another spot on page one for many of my keywords. and we are seeing results. i highly recommend pipp if you need help with marketing online. also, pipp recently brought me up to speed on the growth and importance of mobile, so i had him build a mobile site for my practice which allows me to take advantage of the growth in mobile search.”

why is seo such a vital part of a business strategy?

any business needs to create an seo plan to implement as part of their overall marketing strategy right now! the reason is because people use these search engines for finding whatever it is they need that day, and new potential customers are there for the taking if you have the services or products they need. if they can’t find you, then someone else reaps the benefits of the search engines. opportunities lost are revenue lost. it can really add up to mind-numbing amounts of money.
 
unfortunately, a lot of businesses have hired the wrong seo company and been burned. they didn’t get what they were promised and paid for. that’s why some business owners are hesitant about hiring an seo expert in tampa because they’ve heard those same horror stories. who wouldn’t be reluctant when hearing a negative report?
 
however, in the internet world just as in the rest of the world, there are bad apples sprinkled in among the jewels. you just have to do your research and weed out what’s good from what’s bad. the truth is that when done properly, seo services can improve your business growth by an enormous amount. your roi will really skyrocket.
 
some small businesses and large ones, see seo as being too confusing or a bit overwhelming. however, they still need it if they are going to keep up with their competition. they have to face the fact that a marketing plan without a serious online effort today is not going to deliver the best results.
 
seo that is properly implemented by a skilled and trained tampa seo expert is going to produce a great roi for companies who are smart enough to take advantage of it.
 
we will deliver the kind of results that get you ranked #1 on google.











 
“in the seo world, precision and attention to detail decide the difference between average and expert. pipp’s ability to formulate precise strategies tailored to client’s needs and implement them with knowledge and expertise sets him apart from the many professionals claiming to be seo experts. when a business owner chooses to do business with pipp, they are making the right choice!”

getting top rankings
whenever you search for anything online it is a search engine that delivers the results pages. there will be relevant websites listed on the first page that offer the services and products that most closely match the keywords that were typed into that search engine. the large majority of people performing searches, will only view that first page, without clicking onto the second or third. that’s why it’s so important that your business be listed up toward the top of that first page. you will get a whole lot more traffic when people can see your site upon arriving on that first results page.
 
with seo, your site content and its structure are vital elements that are part of how search engines determine their rankings and results. the more visibility your site has the more potential customers you have, which means more revenue for your business. people search for what they need, see your site link, click on it, and are at your website to find what they need and make a purchase. that is ‘organic’ traffic.
 
long term success
having a sound seo strategy properly implemented for your website will move you to the top search results of the first page and you can maintain that position. this ensures that you keep a steady flow of new visitors coming to your site on a daily basis and business will increase. so pick up the phone and let us help you today.
 
to recap, it is the search engines that everybody turns to when they need to find something. it can be information, products, services, or just general interest, but they find it by one means – search engines, and mainly google. when you can get your business website ranking at #1, you are going to enjoy an increase in visitors and revenues that keep you competitive and makes you a success.
