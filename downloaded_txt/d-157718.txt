tumi chucua is in the north east corner of bolivia, about 12 miles from riberalta. tumi chucua means isle of palms in the tacana language. (the people who live at tumi still go out to the island to collect motacú.) in 1955 sil went into bolivia as instituto lingüístico de verano (ilv). tumi chucua lake was chosen as the site to locate headquarters. ilv finished its work in bolivia in 1985. those of us who lived there think it’s one of the most beautiful spots in the world.
if you ever lived at, or visited tumi, i hope you’ll enjoy this tour down memory lane. it is still a work in progress.
