once known mostly for all-you-can-eat buffets, las vegas has branched out as a haute-culinary outpost, with cuisine from far-flung corners. historically, buffets started in the 40s at the original el rancho vegas hotel to keep patrons on premises during wee hours.  the idea caught on, and legendary buffets now feature dozens of items per meal, sometimes specializing in seafood, steak, or ethnic taste sensations. hotel-casino "gourmet rooms" catering to high rollers followed buffets, and now las vegas high-end dining enclaves are hot across the board, often featuring renowned chefs. among award-winners are bellagio's le cirque and picasso, and the mirage's renoir.
