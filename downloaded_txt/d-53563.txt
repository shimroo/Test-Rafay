tips and advice from the experts
selecting a corporate gift involves many factors. here are the top questions to consider when making your purchasing decisions:
what is my budget?
when setting your budget, include extras such as setup charges, shipping fees, drop shipping, and cards. multi-color imprints and name personalization can also add to the expense. it's essential to account for these additional costs to avoid surprises.
should i add my logo?
determine if you want your logo included. there are pros and cons. adding your customization will promote your brand and keep your message in front of your recipient. however, some feel that adding a logo to a product cheapens the gift. our experience shows that 90% of customers prefer to customize their items, but the decision ultimately depends on the purpose of the gifts.
for promotional items intended to promote an event or be given at a tradeshow, including your logo is a straightforward decision. for appreciation or incentive gifts for employees, you may or may not want your logo included.
how long does it take?
planning in advance is crucial. production and delivery times vary across the industry. normal production time is 5-7 days after you have approved a digital proof, but some items may take longer. inventory levels constantly change, and during the holiday season, production times usually extend due to increased demand.
if your organization requires approval from multiple departments and managers, allow time for the approval process to work through the channels. this process can take an unforeseen amount of time. our best advice is to plan ahead. whether it's a gift for the holidays or an event, ensure your timing is on target to get the items you really want. rush services are available, but it's better to avoid paying extra when you don't have to.
by considering these factors, you can make informed decisions and ensure a successful corporate gifting experience.
