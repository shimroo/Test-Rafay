genealogy in schleswig
holstein, germany
former access to genealogical databases e.g.:
family trees, passenger lists, online searchable emigrant listings, and a lot
more.
the most of this websites were published from 1999 up to 
2004.
during the last years a lot has changed in the german and 
european law about online publishing, and because of that i had to delete 
several of by websites.
maybe some of them will be online again in 2021/2022.
