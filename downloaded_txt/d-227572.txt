we fight to ensure they're used for justice.















 

since 2004, more than 1 in 5 local newspapers in the united states has closed.











 

84% of white people have home-internet access, compared to 78% of latinx people and 76% of black people











 

8 media giants control 818 broadcast-tv stations, resulting in local news that all looks and sounds the same













join us
as we challenge powerful corporations, hold policymakers accountable and mobilize millions.
