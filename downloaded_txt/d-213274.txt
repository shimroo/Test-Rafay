coach kelly has been a dream come true for our daughter. coach kelly is not only a coach; she is a competitive, compassionate teacher and mentor that cares about her athletes. coach kelly has identified and adapted to our daughter’s learning style, figuring out how to break down lessons to ensure our daughter has a full understanding of what kelly is requesting of her. our daughter is a natural righty with speed. after about thirty minutes with coach kelly in the cage, our daughter was slapping, dragging and hitting from the left side. its mental, as well as physical progress our daughter has made working with kelly, and it is immeasurable.google review
