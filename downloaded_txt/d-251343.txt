												a lot of good things have just happened or are about to happen in hobart (@six_russell_bakes and @ranita.ramen have just opened and @lukeburgess77 has a project opening early in 2025) but not all the news is good.
today was the last day @mewahrestaurant will serve its lunchtime yum cha. an institution since 2007 this service will be sadly missed. 
it was a lucky privilege to have one last meal during the last service with @kobi_ruz @analiesegregory @jyefergusonnn and @julie_kettyle_ . 
no doubt there will still be dumplings on the evening à la carte menu but for now the trolleys are silent.

												time to draw breath and contemplate how few posts we have made this year. so many stories but nothing that’s easy to retrieve. this might come to nothing but here’s a first attempt to put together some favourite moments from time spent in france mid year.
this post is about perpignan - a town we have come to love (thanks @mataburro.vins and @vinaigrerie_la_guinelle_ for being the reason for us to come back regularly).
included here:
@naivedeperpignan (we ate here twice)
@manat.restaurant (we would have eaten here twice!)
@bas__ton what a wine list and great pizza plus a @mamenakane_ popup
@cafeleo_perpignan - some of france’s best coffee and one of its most thoughtful coffee people
@neoperpignan for the best bread 
@yegg_pub for fried chicken
and a photo at @vinaigrerie_la_guinelle_ which is easily accessible for a visit from here and a must visit if you are in the region. we might stop working long enough to do a few more of these before the year is out.

												we’re coming to queensland for a tasting at @florgrocer in burleigh heads
we’re there from 4pm-6pm. everyone’s welcome - no bookings, no cost. come and say hello and try some very spring-like queensland-ready wines! (and it’s probably not a coincidence that it is still winter in tasmania and we’re having trouble adjusting after spending july in france)

												just a few more … including …
* the first menu in february 2017 (note the prices!)
* our first taste - salted fish croquettes (inspired by @dementedfermenter’s years at garagistes)
* watching a @fatcarrotfarm vegetable delivery from our favourite daytime seats
* so much good food 
* a wall of amazing wines when everything was glorious … and now, almost the last photo, nearly empty (there are still a few cellar treasures left though, (and books), and they are open until wednesday). 
* our last menu
thank you @whitneykate_ and @dementedfermenter and all of @tmchugos’s team, past and present, for creating such an extraordinary, safe place. you will be remembered and written about for as long as hobart has a history.

												how to capture 7 years of joy in 10 photos (it’s not possible of course) but here’s a start, including:
* the very last time (we imagine - it’s unlikely we’ll forgive the fact they had no choice but to close) we walked out of these doors
* so many wonderful vegetables from so many growers. on our last visit we saw two of them - @provenancegrowers and @fatcarrotfarm - which was not unusual
* angasi oysters
* @whitneykate_ in 2020 - just after the covid lockdown but with the fridge still full of things to take home - that stock helped us through the lockdown days
* and so many recovery days, especially after any @bottletops_wine event, like this one
* so much great wine at prices that made out of towners weep (unless they were from europe)
* ashley with a captive audience!
* the feasts …
* hand pies 
* forbes’ corner
more to come …
