									beaumont school taught me the the importance of discipline and hard work to achieve my goals. i was prepared for the challenges set in front of me at duquesne... because of the value and work ethic i learned through the teachers and faculty at beaumont. i can proudly state that beaumont school paved the way for my successful completion as a doctor of physical therapy.
