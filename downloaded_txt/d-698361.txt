our mission is to enable children with special neurologic and emotional needs to reach their full potential through our therapeutic and educational program, complemented by outreach and training, assessment, and community consultations. 

  

a message from our executive director













 ctds is a therapeutic day school welcoming families with children between the ages of 3 to 12 with neurologic, psychiatric and educational challenges. the school consists of approximately 32 students and we serve another 200 each year through our community services program, providing diagnostic consultations, neuropsychological evaluations as well as individual therapy and child guidance.our mission is to make sure that every child is given the opportunity to reach their maximum potential. we do this by staying very child-centered, taking the time to observe behaviors, account for what we are seeing and then thoughtfully and intentionally setting realistic goals with students and families. we achieve success by building confidence and trust. success is different for each child. for some it may be achieving self control or working to build a friendship as they come out of extended isolation. for others, it may be making steps toward self sufficiency or autonomy or reconnecting with their family. it may also be overcoming social or emotional trauma or the challenges of academic learning.special attention is paid to the deeper curriculum of compassion, tenderness, wisdom and curiosity. uniqueness, passion and existing skills are encouraged and nurtured with patience and thoughtful guidance.our staff is dedicated to understanding each child and working to achieve growth and success. community is a key component of our program and success as we work to support and communicate with families and their support teams.our beautiful campus is a welcoming metaphor for caring, safety, love and understanding. it provides an environment where our students can learn, connect with staff and each other and the environment.                                                                                                                                                                               please reach out if you would like to come visit our campus and meet the team!mark lucier ctds executive director
