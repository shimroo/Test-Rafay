introducing ohs new product lines….















ray civello created bob™ in response to what he saw as an urgent need in the industry. current product offerings were not enough.he wanted to create a modern line that was truly clean and sustainable, that did not compromise on style, luxury or the performance that stylists demand for their professional use in salons everyday. from the sustainable packaging to the all-natural, intoxicating aromas, bob™ is vegan, peta certified and never tested on animals.
