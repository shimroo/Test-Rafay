important notice — help needed for this and philip goddard's other sites!
please note that the red, 'unsafe' and orange, 'suspicious'
 rating given to two of my sites by wot, the self-styled (and indeed self-serving) 'web of trust', are 'false positives'. wot has a
 very poor reputation among many decent and honest website owners, 
who've had their high quality and perfectly safe sites wrongly rated by 
wot's clearly faulty algorithm(s) as unsafe. …
click to read more / less...

…the problem is not just that wot wrongly rates many safe and 
high-quality sites as unsafe, but that it consistently, over many years,
 refuses to take responsibility for those errors, in a quite kafkaesque 
manner. i have tried to get wot to correct the wrong rating for the two 
currently impacted sites of mine, and i just got their standard pasted 
bullshitting response that puts all the onus on me and indicates they 
aren't in the slightest interested in correcting their error, nor 
improving their algorithms, nor indeed reading my constructive detailed 
report of the problem. countless other website owners have had this 
issue with wot.if in doubt about the safety of any of my sites, please check them  in virustotal.
also, if you think highly of this site and its contents (and of course are reasonably sure it's safe!), please consider rating and reviewing it at wot, for the latter claims that getting some positive reviews helps a site avoid or get rid of poor safety ratings.
all my sites are at risk of getting similarly rated by wot as
 unsafe or suspicious, so, please, if you think highly of any of my five
 sites, please do consider reviewing and rating any or all of them.
i understand that each review gradually loses its weighting in arriving at an overall rating, so this and my other sites always need
 new reviews and ratings in order to improve or at least maintain their current rating.
if you do give any review(s), please explain what you find 
good about the site or / and its contents, and not just give curt 
expressions like great site!! — poor-quality reviews like that 
can actually have a negative impact on the site's rating, because such 
reviews are widely given by bots spamming review pages, and your review 
would be seen as a likely bot review. i would have to 'report' for 
removal any reviews that don't look genuine, so please do make sure to 
report a bit of your own experience in your review.

n.b.each of philip goddard's sitesis a belief-free zone…


at a glance…
a celebration of clear-minded creativity —pointing to what is actually there — not what people believe is there…

…with a challenging and inspirational perspective on the nature of our reality…




this site, as well as being philip goddard's personal site, is hub for four other sites of his:


his literary works: 6 novels, 14 short stories, and a collection of poetry, all of a horizon-broadening adventurous, exploratory nature;

his music works: classical, mainly symphonic, including 10 symphonies, and other orchestral, choral and instrumental works. much nature connection. — but now with the addition of a new, pioneering type of music: his nature-symphonies.

his nature and landscape photos, plus recordings of natural soundscapes, the latter including a sub-project of recording various combinations of differently tuned wind chimes out in the wilds — each recording really being a special and very beautiful type of aleatory music composition.

most important of all, his clarity of being site, presenting a pioneering (and thus challenging!) rationally-based approach to self-actualization and the most deeply sourced life upturn, with none of the issues and problems inherent in all belief-based approaches to the same general aspiration. — includes a self-salvation page for people in crisis, and the surely crazy and delusional project fix the human condition, which is actually based on genuine good sense instead of belief or way-out pseudo-scientific theories, unlike other attempts to address the 'human condition'.
his 'neptune the mystic' site. this is a subsidiary single-page site to cater for people who'd lost touch with the author when he originally let go of the neptunethemystic.co.uk domain name, and to reactivate the various otherwise 'dead' links out there to pages of his that are still under that domain name.

this site itself includes pages on:


his hikes, including his hitch-hiking to and from his hiking routes;

careful analysis of intriguing / educational situations arising from particular medical conditions that affected him;

his amazing and inspirational test conversations with chatgpt

a basic personal bio;

his blog;

his music store, bookstore, and natural soundscapes downloads store.

…and of course the inevitable 'more'…


** new, 2024! **going for the pinnacle rather than the armchair!— listen to the author's 'pinnacle' music work:nature-symphony 51 (the fundamental pinnacle examining the source of inspiration itself)

wind
chimes in the wild
 — symphonies of wind chimes and nature




within philip goddard's overall broad horizon natural
soundscapes programme is his wind chimes in the wild series — a
large collection of significant-length recordings of various sets of quality wind chimes in wild, reasonably natural surroundings, …
click to read more / less…
…all recorded fully authentically, with no overdubbing, nor
looping, nor having anything moving the chimes other than the wind you can hear — in considerable contrast to all the commercially produced recordings of wind chimes that he'd heard previously,
which all had at least some type of faking.
his catalogue here includes a large number of cd-quality digital downloads of these authentic
chimes recordings — a big range indeed!
most of the chimes recordings are of various combinations /
ensembles of chimes, each tuned to a different scale so that we get the most exquisite musical
effects — so these are not to be equated with 'relaxation' wind chimes recordings you may have encountered elsewhere.
each digital download in this big collection brings a unique musical experience — in
some cases being remarkably like a complex symphony, albeit composed and performed by 'mother nature'.
indeed, in 2023 he's taken it further and used certain transformations of certain of those recordings to produce his 'official' nature-symphonies.
return to top

…and now an advanced, powerful and visionary new type of music creation: nature-symphonies
 — nature-generated stochastic (probability-driven) electroacoustic 
works, created by applying certain remarkably straightforward processing to selected field 
recordings of wind chimes or / and particular natural soundscapes.

and pieces of current thinking and breaking news.
my 'lights-out' time approaches…this errant monkey isn't going to hang around to degrade and suffer before finally dying, and neither is he going to 'commit suicide'. instead, it appears that he's going to do the unthinkable thing and simply die in his sleep at a time that makes best sense, rather than go along with anyone's beliefs on the subject — i.e., to treat the matter intelligently and treat the matter as something positive and joyful to contemplate and pursue…

>> chatgpt — from astoundingly human-like responses, to a real human
something not just interesting but unprecedented has been going on here!
first, two out of a series of really challenging and very revealing test conversations i had with chatgpt in late november 2024. not just fascinating reads, but inspirational — and then, a gobsmacking development in january 2025…

test 6: impossible 'pinnacle' poem comprehension ultra-challenge!

do you want to be 'appropriate'? …or authentic?



a special primer! —fundamental axioms for usefully understanding 'reality'
>>>>  <<<<
nobody can absolutely, categorically, know anything.
if you understand, things are as they are.
if you don't understand,
things are as they
are.
if you believe that things are, or should be, one way or another,
you have not yet understood.>>>>  <<<<
the ultimate reality that we can ever know of is not the physical 'reality' nor a 'higher reality', but consciousness or experience itself — whatever that is. its true nature is intrinsically impossible for anyone in the whole of 'existence' to understand.


important!
please read underlying causes of human dysfunction now in past tense…. 
although the garbage 
and 'the astral' are apparently no more now, most susceptible people 
would still be subjectively experiencing manifestations of both 
phenomena, as explained on that page, so for the time being in many 
situations it's still necessary to take appropriate measures as though 
they still exist.
for this reason, in some places on this site, including this page, i
 still use the present tense in various of my references to them.

if there's any basic 'message' underlying this and my other websites, it's about the tremendous
advantages and benefits of allowing yourself to be truly authentic as distinct from merely
'appropriate' in your outlook and lifestyle. being truly authentic is the
ultimate mental health, which makes a mockery of the travesty of the 'mental health' that is
aspired to in so-called mental health services and organisations.
the vast majority of people are to varying extents actually programmed* to shy away from authenticity and take refuge in
'appropriateness'.

* i use that word not just as a figure of speech but actually to
signify something quite sinister. i'm referring to real programming, and
it comes from none other than a seriously troublesome non-physical influence that i call the
garbage, which interferes with every single person on the
planet.
it's that programming that distorts a certain level of a person's consciousness to create the
'soul', which latter is thus a dysfunctional or pathological
manifestation, as i explain in the true nature of 'the forces of darkness' and its interference and attacks. it appears that i myself lack such
programming, because i belong to a small minority of people who are no-soul incarnations — in other words, direct, 'immediate' incarnations
of fundamental consciousness ('the ultimate').
such people are naturally authentic and find other people's 'appropriateness' bewildering and
trivial.

so, what do i mean here by these terms?


authenticity is being truly and deeply yourself. in other words your outlook
and lifestyle and behaviour are determined by your deeper nature, which is thus allowed to 'flow'
and become manifest. you could say that a person who is being authentic is 'genuine' or
'self-honest'. such a person has no agendas apart from being 'naturally
him/herself', and has no need nor cause to project any particular (inevitably false) image of him/herself to others.
that deeper nature is naturally 'dynamically relaxed', vibrantly and deeply aware, positive,
energetic, alert, unconditionally loving, secure, happy and creative, and gives rise to a vivid and
abundant life experience. a natural powerfulness flows from that deeper nature, which has nothing
to do with personal status or power / control agendas.
to dispel any possible misunderstanding here, it's necessary for me to point out that a truly
authentic person, being deeply aware and also flexible in their outlook and behaviour, does not go
around like a bull in a china shop, just 'doing his own thing' and upsetting everyone everywhere
(s)he goes. no, such a person, being strongly and deeply aware, is much more genuinely considerate
to other people than anyone who is locked into the 'appropriateness' model, which is based in
unawareness.
a truly authentic person learns quickly where, when and how to avoid pushing people's buttons
in unhelpful ways, even if sometimes this may require the temporary concealing of their own 'truth'
in order not to set up needless barriers.
that doesn't at all mean that a truly authentic person seeks to be unchallenging all the time. far
from it. rather, such a person is flexible in his / her approach and makes sensible and practical
choices in order to maintain a healthy balance of fearless direct
challenge and harmonious parallel existence.


'appropriateness' is trying to be how you want people to see you — which is
usually, but not necessarily, what you believe people around you expect or want of you. it's not
real appropriateness, which is why i'm putting it in quotes every time, because really the most
appropriate thing is always to be genuine and authentic — but the vast majority of people have by
certain means been programmed not to understand this very simple logic and to live false,
ersatz lives that are not truly their own but are to varying extents set up to conform to
other people's perceived expectations of them*. by living
'appropriately', a person is being 'self-dishonest'.

* although the 'other people' involved would normally be what is
assumed to be 'everybody', in some cases the 'other people' may themselves be some minority group,
such as buddhists, christians, 'goths', paganists, 'healers', satanists, 'twitchers' (bird
watchers), social democratic flower arrangers, astrophysicists, doctors, psychiatrists, left-handed
albino rosicrucians, and so forth.

the programming therefore tends to steer people into conventions and traditions, whether those
be of the majority or a particular minority. people set up close relationships and even get
married, and procreate, with no idea of whether all or indeed any of that would actually be for
their own deepest and ultimate good. likewise, they choose their clothes, buy their consumer
products and their entertainments without reference to what would truly and deeply benefit them or
truly reflect their deepest nature or true identity, and without consideration for what would serve
or fulfil any genuine underlying purpose in their physical existence.
'appropriateness' always limits people's life experience, greatly narrowing their awareness and
their life options. because all the time it involves personal agendas of status and power / control
issues, it leads to all manner of conflicts, negativities and indeed all the troublesome things we
see going on in the world.
'appropriateness' is pattern-based and thus rigid in nature. it has no concept of maintaining
a flexible balance, and will always tend to put pressure on non-conformers to conform. unsolicited
advice such as you should do xxxx., why don't you do xxxx?, and the absurd robotically delivered valediction take care!, are typical control measures of
people's 'appropriateness' outlooks. they don't see the true human being at all and instead see
only another focus for exerting control.
indeed, sorry to say, the latter is one of the primary reasons for people wanting to have
children (without regard to whether it's really in their or the world's best interests that they
do so), just as it's also one of the primary reasons for keeping a pet (though rarely
acknowledged!).


authenticity is for living, not discussing or critiquing! 
always at the risk of being accused by members of the 'appropriateness' brigade of brazenly
flaunting a super-big ego (indeed on occasions they not only accuse me but abuse too!), on
my websites i point to what true authenticity can be like, for i myself have always been dedicated
to my own authenticity and am nowadays doing what i can, within the bounds of maintaining
reasonable balance in my own life, to stimulate and catalyse the cultivation and growth of
authenticity in others.

the process of cultivating your own authenticity — making yourself increasingly a manifestation
of your own, perfect, deepest nature — is what i mean by the terms
self-realization and self-actualization, and on
my clarity of being site you get a whole
and very challenging perspective on how you can progressively become fully authentic yourself, free
from all hindering and obstructive influences, whether those are from other people, emotional
issues that you are carrying, or from troublesome non-physical sources (particularly interferences
from the garbage, many of whose actually illusory manifestations
get described as astral or 'dark' entities).
through being authentic rather than 'appropriate', at various times in my life i've caused
bewilderment among people who knew me, because i'd get deeply into some particular interest or
activity and then, after a while, i'd move on and take up something else. it was amazing how
seemingly highly intelligent people would berate me for suddenly not conforming to one or another
stereotype they'd placed upon me, and that i had suddenly broken for them.
some wanted me to be a stereotype 'gay' to comfort them in their own sexuality issues, which
latter they were not doing anything to resolve. others wanted me to be a devoted entomologist with
no significant other interests. others wanted me to remain just a poet, or just a writer of novels
and short stories, or just a nature photographer, or just a composer of major musical works, or
just a 'healer' or 'spiritual teacher'. they were all seeing and to varying extents attaching
themselves to limited images of me, rather than actually the authentic me!
for the same reason, quite a few people get edgy and uptight about me on the basis of what's on
my websites, because they find my own expansiveness of outlook and life experience to be alien to
their 'appropriateness'-related restrictedness of outlook.
you can see the odd examples of that sort of thing in my visitors' book,
and i get the occasional personal communications of a similar nature. the words 'ego' and
occasionally 'arrogant' get thrown at me like mud pies, and such individuals who are themselves in
some supposed self-realization / self-actualization or 'spiritual' path are additionally inclined
to seek to impose upon me their own opinions and beliefs, lecturing and haranguing me, seeking to
convince me or the world that i'm a misguided impostor or charlatan who is falsely claiming that
i'm enlightened and falsely claiming that i've found true clarity or truth.
of course i'm accused of seeking to impose my own supposed 'beliefs' upon other people — yet
these people show no evidence that they themselves are enlightened or particularly self-actualized
(they simply have strong beliefs about enlightenment and self-actualization), and they
offer nothing positive nor constructive that would in any way make their communications
worthwhile.
what those people are really communicating is fear. their particular programming
makes them react out of fear when they countenance a person being as authentic as can be and
demonstrating a true abundance of life experience, because their more limited view born in their
own 'appropriateness' is then being implicitly challenged, and it's fear that is the distorted
'consciousness energy' that holds their 'appropriateness' programming in place.
a particularly common distorted 'appropriateness'-sourced opinion that's put to me is that
anyone who is seen to be some sort of 'spiritual teacher' (not that that is an appropriate
description of me nowadays anyway) should be very modest, quietly spoken and
humble, and should have no abundance in their lives, and should not publicly mention any special
achievements, abilities or 'gifts' of theirs, including such things as their being enlightened*.

* for more about that issue, please see modesty and humility — cutting
through the confusion.


that, dear friends, is one of the sick distortions of supposedly enlightened living that come
from certain religious traditions — notably most buddhist traditions — and actually is among the
things that demonstrate the harmfulness of those traditions through their permeation with
control agenda (albeit sometimes quite subtle). on my clarity of being site i explain the source of such distortions*, and how all religions, without any
exception that i know of, and indeed all so-called spiritual paths, are leading people in a
direction that would horrify virtually everyone if they came to properly understand what's really going on.

* please see the true nature of 'the forces of darkness' and its interference and attacks.


however, my 'message' isn't in the slightest a paranoid one, because it's about seeing the
problem clearly in order to effectively address it and, as far as possible, actually
resolve it. true paranoia has no thought of real solutions! and, to the best of my
understanding, the issue of the garbage's
interference in everyone's lives, giving rise to 'appropriate' rather than authentic living, and
indeed virtually all the world's significant problems, is indeed apparently soluble at least to
some degree — to the extent that people wake up to the fact and are willing and motivated to take
appropriate simple, painless, safe and completely non-scary measures.

for a light-hearted literary portrayal of authentic vs 'appropriate'
living, please see the man with the knobbly
knees.


… and a reminder of the most fundamental and crucial thing that every single person in the whole of 'existence' needs to understand:




>>>>  <<<<
nobody can absolutely, categorically, know anything.
if you understand, things are as they are.
if you don't understand,
things are as they
are.
if you believe that things are, or should be, one way or
another,
you have not yet understood.


 
it's really cool to be normal…
portrait of a normal person
why are you banging your head against that wall?


sorry, i don't have time to stop and think about such things. i'm too busy banging my head
against this wall. — oh, please do me a favour and pass the paracetamol… — and while you're
about it, please bring the television round here so that i can watch it while i'm banging my head
on this wall. you do need some entertainment to make life bearable, you know…

(later) …so,
you're still banging your head against that wall, then!

do you really mean that i shouldn't do what i enjoy? people should be free to do what they
enjoy! that's what we're here for — to enjoy ourselves!

 


portrait of a self-actualized, healthily functioning person
why aren't you banging your head against that
wall?

oh, that! i tried it a long time ago, and it hurt and was most incredibly
boring. just look at my freedom and clarity and ease of being and all the happiness and abundance
in my life now because i don't keep doing that silly thing and getting stuck in pointless
ruts!

well, in that case, at least you should take some
haloperidol to help cure you of your condition.

- er, you're telling me that h- (expletive censored) is a self-actualization
aid and brings happiness and abundance and positivity to one's life?

…and also you should use your television more, to help
cure you…

what television? where? my life's so full of wonderful things, why would i need one of
those? …okay, if i ever have cause to get a big hole made in my head i'll consider getting a
television at the same time…

(later) …i see
you're still not banging your head against that wall! don't you ever let your hair down and enjoy
yourself? you really should, you know. it's unnatural and not normal if you don't just let go and
enjoy yourself a bit. …you're nuts!

 then best not to eat me if
you're sensitive to them!


are you really so sure you want to
be 'normal'?
