it was a great ride on a hot summer
                                          day. the clouds started to build in the afternoon
                                          so you head back home to get inside your enclosed
                                          motorcycle cover before the thunder and lightning.
                                          rain drops start as you race down your street.
                                          as you pull in to park in your motorcycle cover
                                          the rain kicks into high gear. 




 


 you ride right into
                                    your enclosed bike barn motorcycle cover and pull
                                    the top down with you inside. you wipe down your
                                    bike while the pipes cool off and the rain pelts
                                    down – but not on your baby. sure beats the cloth
                                    motorcycle covers that have to let the pipes cool
                                    while your motorcycle gets soaked and provides
                                    no storage or shelter for your harley davidson,
                                    honda, bmw, atv or other bikes. our bike barn is
