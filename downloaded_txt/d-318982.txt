about this book

              in the past two decades we have witnessed unprecedented changes in
              the u.s. beer industry. the emergence of craft brewers and
              consumersâ newfound appreciation for quality beer have resulted in
              what is often called the âcraft beer renaissance.â beer has taken
              on a new excitement and relevancy to the average person. it is no
              longer thought of only in the context of large commercial brewers
              with their mass-marketed beers. the marked increase in the number
              of brew pubs and microbreweries and the burgeoning growth in the
              number of home brewers indicate how deeply brewing beer has
              captured the popular imagination.
            

the brewerâs handbook is intended to provide an
              introduction to brewing beer, and to give a balanced, reasonably
              detailed account of every major aspect of the brewing process.
              this book not only discusses brewing beer on a large-scale
              commercial basis, it has made every effort to address brewing
              practices typically used by craft brewers. thus, its applicability
              extends to home brewers and to individuals working in the brewing
              industry and related fields.
            

              the information in this easy-to-use reference guide is distilled
              from a variety of sources, including scientific literature,
              extension publications, and brewer experience and has the added
              value of numerous citations to more in-depth discussion on many
              topics. the book is thoughtfully organized presenting a seamless
              flow of topics within chapters making it easy to find specific
              information that interests the reader. the brewerâs handbook has
              removed some of the intuition and guesswork in brewing beer. the
              result is a more consistent product of higher average quality
              level. it is written in a language that can be easily understood
              by anyone not having a background in brewing beer. clarity is the
              touchstone that has been employed throughout this book.
