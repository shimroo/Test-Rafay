 freedom 
        of speech 
        regained
 the ninth circuit court rules 
        software is protected speech
        and export controls are unconstitutional prior restraint
here, with no restrictions, posted from 
        within the 9th circuit*,
        is the rsa algorithm in perl:


print pack"c*",split/\d+/,`echo "16iii*o\u@{$/=$z;[(pop,pop,unpack"h*",<> 
            
            )]}\esmsksn0[ln*1lk[d2%sa2/d0<x+d*lmla^*ln%0]dsxx++lmln/dsm0<j]dsjxp"|dc`


if you are in the 9th circuit* please celebrate
        your freedom of speech by posting this on your web site as well. 
if you live where your
        freedom to software as speech is not yet recognized, 
        remember that civil 
        disobedience, as practiced by





                henry david thoreau




                  mohandas ghandi 




                martin luther king jr.



is a grand and noble tradition.
