miss vera’s finishing school for boys who want to be girls
celebrating 25 years of education, transformation, & re-creation



          welcome to the online home of miss vera’s finishing school for boys who want to be girls, the
          world’s
          first transgender academy and most dynamic transformation experience. we are located in new york
          city but
          known across the globe.
        

          i am veronica vera, your dean of students, founder and author. miss vera’s was created in the
          early 90’s
          to serve the needs of the thousands of people presenting as men who have the desire to break through
          gender
          barriers and explore their feminine options, some for a day, others for a lifetime. happily, more
          and more
          couples also call upon me to share my knowledge and guide them
          to
          deeper levels of understanding and trust. providing both a learning experience and a pampering
          session, i
          and my faculty of expert and caring deans are here for you. and we expect you to be the best you can
          be. we’ve
          become so popular that non-trans (cis) women, too, flock to our doors.
        

          what we look for in a student is enthusiasm and a desire to explore. we’ll supply the
          guidance, the
          wigs and the wardrobe in an uplifting environment. we also love to take you out and about to share
          your
          beauty in our wonderful city. with clothing as our props, we support you in your quest for freedom
          of
          expression, so that no matter what your fashion statement, you can be a happier, healthier, sexier
          human
          being. our commitment is to style, from help with putting together your look or looks, as well as
          teaching
          you integrity of lifestyle.
        

          our academy motto is “cherchez la femme”. in french, the verb “chercher”
          means
          “to look to” or “to look for”. it’s perfect for you, dear student, as
          you
          “look to” women for guidance and “look for” the woman inside of you. allow
          your
          femmeself to open you up to the world, not isolate you from it. our lessons are based on a
          philosophy i
          refer to as “venus envy.” i believe that for every woman who burned her bra, there is a
          man
          eager to wear one.
        

          in the years since our academy’s inception, multitudes of gender explorers have visited us
          from across
          the country and around the world. thousands more have read my three academy books. the first bears
          the name,
          miss vera’s finishing school for boys who want to be girls,
          the
          second is miss vera’s crossdress for success. my brand new
          book is
          miss vera's cross gender fun for all for all. for personally
          autographed
          copies,
          please click here. if you are ready to begin your academy transformation,
          i invite
          you to take a tour through our site to learn of the many ways you can participate. if you think you
          might

my fabulous day with miss vera
by bianca



i just needed to thank you. i had an absolutely fabulous day. for weeks i had been thinking up every possible
      reason why i should cancel, including that good old catholic guilt that this was not something one should
      do. i was scared to death. but my experience was wonderful and i am so glad that i did it.
    
until yesterday, i was really just a hairy guy in a dress. only my wife had seen me like that. i would
      usually stay dressed for a few minutes, and then i was done. y'all just made me feel so special. from the
      beginning, you treated me with respect. once i arrived at the academy, i didn't have a second thought more...

amazing grace: how to walk, sit and pose in high heels - a walking class for for all
      genders
take a private lesson or form your own group.
due to popular demand, "how to walk in high heels" as well as, "how to pose for photos"
      may be taken as separate lessons, not part of a transformation package. the integrated group lessons are
      open to all serious students: crossdressers, transwomen and biofemmes or ciswomen (meaning women of
      non-trans experience), united for the same purpose. they are a delightful addition to our curriculum and an
      enlightening experience for all. more...

spouses and significant others

      are you the wife or significant other (s.o.) whose man loves to wear a dress? there is so much more
      understood about the transgender phenomenon and crossdressing than was known at the time i created my
      academy. i encourage you not to live in the dark ages. whether you crossdress or are the partner of someone
      who does, i can help. more...
