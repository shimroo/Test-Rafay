these
            are the good old days
            across the u.s., we have more red fox, raccoon,
            possum, groundhog, and gray fox than we have had at
            any time in the last 100 years, and the numbers keep
            going up. the world of working terriers is better
            too. no generation has ever had more spare time or
            better dogs more easily obtained. no generation has
            ever had easier access to farms brimming over with
            suitable working terrier quarry.

shovels,
            spoons and "berthas"
when it comes to
            serious digging, not all shovels are created equal,
            and not just any shovel will do. find out what to
            look for in a shovel and why a relatively
            easy-to-make "bertha" or "spoon"
            can bring real peace of mind during a difficult dig
            in frozen ground, hard sand, shale or clay.
            directions on making a spoon are given. >> to read more



how
            to use a deben box
a deben box is a
            radio receiver set to a special frequency, while a
            deben collar is a small and very weak transmitter set
            to send a signal at that frequency. simple
            triangulation, a dexterous finger, a little practice,
            and a touch of voodoo are all that is required to
            locate your dog underground, provided you avoid two
            bad locations. >> to read more




size
            matters
if your dog
            cannot get down an old groundhog burrow, it's too
            large to work a fox-dug earth. as barry jones writes:
            "i have not encountered a fox which could not be
            spanned at 14 inches circumference - this within a
            weight range of 10lbs to 24lbs ..." >> to read more 



antibiotics for less
your dog will
            eventually need antibiotics. most major pet
            catalogues sell them without prescription, but you
            have to know what to buy, how to dose, and you must
            follow three simple rules. >> to read more



mistakes and regrets
if you dig, you
            will make mistakes. if you are smart, you will learn
            from them. this list of 20 common problems is a
            litany of what to avoid, a caution about what to
            remember, and an etiquette guide for the new digger.
            >> to read more




health
            care in the field
            since you are the human with the credit card, the
            cell phone, and the keys to the truck, you are in
            charge when it comes to emergencies in the field.
            these emergencies may range from poisoning to traps,
            from suffocation to laceration. whatever the problem,
            the thing that will matter most in the end is
            preparation beforehand and quick level-headed action
            afterward. >> to read more



digging
            a hole
            digging a hole is not quite as self-evident as it
            appears. most groundhog, possum and raccoon are found
            about 3 feet down. holes deeper than 3 feet require
            much larger excavations. >> to read more



go-to-ground and the
            rabbit 
while a 14- or 15-inch tall terrier can
            negotiate an 81-square inch go-to-ground tunnel with
            ease, this same dog will find it difficult to
            negotiate a natural earth which may have an interior
            space of less than 35-square inches – just
            enough room to allow a fox to slip through with
            ease.  where then did these enormous
            go-to-ground tunnels come from? >> to read more





			microchips, tattoos
            & tags
            when out hunting dangle tags cannot be worn.
            microchips, slide tags and tattoos are the answer.

a pictorial history
            of terriers
this
            pictorial history of terriers puts the dog within the
            economic, social and political framework that has
            shaped man, dog, and land alike. a history
            with clickable source readings. >> to read more



from rosettes to ruin
            irish setters,
            once famed at finding birds, are now so
            brain-befogged they can no longer find the front
            door. cocker spaniels have been reduced to
            poodle-coated mops. fox terriers are now so large
            they cannot go down a fox hole. why do show ring
            rosettes so often lead to canine ruin?
