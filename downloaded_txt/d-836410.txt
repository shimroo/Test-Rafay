frequently asked water treatment questions:
what is water treatment?
water treatment is any process that improves the quality of water for a specific purpose. reasons for improving water quality may include drinking, cooking, bathing, or other household activities.
how does water treatment work?
water treatment works by running water through chemicals and filters to remove toxins and hazards. this is done at both the municipal level and at a private level in homes and/or businesses. while a water treatment plant may make water potable again, healthy, clean, quality water can only be truly achieved at the point of service (pos). this is because the water running to your home or business, from the municipal water supply, picks up contaminants from the pipes it runs through. in home water treatment, or pos systems, run your water through an additional set of filters and media that remove contaminants that may have both been picked up from the city water pipes and those that may not have been removed to begin with.
how many steps are in the water treatment process?
there are typically 9 steps in the municipal water treatment process: collection, screening and straining, chemical addition, coagulation and flocculation, sedimentation and clarification, filtration, disinfection, storage, and finally distribution. private water treatment systems for homes or businesses can have anywhere from 3 to 16 filtration stages that work to remove additional contaminants. some of these stages include carbon, reverse osmosis, uv light, and remineralization.
