why is my computer so slow?

what is pc benchmarking?



								

	benchmarking refers to the act of running tests to measure your pc’s performance. important components you might expect typically form a part of this test: your computer’s central processing unit (cpu), graphics processing unit (gpu), and random access memory (ram). but the overall analysis can extend to specific programs on your pc too. these might include microsoft office and adobe products, video games, web browsers, and multimedia file editing software.

							





what does a computer tune up consist of?


it involves cleaning up unnecessary files and deleting unused apps and programs to save valuable hard drive space. our computer cleaner app, avg tuneup, can help you do some of these things automatically. our app can also assist you in boosting your pc’s start up speed and overall performance by temporarily disabling unused programs of your choice. updating your software is an important consideration too, something else avg tuneup can help with. get the latest software patches to support your efforts to reduce annoying crashes and errors, plus fix potential security holes.




are pc tune ups necessary?
