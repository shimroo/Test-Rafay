hey guys,
thanks for running the learning curve camp last week! it was run to your usual high standard and was a very beneficial experience, especially given my lack of currency after the main covid closures. i thoroughly enjoy attending these weeks and really appreciate the time dedicated by the whole team at ramblers, including the instructors, manifest, cafe team, aviation crew/pilots, and support staff. you are all legends and i look forward to coming out again in the near future. 
cheers, adam.
