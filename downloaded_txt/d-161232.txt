your pet's bird cage is his home so you want to make sure you get a cage that suits the needs of your bird and is safe. in order to keep your bird happy and healthy, cage construction, placement, and size should take priority over price when selecting a bird cage.





being extremely social creatures, birds need time out of their cage to interact with their family or "flock" each day. bird stands offer a great way to let your birds to interact with you and your family. bird stands also help you to keep your bird mentally stimulated.

cozzzy bird cage covers provide a warm, dark, secure environment for promoting sleep for any bird. constructed of a revolutionary poly-cotton mixture that is fairly thin and breathable, yet tough for your bird to damage. this material is also non-toxic to birds.








socialized birds love to get out of the cage and go places with you. from a car ride in a bird carriers, wearing a bird harness and going for a ride on your bicycle handlebars, to a hike in a backpack bird carrier, we offer a number of bird travel carriers that let you take your birds out





there are a variety of bird toys available to suit your birds of needs. select bird toys that are appropriate for the type and size of your bird. bird toys that are too small will break under the pressure of large beaks. bird toys that are too large may frighten smaller birds.
