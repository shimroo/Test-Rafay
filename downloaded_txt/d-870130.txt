community outreach
at dps we know that our business success directly correlates to the health and viability of the community where we live and work. as a result, we pride ourselves in our involvement in charitable endeavors, product rebate programs that infuse capital contributions to non-profit (501(c)3) organizations, and volunteer opportunities to help improve the environment around us.
dps has launched a very successful rebate program that has positively impacted several non-profit organizations. the platform is simple: when your organization invests in a new copier system, dps will donate 100% of the net proceeds of the trade-in to a charitable organization of your choice or if you prefer, an organization that we currently support.
