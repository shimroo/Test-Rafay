 over the last 7 years, our family has formed a great relationship with the staff at guarneri house, as we have needed their services with everything from child size cello rental to the purchase of full-size viola and violins, from bow purchases and repairs to instrument checkups and small repairs.  we completely trust their skill and advice.
