namaste'



as defined by mahatma gandhi:

in india when people meet and part they often say, namaste' which means: "i honor the place within you where the entire universe resides; i honor the place within you of love, of light, of truth, of peace; i honor the place within you, where, when you are in that place in you, and i am in that place in me, there is only one of us."
