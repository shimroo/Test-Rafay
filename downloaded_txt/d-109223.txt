“
we chose this neighborhood home in cathedral city because is in a great location to see the entire area: palm springs, palm desert and joshua tree... and we were right! it allowed us to visit friends and enjoy the national park. but we really enjoyed the opportunity to relax as a family. the kids could wake up and enjoy the pool all day, we enjoyed grilling and eating outdoors, etc... being away from the resorts and having our own pool to enjoy was the best!

loved the house and yard, 6 adults 6 kids plenty of space for kids to play and hang in the pool, 9 bikes in the garage were an unexpected bonus. the management company were great and responsive. just across from the polo grounds so lots of wide open space to take a morning walk. house was brand new and spotless, well stocked kitchen with all the stuff we needed. would highly recommend this place.

the house is very nice and very well kept. the home is within a small gate-guarded collection of homes. the house has many amenities, including multiple sitting areas outside...and the property is meticulously maintained. the property is also located a short 10-minute walk from downtown. there is no need for a car. the house and sitting areas can accommodate a lot of people, but it only has four bedrooms + one very small room with two bunk beds. we had 4 couples and one single person (who got a bunk bed). it worked for us, but you should consider this. the colony has three other homes on the property that can be rented or there are hotels nearby for additional guests. the property management company and the site personnel were very professional. as a courtesy we advised that one of the toilets was "running" and they had it fixed with a few hours. we had excellent time and we plan to stay here again in the future. john..

“
this is a beautiful, well cared for party house! impeccably clean and inviting. great location as a starting point for any palm springs adventure you'd like--from brunch in old downtown ps to high-end shopping in palm desert. there were only 3 of us for our visit, but the house would easily accommodate 4 couples, all in real beds. loved the style of the place too. it's a mid-century that's been blown out, but interior design still winks at the 50s and 60s. really could not have been a nicer experience staying there.

was very quiet and relaxing area. staff at mclean was very helpful with any requests.
