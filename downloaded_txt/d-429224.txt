what our clients say


 “thank you to sean for your great organization of my shaun's party. you run a very professional company and i would definitely recommend your wonderful services.
a big thank you to peter our dj, he was on time to set up and was very professional and personable. he did a great job dealing with the noise meter at the venue and shaun was very happy peter kept an eye on it and stayed within the restrictions so the music didn't cut off. the kids really enjoyed the music and the most of all shaun really enjoyed it. peter was also no fuss in packing up and i'm so glad he was chosen to do our party. thanks peter you are a wonderful dj and a lovely person as well.
overall i was extremely happy with your service, getting companies off the internet can be worrying but mega music was fantastic i will definitely use you again.” kerrie18th birthday party, castle hill “just a short note to say a big thank you for the professional job you did with our wedding music at settlers on saturday.
the music was both romantic and personal and created the mood we both dreamed of. everybody commented on the great music played.
thank you for your perfect timing and range of music. we have booked you now on 3 occasions, and we have never been disappointed.” karen & darrenwedding party, settlers “on behalf of nokia telecommunications, i would like to extend our thanks to you and our dj at the park hyatt hotel, the rocks.
we hadn’t had a function with these people before, so were unsure of the music to be played. we left the choice of music entirely up to the dj, and it wasn’t long before he had everyone up dancing. the dj was on time, friendly and willing to play any music that was requested.
once again thanks to the dj and mega music for making the night a great success.” lindapark hyatt hotel, the rocks “thank you so much for providing the music for our year 12 formal. everyone had a wonderful time, and i’m sure the music contributed greatly. it was a wonderful mix and was professionally done.” rosgymea high school “i would like to thank you for the service you provided for my daughter vanessa’s seventh birthday party.
the party was a wonderful success and was enjoyed by the children and adults alike. this was largely due to our accomplished dj.
the dj entertained the 30 children extremely well. his choice of music and the way in which he initiated and participated in the party games was fantastic. watching the dj on the day and later on, the video we took, it was obvious that he genuinely enjoyed entertaining and having fun with the children. many of the adults present also commented on his behaviour and have since contacted me for information on your company for use at their own functions.
thank you again and please pass on our thanks to the dj for giving us all a very pleasant afternoon.” donnabirthday party
