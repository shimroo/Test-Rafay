building a future free from poverty and racism

join us









our work
we lead the fight for economic and racial justice by litigating, shaping policy, and training and connecting people in the advocacy community.








issues

we don’t just fight for communities affected by poverty—we work alongside them, advocating for solutions that are informed by their lived experiences.








advocate networks

we convene and connect advocates, community leaders, and activists across the country so they can share ideas, resources, and get the tools they need.








advocate training

we build the capacity and skills of equal justice lawyers and activists to champion economic and racial justice in their fields.








our impact
from litigating and shaping policies in illinois to training and convening multi-state networks of public interest attorneys, we work with and for the communities we serve to make equal justice and economic opportunity a reality.






our advocates react to the onslaught of trump’s first days



the first 10 days of the trump administration have seen a swift and unprecedented assault on our government, our democracy, and our most vulnerable people. we asked a few of our advocates to share their thoughts on the latest developments and the effect they’re having on marginalized communities.







the shriver center on poverty law responds to the outcome of the 2024 presidential elections



in the face of a deeply polarized nation, this election has brought profound emotions and urgent questions about how each of us is seen and valued. for many of us who identify as people of color, immigrants, members of the lgbtq+ community, or allies in the fight for justice, this moment can feel jarring. but it is also a call to action and an opportunity.







our vp of development on meeting the moment with courage and shared commitment



this is a critical moment in the fight for a more equitable future, with opportunity for all. we spoke with vice president of development erin dowland kabwe about what inspires her to do the work and how donors fuel our mission.







why the middle class takes center stage in this (and all) presidential elections     



 as difficult as that feels, ending poverty is ultimately a policy choice. we already know that measures like the child tax credit and progressive taxation can lift all boats. as we head toward election day, we must remember that when we center poverty in our politics, we all win.

a tale of two americas

on the day we commemorate dr. king’s life and legacy, we rarely confront and discuss his most stinging criticism of america’s grossest injustice: how could a country of such great wealth have so many of its citizens trapped in vicious cycles of poverty? 





building the healthiest region in the country – together 

as the season of gratitude begins, we’re reminded of the strength and importance of our amazing community of leaders, advocates, grassroots activists, and beyond. erin dowland kabwe, the shriver center’s vice president of development, profiles the community memorial foundation, a critical partner that funds necessary work in the pursuit of health and racial equity.

stephani becker, the assistant director of health justice for the shriver center, recently spoke about the significance of the exchange and our continued efforts to expand health care to everyone in illinois.





president and ceo urges us to live our values
