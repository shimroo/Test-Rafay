a medical practitioner’s answering service




most medical practices’ biggest complaint on day-to-day duties is setting appointments and the high rate of no-shows. cosmopolitan medical communications understands that your time is valuable, and we are pleased to offer a service that saves you time and money by reducing your rate of no-shows. in fact, cosmominder lowers no-show rates as much as 70% over practices not using reminders!
cosmominder reminds patients of appointments, which reduces no show rates, and our lab result service allows patients confidential access to their lab results and much more. this service allows for you to reassign staff to other important duties while only costing you pennies per patient.






tigerconnect




utilizing tigerconnect within startel’s software, cosmopolitan medical communications has seen the following results:

enhanced security and hipaa compliance – the integration allows cmc to use texting to quickly send clients patient information while also keeping all message content secure and encrypted so that they and their clients remain hipaa compliant.
improved productivity – staff members are able to communicate with clients via secure sms without having to leave their current software interface, helping increase staff efficiency.
saving time and money – by having one integrated messaging solution, clients can avoid fee increases of 10% – 30% on their bills as there is less live operator time needed to service the account. instead of making a manual phone call to a provider, cmc can simply send a secure text message.

cosmopolitan ranks number one internationally
atsi award of excellence winner
the atsi award of excellence is a measure of quality customer service provided by call centers and answering services around the world. as the leading industry association for answering services, atsi has established a set of guidelines for call centers and answering services to demonstrate their level of customer service. “mystery calls” are placed by a third party company throughout the year to participating call centers, and can be received at any time, twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. the “mystery calls” are scored in several categories including, but not limited to, hold time, correct use of grammar, manners, verification of information given by the caller, and operator knowledge and confidence.
from medical messaging to on-call schedule management, cosmopolitan offers everything you need to keep your operation running smoothly.
