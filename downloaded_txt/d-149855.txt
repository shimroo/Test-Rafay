the organized
					writer's six rules


here are the
                    six rules of every organized
                    writer.... 






1. 
                    work with yourself, not against yourself
understand your
                    personality and what works for you.  do what feels
                    right and what appeals to you—not what seems to “be
                    organized.”



2.
                    focus and pay attention 
when possible, do one
                    thing at a time. do not let your mind wander. picture the
                    goal in your mind, and focus on it.



3.
                    invest your time 
pay attention to how
                    you spend your time. saving just 20 minutes each day gives
                    you an extra 120 hours each year. strive to improve the time
                    it takes to complete a project. be willing to invest a block
                    of time if it will save you hours of frustration later.



4.
                    create habits
you can create a new
                    habit (or lose a bad habit!) in 21 days.
                    for only three weeks of effort, you can create a lifetime of 
                    good habits.



5. 
                    use the right tools
make sure you have
                    the right tools handy when you need them.



6. 
                    work forward
organize for your
                    work ahead.  don't organize what's already finished.
                    you want to save time by going forward not just reorganize
                    what you already have.

					writer resources in the organized writer ebook...



              "the information in the organized writer will help you
              maximize your space and time – and preserve your sanity....although
              it is difficult to form new habits and even the idea of 'getting
              organized' can seem painful, this book makes it sound almost, well…fun.
              give it a try!"
