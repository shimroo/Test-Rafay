          what our students say      






                    truly an amazing college and (objectively) the best. i love the grounds and everyone is incredibly nice.                  



                    lyba, 1st year history                  

 





                    worcester is often known as the friendly college, and it really is true! we have a great community across year groups and everyone is so welcoming.                  



                    maddy, 4th year mathematics                  

 





                    studying medicine at worcester is great! the tutors are incredibly supportive and there is a strong sense of community with all the medics.                  



                    atty, 3rd year medicine                  

 





                    worcester is such a gorgeous college with beautiful study spots and the incredible grounds which make for scenic study breaks.                   



                    hetta, 3rd year english                  

 





                    chemistry at worcester has been an excellent experience so far, i felt settled in instantly through the help of welcoming tutors and students.                  



                    bradley, 1st year chemistry                  

 





                    i hadn’t studied classics before university but the tutors here are so supportive which made it a lot easier.                   



                    miriam, 2nd year classics & english                  

 





                    my favourite thing about worcester is how easy it is to escape from the high intensity of the city in worcester's beautiful grounds.                  



                    sam, 2nd year physics                  

 





                    i know everyone says their college is the best, but worcester really is the loveliest - the grounds, the people, the events, the location, what's not to love!                  



                    shivi, 1st year biology
