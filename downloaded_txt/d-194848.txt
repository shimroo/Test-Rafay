classic cars in history








 

 



this is one of many ford model t's in
                    wisconsin during the 1920's. this classic car was valued
                    for its high axles that could
                    easily maneuver in the quagmire dirt roads prevalent at that
                    time.  this ford model t  was traded in for a more
                    expensive and luxurious chevrolet and then resold by the
                    chevrolet dealership in wisconsin around 1929. 






 

 


 

 


 
henry art's and charles diederich's
                      chevrolet automobile dealership
located in ladysmith, rusk county, wisconsin.  the two partners operated
this chevrolet car dealership from the summer of 1924 until the depression when
the business
could no longer support the two partner's families.  
it was dissolved in
1930. 


 

 


 

 


charlie diederich was born in 1895.  he
                        did not want to be a farmer
like his father.  he loved cars and made a career of buying and selling
them.   his sister theresia was county supervisor of schools and wanted
a car to travel
between the schools.  she went to the bank to arrange a $200 loan for a
car, but the
bank refused it.  the bankers told her they would loan the money if she
wanted to buy
a cow, but they didn't believe in automobiles!




 


 


 


 



charlie died in 1993 so is not here to identify these autos,
                      but they were probably manufactured the year the picture
                      was taken. charlie would travel to detroit and drive the
                      cars to 
                      wisconsin for sale at his dealership there.



 

 


 

 


charlie said shovels and rope were necessary
                        equipment when traveling in the early days. the roads
                        were not paved yet so if it rained you might need to
                        dig out or get pulled out of the mud. early road maps
                        gave directions, such as "turn right at the 
                        old
                        oak tree in front of farmer yasker's place." 
                        they took charlie's licence away when he was in his 
                        nineties
                        after he sideswiped a few cars with his 1950s buick.
                        
                        he still had three buicks when he died at 98 years old
                        - 
                        one that ran and two more for parts.




bill diederich bought this 1927 buick
                      touring sedan after wwii for $40.00. he and two friends,
                      lewis tusken and frank elliott, spent the summer touring
                      northern wisconsin. 
                      bill sold the buick that fall for $140.00.
