from the principal 



liz miller, principal
welcome to dawes middle school, home of the diamondbacks!
it is my honor and privilege to have the opportunity to serve the dawes community as principal. dawes has a dedicated, innovative and caring staff that builds an inspiring culture to serve each student, every day.
it is our vision to continue to create a community of hope, through caring relationships, high quality teaching and a safe school environment to instill confidence and motivation in each student to achieve at high levels in preparation for college and career readiness.
as a community of collaborative educators, we strive to meet the needs of each learner, through high expectations with on time support, daily engagement of each student, increased literacy skills and a positive school culture that honors all voices, individuals and identities.
it is through purposeful teaching, collaborative partnerships with parents/guardians and the dawes community that we will continue to learn and grow together.
we are honored to teach your students and welcome your questions, comments or concerns.
go diamondbacks!
sincerely,liz miller
