preserving flathead fords around the world

founded in san leandro, california in 1963, our club recognizes all ford motor company vehicles made between 1932 and 1953, 
		including ford, lincoln, mercury, commercial vehicles, tractors and other ford powered vehicles built around the world utilizing

2025 early v-8 texas driving tour
hallettsville, texas

						we are glad to finally announce the 2025 early v-8 texas driving tour, based in hallettsville tx.
this will be a back to basics driving tour, inspired by a national driving tour your organizers attended. there will be four days of driving through the texas countryside, mostly on two lane roads. we will visit several historical texas revolution sites on our travels. if you are interested you can join for all four days of touring. for those who prefer a shorter tour we still have something for you, you can arrive on friday and join for just saturday’s fun. saturday’s drive is more local, visiting the painted churches around schulenburg tx. if you want something in between you can join on thursday or friday and stay through saturday.
we are striving for an affordable tour. we are controlling cost so that each participant can do as much or as little as they desire. we have not seen a texas tour done like this before, so we don’t have a prediction on how many people will participate on each day. since we cannot predict the number of participants for any given day, the museum entry fees and meals are not included in the tour registration. registration fee will cover a tour book and a friday evening ice cream social.
there will be a follow up email with tour registration information including cost and a registrar's phone number.
the host hotel is the hotel texas in hallettsville tx, phone 361-798-5900, website: http://www.hoteltexas.net/#/
more information to follow.
thank you,
fred mills
