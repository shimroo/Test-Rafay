                                        green lea saved me after a major screw up by 1800flowers. they received and delivered the arrangement in less than 24 hours and i got a confirmation of delivery. the recipient said it was stunning. i live in colorado so this was always a challenge. i’ll be using green lea from now on.
thank you so much of the excellent service and quality of product.

                                        the recipient loved the gift of flowers and texted me "these flowers made my day and my wife is raving about how beautiful they are!". he lives in voorhees where green lea is and i always believe in finding a great local florist to my recipient rather than using one of the national chains, better flowers every single time. thank you green lea!

                                        the arrangement received for the funeral was 
beautiful. it was bigger than expected and had 
a nice variety of flowers. the order process was easy as i was able to talk to someone at green lea who guided me in choosing the correct arrangement. i will definately be using your services again.  thank you

                                        i ordered online, always scary not sure if the pic is a true representation of the actual item. let me just say, it was beautiful. my dil love it. there was a slight substitution the roses were yellow instead of white but it was not a bad thing at all. i actually liked the arrangement better. but i'm biased towards yellow. thank you so much for making my experience wonderful.

                                        so the person i sent this arrangement to has been a florist for about 40 years. her dad owned a prominentl florist in north east philadelphia and won many awards at the philadelphia flower show. these flowers were for her for her 91 year old dad's passing.  i was worried sending a bouquet to a life long florist..but..to my surprise. she told me even before she know who the arrangement was from, she said to the delivery person. wow these are beautiful...then she sent me a video and message of the flowers and said how beautiful and fresh and how full and fragrant the arrangement was. that tells me how perfect green lea florist is. ty for creating a beautiful arrangement for a very picky recipient who dod nothing but rave about it!! 100 out of 10! thank you
