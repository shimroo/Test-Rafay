as a medium i am able to mentally see, hear, and sense persons in the spirit dimension, and convey messages from them to people in the physical world. although i use my psychic ability to receive communications from the spirit word, i am not a psychic reader or a fortune teller.
my sessions are purely mediumistic with a focus on spiritual guidance, and evidential messages from recognizable personalities in the spirit world.
