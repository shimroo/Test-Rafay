come for the beautiful flowers and plants and stay for the mouth watering wood fired pizza, this little gem in the middle of farm country is a splendid place to stop to get so many variations of plants, flowers or trees for your home or advice on how to take care of the ones you have.  the restaurant is wonderful, many different thin crust wood fired pizzas or amazing sandwiches and refreshing libations all made to order by an amazing fun loving staff, every time i'm in this area i must stop here.

this place is amazing! they sell excellent quality plants that are grown right there, so already adapted to our weather. also really big selection to chose from. the food at the cedar cafe  is homemade, creative and yummy.  staff are very friendly and bob is a endless source of knowledge always willing to share it with others. this place does a great job at educating people and teaching about plants and gardening! always a pleasure to visit!

from wherever your home is, this place is worth the trip! beautiful scenery in and around the area to and from the nursery. the staff is very knowledgeable about flowers, shrubs, trees etc. the cedar cafe is a hidden gem that needs to be experienced.  great atmosphere for a place to eat, relax and enjoy the delicious food. they have many different things on the go throughout the season, from artist in the garden and workshops to give you tips from the pros. can't say enough good things about it! worth the trip for sure!
