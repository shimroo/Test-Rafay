  enchanted creek studios               introduction | art | the studio | me   

            greetings from  enchanted creek studios  
     enchanted creek, nestled high in the santa cruz mountains alongside the central california coast, is the source of many an inspiration. as you explore these pages you'll see the results of a few of them, most of which were created in the studio which is perched on top of a few large boulders above one of enchanted creek's small waterfalls.i, michael dunn, have lived here for over forty years, creating art, working the land, building the studio, and kind of living like a hermit most of the time. the adventures of life have been inspirational and the influence of others does play a part in my art as well as how my life has evolved.

life here hasn't always been easy due to its remoteness, but it's a beautiful place and it offers me the the peace and quiet to help my art evolve in a natural progression. sometimes the winters are rough, with floods and an occasional snow, heavy winds, or an earthquake, but those are often the times when i get the most work done inside, and when i have the opportunity to create some of my favorite pieces. life is short and so i try to make each day a masterpiece. 

i hope you enjoy this site and find something that makes your day a little better. this site evolves in spurts as i get more and more of my work posted, so check in from time to time and see what's new. if you like, feel free to email me with any comments or suggestions.   thanks for the visit,
  michael                                                                     art   - this will lead you into the world of creation in which i dwell. you will see that i work in a variety of media, including bronze sculpture, two-dimensional art, digital art, woodcarving, jewelry and photography, to name a few.  as you visit my other pages you'll find links taking you to other artworks such as new works and works in progress. if you see anything that you like but would want it a little different i do commissioned work as well.here you'll also find links to my résumé, and artist's statement, and example contracts appropriate for artists and gallery consignments and royalties. all the images you see throughout these pages are originals and are available as note cards or prints. if you are interested in purchasing anything you see on these pages or would like custom designed work in any of the media featured just drop me an email at michael@enchantedcreek.com.  
         the studio  
 this leads into sharing with you, through text and pictures, the studio and home, enchanted creek, which runs alongside it, the mountains that surround it, and the setting in which i live and work here in santa cruz county, california. within time it will also be the window through which you may view some of the other interests that make life along enchanted creek so fulfilling. it's a beautiful place and it's a home base as well as a home, meaning i do occasionally travel and visit other natural wonders to gather inspiration for the art i do. in time this section of the site will be the gateway to share some of what i find to be inspirational.            
me 
 here is where you might find out a little about me in both my professional, personal,  and recreational life. this is a catch-all portion of the site for all those things that can't, or won't, fit comfortably in the previous sections. i feel that there are some that want to know what's behind the artist, what motivates, what inspires, and where he is coming from. if this is of interest to you, then this is the section that will answer some of those questions.  i'm an open book, and see no value in mystery, so feel free to ask about anything that seems unclear. i welcome the idea that people might want to know who i really am.              these pages are created and maintained by:  enchanted creek studios                please note: all the images you see and the pages you see them on are covered by copyright laws and it's a lot cheaper to deal with me directly than not. thanks for supporting the rights of the artists.  copyright 1995 - 2021  by michael dunn all rights reserved           enchanted creek studios p o box 455boulder creekcalifornia95006 phone: (408) 395-0881  email: michael@enchantedcreek.com  url:  http://www.enchantedcreek.com        last updated on february 2, 2021
