vr-24  -- the navy transport squadron





vr-24 association


welcome

vr-24 association mission statement:
the association was founded
to preserve the memory of vr-24 and its traditions.  although vr-24 was decommissioned in 1993 after 46 
years of continual operation, the goal of our association is to enable all those who served in or supported 
vr-24 to continue into the future the friendships formed through that service .
 
 

vr-24 historical summary:
the primary mission of vr-24 was to service
the u.s. navy 6th fleet in the mediterranean, and when called upon, u.s. naval forces operating in 
other parts of the world.  vr-24 and its detachments delivered freight, mail, and personnel to u.s., nato, and friendly foreign bases, 
ports of call, and via carrier-on-deck-delivery, to u.s. navy ships at sea.  vr-24 also performed life-saving medical evacuations and 
disaster relief missions throughout its far-flung areas of operation.  to accomplish their mission, 
vr-24 air crews often flew in and out of airports that had only primitive communications and navigation aids,
cargo handling equipment, and ground support services.  missions were often completed 
under the most adverse weather conditions. cod aircrews providing the vital link between land bases and ship at sea, often 
operated at maximum ranges from austere remote detachment sites. the men and women of vr-24 met 
these challenges through hard work, long hours, and innovation. vr-24 soon became
known as the "world's biggest little airline" that could deliver .....................anything,
anytime, anywhere.
 
 

vr-24 web site:
the purpose of the vr-24 web site is to present   
an informal and unofficial history of vr-24. the web site contains photographs and material provided by 
former members and friends of vr-24.  without such support the web site would not exist or prosper.
