        allan hardman is a masterful and passionate spiritual teacher, coach,

        many ways you can heal, renew, deepen, and enrich your life here. you’ll

allan says: "all life is based on relationships, 
        and the most important relationship is the one we have with ourselves. 
        most people have learned to believe lies denying their value and worth 
        in the world. i am passionate about helping us all change how we “dream” 
        ourselves — and learn to love and accept themselves just as we are 
        (and just as we are not!). when we heal our relationship with ourselves 
        the entire world we live in changes. want to change your world? let’s 
        do it!”
allan’s background includes over 
        twenty years as a practitioner and instructor of alchemical hypnotherapy 
        and spiritual psychology, and a ten year personal apprenticeship with 
        miguel ruiz, author of the four agreements and other books. he 
        is a toltec master in that tradition and brings his wisdom of the toltec 
        path to his work with spiritual counseling and emotional healing. allan 
        is the author of the everything toltec wisdom 
        book, and co-author of the 
        heart of healing and healing 
        the heart of the world, with deepak chopra, dean ornish, 
        caroline myss, and many others.
live 
        passionately without attachment to the outcome"
