what should you do after a dui arrest in orange county?

after a dui arrest in orange county, it's essential to take specific steps to protect your rights and potentially improve your legal situation. here's what you should do:remain calm: a dui arrest can be stressful and overwhelming, but losing your composure will only make things worse. it's crucial to stay calm and focused throughout the process.cooperate with law enforcement: be respectful and cooperative with the arresting officer. refrain from arguing or making any statements that could be used against you later.invoke your right to remain silent: you have the right to remain silent and avoid self-incrimination. politely inform the officer that you'd like to exercise this right until you consult with your attorney.avoid field sobriety tests: you have the right to decline field sobriety tests, which are subjective and can be used against you in court. however, in some jurisdictions, refusing these tests at the police station after you have already been arrested can result in immediate administrative penalties, such as a driver's license suspension.request an attorney: as soon as possible, request to speak with a dui lawyer. if you don't have one, ask for a public defender. having legal representation is crucial during this process.document the incident: if possible, try to remember and document any relevant details about the arrest, such as the officer's behavior, any potential issues with the breathalyzer or blood test, or any witnesses present.bail and release: after processing, you may be released on bail or your recognizance, depending on the circumstances. follow all the conditions set forth by the court during this period.contact the dmv: in orange county, you typically have ten days from the date of arrest to request a dmv hearing to challenge the suspension of your driver's license. your attorney can help you with this process.avoid discussing the incident: refrain from discussing the details of your arrest with anyone other than your lawyer. statements made to friends, family, or on social media can potentially be used against you.seek professional legal advice: consult with an experienced orange county dui lawyer at braden & tucci. we can review your case, explain your rights, potential defenses, and guide you through the legal proceedings.





why should you hire braden & tucci for your dui case and dmv hearing?

your choice of legal counsel is not a decision to take lightly. the attorney you choose can mean the difference between excellent results or real complications. if you want to be fully informed about your legal rights and you want attorneys who will fight for your rights, (and not a dui broker/dump truck who is just going to take your money and plead you out), call us. we will aggressively represent you both in your court trial and at the department of motor vehicles hearing.braden & tucci will give your case the personal attention it needs. your problem is our problem and we will handle your case as if it were our own. that is what we would expect and you shouldn’t settle for anything less.





why should you even hire an attorney?

don’t and you’ll guarantee the result. defending yourself in the criminal justice system will be almost impossible and very rarely successful. some legal commentators call drunk driving the guilty until proven innocent exception to the constitution. drunk driving is a complex field of law. the politics and the odds are stacked against you. the penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol and or drugs can be very severe. the penalties may include the following: a jail sentence; a substantial fine; attendance in alcohol abuse classes; suspension, revocation, or restriction of your driver’s license; and/or other penalties. further, pleading guilty to a dui will result in your insurance premiums doubling and even tripling over the next several years. often the fines are not as financially draining as the rise in insurance costs.a drunk driving arrest triggers two separate legal actions against you. one is the criminal action. the other is the dmv civil action to automatically suspend your license. often with skilled and aggressive representation, it may be possible to have the charges dropped or reduced without the expense of trial. however, we prepare every case as if it were a trial case. obviously, not every case is a trial case. but we prepare every case that way for two reasons:in case it is a situation where we are going to trial, we’re ready.it is the best way to ensure a possible reduction or dismissal of the charges before trial.either way, the client has been afforded quality, aggressive representation which will in turn ensure the best possible result. if your case is filed as a misdemeanor, the law permits me to attend all of the court appearances on your behalf. you won’t have to miss time from work and you don’t have to suffer the stress and anxiety of appearing in court. it is quite possible that i will be able to resolve your case to your satisfaction without you ever having to set foot in the courtroom. remember the more experience your attorney has with dui cases, the better your outcome and the less chance you as the client will have a negative experience from the system.





why should i talk with an attorney?

								the reason you are on this website is that you already aware of the need to speak with and possibly hire an experienced dui attorney with a proven track record. it is possible that the police may have violated your rights or committed some error that could result in the charges against you being reduced or even dismissed. therefore, it is very important that you speak with us as soon as possible after your arrest.
