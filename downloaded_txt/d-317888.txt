best road-trip books

we've assembled a quick run-down of a few of our favourite road-trip books in the hope they inspire and feed your wanderlust.









ford focus active review

several times during a 500-mile round-trip to cornwall in the new ford focus active, i noticed cars would often become âstuckâ in its blind-spot.  after it happened for the sixth time, i came to the conclusion people were slowing down to get a better look.
ford, focus






mazda cx-30 review

the mazda cx-30 slots neatly in between the cx-3 and cx-5, and borrows much from the well-received mazda 3, most obviously its updated kodo design philosophy and its edgier, wedgier snout. for our money, that makes it one of the more distinctive suvs out there.
mazda, cx-30






ds3 crossback review

pythagoras would have absolutely loved the ds3 crossback; nearly every surface, both inside and out, is littered with triangles and geometric shapes.â whether that works for you is, of course, entirely a matter of personal taste, but there are certainly some elements i found to be strangely appealing.
ds, ds3






toyota hilux invincible x review

there was a time when if you wanted a new pickup you'd head to your nearest toyota dealer and simply order a hilux. trouble is, other manufacturers have since cottoned on, and with even mercedes getting in on the act, toyota has to keep ahead of the curve or risk losing their most utilitarian crown.
toyota, hilux






ford focus st estate review

much has been written about the new ford focus st hatchback. the thing is, itâs the estate that interests us, because as well as being fans of fast fords, we brits love a good wagon.  and this is a very good wagon indeed.
ford, focus






new ford ranger review

gone are the days when a pick-up could be constructed from little more than a few bits of pig iron perched atop some cart springs.  perhaps mindful of that, the new ford ranger is now laden with more safety gizmos and connected features than ever before.
ford, ranger






kia xceed review

it would be easy to brand the new kia xceed as little more than a regular ceed hatchback with a suspension lift. that would rather miss the point, however, and as a measure of how seriously kia takes this latest edition to its range, consider this: with the exception of the front doors, every single body panel is new.
kia, xceed






volvo xc90 b5 mild-hybrid review

honouring its commitment to offering an electrified version of every model in its range, the volvo xc90 has been updated for 2020 with a new b5 mild-hybrid powertrain that sees the familiar 2.0-litre twin-turbodiesel joined by a 10kw electric motor powered by a 48v battery. read our review to see if the xc90 b5 makes for a worthy update.
volvo, xc90






lexus ux review

at first glance, the lexus ux seems to have an awful lot going on.  that's deliberate, lexus reasons, having identified a group of customers they're calling 'urban explorers' (hence ux) who want something a little different from their compact suv.
lexus, ux






mitsubishi l200 series 6 review

make no mistake, this is one imposing truck.  the l200 has always been a hard-working truck for hard-working people, and mitsubishi knows their customers well.  it should be no surprise, then, that for this sixth generation theyâve focused on making it tougher and even more capable.
mitsubishi, l200






honda hr-v sport review

at first glance, the honda hr-v shouldnât really work.  crossovers and suvs are all about family practicality, arenât they?â  sportiness and performance considerations come second.  well, honda thinks you can have both, and having spent time squirting a honda hr-v sport through the hampshire countryside, we discovered that it makes for a strangely likeable mix.
honda, hr-v






ford ranger raptor review

almost since the ford ranger was launched, enterprising retailers have been merrily bolting on a range of rufty-tufty accessories to attract the growing number of people who feel a chunky 2.5-ton pick-up truck just isnât bad-ass enough for them. now the new ranger raptor is about to put them all to shame.
ford, ranger
