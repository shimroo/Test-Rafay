sample of film transfer
here is a sample of the quality of a video kitchen film transfer.






8mm film to digital/dvd
8mm film usually comes to us in 3 sizes - if you’re unsure about the exact length, we will measure it out and form a rough estimate at the front desk. when the order is completed we will adjust the invoice for the amount of film we ended up running.3 1/2 inches for a 50ft reel, about 3.5 minutes long5 3/4 inches for a 200ft reel, about 12 minutes long7 inches for a 400ft reel, about 24 minutes longnote: some older kodak reels may say 25ft on them.  these were originally 16mm double rolls.  that means that half of the film was shot, flipped and the other half was shot, then split in processing to one 50ft reel.  it can be confusing, but the words “double reel” and the 3 1/2 inches mean it is really a 50ft reel.
