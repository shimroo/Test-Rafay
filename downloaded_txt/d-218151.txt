instant payday network reviews homeless man makes $4k plus more reviews and how to drive traffic





hi ya'll from west texas. today i am going to give my review and honest opinion on the instant payday network as well as the reviews of many others. i want you to have not only my hones opinion but also the honest opinion of others, so this post is about many, many instant payday network reviews. at the bottom of the page, after all these videos i will give you an over view of what instant payday network is about and how to drive traffic, generate leads, and build a list for the system, also referred to as ipdn.

if you want to know a great way to get paid to give away an awesome free lead generating system that you can use with ipdn or any other business go to http://dotcompaydays.com and watch the awesome videos there. hint: 100% commissions, unheard of in the affiliate marketing industry.

so without further adu, lets dive right it...

i am going to start with the experience of this homeless man who makes $4k per month with ipdn living in his truck...




here is the text under the video at youtube:

" i am a homeless guy with two dogs, my babies kyzak & rydik, and we 
recently lost our home because the new owners decided to not allow big 
dogs. i am sitting in front of the coffee shop using the hot spot to 
upload this video proof that i am making money with this even homeless. 

if
 you want an easy foundation to start from, and start earning an income 
online, then this is it folks. check it out, it is free, however the 
doing of your offers part which is a must to get your affiliate status 
to earn commissions may cost, but it is less than 20 dollars. i paid 12 
dollars, and make money with this almost every day. and i am homeless. 
so if i can do it you can do it."

get the free ipdn system now... 

the second review of a woman who promotes ipdn passively not actively...




get the free ipdn system now...

here is a video review and income proof for a lady named caryn petty...




as you can see ipdn works for people from all walks of life, here is one more...








and one more income proof video just to top things off before we move on to what ipdn is all about and how you can get this system for free, earn money from it and how to drive traffic and build a list that you can promote offers to.




okay, so now you know what's possible for the average joe, or jennie (like me :) ) as the saying goes. i just started the ipdn system and i am really excited about it.

so lets move on to what the ipdn system is. the ipdn system was started by a very nice guy named jeff buchanan who found himself broke and living back at his mother;s house. he had a desire to succeed in his own online business and he knew that if he gave enough people what they wanted then he would eventually get what he wanted too...

so he started the ipdn system to help people just like me and you to start out on line in a way that was cheap enough and easy enough that we could succeed, and earn while we learn.

alot of people have bashed jeff, saying it's a scam, it's not really free, etc. but let me ask you something, how many guys do you know  who are willing to give you a high converting website and system to build a list and income, to pay for the hosting and maintenance of that website, and to do it absolutely free, never earning a dime off of you?

i have not met very many men other that jeff who is willing to do this for you.  the only other system that even comes close is the free lead system, totally awesome as well and a great way to build a list fast and free.

the idpn system is free, yes, to qualify to earn commissions you have to complete the trail offers at my cash freebies and double my cash freebies, but let me tell you, i have found systems identical to jeff's ipdn that charge $30 per month just for the marketing and lead generating system that jeff gives you for free from ipdn.

so could such a great guy, who is willing to give this away for free and not earn a dime except from those whom he directly refers be pushing a scam? my gut tells me no way. meet jeff in the video below as he tells his story of beginning ipdn...





as you can see jeff is just a normal guy, an incredibly nice guy who earns an incredible living online. personally i do not know why anyone would want to bash such a nice person? weird, but anyhow, it takes all kinds to fill the world!

back to ipdn. i just joined not too long ago and will be posting my own success video soon, but in the mean time, get your own free ipdn system now, and when you sign up through my link i will offer you the opprotunity to send 500 us visitors from a highly responsive  us traffic source to your ipdn page, on me, that means i will pay for it.

to qualify for this offer watch for the emails i will send you after you join through this link, and when i mean free i mean you will not pay me a cent, just qualify for ipdn and one other simple little thing and then you can email me as i will direct you to in my email, so watch for my emails and open to find out.

don't wait, join ipdn now...

naked beauty joey atlas symulast review - my take





hi and welcome every one to my review of the naked beauty symulast cellulite exercises program from personal trainer joey atlas. i am going to tell you my story, my struggle with the cellulite on my hips, thighs and butt, but first i have a video review for you...




okay, so i will tell you my story now. for your reference the video above can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2at3ljowd2g&list=uukvut4w7yqnj_3impcp2loa  if you have followed me at all you may already know that i have had 5 children and despite being a strick low carb dieter for the past 10 years and keeping a good figure i still have struggled with that stubborn cellulite on my hips, and back side that is just hideous and makes it embarrassing to wear shorts or a bathing suit.

so after some good research i finally found the naked beauty home cellulite treatment exercises and i am super excited. the reviews are from real women and you really need to watch joey's video explaining why the symulast method is the only real at home treatment for cellulite (memo to us girls: the creams and lotions just don't work, and joey explains why in his video) click on the video below to watch how joey explains what the real root cause of cellulite is and more importantly - what the cure is...




click on the video above to watch, it will really surprise you!

okay, so just what is symulast? well joey deifnately explains it best in the video above, but i will do my best to give you a brief explanation here as well. symulast stands for synergistic muscle layer stimulation. 

it is basically the sequence, form, and tempo that are necessary to tone the underlying muscles that are not toned and are causing the skin to sag - what we call cellulite.

i wish i would have taken before and after pictures but since i did not i will share with you nicki's photos to show you just how effective the naked beauty method is:




as you can see her results are just amazing. i am super excited because joey has clients getting amazing results in just 28 days!

here is another photo of a lady who has used the naked beauty method:



this photo is from charmaine t who was super excited to report "20 years of cellulite almost gone in just 23 days!"

these are just amazing results. if you want to find out more about the naked beauty symulast cellulite exercises you can watch the video above by joey atlas or click here.

hope this review is helpful and informative and have a good day ya'll from west texas!

-jen

cellulite exercises from top fitness expert tone saggy butt





okay, okay, this is an embarrassing topic for me (actually it's an embarrassing topic for any women, but unfortunately it is a very real topic that needs to be discussed. i am talking about cellulite, more specifically cellulite that affects 85% of all women on their hips, butt, and thighs.

yes, i have it and if you are a woman, chances are you do too, so there's no need for me to point out to you that it's down right embarrassing to be seen in a bikini. well as embarrassing as it is to admit that i have it i am going to do so here for the sake of telling you that i have recently started a cellulite exercises routine by joey atlas. i am very excited about doing these exercises because joey has raving reviews from hundreds of women around the world whom he has helped through his symulast exercises program. hundreds of women have raved about how joey has helped them to get rid of their horrid cellulite through these exercises.

well naturally of course i want the latest and greatest thing that has the best reviews and is from an expert himself and that is what i have found with this system.

i started it two weeks ago and already i am seeing less dimples in my cellulite. you can really feel the exercises working when you start doing them yet they are not hard of strenuous. joey shows you how in his video and it only takes 15- 20 minutes about 3 times a week.

that means even a full time working mom like me can fit these into my jam packed schedule.

what about you? what are your experiences with cellulite and what have you found to combat it? i would love to hear from you please leave your comments below.

shabby chic decor tips and reviews





i love the shabby chic look, and do every room in my house with shabby chic white furniture for a cottage decor look. okay, so i have been shopping around lately for a new dresser and found several options online. these have to meet my criteria however, which include...

--a creamy or soft white look - no shocking hospital white here. the piece of furniture that i choose for my boudour must "set the mood" subtlety with it's softness. this will make my rooms warm and inviting and still give that clean and fresh feeling that white furniture gives to a room.

--if not a pure white then an ivory or antique white. it has to be close enough in color to my other furniture that it will look nice and be a welcome fit.

--not too wide. i do not have room in my bedroom for a long dresser, something taller that takes up less floor space this time around.

--not too gobby. yep, believe it or not some of the shabby chic style furniture out there looks too gobby to me. i want something clean an nice looking with a touch of class. elegant - that is what i am looking for in a piece.

-with or without appliques of carvings. this is not so important to me as it used to be. i used to have appliques on every piece, not so much anymore. as i said, it can be over done.

-mush have vintage style glass knobs. this is still a must for me as it gives the feel and look that i am looking for.

sadly, in my shopping around i have found that most white dressers, night stands, book cases, chairs, and other furnishings that are white are sold as children's furniture. alas, it is difficult to find a great looking headboard or bed frame  in the shabby chic style that is any bigger than a full because the assumption is that adults want something wood colored and do not want white furniture. but more and more people who are looking for a vintage, shabby, or cottage style decor are turning to white furnishings and i wish bed makers would realize this and provide beds in king's and queens for those of us who do our decor in white.

so what bout you? have you also found it difficult to find white furnishings for the bedroom for adults? if you have found any great resources please share them here.

the crazy lady at work





i work a full time job, and i am known at work as quite the zany and crazy lady. i tell my co-workers often that i feel like running through the store, screaming and waving my hands like a child just for the fun of it. yeah, i know, that would get me fired, and probably in the nut house too, but it's like i always say; sanity is way over rated!

;)

well you know we have to get our kicks somehow. anyhow, the weather here is good today (no dust storms) and if you follow me in any other places you know by now that i have many interests. today i am at the public library because the internet is painfully slow at my house and the sears guy is there and it was just better to come to the library.

i had to run into town anyway to run some errands so it worked out fine.

anyhow i am working on some keyword research today with my long tail pro platinum and i am finding all kinds of great information for many keywords. the best feature i like about this software is the ability to see how competitive it would be to rank for a specific keyword term. this is that priceless feature that saves me loads of headaches and time.

if you are into internet marketing of niche website building then i highly recommend this software.

have a great day!

going wild today





this is my first blog post to this blog. how is everybody? today is thursday and i am off work so it is a great day to start this blog.

it is very windy and there is a terrible dust storm here in west texas where i live. i hope everyone else driving today did not have to battle the dust storm as bad as i did. on one part of the road the dust was so heavy i could see maybe 20 feet in front of me. still it was crazy to drive out today i suppose as i did not have to work and really just needed to run some errands.

the dogs have been going wild with barking because of the dust that is blowing everywhere and it is going to be alot of sweeping off the porch when the wind dies down.

so the whether here is definitively very wild today. i am just a regular country girl just moved here a year ago. i lived in arizona before that. still it reminds me of home because where i lived, actually where i grew up in northern arizona we had pretty bad dust storms too every spring so it feels somewhat like home.

the major difference is here it is so flat! back home we lived in the good old rocky mountains, so i am used to breathtaking scenery. there is nothing here for scenery but the big texas sky and oil pumps.

i don't know if you would consider oil pumps and sage brush as scenery but the sunrise and sunset are amazing.

okay so more about myself. this blog will be a random mod podge of my various interests. some of those interests include dancing, singing, self improvement of any and all kinds, romance, low carb dieting, tca facial peels (which i do myself at home, so follow along) learning to play the piano, home and family organizing, and how things are here where i live and at my job.

i tend to ramble a lot when i write so if my posts are somewhat random and varied you will have to excuse me sometimes.

well toodles for now.
