dvd review - tsui hark's detective dee: mystery of the phantom flame

28 aug 2013



sweet lord, it has been some time since i last posted a review on this site!
the period mystery action movie detective dee has the fortune of being my first review and much of the credit must go to tsui hark for producing a surprisingly engaging and coherent suspense story. this can be largely attributed to excellent performances from the cast and top quality action choreography by samm hung

dvd review - tony jaa in ong bak 3

29 dec 2010



it was no surprise when ong-bak 2 failed to reach the dizzy heights of the original, but was ong-bak 3 a fitting conclusion to the trilogy or an anti-climax?....

dvd review - luc besson's district 13 ultimatum

29 dec 2010



district 13 (2004) was one of the surprise hits of the decade and it is no surprise to see a seqel emerge. given it was produced five years after the original, could cyril raffaelli and david belle reproduce their magic from the original?

dvd release - ong bak 2: the beginning (released 15th feb)

09 march 10



was ong bak 2 (ob2) the most anticipated martial arts  movie in the last decade? â€“ almost certainly yes! 
the original ong bak was a  genre defining launch-pad for martial artist tony jaa and the thai action-movie  scene. it gained worldwide distribution and remains a hugely successful dvd release. ob2 was an even more ambitious project  both in terms of scale and for tony jaa in particular, who took on the  directing reins in this period epic. before ob2 reached the studio there had  been several years of delay, confusion, breakdowns on tv (by tony) and rumours  of triad meddling; so it came as a relief to everyone when it eventually hit  the screens in the latter part of 2009.

dvd release - shaw brothers back in the uk! - released on 23rd march

27 feb 09



after a period of several years with no  shaw brothers releases from momentum pictures they are now in the process of introducing dragon dynasty discs to the uk. the first two titles from the legendary shaw brothers stable are obvious choices, both 36th chamber of shaolin and king boxer are genre classics that will no doubt sell like hot cakes!

both will be part of the fantastically remastered celestial collection and packed with loads of extras (including a tarantino commentary on king boxer). these titles are not to be missed.
