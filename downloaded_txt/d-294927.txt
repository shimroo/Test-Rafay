an archive presenting and documenting some important and
original contributions made before 1976 by 20th century
women.




whose faces are shown above? 
the graphic show the faces of some physicists spanning three
generations.  click here for their
names.
they are among the 83 women for whom data is archived in this website.


what can you find in this archive? 
descriptions of important contributions to science made by
83 women in the 20th century. these
are documented by the original papers in which the discoveries were
first reported.
  in addition there are historical essays and other historical
documents not
easily available elsewhere. 


where are 17th, 18th, and 19th century women?

 women in those centuries did not have access to
institutions of higher learning. their participation in scientific
discovery was not possible. there are some notable exceptions such as
émilie du châtelet, sofia kovalevskya, and mary somerville
but generally women' intellectual development was thwarted.  brief historical account.. 


why only three quarters of the 20th
century? 
by the last quarter of
the century there were many more women working as physicist than in
earlier years, too many for this website. 
each woman in this website has been carefully and thoroughly
researched, and the descriptions of
their work vetted by distinguished colleagues who served as field editors. 


 why only 83 women?
we
believe there are more women whose contributions should be recognized
but time and resources did not allow for further additions.
this work would not have been possible without the generous support of
the alfred p. sloan
foundation, the american
physical society, the university of california, ucla physics and
astronomy department, the laboratories of nist, joan palevsky and other
generous donors.


how can we browse
this archive? 
by the name of an
individual woman physicist chosen, for example, from the list on the
right or from the  annotated photo
gallery 
or from her quotation  in her own words or
by using the  search engine provided. 


and then?  
follow the clues and click away! if you desire further
reading,
we suggest some books and articles on the webpages and have included a
very large 
reference database in this website.
