-i didn't have any problems. it was easy to compete the classes as soon as possible. books were mailed to me out of state when i was out of la due to covid. came quick.
-lot of answers were online to the course exams, obviously. so if you're wanting to just get the courses over with go ahead.. however, you gotta actually study and prep once you get official date for the official licensing exam through cal dre. but getting an exam date could take ages... so i waited to bust out the studying couple weeks before exam. there is no avoiding learning the material nonetheless.
-i feel like this school was cheap, always answered phone. found on graham stephen's youtube so had small discount. the school also let me know i didn't need to buy a third class with them because i explained i had a business law class already from csun. appreciated that.

excellent communication from mike. he was very helpful with exam tips. i passed the exam on the 1st try, no problem. don't let the 40% passing rate discourage you. if you study and if you do all the practice flashcards, quizzes and exams, you will pass. some of the questions from the practices were similar to the ones on the exam. when i need ce hrs, i will sign up with this school again.

i am giving premier schools a 5-star rating. i received excellent help from their staff being a newcomer to this school. no matter how many times i had to ask a question they would be there with patience to help me with clear understanding. i would highly recommend this school to anyone needing to renew their license, or to obtain their license to further the education. it's really nice when you have someone there to assist you and enjoy doing what they do. hands down i like the school had a great experience with them and i definitely recommend them to anyone who needs them.

i used premier schools in 2007 to get my real estate license. passed the exam the first time! was so impressed that i used them for my brokers exam too! passed the brokers on 12/18/19 on my first attempt too and was first done! without premier schools there is no way i would have passed those tests so easily! their study material is top notch and right on point! thanks for helping me breeze through the state exams!

premier schools provided the real estate courses that assisted me to successfully obtain my broker's license in 1989. i have used premier for all my subsequent renewal course requirements. the material is concise and very well presented. i would highly recommend premier school real estate courses to real estate professionals and those thinking of entering the real estate industry. excellent material and service!

i have been dealing with premier schools and mike and his crew for over 20 years. i have referred and directed so many agents (over 140) for licensing and 45 hours credits.
                    i was broker officer for over 30 corporate operating real estate companies.
                    we all got fabulous customer service and key was the practice questions and courses offered.
                    cannot get better help anywhere with your real estate needs.

i have used premier schools study materials and tests for renewal of my california real estate broker's license for many years. i have always found them to be easy to work with and very fairly priced. the on-line study guides and practice tests were easy to access and once completed, i passed the final tests easily. i highly recommend premier schools for your licensing requirements.

iâve take my continuation courses with premier schools for the past 3 years. their online courses are very well organized and easy to access. iâd recommend premier schools to students looking to obtain or renew their license.
