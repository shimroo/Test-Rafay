the dpn archives



originally digitized by former editor dan landrum, the dpn archives are now hosted by the internet archive at archive.org!the internet archive is a non-profit digital library with an ambitious mission: to provide universal access to all knowledge -- the books, magazines, web pages, audio, television and software of our shared human culture. they provide free access to researchers, historians, scholars, people with print disabilities, and the general public.you can also find links to individual issues by clicking “archives” in the menu, or visiting dpnews.com/archives. digital dpnfirst things first - don’t worry! the print edition of the magazine is not going anywhere!! but we are working diligently to produce an online, digital version of dulcimer players news. this version will be much more than a pdf replica of the print magazine. i am trying to balance rolling it out as soon as possible with getting things right the first time. i want to avoid introducing any major changes shortly after going “live.” my hope is that a digital version of dpn will make not only the magazine, but also dulcimers in general, more accessible to different audiences. for example, google chrome can automatically translate live text, so international players can read the articles, too, and text to voice tools can help the visually impaired get the most out of the magazine. finally, without the added costs of print production, a digital-only subscription will be a more affordable option. we have just begun testing the new platform. if you are interested in checking it out and giving feedback as we work out the gremlins, please email me at editor@dpnews.com. i’m looking for input from both tech-savvy and tech-not-so-savvy readers!
