breeding  boricuanismin usa-ricans


by irene f. vázquez (mrs. don jíbaro)


hen i saw the movie, 

						my big fat greek wedding, i realized how 
					other cultures can identify with it. a group of people can 
					immigrate to another country and still bring their culture 
					with them, bring up the next generation, their kids to be 
					like them loving the food, the language and marrying into 
					their own race. now, those whove seen the movie, know that the parents 
					seemed to overdo their culture by ignoring the ways of the 
					land that they live in or looking at the other ethnic groups 
					in a negative way. the heroine of the movie seemed to look 
					into the american way of life wistfully rather than into her 
					greeks familys. yet, she recognized and understood the 
					traditions  she spoke the language and ate the food. she 
					knew the folkloric ways that identified them. she marries a 
					non-greek who embraces her culture, seeing the uniqueness of 
					it and makes it his own.

how pedro albizu campos 
got a bad deal(september 12, 1891  april 21, 1965)





						pedro albizu 
campos was 
a puerto rican attorney and politician, and the leading figure in the puerto 
rican independence movement. gifted in languages, he spoke six; graduating from 
harvard law school with the highest grade point average in his law class, an 
achievement that earned him the right to give the valedictorian speech at his 
graduation ceremony. however, hostility towards his mixed racial heritage would lead to his professors 
delaying two of his final exams in order to keep him from graduating 
on time. during his time at harvard university he became involved in the irish 
struggle for independence.

the 
ponce massacre of 1937

...was a police slaughtering over a peaceful civilian march, taking place in 21 
march 1937 at 3:15 pm, in palm sunday, ponce, puerto rico, that killed 19 people 
and wounded over 200 others. it is the largest massacre in puerto rican history. 
the march had been organized by the puerto rican nationalist party to 
commemorate the abolition of slavery in puerto rico by the governing spanish 
national assembly in 1873. the march was also protesting the u.s. government's 
imprisonment of the party's leader, pedro albizu campos, on alleged sedition 
charges.

the empty bed
a few years ago i was playing my guitar at 
						home. i came upon this old tango my dad used to quote... 
						la cama vacía" (the empty bed). i remembered the lyrics 
						and went on to sing it as i played. half way through the 
						song i began to weep. i didn't stop playing, and my 
						singing became a cry of sadness.

puerto rican identity: to be or not to be
by don jíbaro 
			the cultural quest for identity is an incredible phenomenon. 
			it has been the theme of  countless works of science, art and 
			literature. one's personal identity can be manifested in any part of the world. all you need is behavior. you are who you are no matter where you stand. we are boricuas when we behave like boricuas;

					all or part of three towns in the northwestern part of the

					being evacuated friday because of fears about structural 
					damage to the nearby guajataca dam. close to 70,000 people 
					could be affected if the 90-year-old dam, which is 120-feet 
					high and can hold about 11 billion gallons of water, 
					collapsed, said puerto ricos governor, ricardo rosselló

hay que eliminar las 
					burocracias y gastos en puerto rico
por dr. edgar león
					el día que se eliminen las burocracias en el gobierno de 
					puerto rico será el día que se recupere la economía y el 
					servicio eficiente para el pueblo. todavía seguimos con la 
					mentalidad que hacen falta cincuenta personas para manejar 
					la solución a un proyecto gubernamental. el gasto excesivo 
					inútil y los costos de la burocracia invisible y excesiva en 
					la isla sigue creciendo sin control.

en la política, la burocracia es como ir nadando en un mar de decisiones

this is the day the 
					lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. psalms 118:24


on july 25, 1898... during the 
                    spanishamerican war, the u.s. invaded puerto rico with a 
                    landing at the southern town of guánica. as an outcome of 
                    the war, spain ceded puerto rico, along with the philippines 
                    and guam, then under spanish sovereignty, to the u.s. under 
                    the treaty of paris, which went into effect on april 11, 
                    1899. spain relinquished sovereignty over cuba, but did not 
                    cede it to the u.s.a.






comerío (spanish pronunciation: [komeˈɾi.o]) is a 
						municipality of puerto rico located in the 
						center-eastern region of island, north of aibonito; 
						south of naranjito and bayamón; east of barranquitas; 
						and west of cidra and aguas buenas. comerío was founded 
						on june 12, 1826. originally named "sabana del palmar", 
						but later changed to comerío, named after a local taino 
						cacique (chief) comerio.

puerto ricans have el cuco...but americans have the bogeyman, a mythical creature 
						used by adults to frighten children into good behavior. 
						whatever you call it, the creature has no specific 
						appearance and conceptions vary drastically by household 
						and culture, but is commonly depicted as a masculine or 
						androgynous monster that punishes children for 
						misbehavior. mexicans call it el cucuy. the "monster" 
						may target a specific act or general misbehavior, 
						depending on what purpose the desired discipline serves, 
						often based on a warning from the child's parents or 
						nanny with something like "you'd better behave or el 
						cuco will eat you". the term "el cuco" is sometimes used 
						as a non-specific personification for terror, and in 
						some cases, the devil.





by the 1960s most train transportation had basically 
						disappeared. behind the building was a big water tank

						as children in the 1950s we played in the abandoned 
						buildings and around the train cars which came through 
						occasionally. ah! the memories! 









castillo el morrothe construction of the 
						fortress and its surrounding walls began in 1539 on 
						orders of king charles v of spain, built under the 
						direction of conquistador diego ramos de orozco and its 
						main purpose was to defend the port of san juan by 
						controlling the entry to its harbor.

the puerto rico 
			flagmainly 
			to suppress the independence movement in puerto rico in puerto rico 
			in 1948, it became illegal to sing the national anthem "la 
			borinqueña" or display of the puerto rican flag in public (gag law) 
			with a penalty of 10 yrs. in prison. the law was repealed in 1957.
the new flag, which consisted of five equal horizontal 
					bands of red (top and bottom) alternating with white; a blue 
					isosceles triangle based on the hoist side bears a large, 
					white, five-pointed star in the center, was first flown in 
					puerto rico on march 24, 1897, during the "yauco"

the importance of garlic

					be there at dinner time. my friends mother cooked the most 
					delicious arroz y habichuelas colorás that i had ever 
					tasted. yummee! that lady could cook! her rice and beans 
					needed no meat! when i asked her how did she cooked such 
					tasty beans and if i could learn to cook like that, she said 
					her secret was culantro y ajo (coriander and garlic) but

chebo's 
						heart of unbeliefwhen 
					i was a kid our neighbor gave a party and invited the whole 
					barrio (hood). once at his house, i noticed my friend chebo 
					was outside by the window, peeking in."come on in, chebo" i said.
					but he said: "no, i wasn't invited." i replied: "but, the whole neighborhood was invited, come 
					in."but chebo insisted: "no, i wasn't invited." so he stayed 
					outside.chebo's heart was hardened by the deceitfulness of his own 
					heart and unbelief. he lived a life of jealousy, envy and bitter remorse 
					because he didn't always get what he wanted, but hated those 
					who did.
"see to it that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief 
					that turns away from a living god." hebrews 3:12




just 
						a note: because of the failure in the enforcement of laws people 
						are doing whatever they want, rather that what they 
						should. they fail to follow the instruction of police 
						officers when stopped for a simple traffic violation. 
						they run when nobody is chasing them... such lawlessness 
						will backfire and prompt the government to say: "that's 
						it! --- no more freedom." this will lead to them tightening the grip they already have on the 
						citizens leading us to a totalitarian degraded world 
						where you will have a microchip embedded in your wrist 
						in order to be able to buy, sell or go about your 
						business. so obey the local laws of the land... it's for 
						your own good!




you can tell that the hut was hand made, with materials 
						found all around. those were simple days. they didn't

						drum full of water.




racial 
						profilingracial profiling is the act of suspecting or targeting a 
						person of a certain race on the basis of observed 
						characteristics or behavior, rather than on individual 
						suspicion. more commonly in the united states, racial 
						profiling is referred to regarding its use by law 
						enforcement at the local, state, and federal levels, and 
						its use leading to discrimination against people in the 
						african american, native american, asian, latino, arab, 
						and muslim communities of the u.s. in european 
						countries, the term "ethnic profiling" is also used 
						instead of racial profiling.one of the main reasons we have racial profiling in the 
						inner city is not just the color of the skin as it is 
						the continuity of offenses done by those ethnic groups 
						in the past. if youre hispanic and you spit on the 
						church floor, then all hispanics are now church floor 
						spitters. so, you must live in a way that we dont get 
						blamed for what you do. 





puerto rico 
						has another problemit's true, even before the hurricane, puerto rico had a big

						rican leadership and that maybe the reason why it pr 
						can't get any help from the usa.

a glimmer of hope... the strength that comes to you when 
						you know you have to move on forward, beyond your 
						inabilities and obstacles, towards that prize of 
						satisfaction of a job well done.







our lives are determined by our choices. 
						we must 
					then, choose wisely. wisdom comes from knowing how to use 
					the information and experiences for our own good, most 
					people are not wise. the scriptures offer wisdom by giving 
					us advice and telling us about how fools make the same 
					mistakes over and over (ex: book of proverbs, psalms,etc).
						folks don't want to be told what to do or how to do it. they 
					repeat their mistakes. i choose to give encouragement and 
					motivate my friends towards a better life. we all can use 
					that kind of friendship. most people appreciate and respect 
					me. that's encouraging. someone who's there that makes you 
					feel comfortable telling them your problems, listening to 
					you. the world is not going to change to my liking, so i have to 
					learn to live in it... with all the idiots and crazies... 
					and wise men (if you can find them). my wife and my children 
					are happy and successful because we have always make time 
					for them. there's no greater love that a man laying down his life for

					treasure them, because they are rare!!! 


the 
					birth of fake news
by 
					don jíbaro orlandoin the 1960s jimi hendrix wrote a song about 
					extraterrestrials visiting earth... he quipped: "thank you. 
					as you well know, you just can't believe everything you see 
					and hear, can you?" so today, we hear and see about wars, rumors of wars, 
					people dying, discoveries and a myriad of news. the term 
					"fake news" or "alternative news" comes to mind. it's 
					everywhere and we have to do a bit of research before we bet 
					our lives on them.news is a big business and news people must have 
					something to say in order to sell information. some news 
					sources have opted to fabricate news in order to sell 
					sensationalism. sometimes you read about some celebrity that 
					"bought a new rug" !!! time magazine recently twitted an 
					article about what some famous people eat or breakfast  
						
let's live, therefore, to lift up the reputation of our 
					culture through good works... the culture that others sadly 
					continue to defile. it's up to us to thrive and bring back 
					the honor and respect. think about it. honor and respect.





the religions of the world

						a 
						man falls into a hole and realizing he can't get out 
						desperately calls out for help. he hears someone walking 
						nearby:

buddah --- "use the precious human life and the 
						intelligence and mind that you now possess for the 
						understanding that because you create your own 
						suffering, you can also create your own true liberation 
						and a way to get out of the hole." he then walks away...


shiva-vishnu --- "there is one god who manifests 
						in the form you choose and he is also within you now! so 
						choose the form wherewith god shall deliver you from 
						that hole." he then walks away...


islam --- "total submission to allah as ordained 
						in quran and sunnah of prophet muhammad sallam's 
						islam... once you desire such favor to kill 
						some infidels allah might help you out of the hole." he 
						then walks away... 

jesus --- "give me your hand so i can pull you

ask 
					don jibaro
dear don jibaro,why is it that there are some boricuas that think they are 
					white even though 94% of us are mulatto, trigueño, negro, or taino. i know we are a mixture of 3 races (african, taino, 
					and spaniard). many boricuas are ignorant of their roots. 
					what do you think? thanks, jesse ramos
dear jessie...well... white is erroneously equated with "better", and i 
					noticed that you've anglicized your name which is probably 
					josé, right?anyway, my mother (rip), who was from corozal, pr was blond, 
					had green eyes and had no idea what a white person is, as 
					opposed to a brown or black, et al. it's all in the 
					upbringing. if your father told you that you can go 
					"through" walls, you're gonna end up with a lot of bumps on 
					your forehead and a broken nose many times over (unless you 
					get the hint) you are what you are, and what you are is 
					based on how much you know about your roots, more than your 
					upbringing... i wrote an article on puerto rican identity 
					that will shed some light on this dark matter. (pun 
					intended)

last night, after the usual discussion as to how these dudes
