how it works?



click the green button "create new user"
fill out the form fields for your new user. select which permissions your new user should have and assign a username and password. click save. you will receive an e-mail confirming the new user has been set up successfully. follow this procedure to set up each new user.
after you have created a new user, the new user will receive an automated email with their new user name and password. they will be given instructions on how to change their password if they would like to choose their own. however, as an administrator, you will always have access to delete/edit users, view their profile information (including their password) and change their permissions.
if you need to edit a user, there are links beside each user to edit or delete the user’s profile.
if you delete a user, the user will now appear on the deleted users page and you can re-activate at any time if you need to do so.
