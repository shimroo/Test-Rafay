welcome to my world of stewardess uniforms!
1885 different uniforms from 629 airlines


ever since my early childhood, i have been interested and fascinated by the world of aviation.
i used to collect everything that wore an airline name or logo, such as posters, postcards, stickers, timetables, safety cards and airplane models.

sometime in 1980 i was given my first uniform by one of my mother's friends. i was so excited and i wanted to have more uniforms.
in 1982 i heard that two charter airlines were introducing new uniforms.
i wasted no time, i called these airlines and as a result i was invited to pick up a set of old uniforms.
between 1982 and 1993 i didn't do much to obtain any more uniforms, something i really regret now as i could have had many many more!
most of my uniforms were obtained between 1993 and today. at the moment my collection contains 1885 uniforms from 629 different airlines. as i travel the world as a senior purser with klm, it gives me the opportunity to visit local airline offices and i meet people who can maybe help me to obtain new uniforms for my collection. one day, i hope to make a book about my collection. another dream that will come true? who knows?

thank you for visiting my website. enjoy it and have fun! keep visiting, i will update this site regularly.
