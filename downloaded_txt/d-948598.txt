latest news




december 2019: "surprising disconnect over compliance
and secure web use at financial firms." the legal, compliance and it departments at financial firms frequently have strikingly different priorities when addressing security and compliance issues. this disconnect creates the potential for sizable gaps in compliance and data protection approaches in these organizations if they are not properly and jointly addressed by the chief risk officer (cro), chief compliance officer (cco), and chief information security officer (ciso). this industry survey and briefing report, cobranded by triangle realtime reports and sponsored by authentic8,  shows how financial and
legal organizations can unify their management teams and take steps to safeguard information today and in the future. contact triangle president paul pinella (paul@radarmedia.com) for more information.



september 2019: "digital platforms drive business success." digital platforms are becoming the go-to foundation for ensuring innovation, agility, and an exceptional customer
experience. as a result, leading businesses are turning to digital platforms, which not only unify data to provide greater intelligence to customers, employees, and partners but also enable connections to enterprise applications and access to cutting-edge analytics and development tools. this briefing report, cobranded by mit technology review insights and sponsored by sap, demonstrates that a strong customer experience
goes well beyond direct customer touchpoints and actually requires integrating data from systems across the organization.  contact triangle president paul pinella (paul@radarmedia.com) for more information



october 2018: "fueling decisions and actions with data pipeling." digital businesses need to act quickly on their data, yet traditional data tools and processes are slow. a new approach known as âdata pipeliningâ can help. it uses automated, repeatable processes and advanced software techniques to find, cleanse, enhance and analyze any form of data at its source, eliminating the cost and delay of moving the data.  this briefing report, cobranded by mit technology review insights and sponsored by sap, examines how data hubs can rapidly deliver enriched, trustworthy,                  intelligent data to the right users with the right context at                  the right time.  contact triangle president paul pinella (paul@radarmedia.com) for more information



may 2018: the spring issue of the massachusetts and rhode island chapter of the leukeimia & lymphoma society (lls) newsletter is now out and available online in pdf format. the issue includes a profile of laura macneill, an lls veteran who recently took the helm of the ma and ri chapters to continue her battle against blood cancers. the newsletter content, editing, design and production is handled by larry marion, alice shimmin and chuck mackey, all of triangle publishing services co. contact ceo and editorial director larry marion for more information. 



january 2018: "the data-driven transformation: how marketers are using data to rethink and improve the customer journey." to stand out today, brands need to find ways to stay relevant in real time. thatâs where data comes in. in this  report and series of case studies conducted by triangle-partner mit smr custom studio  on behalf of google, our research reveals that the first step toward data-driven marketing is developing a strategy for getting your data house in order. when marketers begin to integrate different information sources, companies can uncover insights to help reduce wasteful spending, deliver more value to their customers, and ultimately increase revenue. find out how marketing leaders at bayer, sprint, and tapestry inc. (the parent company of coach, kate spade new york, and stuart weitzman) have taken steps to make those connections across data, teams, and
technology to deliver better experiences for their customers and better results for their businesses. contact triangle president paul pinella (paul@radarmedia.com) for more information



october 2017: "survey report: behind the growing confidence in cloud security." the age of unthinking fears about cloud security is over. in this  recent global survey conducted by triangle-partner mit smr custom studio  on behalf of google cloud, respondents were asked: over the last two years, how has your overall confidence in the security of cloud applications and infrastructure changed? the response was interesting. 74% of respondents have become more confident in cloud security. not only is cloud adoption rising steadily across geographies, industries and job functions, but confidence in cloud security is rising as well â to the point where increased security is a major reason enterprises opt for cloud solutions. contact triangle president paul pinella (paul@radarmedia.com) for more information



september 2017: "competing for talent in the digital age." in this forbes insights briefing report, sponsored by sap, we explore the latest digital technologies that leading small and medium-sized companies are using to recruit, develop and retain workers. many of these same digital tools are being used in much larger companies to attract the best and the brightest knowledge workers, including millenials who now expect the latest digital technology at their fingertips at all times. this briefing report looks at several smbs and how they are using new technologies to recruit and retain the talent they need to thrive. contact triangle president paul pinella (paul@radarmedia.com) for more information



november 2016: "doing business in-the-moment: transforming transaction processing for the digital economy." this forbes insights briefing report, sponsored by sap, examines extreme transaction processingâthe ability to process at least 2 million transactions per hour. today enterprises across industriesânot just high-frequency trading firmsâmust figure out how to ingest and process extraordinary numbers of transactions from an expanding variety of sources concurrently, quickly and reliably, with no tolerance for latency, loss, inconsistency or failure. we look at: how digital technologies are expanding the volume and variety of transactions; the sources of demand for high-speed transaction processing; how new types of transactions are fueling business innovation and growth; the organization and technology changes needed for modern transaction processing; and some advice for defining a business case and exploring new technologies. contact triangle president paul pinella (paul@radarmedia.com) for more information



september 2016: "why today's digital teams need a new class of collaboration tools and solutions." this harvard business review analytic services survey and report, sponsored by cisco, examines how today's workplace depends on teamwork more than ever before. due in part to the fact that so many teams today rely on people from outside the organization, including contractors and consultants from all over the world, these teams need a new way of working together. based on executives responding to the survey, current collaboration tools fall far short on supporting the depth, pace and style of teamwork now required to keep up with today's most important business imperatives. contact ceo and editorial director larry marion for more information. 


june 2016: "doing business in-the-moment: how smbs run live in the digital economy." this forbes insights briefing report, sponsored by sap, looks at several small to midsize businesses (smbs) and how they are using new technologies to respond to events as they unfold and even take action in anticipation of what lies ahead. customers no longer tolerate long order processing times, inconsistent information across channels or service glitches. and yet, business is increasingly global and complex. to meet these demands, businesses of all typesânot just digital giants and deep-pocketed competitorsâcertainly need instantaneous access to relevant data. they also, however, need the ability to respond immediately to the insights that data reveals. this is as true for smbs as it is for any other size company today. all businessesâand especially the fast-growing onesâneed operational, supply chain, sales and inventory insights at their fingertips to make the best decisions, seize hidden opportunities, anticipate problems and delight customers. contact triangle president paul pinella (paul@radarmedia.com) for more information
