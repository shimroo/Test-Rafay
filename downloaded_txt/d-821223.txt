spider-man: far from home


jul. 3rd, 2019 at 8:54 pm



 


norwich36i was going to binge watch stranger things tomorrow, but i might have to wait, because new canon would interfere with me wallowing in all my spider-man big emotions. many many spoilers behind the cut.

new release of endgame?


jun. 29th, 2019 at 2:34 pm



 


norwich36anyone who's seen endgame with the new footage, (a) is at all at the beginning of the film, as a recent spoiler has revealed? (b)is it worth seeing? (potential spoilers in the comments, natch--and feel free to completely spoil me on this; i'm trying to decide if it's worth sitting through a third time, and if i do when it's safe to go to the bathroom, so i'm also curious if it's just the drector's intro and that one scene, or if they added more anywhere else). oh, and i don't care about the spiderman teaser at the end since i'm going to see the damn film this week.this entry is crossposted at https://norwich36.dreamwidth.org/289760.html, but feel free to reply at either place.

poetry


jun. 24th, 2019 at 11:29 am



 


norwich36i'm trying a resolution to include more poetry in my life, so have a poem:morning poemby mary oliver every morningthe worldis created.under the orangesticks of the sunthe heapedashes of the nightturn into leaves againand fasten themselves to the high branches—and the ponds appearlike black clothon which are painted islandsof summer lilies.if it is your natureto be happyyou will swim away along the soft trailsfor hours, your imaginationalighting everywhere.and if your spiritcarries within itthe thornthat is heavier than lead—if it's all you can doto keep on trudging—there is stillsomewhere deep within youa beast shouting that the earthis exactly what it wanted—each pond with its blazing liliesis a prayer heard and answeredlavishly,every morning,whether or notyou have ever dared to be happy,whether or notyou have ever dared to pray.this entry is crossposted at https://norwich36.dreamwidth.org/289419.html, but feel free to reply at either place.

rocketman (and also tolkien)


may. 31st, 2019 at 5:47 pm



 


norwich36i know absolutely nothing about elton john's life, but this film was a blast--formula, yes, but doing that formula so well, with fantastic musical numbers--but what i really came out of it was the thought that the real love story of the movie was elton and bernie, and now i want all the slash. omg jamie bell's soulful eyes were like, 90% of the film for me. (i didn't even really like jamie bell before this).and speaking of rareslash coming out of biographical films that i want to see: last weekend i saw (and really enjoyed) tolkien, and that also had an unrequited love thing--in this case tolkien's friend geoffrey silently pining for him. has anyone encountered any fic for this? searching the actual pairing got me nothing, and searching "tolkien" on a03 is practically impossible since all i get are hits for the hobbit and lotr.this entry is crossposted at https://norwich36.dreamwidth.org/288982.html, but feel free to reply at either place.

holiday report


dec. 31st, 2018 at 10:29 am



 


norwich36i’ve spent a lot of time with family and travelling in the last 10 days (christmas with my parents and sibs in chicago, then 3 days with the extended clan in pittsburgh where my grandmother is in hospice, so that was a mixture of sadness and joy at seeing lots of folks i haven’t seen in a long time), but i did got to spend time with my sister and her kids.movie report: saw aquaman with my niece and nephew; basically thought it was terrible but jason momoa is very very pretty, which made up for a lot. i also saw spiderman in chicago with talitha78 which we both loved. a couple spoilers behind the cut.

tumblr alternative?


dec. 5th, 2018 at 8:20 pm



 


norwich36so pearwaldorf apparently tweeted at maciej ceglowski (pinboard guy) about a tumblr alternative and he replied ( tweet and response here: https://mobile.twitter.com/pearwaldorf/status/1070364450270507008), and now there is a google doc for ideas here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-wof6x0apxju15edcqukzjwqiinfrbjfowayt48umg/mobilebasic ( please pardon my lack of live links-i find it extremely difficult to type code on my ipad, and my laptop is currently in the shop for repairs).this entry is crossposted at https://norwich36.dreamwidth.org/287654.html, but feel free to reply at either place.

norwich36thanks for the good wishes. sorry i can’t actually respond on livejoural, because i don’t remember my password, and i’m on a different computer. apparently i set it up so all anonymous entries are screened, so i can’t even reply that way. if you want to get an actual reply from me it has to be on dreamwidth—sorry!this entry is crossposted at https://norwich36.dreamwidth.org/287390.html, but feel free to reply at either place.
