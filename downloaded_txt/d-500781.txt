how did we meet?



mike likes to make up stories about how we met.  he usually says: a strip club, a bar, a tattoo parlor (beyond ridiculous locations if you know me at all - little miss conservative).  the truth is that we met online on a dating website.  i tried out several websites for various amounts of time.  mike used one website for a very short time before he met me.  lucky him! :) i, on the other hand, had several 'interesting' blind date experiences along the way.  mike found my profile first and contacted me.  before i responded to him, i took several days to online stalk him.  i think i literally read every single facebook message he ever posted.  when i finally responded to his email, he actually forgot who i was.  so much for first impressions! :) anyway, we emailed for about a week, talked on the phone for about a week and then we met in person.  i will save our first date experience for a different post though.here are a few of my favorite sentences from mike during the first week of communication. after reading theses, i just knew i had to get to know this guy better.- i want a marriage like my parents: christ centered, fun and full of life.- my niece and nephew are amazing and i love them so much.- i'm super extroverted.- i have a huge family and holidays are always an adventure.- i will admit i am an in the closet chick flick lover. :)- god's grace is amazing.

it's still  a beautiful life...



a long time ago i remember being in my parent's kitchen with my sister and my brother.  we were talking about god and how we each  wanted one thing to be be our 'life testimony'.  we just wanted one  thing that would make us always remember us how blessed we are and  how amazing god really is.  i said that day, that if i ever got married  it would be my 'life testimony' because there was no way i was even  close to getting married and my options seemed to be dwindling with  every passing day. but then it happened, after losing all hope in myself, god proved himself faithful (like he always does)  and i met mike.  this blog is taking a drastic turn from a marathon  runner's notebook to a brides planning guide.  please join me along the way, as  i plan for one of the most special days of my life.  i find it so  fitting that my blog title is still more than perfect for this life  transition, it's a beautiful life indeed!

catching up



i stepped on a scale this afternoon for the first time in months.  i weigh the most i have ever weighed in my life.  :(i fell off the p90x bandwagon because of my crazy, busy schedule even though i love the program.  i need to make exercise and healthy eating a priority in my life.  i think i'll start tomorrow........ because i already had ice cream for lunch today. :)

winter updatei have been p90xing a few days a week (still loving it). i hop on the treadmill about once a week (4 miles at the most). so far, so good - i can fit into all my clothes this winter (unlike last winter). i also registered for the great aloha run.  i know i am not ready for an 8 mile race, but why not have fun and just go for it?! :)valentine's day is just around the corner. it is one of my top 3 favorite days of the school year. there are valentine cards to exchange, crafts to be created, cupcakes to be eaten, red/pink shirts to be worn and valentine games to be played.
