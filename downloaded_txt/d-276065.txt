our recommended sites

them anime
simply put, our sister site.  filled with smart writeups from great friends, this is where i go for anime reviews.  i also participate in their forums under the handle akirakaneda.
anime news network
there's still not a better english-language anime news site on the web.
my anime list
the best place to catalog what you've seen, what you own, and what you want to watch next.
hulu
most new anime i watch, i watch via hulu plus.  there's a great selection of the latest simulcasts and tons of good classics.
nis america
no one has ever put out quality box sets like these folks.  not only that, they are the only current distributor that sends me free screening copies.  i don't get any money from them, but i love their product.  go visit them (and pick up a copy of bunny drop).
