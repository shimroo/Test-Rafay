autism – how it affects your ability to work￼

autism is a mental disorder that causes a preoccupation with oneself, which can lead to difficulties communicating, imagining, and social interaction with others. autism adults have difficulty performing work that requires them to pay attention or receive instructions for long periods.
autism can sometimes be adapted to work environments by people who have autism. for those with high functioning conditions like asperger syndrome, this is particularly true. statistics show that most adults with autism cannot work on a full-time basis in any sort of meaningful employment, or live independently. only 6% of autistic adults are able maintain full-time employment despite significant efforts to encourage employers to provide environments where autistic adults can do meaningful work.
autism can be treated by early detection. autism can be treated both medically and therapeutically if it is caught early. a child with autism has a higher chance of functioning independently as an adult if they early intervention treatment.
this is possible for people with milder autism spectrum disorders in workplaces that have trained supervisors to handle autistic employees.
autism and the workforce
autism sufferers can have significant difficulties in navigating the workforce. research has shown that 20% adults with autism are not employed, although other estimates are higher. this gap may be evident at an early age. only 58% of people with autism aged 18-25 worked for pay.
companies are becoming more aware of the importance of having a diverse workforce. they also embrace autistic people for their unique perspectives. large companies like microsoft have programs that actively support and hire people with autism. companies with autism may also be eligible for financial incentives from the government. these incentives allow people on the spectrum to turn their natural talents and abilities into marketable skills.
what are the employment challenges that people with autism have to face?
adults with autism often find themselves in unemployment or underemployment all their lives. interviews can be difficult for them. this is because they need to make eye contact and have a strong personality. they also need to establish a relationship with the hiring manager. people with autism might struggle to adapt to a new job or navigate the workplace social dynamics. this could include clients, assignments, office politics, and even losing their job.
what are some good jobs for autistic individuals?
the passions and obsessions that are characteristic of autism can be translated into valuable skills for the workforce. people who love patterns and puzzles might excel in software debugging, quality control assessor or other roles within the technology sector. stockroom operations, production lines, removalists and data entry are just a few of the other positions available in autism-friendly businesses. people with autism should consider how their talents and natural interests can be matched up to the requirements of specific positions on the job market.
what are the advantages of hiring autistic employees?
autism is a disability that affects millions of people, but it can be an advantage too. with high unemployment rates for autistic workers and companies alike there needs to change in order accommodate this population niche with their interests or abilities at hand – such as folding laundry or coding software! employers should adopt an ability centered approach which recognizes unique talents autistic employees may possess while acknowledging they will always put forth effort when needed most; society benefits greatly because these individuals excel specifically towards positions requiring skill sets relevant only found among those diagnosed.
people on the spectrum are four times more likely than other adults to have a job, but when they do find work it’s often difficult. these individuals face many challenges in getting hired and keeping that first position once obtained-the result being financial insecurity for both those with autism as well as their families who rely heavily upon them working regularly at an income level sufficient enough so one won’t sink into debt due solely because he/she has special need. this is what some adults with autism think. “the best way to help individuals on the spectrum obtain and maintain employment.”
which companies are autistic-friendly?
sap is a leader in including people with autism into their workforce. it values and supports diverse ways of thinking, which can help them on the job site or at home depending how it needs to be used for each individual worker’s needs during employment period
a lot more companies need these kinds if employees because there seems only handful out right now but when you start adding others like ey (ernst & young) who also have an autistic program i’m sure they’ll come across some great talent tracked down through this route
what can companies do to support autistic employees?
clear communication is crucial for creating an autism-friendly workplace. managers should give clear instructions and deadlines to employees and help remove any obstacles that might prevent them from achieving those directives. managers should be open and honest and open to new ways of thinking and creativity. managers can provide quiet places to work in noisy offices and make sure that the lights do not flicker to accommodate autism’s sensory symptoms.
traditional interviewing focuses on connection and conversation. companies can replace the traditional interview process with an aptitude test, or a skills-based task to hire autistic employees.

 
 



understanding autoimmune autistic disorder – the trigger

scientists have made remarkable advances in understanding autism’s causes in recent years. autism is now believed to affect 1 in 88 children. however, this knowledge has not been widely shared with the public. the focus is often on vaccines.
the abbreviated version of autism is that affects one third or more, looks like an inflammatory disease and it is monitored meticulously from the beginning in the womb,
scientists call it immune dysregulation. your immune system should function like an intelligent action hero. it should respond quickly to any inflammation with precision, accuracy, and deadly force. this requires a balanced mix of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory muscles.
the immune system is unable to balance the needs of autistic people. inflammatory signals are dominant. the anti-inflammatory options are insufficient. chronic activation is the dominant state. the more autistic symptoms are triggered by inflammation, the worse they will be.
the autistic brain is the most affected by dysregulation. chronic activation causes the growth of spidery cells, also known as astroglia or microglia. there are many pro-inflammatory signaling molecules. the genes involved in inflammation can be switched on.
these findings are significant for many reasons. but perhaps the most important is that they show evidence of an abnormal, ongoing biological process. this means there is now a treatment target for a disorder that can be defined as repetitive behaviour, social impairments, and difficulty communicating.
how can we address this problem and where do we start? scientists have found the answer to this question in the womb. an extensive population-wide study in denmark that covered two decades of births shows that an infection during pregnancy can increase the risk of autism. the odds of getting a viral infection such as the flu in the first trimester are tripled if you’re hospitalized. the chance of contracting a bacterial infection (including one in the urinary tract) during the second trimester is 40 percent higher.
this is not a case where bacteria and viruses directly harm the fetus. it is the mother’s attempt at repelling invaders, her inflammatory response, that seems to be the problem. paul patterson, an expert on neuro immunity at caltech has demonstrated this principle. behaviour problems are caused by artificially inflaming pregnant mice without the use of an infective agent. this model shows that autism is caused by collateral damage. it is an unintended consequence for self-defense during pregnancy.
it is absurd to attribute the autism epidemic to infections. first, epidemiology does not fit in the larger sense. infantile autism was first described by leo kanner in 1943. although the number of cases has increased tenfold, careful analysis suggests that it is actually less than half. however, both viral and bacterial infections have declined in the same time frame. we are, by many measures, more infected than ever before in human history.
