i've spent over 5 years teaching at coding bootcamps and even attended one myself. as a full-stack developer, javascript and react are my favorites to work with. i love creating content that helps people learn to code, by sharing my experiences with coding bootcamps, and exploring the possibility of becoming a digital nomad and traveling the world, as my ultimate goal is to become a digital nomad and explore the globe. with a community of 8k+ followers across social media, i leverage my 10+ years of teaching experience to inspire and educate others about the exciting world of coding. let's connect and see how i can help you achieve your coding dreams!
