the magpie consort is a group of 16 singers based in columbus, ohio. we perform a wide variety of repertoire, collected in magpie fashion from many parts of the world and from different musical traditions: medieval chants, sacred and secular renaissance gems, folk song and world music arrangements, and contemporary compositions. we enjoy collaborating with instrumentalists, dancers, and others – and we also like to include our audiences in making music.
our repertoire this winter was a mixture of renaissance european music for advent and christmas, secular seasonal songs from many traditions, and reflections on the crisis in the middle east.  we gave performances at franklin park conservatory, and in music series at our lady of victory church (marble cliff), first unitarian church (clintonville), and holy trinity lutheran church (upper arlington). and we raised over $1000 for doctors without borders, the international charity providing humanitarian aid in zones of conflict.
coming up in may, two concerts on the theme of transformations, and a collaboration with centennial high school. see our concerts page for further information.
to get reminders about all our performances, please join our email list for updates.  we also welcome inquiries from anyone who would like to audition to join the group – especially tenors and basses.
