 the homestead inn is our new favorite place to stay in blowing rock!!! we stayed here this past weekend and the room was perfect for my husband and i and our dog. the bed was super comfy and we loved the sheets too. the inn is so cute and also walking distance up to main street. we will definitely be coming back to stay here in the future. highly recommend it!!!

 we had a blast and blowing rock is beautiful! took our kids there to see snow and wow, did it snow! we rented cottage #1 and it was perfect for us. cozy, cean, remodeled kitchen, comfy bed, washer and dryer, and perfect location as everything within walking distance. owners of homestead are great, and made sure we had everything we needed. even let my girls use their sleds! we look forward to returning to the homestead!

 very cute rooms at an affordable rate only a block or two away from blowing rock's small and walkable downtown district! i felt right at home the moment i stepped into my room. the room was well decorated, squeaky clean, with a very comfy bed. the innkeepers were very cool and nice. so much to love about this spot, and i'll definitely be back!
laura p.


 
 i had an excellent stay - comfortable bed, well-lit room modern bathroom, fridge and microwave. staff went out of their way to reserve a parking spot for me to charge our electric car. the location is super convenient to downtown blowing rock - easy and safe walk to and from area watering holes.
