workshops















fostering creativity within communityunlock the hidden potential within your communitycreativity is often misunderstood to be a talent possessed by a select few, while in reality, it's also a skill that can be nurtured and developed by anyone. and most communities, be it a church, school or local organization, rarely appreciate the potential it has for fostering great art, music or innovation within it’s core membership.i have helped many communities to break through into a treasure trove of creativity. i start by identifying the common stumbling blocks we all face like fear or lack of self belief or lack of resources to then cultivate genuine belief and desire to become the creatives we were all born to be.we can make excuses as to why we are not ‘so’ creative or successful or, we can do something about it.

“at every crossroad in my career  i was fortunate to have a mentor by my side; during the seasons i worked as a guitar-player sideman, then as a studio musician, a budding songwriter, studio engineer, music producer and composer. through these ‘big brother’ relationships i was fast-tracked onto the higher playing fields within the music industry. in my own way, i want to return the favor to other’s on their creative journey.”— chris falson
