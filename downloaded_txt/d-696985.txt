a thanksgiving song





well, it's more about the turkey. but still.ella learned this at school, then sadie promptly learned it from ella. i love that ella has her eyes closed through half of the song. also, the sadie-screech at the end? classic.

halloween





remember halloween? i do. mostly because andy and i dressed up (we haven't done that in several years). but this year it wasn't just about the girls. oh no. we decided it was time for us to shine (well, the invitation for a costume party decided it for us, but we willingly agreed).the party was a couple days before halloween, but we had so much fun being an 80's rock duo (andy named us prom) that we dressed up again while the girls trick-or-treated.oh yeah, the girls. ella was a titans cheerleader, and sadie was a cowgirl.look at my little family. look at my man's flowing, mulletted locks.every year we trick-or-treat on our cul-de-sac. this is the second year our friends, the oakes fam, joined us.(amelie really really wanted to be in our family pic)after the girls got their candy, they would run away yelling, "thank you! happy halloween! happy trick-or-treat!"rock on, halloween. rock on.

three wishes





sadie has three wishes. when she sees a star, she asks for these things. when asked what she wants for her (fourth) birthday, she says these things. when santa asked what she wanted for christmas, she sweetly requested these things.always these three. always in this order. an american girl doll that looks like me named kit,a seesaw,and a baby sister.{so this is sadie as a baby, but you get the idea}the other night we finally had to break it to her that she would not, in fact, be getting a baby sister for christmas. to not get her hopes up. that if one were coming mommy's tummy would be really huge right now. she was pretty disappointed, but seemed to understand. and she continues asking for one.
