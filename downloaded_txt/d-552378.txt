welcome to longarm university
in the summer of 1999,
	  cindy roth 
	  had the idea of having talented longarm quilting instructors teaching 
	  longarm quilters in small, hands on classes. enlisting the help of other 
	  local quilters, longarm university, inc.â® was created. longarm 
	  university has had several hundred students attend workshops and classes. 
	  many of our students have started their own successful longarm quilting 
	  businesses and have won many local, regional and national quilting awards.
longarm university is expanding to offer to you quilting products 
	  designed specifically for longarm quilters. these products will make your 
	  quilting easier and make quilting designs that longarm quilters have been 
	  unable to create in the past. we welcome and encourage any 
	  questions and comments. please contact us at
