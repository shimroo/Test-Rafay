impartiality is the governing principle of how bsi provides its services. impartiality means acting fairly and equitably in its dealings with people and in all business operations. it means decisions are made free from any engagements of influences which could affect the objectivity of decision making.as an accredited certification body, bsi assurance cannot offer certification to clients where they have also received consultancy from another part of the bsi group for the same management system. likewise, we do not offer consultancy to clients when they also seek certification to the same management system.the british standards institution (bsi, a company incorporated by royal charter), performs the national standards body (nsb) activity in the uk. bsi, together with its group companies, also offers a broad portfolio of business solutions other than nsb activity that help businesses worldwide to improve results through standards-based best practice (such as certification, self-assessment tool, software, product testing, information products and training).
