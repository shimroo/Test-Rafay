amazing charitable work for past 12 years – since 2009.
but there are other passions, six very dear to my heart, hence this website, in the making for nearly a decade. i lost thousands of files and pictures in subscribed portals, and damaged hard drives, so i decided to rely on a website like this.
          thomas is my large family – calendars and monthly zoom famtalk!
          thamizh the beauty of the language!
          tinsel is thamizh cinema!
          thots or musings – others’ contributions
               – a forum to express on controversial issues – nalini’s nook.
               – dkk’s page on rare blogs.
          tributes: my scribbles and personal reflections.
          treats: plants and food – marunthombal and virunthombal with useful tips.
