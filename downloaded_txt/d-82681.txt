according
        to the theory of aerodynamics, and as may be readily demonstrated
        through experiments, the bumble bee is unable to fly.
this
        is because the size, the weight, and the shape of his body in relation
        to his wingspread make flying impossible.
but
        the bumble bee, being ignorant of these scientific truths, goes ahead
        and flies anyway - and makes a little honey everyday!
