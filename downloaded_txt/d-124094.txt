books by james bowman




media madness
before there was howard kurtz’s media madness, there was mine — now, alas, out of print but still available while supplies last for the cost of shipping and handling. send $5.99 to me in care of the ethics and public policy center, 1730 m street, suite 910, washington, d.c. 20036



honor, a history
also available, now in paperback and kindle version, is honor, a history, which was first published in 2006. a study of western cultural artifacts, from the epics of homer to the movies and tv shows of today, it is focused on explaining why western ideas of honor developed so differently from those elsewhere — and especially from the savage honor cultures of the islamic world. the book then goes on to trace the collapse and ultimate rejection of the old western honor culture from world war i until the present day and to suggest the conditions that would have to prevail for its revival.
