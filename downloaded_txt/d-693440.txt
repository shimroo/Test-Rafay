 bringing art to quilting
since its inception in 1991, the designer's workshop has committed to bringing you the most unique foundation pieced patterns available.  foundation piecing (commonly called 'paper piecing') utilizes a "sew and flip" method to provide a 'what you see is what you get'   approach to quilt makers.  
each pattern is broken down into units and sections and numbered in the order to be done.  all sewing is straight line only.
all patterns include a printed freezer paper foundation ready for sewing.  freezer paper has added benefit of adhering to the fabrics when ironed in place, serving as a stabilizer as well as a foundation.
each pattern includes complete directions, illustrations and diagrams to walk you through the entire process.  some are easier, some more difficult, but all require the same understanding of the sewing process.
for rank beginners we suggest starting with #161:  foundation piecing 101.  this covers all the basic steps with six simple blocks.  next on the list would be #201:  fruit sampler.  it also is very basic, but creates a small wall hanging.
