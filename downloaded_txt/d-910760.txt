    our vgb commercial spas are accepted in all counties for the east coast to california counties such as los angeles, san diego, orange county, santa barbara and san francisco where strict swimming pool and building codes are enforced and the vgb virginia graeme baker pool and spa safety act is causing hotels, health spas, colleges, and resorts to update their spa drains and filtration systems. pdf listing with phone numbers and internet links of all county health departments in california.
