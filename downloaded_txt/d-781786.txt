					getting assistance				
							








obtaining therapy equipment for your child with special needs is expensive.  in the past we have provided grant assistance to select applicants. due to financial reasons, we are not accepting grants at this time. if you are in need of equipment, please check out lexi's closet, where families and therapists can view a wide selection of inventory items to try out.
