about us 









 


join a community of volunteers serving veterans, military, and their families!
we know that military service is a sacrifice for the whole family, so ala members quietly look for ways to ease the burden—whatever it takes to get that family back on its feet physically, mentally, socially, and vocationally. if we don’t have the resources, we connect military families with our partners who do.
one of our core values in honoring our veterans is to demonstrate and pass on respect for our country and our nation’s flag. we promote patriotic youth programs, most notably the american legion auxiliary girls state and girls nation programs, held regionally and nationally, along with education programs, contests, and scholarships in local school systems.
making our communities better places to live is another core value american legion auxiliary members put into action daily across michigan. whether hosting a stand down to bring vital health and support services to homeless veterans or coordinating a send-off or welcome-home event for a deployed military unit, ala members are continuously at work in their communities, demonstrating the compassion and heart we have for those who serve our country and protect our freedoms.

how do we know about military sacrifice?
because we are the male and female spouses, grandmothers, mothers, sisters, and direct and adopted female descendants of members of the american legion, some of us are veterans ourselves.
