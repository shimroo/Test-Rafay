comments, questions, ideas? ... 



if you have any suggestions to
                        make the site better, have an energy related idea, or
                        have a project you have done or seen elsewhere -- lets
                        hear about it...



the half program 


 
 the half program - 23 projects we used to cut our
                      energy use in half




the half
                          program is a systematic way to choose the
                        solar and conservation projects that will give you the
                        most bang for the buck.   its amazing what can be
                        accomplished and how good the return is when you choose
                        projects carefully.
its the most important thing on this site.
