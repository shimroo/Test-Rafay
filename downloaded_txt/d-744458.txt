welcome to the living history of wyoming
the wyoming historical society began in 1953, and is made up of members across wyoming, as well as from outside the borders of wyoming and the united states. the society is open to any individual interested in history of wyoming and the west. wyoming state historical society is a non-profit, membership driven organization that encourages the study of wyoming history.  we believe to study the past is to understand the present and prepare for the future.
our vision is to ensure that wyoming’s past remains accessible to present and future generations.
