outstanding temperament very easy to dovery correct typealso eligible for coloured ri/hoys classes

rare & very flashy roan heavy weight. something a little different that will stand out.
great mover with four whites over 10inchs clean flat limb. beautifully put together.
a pleasure to school and does not act like a 4 year old safe and sane super on the roads to hack out alone or in company.
great to box up and travel to fun rides and clinic not yet shown.
a very sweet allrounder for his age. snaffle mouthed lovely and light in the hand not too forward nor to lazy will give a great judges ride.
no vices or health issues open to vet.
