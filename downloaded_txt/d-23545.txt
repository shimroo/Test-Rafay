vintage karts









a fun site dedicated to the early days of karting  


vintage karts   is about
early bug karts, dart karts, fox go-boys, go-kart 400's and 800's, kavalla karts,
xterminators, and all the rest of those little machines that formed the beginnings of the
sport we've known for decades as "karting".
