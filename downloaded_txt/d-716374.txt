 know well the face of your
flocks; set your heart on your herds. 
 for riches are not forever, nor the crown from
generation 
 to generation. when the hay is removed, and the tender 
 grass is seen, and the
mountain plants are gathered, 
 the lambs are for your clothing, and the goats 
 are the price
of the field. and you shall have goats' milk
 enough for your food, for the food of your
household, 
 and a living for your young women. proverbs 27:23-27 mkjv
 

 
 and i heard every creature in heaven and on earth 
 and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, 
 singing: "to
him who sits on the throne and to the lamb 
 be praise and honor and glory and power, 
 for ever and ever!"
- revelation 5:13
