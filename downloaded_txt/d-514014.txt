what do we believe? 



prayerful we are committed to the power of prayer. we know that it is a prayer that moves the hand of god to bless his people. when a prayer need arises, we are steadfast in our dedication until god moves.personal at st. john’s, every single person is valued regardless of standing or status. your life here gives you significance among god’s chosen people and we regard your petition as urgent in the eyes of god and ours.















purposeful we embrace our trials as necessary in the christian experience. in revelation 12:11, “we overcome by the blood of the lamb, and the words of our testimony.” the purpose of our trials is to bring glory to god. therefore, we gladly accept what god allows as a means of growth and grace.passionate passion drove the mission and ministry of jesus. only after he had completed the objective of his coming did he say, “it is finished.”  the same passion drives our mission here at st. john’s. we are passionate about seeing you through until he who has begun a great work in you is fulfilled.
