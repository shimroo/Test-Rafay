each year winning authors are selected from our reading list based upon votes from each go on girl! book club chapter for author of the year and new author of the year. they are then invited to receive their awards in person at the annual awards ceremony. gog members and guests have had the honor of awarding in person to pearl cleage, bebe moore campbell, walter mosely, jill nelson, valerie wilson wesley, diane mckinney whetstone, lawrence hill, daniel black, isabel wilkerson to name a few.
