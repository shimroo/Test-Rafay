st. paul’s is a member of the episcopal church which has a legacy of inclusion, aspiring to tell and exemplify god’s love for every human being; women and men serve as bishops, priests, and deacons in our church. laypeople and clergy cooperate as leaders at all levels of our church. leadership is a gift from god, and can be expressed by all people in our church, regardless of sexual identity or orientation.we believe that god loves you – no exceptions.



























“st. paul's church is located on n’dakinna, which is the traditional ancestral homeland of the abenaki, pennacook and wabanaki peoples past and present. we acknowledge and honor with gratitude the land and waterways and the alnobak (people) who have stewarded n’dakinna throughout the generations.”
