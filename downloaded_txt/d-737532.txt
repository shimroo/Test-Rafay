original quotes:

"there is no knowledge, only belief ."
     "water, in all its forms - rivers, lakes, falls, clouds, rain, and, most of all, life, is a source of never ending beauty."
     " 'life' is software that builds its own hardware."
     "we are living the first pass of a two-pass algorithm."
     "we do not learn; we discover what we did not realize we already knew."
     "birthday: that special day of the year that most clearly marks that time pushes the start of our life farther away, and pulls the end nearer."
    (expanded essay)
 "the best way to get something programmed is to ask a programmer to do it by hand."
     whether you add (bu__sh__) or subtract (b_s_),
    the result is the same.

	   he is now out of office (thank goodness), but we must not 
	   forget the horrors of those eight wasted years.
	   inform yourself about bu__sh__

	   unfortunately, what started with the 2016 presidential election, resulted in something even worse!

a word about java: 

	 when this site was launched, the java programming language was 
	 "the way of the future", and i wrote a bunch of applets which 
	 appear on this site.
	 
	 but then a number of security holes developed in java and the "web powers" 
	 (i.e. the browser people) decided that java was a big no-no ... 
	 and now it can be difficult or impossible to run those applets.
	 a few i have rewritten in javascript, but many i have not 
	 taken the time for.  
	 sorry about that.
