catching the autumn

				by lara gularte                     

i am tired of my own long story, 
my blouse stained with vignettes. 
the gold ring i lost can not be found, 
my china teapot stays broken. 
familiar faces are stacked, 
piled high in snapshots.

in this half-light of my life 
i will cook a soup of claws and spine. 
when my eyes fail i will eat more parsnips. 
my skin will become bleached wood, 
preserved by salt. 
i want no candy hearts or sticky adjectives, 
no flower ...

outside

				by gary short

some strings of light. 
mostly absence. 
out the window, trees, 
the narrow margin. the edges 
carved in new sun.

i sway, 
stalled at the warm window. 
out there the sweep of wings. 
out there wind's tangle.

i sway to the absence, 
a disappearance like hushed flight. 
now the wind nods slack with sleep.

in the tree outside my window, 
the scurry of wings 
like a preface to arrows.

latticed shadows of limbs 
weave a net of the day. 
the sway of the tree i depend on 
to summon me.

spring equinox

				by jane blue first published in poetry now

i feel peeled, coffin-ripped. 
the worms of night sated now.

my spectacled eyes 
tender as incubated babes.

elms hang infant leaves 
like minuscule laundry.

at a bus stop, a bird walks 
high in a tree's new fringe,

pecking, sashaying 
up the limb skyward.

it pauses to call "chip-chip" 
into the morse-code morning.

soon, someone replies, 
"chip-chip." the bird saunters

out on the attenuating branch, 
then steps into air.

what soldier, what saint 
will i be in this new life?

blue prose

				by carol frith  first  published tule review

lawn chairs like lateral road maps-- 
the grass scans blue. i won't go out 
today. bent light. light like water spots. 
nobody walks here anymore: three apricot 
trees and a peach. the leaves fill with 
blue, separate into blank space.

now, a man in blue grasses sits down on the 
lateral slats. answers turn over in the 
middle distance. think of the way

a blue vein of light remembers itself. 
the man in blue glasses frowns 
in his lawn chair. he listens to me.

i have a baker's dozen of blue words 
to offer: azure, ...

solstice greetings

				by julia connor

hold what you have loved                  
firmly in mind

what is 
bears also the tendency
not to be
bittersweet 
the salts reshuffle      

why not moisten 
the fingertip
and write 
the beloved name in air
right now

ancestral call

				by calder lowe

rising above the steady snore
of the purifier, a train whistle
from the nearby tracks scoops away
two metallic llamas and a solitary
wooden elephant plodding along the tops
of the bookshelves.  in their absence,
camels from a caravan in a painting,
stumble, lose their footing in the sand.
the cats paw at their reflections in the window.
time is restructured in that instant
of misdirected sound.  count back
one, two, three centuries.
train whistles, bugles, church bells

thread through clouds.
my ancestors blow glass
in the black forest of germany,
carry lafayette off the battlefield,
make an error in judgement about
a new boarder from the coal mine.
glass glows in the von eberhardt ...

armory square hospital, 1863

				by joshua mckinney first published tule review  spring '01 
let the physician and the priest go home. 
-- walt whitman


the young men haunt his days and nights 
within the whitewashed wards. at last a bliss 
though terrible. to those outside he writes, 
"...there is no time to lose, & death & anguish 
dissipate ceremony here between my lads 
and me." without the cloak of poetry, 
he cures. he walks between the rows of beds, 
his energy unchecked. at last he is free

to love. to give a gift, to dress a wound-- 
he feels the boys' needs as his own. ...

the new main, s.f.

				by paula sheil

a man entered the space. hair. black. soft. moved down his 
back. all of his back. moved when he moved. kelp with the 
tide. moved him or followed him. i. like a tiny yellow fish 
darted into his hair. and out. no solid between us. space 
only clarified my having him and letting go. interrupted by 
concrete and glass.

 a man entered the space. picture him naked on a white sheet. 
his skin the color of walnut oil. his fingers. hidden. i 
wanted him. suddenly. to never forget.

 a man entered the space. not so many men are ...

to the valley fog

				by don campbell

through the bedroom window 
you are there in the morning 
filling every space with snow-like silence 
fooling the northerner with your whiteness

covering the tops of trees and the roof line of tall buildings 
you soften every edge in town 
drip off gutter corners into the streets 
leaving a trail the cats avoid

the valley surface thirsty from a long summer's drought 
is glad for any water...even yours now dirty 
from the dust and grime you've trickled off 
the leaves and the stone walls

the people are troubled because you break 
their speed as they drive to work 
hawks stay put ...

visitation rights of the levee builders

				by william barr

in late april each man and his 
oldest son light the levee fires. 
the night bridges are floated 
from both sides and joined at

the center. throughout the night, 
i hear footraces, cheers, and the 
squeak of old nails in old wood. i 
smell crayfish, turnip pudding,

cabbage, and i can almost taste 
the walnut prawns. no, i speak no 
chinese at all but the laughter of 
the young men echoes into my

morning prayer. when the old 
man finally speaks even the dogs 
are quiet. there is one final 
chorus, then their steps, their

soft leaving steps. at dawn the 
levee ...
