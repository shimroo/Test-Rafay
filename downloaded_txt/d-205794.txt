automatic self releasing shelton bite detector™


the sbd™ (shelton bite detector™) can be used for trout, catfish, stripers are any light bite species. it has a self releasing feature that tips upside down when the main line is pulled and falls off line loop. the sliding rubber core weight is adjustable. you can also tie the line to a stick, rocks are what ever is handy. no longer to you have to worry about un-attaching bobbers and such from your line. it simply self releases itself and all you have to do is strike and land fish. the bright color gives great visibility from long distance in case you wander down the shore to tend another rod or visit. when done just wrap the line around the sbd™ with the sliding weight at the bottom of the line where the loop is. when wrapping on the final wrap place line in the release slot and move weight back up which locks the line that wrapped around the body in place so it stays till you slide weight back down. hold the loop and drop the sbd™ and it will unwrap the line by itself.
