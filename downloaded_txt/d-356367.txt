the phillyfunguide event calendar debuted in 2002 as a service of the greater philadelphia cultural alliance to promote cultural events in the region. in 2006, the funsavers program was launched to complement the phillyfunguide by offering discounted tickets and a weekly email newsletter. over the last 22 years, the landscape of event promotion has changed dramatically and the strategic goals of the cultural alliance have shifted to better meet the changing needs of the arts and culture sector. after careful consideration, the cultural alliance will discontinue phillyfunguide on august 31, 2024 and funsavers on december 12, 2024. the last day to submit an event to the phillyfunguide is july 19, 2024 and the last day to submit funsavers content will be december 2, 2024. 
we know that many local organizations rely on revenue generated at their events, yet have limited resources to market their offerings. the cultural alliance will continue to offer options for high-impact advertising placements on our website and in our monthly culturewire newsletter at a low cost. learn more about advertising with the cultural alliance.
additionally, we’ve compiled a list of online calendars where you can submit your events for free, which you can find below.
