help 
                        your gradeschooler write! this would be a 
                        great spring story, but the author ran out of ideas after 
                        the first few sentences! finish this story, please! we 
                        can't wait to see it.

it's time 
                        to camp -- may often marks the beginning 
                        of the camping season in many families. whether you are 
                        a tent-camping crew, an rv group, or a backyard camp family, 
                        here are some fun activities and recipes to liven up any 
                        camp-out.


 

marvelous may! 
                        -- spring is now firmly in our grasp, and the weather 
                        is finally beginning to become warmer. the end of the 
                        school year is in sight, and with it, vacations and summer 
                        fun. 

thinking 
                        big! -- magnifying glasses can be fascinating. 
                        they afford your children a unique opportunity to peer 
                        at details that would otherwise escape notice and learn 
                        about the intricacies of our world. 


 

winning the seatbelt wars 
                        -- every child goes through it at one time or another, 
                        and it can be enough to spoil a fun trip: the great seatbelt 
                        fight is on! 

playing 
                        in the dirt: gardening for kids -- our april 
                        featured writer jaqueline rupp tells us "this is 
                        the time when nature comes alive, awakened by the warm 
                        breezes, from its winter slumber."


 


need 
                        an end of the day pick-me-up? --  
                        you've done so many things today you can barely remember 
                        all of them and you still have dinner to cook, children 
                        to be fed and bathed...


start 
                        planning your summer travels now! -- the 
                        internet is full of great discounts for travelers, but 
                        most of us don't have that much time to spend trying to 
                        find that "perfect" web site.


 

astronomical 
                        adventures: exploring the skies with your child --

                        ation with unexplainable mysteries... jacqueline 
                        rupp shows us how!

                        -- there are these struggles that keep popping up…struggles 
                        that i had somehow forgotten about in the two years between 
                        babies.
