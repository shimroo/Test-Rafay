through the looking glass

wednesday, may 23, 2007


season finale at 9/8c on abcjack and his fellow castaways begin their efforts to make contact with naomi's rescue ship.  stuff:1. both this season's premiere, "a tale of two cities", and the finale, "through the looking glass" are book titles.i'm not going to make any predictions or share any rumors.  there'll be plenty to talk about afterwards.  enjoy the two hour finale!

greatest hits

tuesday, may 15, 2007


tomorrow, wednesday may 15th at 10/9c on abc:jack devises a plan to do away with "the others" once and for all, sayid uncovers a flaw in "the others'" system that could lead to everyone's rescue, and charlie's dangerous task may make desmond's premonition come true.  this episode is charlie-centric, but sadly this may be the last of such episodes...  in other words, (although i question whether the writers would make this so obvious), everything leads to the fact that charlie will die:1) the episode title, "greatest hits" refers to an album containing a band/artist's top songs, usually after a member(s) of the band or that artist dies.  with charlie being a member of the band driveshaft, you can see the connection.2) we already had an episode that teased us from the opening scene that charlie would die, but he survived in the end.  if he doesn't die in this episode, it will be as if we've seen it all before.3) the "epitaph" in the episode description..."charlie's dangerous task may make desmond's premonition come true."honestly, charlie's cool, but he might have lost our interest in his character.  there's a good chance he's not coming back next season.  to dodge having to give a definitive stance on this issue, i'll just say that we'll just have to wait and see...

in last week's episode, "the man behind the curtain", ben appears to be speaking to an empty chair, where jacob should have been sitting.  locke is skeptical about the situation and has started to think ben is crazy.  you heard the "help me" line and jacob's wrath throughout his little hut, but perhaps you missed the screen flashing for a short second with the above image, which is likely of jacob himself. why does jacob only appear for a second?  why does he say "help me"? the image we have of him leaves many possibilities.  it's hard to tell whether he most closely resembles alvar hanso, locke, or any other character one could make an argument for.

end date?  2010

sunday, may 13, 2007


it's been reported that "lost" will end in 2010.here's the breakdown of the structure for the following years:spring 2008 feb. to may   –   16 consecutive repeat-free episodesspring 2008 feb. to may   –   16 consecutive repeat-free episodesspring 2008 feb. to may   –   16 consecutive repeat-free episodeslindelof and cuse seem pretty confident with this bold move.  i especially like a few lindelof quotes:"...with the answer-filled season finale may 23, viewers 'will begin to get an idea of what that design will be, and it will not be at all what they expect.'""the last five minutes of (this month's) finale are going to seal our fate."there are pros and cons, but overall this will end up being a good decision.  if they revert to the 9:00 slot, "lost" is set for the next three years.

the man behind the curtain

sunday, may 06, 2007


wednesday, may 9 at 10/9cben begrudgingly begins to introduce locke to the secrets of the island, beginning with the mysterious jacob.tv-14tv.com has a more satisfying description:ben unwillingly divulges information to locke about the island, taking him on a journey to various locations including strange monuments and the mysterious jacob. back at the beach, juliet's secret is revealed. flashbacks will show us the origins of dharma and the history of the island, including 'the purge'.i love the allusion in the title of this episode, likely referring plot-wise to jacob.  this isn't the first time "lost" has given a nod to "the wizard of oz".  if you recall, ben called himself henry gale, a name he stole from a dead parachutist in the show, and a name the writers borrowed from the movie.also, the episode will be ben-centric and mikhail is supposed to have an appearance.

the brig

tuesday, may 01, 2007


wednesday, may 2 at 10/9clocke tries to persuade sawyer to help rid them of a great nemesis, and the survivors learn some shocking information about oceanic flight 815.i wonder what exactly was meant by naomi's testament: ''flight 815? the one from sydney? that's not possible....they found the plane. there were no survivors. they were all dead.''could the others have created some sort of decoy crash?  this seems far-fetched, but with money and connections, they could have faked it or had a false news story leaked.   it wouldn't be as hard to stage if "all the bodies and most of the plane were destroyed by fire."of course, the thrilling far-out sci-fi twist would be to have the outside world exist in a different future, one where the people on flight 815 didn't survive...this becomes very confusing when you consider it.
