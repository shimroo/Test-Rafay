intrinsic devices specializes in the 
        manufacture of nickel-titanium shape memory alloy products used for fastening, 
        sealing and electrical interconnection.   we produce a family 
        of standard heat shrinkable metal rings under the name unilok.  other products 
        include tensioning rods, expanding rings, and expanding plugs and pins.

our products incorporate sophisticated 
        materials science in order to deliver ease of use, exceptional performance 
        and the ultimate in reliability.  intrinsic's fasteners are self-installing, 
        building controlled preload forces which are independent of component 
        tolerances and operator-to-operator variation.  just position the 
        part and heat it above the specified temperature.  as long as the 
        mating components meet dimensional requirements, repeatable performance 
        is assured.

we serve commercial and military oem's 
        worldwide with quality products delivered on time.  applications 
        include sensors, downhole tools, aerospace systems, process equipment, 
        munitions, marine hardware and medical devices.

heat 
                  shrinkable rings for permanent and semi-permanent fastening, 
                  sealing and electrical interconnection. these rings have machined 
                  rectangular cross-sections. they are tabulated in english and 
                  metric dimensions in the links below.

these 
                    heat shrinkable rings are produced with the same material 
                    as the rings above, but manufactured by forming and welding 
                    round wire.
