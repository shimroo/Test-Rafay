dedicated chinese-language website for site signatures
as china's middle-class grows, so does the need for an expansion of a more comfortable, upscale shopping experience, and who better to create this than the wizards at site signatures. with an expansion of business into china, and a number of new strategic partnerships, site signatures chose to forego the machine translation route and have us produce a custom, professionally translated version of their current website. while it was our first foray into non-western websites, we know it won't be our last.


482 princeton-kingston road
the market for high end homes is weak, but in places like princeton, nj there are still enough buyers to make building a large home a worthwhile endeavor. that being said, it helps quite a bit if you can set yourself apart from the pack, and a great website can be a part of that strategy. working with an exceptional client, we just completed a website which showcases the charms of this unique estate, and allows buyers throughout the region, and beyond, to get a taste of what's available in princeton for a little over $2 million dollars!
