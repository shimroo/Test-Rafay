health care
there are many important reasons to work under a local 802 agreement. among the most important is access to quality health care and insurance. the local 802 musicians health fund was established in 1951 for musicians and their families and is administered by a joint board of employer and union trustees and a plan administrator.

benefits of union membership
why join local 802? musicians can achieve more pay, benefits, job security and respect with a union than if they try to negotiate separately on their own. secondly, the union movement empowers all of us to work together for more justice, equality, diversity, inclusiveness and fairness in all of society – it’s a great way to be a part of social change. thirdly, there are some core benefits in joining local 802, which you can see on this page.


benefits





allegro
from monthly updates on collective bargaining agreements to discussions about copyright protection, common challenges facing musicians and the joy of making music in the cultural capital of the world, allegro keeps musicians up to date about issues and ideas at the forefront of new york city’s music scene.

practicing at home
yes, you can practice in your home/apartment. no matter what your neighbor might say, the law is on your side: professional musicians have the right to practice in their apartments during reasonable hours. however, there are limitations, set by nyc regulations and rules that may govern your particular building.
