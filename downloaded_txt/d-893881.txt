why choose tcs?

		education is not just about developing the mind. it is about the transformation that takes place in the heart and character of a child as well. to do this, it is critical that students have an opportunity to learn about god, scripture, faith, and character integrated into the context of all of their academic subjects with teachers and staff that care about the hearts of our kids.
	



























 
  





respect, responsibility, gratitude, and genuineness

		we aim to equip our students to become productive members of church and society, demonstrating leadership and service as they learn and experience their god-given gifts and talents. to have a genuine relationship with christ, resulting in attitudes and actions that manifest respect, responsibility, and gratitude.
