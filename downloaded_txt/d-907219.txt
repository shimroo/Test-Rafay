       all of our kayaks are made in uk
 cornwalls original kayak shop



    largest independent kayak shop in cornwall
  at our showroom and workshops we have 125
kayaks for sale from dagger, venture kayaks, islander sit on tops, tootega, wilderness systems and gladiator paddleboards. we also stock paddles, spraydecks, buoyancy aids and kayaking and canoeing equipment from palm, nookie, streamlyte and ainsworth. most customers call to view the products and get advice at our unique rural kayak shop.

 as experienced paddlers and also kayak designers and manufacturers ourselves we have a pretty good understanding of what type of boat will best suit a paddler. before advising a model of kayak or canoe we will ask you questions about your experience (or lack of!), ambitions, family and friends who might use it and anything else of relevance. we will then recommend 2 or 3 models of kayak for you and explain the pros and cons of each model so you are able to make your own informed decision in order to best enjoy your canoeing or kayaking.  if you are just starting out take a look at some of our information pages such as the kayaks page or even give us a call.
