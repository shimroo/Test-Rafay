with us
ccs offers an educational program that is academically challenging and distinctively christian. each of us has been distinctly gifted and called to love god with our hearts as well as our minds. our hope is that our students will see themselves as important characters within god's story who are called to the remarkable work of worshiping and glorifying him in all they say and do. watch this video to hear one family's story about finding a place where all three of their boys–with different interests and personalities–could grow.
