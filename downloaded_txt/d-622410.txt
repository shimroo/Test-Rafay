 the
purpose of this page is to
highlight the artwork used on as many of the "official"

 pink floyd & solo cd releases as possible.









the cd's have been listed by
album name and by the country of origin. the
country of origin is (in most cases) taken from what is stated on the
cd label. this is important as originally all
cd's were made in japan,
even the locally available us and uk releases. these for instance will
be listed in the japanese section (as this is what is stated on the cd
label.)

points
to note....even though
these cds were made in japan, they were never intended for release in
japan. this may also be the case for other releases from around the
world. it is also common for the seperate components of a cd release to
be made in different countries. the cd, the artwork, the screen
printing and or another component (or any combination) could each be
produced in different countries. very confusing for the collector. this
is why one point of reference was selected.



i
have endeavoured to list the cds this way
so that anyone could look at a cd label and then find the corresponding
issue more easily. i'm sure there are errors, but over
time, with the help of other collectors the site will become more
accurate.
 to access a page click, on the
corresponding picture below
and then either return or click on one of the small album cover or flag
icons on any of
the following pages. please note that the solo cd's are not
accessible
via the country, only through the pages relevant to that artist. for
more
information see the site navigation page.
