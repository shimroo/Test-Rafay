nomos lxv, reconciliation and repair, published






april 21, 2023 8:47 am |
                james fleming (administrator)





nomos lxv, reconciliation and repair, edited by melissa schwartzberg and eric beerbohm, has been published by new york university press and distributed to all who were members of the asplp as of april 10. here is the description of the volume from the press's website: 
in the latest installment of the nomos series, a distinguished group of interdisciplinary scholars explore the erosion―and potential rebuilding―of civic bonds in response to injustice, wrongdoing, and betrayal. contributors address the possibility of reconciliation and repair, drawing on cutting-edge insights from the fields of political science, philosophy, and law. nine timely essays explore our pivotal moment in history, from the question of reparations for slavery to the from the art―and impact―of the public apology.
the editors of this volume encourage us to not only examine the roots of mistrust, but also to imagine a collective way forward, particularly as we face the continuing threat of the covid-19 pandemic. reconciliation and repair provides thought-provoking perspectives in an age where they are desperately needed.
join now or renew your membership: only $20 for students and post-docs and $50 for faculty. new or renewed members will receive reconciliation and repair soon.
click on "membership" above and then click on "join" or "renew." if you encounter problems, email jim fleming, the secretary-treasurer.
