welcome tost albansour mission - to make disciples of jesus from all nationsst albans is one part of christ’s body in our city, seeking to worship, serve and communicate god in all aspects of our lives; and to encourage one another on our journeys with jesus. we are a contemporary, family-oriented church which seeks to be biblical, mission-focussed and open to the leading and empowering of the holy spirit. our church is attended by people of many different cultures.we are committed to small groups, youth, young adults, children & families, sharing the gospel, overseas mission partnership and community involvement, as well as having a heritage of charismatic renewal and a recognition of the jewish roots of our faith.we have two sunday services at 8:30am & 10:15am. services are similar in content and style but the early service does not include children and youth programmes. at our second service all ages begin together in our relaxed and friendly style of worship and then during the service move to their age-related programmes for pre-schoolers, primary-schoolers, intermediate and high school groups.morning tea is served after the service and a shared lunch is held on the first sunday of the month after the service.
