your fun is our priority 



									we’re all about making sure you have a really fun time when you book a trip at riversedge outfitters. our trained and professional staff makes sure all of our equipment is maintained and that our facilities are clean which is why people from columbus, dayton, and cincinnati continue to come back to riversedge year after year.								











what’s the difference between raft,
canoe, and kayak rentals? 



if you’re not familiar with the difference between these types of watercraft, here’s a quick breakdown. 











 







kayak rentals 



kayak rentals are single-seat watercraft that have a sit on top and are easy for paddlers to climb into. paddlers have a double-bladed paddle to navigate on both sides. these are usually for people who want to be individually in control of their own watercraft, though we do offer tandem kayaks as well. some people consider kayak rentals easier to steer than canoe rentals, but that’s your choice to make! 



















kayak description 



riversedge offers sit-on-top recreational kayaks that are ideal for beginners and warm weather paddling. these kayaks are wide and stable, making them difficult to tip over, with an open cockpit design that allows easy entry and exit from the kayak. the sit-on-top style features a built-in backrest and footrests for comfort. the sit-on-top design is user-friendly for first-time paddlers and offers the ability to easily slide in and out of the kayak for swimming off the deck. 











canoe rentals 



canoe rentals are an open-top watercraft that typically have seating for two or sometimes more people. for a typical two-seat canoe rental, each paddler will have a single-bladed paddle to propel on one side at a time, in coordination with the other paddler. canoe rentals are unavailable on our 9 mile kenton’s run trip. 







 



















canoeing description 



riversedge canoes are designed for two people. we do offer special canoes with a third seat in the middle. our canoes comfortably accommodate two moderate-weight adults, with a combined weight not exceeding 500 pounds. alternatively, it’s suitable for one or two children to sit in the middle seat with two adults. 











 







raft rentals 



raft rentals are great for family outings, as they are easier to maneuver and have more seating. kayak and canoe rentals are more designed for speed, so raft rentals will typically result in a slightly longer, more leisurely float down the river. raft rentals are unavailable on our 9-mile kenton’s run trip. 



















rafting description 



riversedge offers raft rentals that are perfect for family outings and leisurely river adventures. their rafts are specifically designed for a more relaxed and scenic float down the river, rather than focusing on speed like kayaks and canoes. the spacious rafts can comfortably accommodate larger groups, making them an ideal choice for families or friend groups looking to spend quality time together on the water.

what about dogs?

due to insurance restrictions we cannot allow dogs on our property at riversedge.

river levels explained.









what about alcohol?

we highly discourage the consumption of alcohol on the river, and you need to know that you can be ticketed on any river in ohio for an open container violation. occasionally there are water craft officers on the river that will ticket you for having an open container of alcohol. we also will refuse to rent to anyone who has rented watercraft from us previously and returned intoxicated and disorderly.









is there an age requirement?

the minimum age is 3 years of age and/or 30 pounds. our smallest life jacket will fit a child 30-50 pounds.







can i use a credit card for payment?

yes, we accept mastercard, visa, and discover. you can also make your reservation online, including making payment.







how late can i stay on the river?

we close at 6:30 pm, our last trip is at 4:00 pm and we require that you return by the closing time of 6:30 pm. a late fee of $10.00 per boat, per half hour will be charged. please keep in mind that our staff does this seven days a week, and would like to leave at normal closing time to spend time with their families and prepare for the next day.







what should i take on the river?

you should leave all valuables in your vehicle or at home. jewelry is highly discouraged because it can slip or come off if you enter the water and will be lost. you should have a good pair of water shoes because there is a possibility of stepping on sharp rocks while on your trip, we do have water shoes available to purchase. coolers are okay if you want to take a lunch and have a picnic on one of the many beaches however, we ask that the cooler not be styrofoam and be medium size to fit in most boats. glass containers are not allowed. car keys should not be taken on the river! we have a key rack you may leave your keys on while you are on the river.







how many people can ride in one raft?

the large raft can hold about 5-6 adults of moderate weight, a few more if some are children. the smaller raft is great for up to 4 adults or a family group of a few more with small children.







how many people can ride in one canoe?

most of our canoes are designed for two people. we do have special canoes with a third seat in the middle. this allows three moderate weight adults to comfortably fit in the same canoe – total weight of the three should not to exceed 500 pounds. the same 3rd seat canoe will work great for 1 or 2 children to sit in the middle of the canoe with 2 adults.







how many people can ride in one kayak?

most of our kayaks are designed for one person. we do have tandem kayaks that are designed for two people.







do you shuttle private canoes and kayaks?

due to insurance restrictions we are not allowed to transport privately owned watercraft on our vehicles, or allow any privately owned watercraft on the property. we cannot allow privately owned watercraft to exit at our takeout. we cannot allow the parking of any vehicles at riversedge that are transporting privately owned watercraft. we do want all boat owners to be able to experience to beauty of the little miami river by accessing the river at the many public access points. just 1/3 of a mile above riversedge is a public access with a concrete boat ramp, and great parking. this is the access that you should use to float our section of river. it is the spring valley wildlife area river access located on roxanna road, just off of route 42.








do i need to make a reservation?

yes, reservations are required because they allow us to limit the number of people on a give hour and offer the best service possible.







what about the $1 donation?

every time that you float with riversedge you are helping conserve the little miami river! we donate $1 for each boat rented to the little miami conservancy!







when are children free?

with 2 paying adults in a canoe or a small raft, children under 12 are no cost. canoes, tandem kayaks and small raft all require 2 paid persons. a large raft requires 3 paid persons, and then children under 12 are no cost.
