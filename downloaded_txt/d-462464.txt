i get to stand in front of a mirror and just move my body and sweat and have a good laugh with women of all different ages, enjoying their bodies and music. i’ve been with these dance classes for the last 8 years because it’s not just about me, it’s about this community of women and men working out together.

you’re not just coming only coming in for fitness and dance, you’re learning something too. i’m much happier when i do the classes and i’ve  really grown as a person over the last few years thanks to my experience at dance dynamics.

exercise used to be a chore, but now it’s the best part of my day! during the lesson you don’t realise how hard you’re working and then afterward, you’re like, ah, that was really hard. it’s just the best, i love it.

there’s no judgement with dance dynamics, it's always inclusive and there’s never any pressure to be able to keep up with any of the instructors and they’re always very encouraging.

dance dynamics is a very supportive and open atmosphere, all the instructors get to know you on a personal level and it’s a nice, casual, social approach to fitness. i don’t feel like i’m working out, even when i do sweat up a storm some days, and i love just being able to come to so many different styles of dance classes.

the minute i get in the door, there’s like this electric energy, there’s nothing better when there’s music already playing, it gets you in the vibe, you’re ready for it. i am absolutely not trained, so i was nervous about it, but i would tell people, no matter what you skill level is, you will find it so okay and just so fine once you get in there.
