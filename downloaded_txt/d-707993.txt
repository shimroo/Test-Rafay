biography

                  anne jeffreys seems able to be almost any place, any time, any
                  guise-- so great is her versatility.
                  starting her professional career when a teenager, miss jeffreys
                  was a leading junior model for john robert powers in new york,
                  while studying for an operatic career.
                  she was offered and accepted a role in a musical review,
                  "fun for the money," to be done in hollywood, which
                  led to her winning her first movie role, it was "i married
                  an angel," with her idols janette macdonald and nelson
                  eddy.
                  next, she was put under contract to republic studios and made
                  a dozen films for them. one was "flying tigers" with
                  john wayne.
                  r.k.o. bought out her contract in order for her to co-star
                  with frank sinatra "step lively," between her many
                  career film assignments at r.k.o., she managed to continue her
                  singing career by performing with the new york symphony and the
                  ford symphony  and the los angeles opera company.
                  kurt weill heard her sing "tosca" at the brooklyn
                  opera house and hailed her for his musical version of the
                  elmer rice pulitzer prize play "street scene," for
                  which she received critical acclaim. this started her love for
                  the stage.
                  next came "my romance," a play by edward sheldon.
                  the role was tailored for her talents by mr. j.j. shubert, who
                  commissioned sigmund romberg to compose the music. she toured
                  as well as played it on broadway for a season.
                  miss jeffreys performed for the three seasons and the greek
                  theatre in los angeles, alternating with
                  "bittersweet" and "the merry widow." while
                  there, cole porter offered her "kiss me kate." she
                  spent two years and 887 consecutive performances in that
                  classic musical.
                  during her "kate" run at the shubert theatre in new
                  york, she met robert sterling, then starring in "the
                  grameroy ghost" at the adjoining morosco theatre. the
                  columnists dubbed them "the romance of shubert
                  alley." they were married six month after they met.
                  "three wishes for jamie" was the next broadway
                  starter for miss jeffreys, after which she joined forces and
                  talents with her husband; they toured top nightclubs and
                  hotels in the country including the waldorf in new york, the
                  sands in las vegas, palmer house in chicago, the coconut grove
                  in los angeles and the fairmont in san francisco.
                  their highly successful club act let to the long running and
                  ever popular "topper" tv series, in which they
                  delighted audiences all over the world as george and marion
                  kirby -- "the ghosts with the most."
after two years of filming 86 "toppers," miss
                  jeffreys "semi-retired" for her role as wife and
                  mother. when she did accept a role, usually her three sons,
                  jeffreys, dana and tyler, with nurse in tow, went with her.
                  she managed to do "destry rides again" for the same
                  companies, which later they repeated at the lincoln centre in
                  new york and then on tour.
                  alan lerner persuaded her to take over the broadway company of
                  "camelot" and tour with it for six months in
                  philadelphia and washington, d.c. it remains on of her
                  favorite roles along with "the king and i," which
                  she has done many times.
                  miss jeffreys has appeared on most of the top dramatic shows
                  on tv as well as musical specials., talk shows and even a soap
                  opera she received a golden globe award nomination for her
                  work in "the delphi bureau" series.
                  some of her other theatre performances include
                  "carousel," "anniversary waltz,"
                  "bells are ringing," "ninothcka,"
                  "desert song," "do i hear a waltz?"
                  "song of norway," "most happy fella,"
                  "no sex please, we're british," "take me
                  along," "follies," "and "the king and
                  i."
                  an aquarian, born in north carolina, miss jeffreys says she
                  owes everything to her mother, who started and managed her
                  career and even chose robert sterling as the man she should
                  marry. after 50 years of happy marriage and three fine sons --
                  and a well rounded career -- the gregarious actress says,
                  "my life has been a full, happy and active on; and i hope
                  i'll always be as busy as a blind dog in a meat shop. i thrive
                  on activity."
