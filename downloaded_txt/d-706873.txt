are your people performing at their full potential?


people often know exactly what they need to do to achieve their goals. but they have trouble staying motivated and following through long term.
the problem is that their habitual focus tends to be limiting and negative, keeping them in suboptimal patterns of thoughts and emotions…which leads to poor performance.

your organization is a sum of many such minds.
so, how do you achieve enduring success where individuals, teams, and leaders are aligned in purpose and performance?
 
 
 
 



wayne lee has studied the secrets of high performers and in his wildly entertaining presentations, he shows you how subconscious programming was the key to achieving their biggest goals and how you can put the same scientific principles to work to produce next-level results in your life and business.

he has helped over 6,000 global organizations achieve sustainable peak performance through the right mindset, collective alignment, and the power to overcome what seemed unthinkable yesterday.

rapidly shift your culture from surviving to thriving

 
 
 





activate your future vision
your people will learn to become visionaries seeing new possibilities and solutions in themselves and their teams and raising the bar for themselves.

 
 
 




clear your subconscious blocks
by fixing their focus and breaking out of old, negative patterns of thinking, your people will be influenced by what’s powerful, positive, and productive and create momentum moving forward.

 
 
 




elevate your flow state
as your people spend more time in resourceful emotional states, they gain access to an abundance of inner resources like creativity and energy and follow through on what’s most important.

 
 
 
 
 





 



“a perfect balance of talent & teaching.”
darrell johnston, regional vice president, eastern canada, compass group canada
 
 
 


for over 25 years, wayne lee has been one of north america’s premier corporate presenters, entertainers, and peak performance experts. during his career, he has helped people from over 6000 organizations and various walks of life develop the subconscious mindset that allows them to perform at a high level no matter what challenges they face.
it's a mindset that empowered him to become a 5-time national wrestling champion and achieve excellence his whole career, but it trance-formed him even more during the pandemic when business came to a screeching halt. faced with such an intense season of adversity, wayne had to double down on his own mindset to pivot and grow in new and unexpected ways.
 
 

experiencing again how mindset can change everything further fueled his lifelong passion for empowering people to achieve their full potential. he began coaching and developed an enhanced system for achieving peak performance, the trance-form process.
today, he works with leading brands to guide their teams through the high-stress, constant change, and fast-paced environment that is now commonplace. wayne shows each audience how to reconnect with what matters most so they can achieve any result, all while enjoying the ride of their life.
