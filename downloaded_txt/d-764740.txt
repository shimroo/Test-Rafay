what is socr? 

								the goals of the statistics online computational resource (socr)
								are to design, validate and freely disseminate knowledge. our
								resource specifically provides portable online aids for
								probability and statistics education, technology based
								instruction and statistical computing. socr tools and resources
								include a repository of interactive applets, computational and
								graphing tools, instructional and course materials. 






what are the main socr
								components?

								the core socr educational and computational components include:
								distributions (interactive graphs and
								calculators), experiments (virtual computer-generated
								analogs of popular games and processes), analyses (collection of common
								web-accessible tools for statistical data analysis), games (interfaces and simulations to
								real-life processes), modeler (tools for distribution, polynomial
								and spectral model-fitting and simulation), graphs, plots and charts (comprehensive
								web-based tools for exploratory data analysis), additional tools (other statistical tools
								and resources), socr wiki (collaborative wiki resource), educational materials and hands-on
									activities (varieties of socr educational materials), socr statistical consulting and statistical
									computing libraries.
 

java browser issues

 as of spring 2020, internet
									explorer (ie) is one of the very few browsers that support
								front-end java-applets on client machines. using ei to run socr
								java applets requires adding "http://www.socr.ucla.edu"
								and "http://www.socr.ucla.edu" to the exception
									site list managed in the java security tab, see 
									find the java control panel. the exception site list is shown
								in the tab, and the socr url's have to be added to the list to
								allow the socr java applets to run in the browser. see
									these instructions. 
 chrome browser users need to explicitly allow  java
									applets to run in the browser window. this is accomplished by
								manually enabling the npapi plugins
								(chrome://flags/#enable-npapi). 



as of 2021, java applets are depricated ... consider using some of these alternatives:

how to use the
								socr resources?

								there are three major types of socr users: educators, students
								and tool developers. course instructors and teachers
								will find the socr class notes and interactive tools useful for
								student motivation, concept demonstrations and for enhancing
								their technology based pedagogical approaches to any study of
								variation and uncertainty. students and trainees may find
								the socr class notes, analyses, computational and graphing tools
								extremely useful in their learning/practicing pursuits. model
									developers, software programmers and other engineering,
								biomedical and applied researchers may find the light-weight
								plug-in oriented socr computational libraries and infrastructure
								useful in their algorithm designs and research efforts. the
								three types of socr resources are:


interactive java
										applets: these include a number of different applets,
									simulations, demonstrations, virtual experiments, tools for
									data visualization and analysis, etc. all applets require a
									java-enabled browser (if you see a blank screen, see the socr
										feedback to find out how to configure your browser).
instructional
										resources: these include data, electronic textbooks,
									tutorials, etc.
learning
										activities: these include various interactive hands-on
									activities.
socr
										video tutorials (including general and tool-specific
									screencasts).


socr support
								please consider
									making donations of any size to support socr student stipends
								(for  resource development and conference travel) and instructor-training/continuing-education 
								workshops (travel and stipends for k-16 educators to attend
								annual socr-events).
