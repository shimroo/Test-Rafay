cold at chinese new year?
wed, 2012-01-18 16:27 â mr tall

youâll hear it this week (if you havenât heard it already): chinese new year is coming up, so itâs going to be cold!
the assumption that chinese new year (cny hereafter) invariably brings a cold snap is deeply-ingrained in hong kong culture, among natives and expats alike. read more »

the research study that i have long awaited has finally been published. an article in the wall street journal summarizes the work of researchers in the usa who have identified and analysed âpedestrian aggressiveness syndromeâ: read more »

how to start a one-man business in hong kong
tue, 2010-09-28 17:35 â mrb

i'm just starting on this, so i'll jot down notes as i go along.
there are three options for starting a company in hong kong: a sole proprietor, a limited partnership, or a limited liability company (llc).
there's a summary of the differences between them on this website. though as you read their final recommendation, keep in mind that their business is to sell you a service to setup a limited company! read more »

hong kong museums
wed, 2010-03-24 09:00 â mr tall

although i've mentioned hong kong's museums in an article on things to do for visitors, i thought i'd spend a bit more time discussing their relative merits -- and deficiencies. i feel much more qualified to do so at the moment than i did several years ago, since daughter tall is now entering the optimum age range for museum action (she's seven going on eight). so let's take a little tour of our fair city's publicly-funded repositories of history and culture. read more »

hong kong's urban heat island
fri, 2010-02-05 09:00 â mr tall


the
theme of my first hong kong climate change article was simple:
average yearly temperatures here have been going up more less steadily
since the hong kong observatory (hko) starting keeping track of them,
but
they have skyrocketed in recent decades. yet over the past 60 years,
essentially all of this warming has occurred at night, i.e.read more »

climate change in hong kong
fri, 2010-01-29 09:00 â mr tall

the message from the hong kong observatory is unequivocal: global warming is real; itâs affecting hong kongâs recent and current weather in obvious ways; and future trends for the world, and perhaps for hong kong especially, are ominous. read more »

where do you shop?
thu, 2009-11-19 09:00 â mrb

in particular, where do you go to buy tvs, cameras, computers, mobile phones, etc?
our suggestions about this on batgung are around six years old. then we wrote about visiting small stores to get a good deal, but these days i find i'm more likely to go to the big chain stores, especially if shopping with visitors.
i feel the difference in price between them has got much smaller - or maybe i've just got more cranky, and can't be bothered visiting lots of shops. so, cranky or rational - that's the question i hope you'll help answer.
here's where i bought most recently: read more »

thu, 2009-10-29 09:00 â mr tall

twenty years in hong kong
thu, 2009-10-22 09:00 â mrb

20 oct 1989. that's the first hong kong stamp in my passport.
twenty years already? that's gone past quickly. will i be here for another twenty?
our younger daughter is only three, and we want her to grow up reading and writing chinese. that means another ten years at least. then even if we did move, where would we go?
