      phonicstutorâ®: the ultimate interactive phonics tutorial software!










              phonics software
            

 the phonicstutor method of instruction teaches students the common sounds for an extended set of orton-gillingham phonograms with spelling rules. beginning with single-letter phonograms and single-syllable words and progressing to multi-letter phonograms and multi-syllable words, phonicstutor allows students to gain phonemic awareness without the frustration of memorizing a large set of phonograms and associated spelling rules before reading words and sentences. by grouping words together that have a common spelling pattern and similar pronunciation, students can easily understand which phonogram says which phoneme. the phonics lesson plans in phonicstutor include presentation and investigation of the words, word analysis, word pronunciation, and a spelling test. most lessons end with dictation of sentences. phonicstutor is easy enough to use by a 4-year old with supervision and is self-teaching for children ages 6 and older.

phonicstutor has a reputation of teaching students of all ages to read when other methods have failed. special education teachers and dyslexia experts highly recommend it for dyslexia and other reading disabilities.

phonicstutorâ® is by far the best and most complete phonics, reading, and spelling curriculum for the computer that i have ever seen. phonics tutor is superior in that it combines all three of these essential subjects into one comprehensive program.

              "ironically, the method that research upholds as the most empirically validated is also the most demanding: phonics-based learning. tedious for kids, exceedingly difficult for both amateurs and professionals, the phonics method has been a pedagogical stepchild: respected, but definitely disliked. because of this status, it's a pleasure to see that an old favorite of education update, 4:20 communication's phonicstutor has finally released a new addition to its well-received phonics-based reading software, phonicstutor frequent words edition." mitchell levine, reviewer

homeschool mother praising the self-teaching benefit of 
			phonicstutor
i have used phonicstutor now with 3 of 
			my 6 children and i absolutely love it! it does a thorough 
			job of teaching phonics, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation 
			skills as well as getting them off to a great start reading. with a 
			large family, i appreciate the self-teaching nature of the program. 
			i can work with another child while phonicstutor does an excellent 
			job teaching phonics to my early reader. i use a self-teaching 
			literary approach to homeschooling with a lot of classic literature, 
			so good reading skills are fundamental to the success of my 
			homeschool program. 
			thanks for a great program! tiffani,

 reading specialist
i am a reading specialist with an edm in the 
			psychology of reading from temple university in philadelphia. it was 
			an exceptional program with exceptional teachers. however, the real 
			world of the reading clinician is a far cry from the graduate 
			school. currently, i am an independent contractor doing tutoring in 
			all areas of literacy. many of my students are socially and 
			emotionally disturbed and exhibit all of the concomitant behavior 
			problems that are the results of their frustration with their 
			diagnosed dyslexia. the plain black and white presentations (of 
			phonicstutor) allow a chronological senior to work on his or her 
			grade two level sans embarrassment. the explicit and analytical 
			lessons include all of the elements of research proven methodology. 
			i have several anecdotes that i could relate. the one that most 
			exemplifies the effectiveness of phonicstutor is of mk. his gates 
			presented him to me as having scored a 1.9. mk is a seventh grader 
			with some severe cognitive issues, the most demanding of which is 
			his lack of short-term memory. i have worked with mk for six months 
			and he now reads on an early fourth grade level. i have had very 
			similar results with other students. i am equally impressed with 
			this program as a means by which i can provide help to other ecd 
			folks and to those who have become reading specialists along with 
			their elementary ed. training. phonicstutor packages a wonderful 
			diagnostic and palliative program that is easy to learn and produces 
			wonderful results when implemented properly. paul, 
"i can truly say we have tried them all.  i can 
			truly say that my children would have been left behind if it had not 
			been for phonicstutor. this program has brought our two children 
			from reading on a second grade level to 7th and 8th grade levels in 
			six short months. this is something we did not achieve with all the 
			money we spent on other programs and special education teachers. the 
			stress is now gone thanks to phonicstutor. our children now have the 
			strength, courage, and success to continue with a strong education. 
			they have mastered 'severe' learning disabilities." roxanne

              "...phonicstutor is so intense on phonics that we use it as a 
				differential diagnosis of a reading disability. if a student 
				cannot gain in phonemic awareness through this program, they 
				never will. i would go so far as to say the program "retrains" 
				the brain. we are completely sold on the program. we have seen 
				nothing better in our 28 years in education..." jack
