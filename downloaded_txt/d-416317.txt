the energy situation
            in the u.s. is making for some changes in the renewable energy
            industry; most major suppliers and manufacturers have increased
            their prices. we endeavor to keep our web pages current, 
			but there are so many pages and prices to change--well, call us to be
            sure our information is up-to-date.
we are trying to keep our customers and
            renewable energy partners as informed as possible so you may plan
            accordingly.  call for your current pricing and availability.
