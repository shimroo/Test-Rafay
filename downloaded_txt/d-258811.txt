about us

there is nothing more exciting than bringing new products to life, and that is a daily thing here at paperartsy! we work with more than a dozen stamp designers, each of whom bring something new and unique to the wide range of paperartsy collections.
in september 2020 we relocated the business from the uk to france, which as you can probably imagine, was a challenge mid-pandemic. we are open for orders and ship worldwide daily with tracked service.
