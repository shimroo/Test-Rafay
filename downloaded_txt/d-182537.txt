the early church was unashamedly pentecostal. speaking in tongues, divine healing, prophecy, and other gifts of the holy spirit were the norm, not the exception. in their midst were christian prophets and god-called apostles. these very same spiritual gifts and ministries exist in the church today.
pentecostalism is the fastest-growing segment of worldwide christianity. the pentecostal and charismatic movements were major religious events in the 20th century. some researchers estimate that the pentecostal church today, in its varied expressions worldwide, is second only to the roman catholic church in numbers of professing christians.
pastor jim feeney has more than 50 years of sermon preaching and bible teaching ministry in spirit-filled churches. he brings to the pulpit broad experience from his years as an air force officer and faa air traffic controller, followed by several decades of fulltime ministry in pastoring and in bible college teaching.
in 2004 jim sensed the lord's direction to start this website and to present bible studies and free sermons online for pastors, sunday school teachers, bible students, and everyone hungry for god's holy word â focused on important bible teachings from a spirit-filled perspective. he has deliberately concentrated primarily on pentecostal-charismatic beliefs and practices in the selection of topics â providing you with hundreds of his free online bible teachings and sermons on healing the sick, miracles, the holy spirit baptism, speaking in tongues, spiritual gifts, the 'fivefold ministry,' and much more. pastor jim also has included some messages on what the bible says about the end times. come see.
