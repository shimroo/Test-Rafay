  good bye and thank you
 iâve been avoiding this for months, but it needs to be done.
the new england anomaly website has run its course.  i am no longer updating this website.
although i am still involved with local museum work and cemetery studies, my interests are taking me elsewhere, and i need to move on.  besides, there are people who do this sort of thing better than me, so i leave them to do it.
thank you to my readers (all two of you), for supporting me all these years.  itâs been fun.
take care!
