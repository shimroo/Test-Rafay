paul has been my chiropractor for over 10 years and i‚Äôve always had good results from him. since having heart bypass surgery a couple months ago i started having numbness and tingling not associated with the surgery. he listened as i told him what & where was bothering me. his treatment helped give me relief. i will be back to continue the treatments.

dr. marsh is very attentive and in tune to his patients needs. his front office staff has a lot of empathy for his patients. when dr.marsh says he‚Äôs going to do something he does it, which is very refreshing. his appointments are also always at the time scheduled. no long waits in the waiting room!!!
