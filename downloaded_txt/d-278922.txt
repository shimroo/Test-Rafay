helping adults to help young children








before we begin, we would like to clarify:

hilltop early childhood services  does not provide direct child care services.

we do provide:
professional development (pd)/training, consulting, and presentations/keynotes to early childhood education professionals, aspiring professionals, families, and supporters of high quality early childhood education.  we help our clients solve problems.

let's take a journey!
