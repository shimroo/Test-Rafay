"sheila kassay has expert knowledge of the real estate market and remarkable people skills. she helped us find renters 20 years ago and, with her finger on the pulse of the market, helped us achieve our objectives in our recent sale—all with attention and care for the people involved. we would definitely work with sheila again!"  ★★★★★

"the entire team at finest is so professional, helpful and knowledgeable about their market. as a tenant (for 9 years), they found me 2 lovely apartments, and as a landlord (for 26 years) they have brought me the most wonderful long-term tenants that stayed for an average of 6 years each. there's a reason i've worked with them, and no one else, for 35 years - they are simply the best!"  ★★★★★

" i had a wonderful experience  with finest realty. during the pandemic my landlord sold his house. i was having such a difficult time finding another rental.  i came across finest & got a call from doug. he immediately searched for housing for myself & my partner. we saw 3 apts & i liked one,  the next thing i know i was meeting to finalize. but the best part about finest is that i didn't have to do any chasing to get answers, i received quick responses to all my questions. i recommend finest realty rental to anyone looking for a rental." ★★★★★joanne g.
