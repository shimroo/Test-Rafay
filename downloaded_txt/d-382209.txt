a proud family tradition
the outwater family has been providing homes and businesses with pure water from the same natural spring since the founding of belmar spring water in 1924. through three generations, our family has remained committed to providing consistently dependable service. we’ve remained local so we can develop and maintain relationships with our valued customers.
a deep, underground spring running under our protected land is the source of belmar spring water, which we quickly bottle and deliver to ensure the fresh, crisp taste our water is known for. and you can feel confident in knowing exactly where the water is coming from – the same pure spring for more than 90 years. can you say that about the “big” bottled water companies? you know you can rely on belmar spring water for the best taste and the highest quality.
throughout the bottling process, we ensure our water’s quality and purity by following strict controls and closely adhering to good manufacturing practice codes and purity guidelines established by the international bottled water association(ibwa) as well as all fda and state standards. when you drink belmar spring water, you can be confident that you’re enjoying the purest, best-tasting water.
we are local. that means our water is fresh, not shipped across the country but delivered to you right after bottling. being local also helps us control costs and pass the savings to our customers!
