instruments, digital gauges, alarms and monitors
 we manufacture a wide range of intelligent instruments, digital gauges, alarms and monitors 
	designed for use in the commercial/leisure marine, motor home/rv and emergency vehicle (fire truck and ambulance) markets.   our product lines include engine gauges, fuel/fuel consumption and tankage
	gauges, electrical gauges, gas detectors, depth, speed, wind sensors and digital instruments, pc based fishfinders and electronic accessories such as chain counters,
	nmea combiners, digital clocks, bilge alarms, etc. 
these intelligent gauges either contain built-in calibration curves for all popular standard resistive senders - both european 
	and american styles, or learn the sender characteristics and compensate for odd tank shapes.  custom 0-5v, 4-20ma and high voltage versions are also available by special order.   
	most cruzpro gauges work on both 12v and 24v, have built-in user settable high and low alarms and output 
	nmea 0183 serial data to aid remote monitoring or logging of performance data. 
to insure a reliable long life in the harsh marine environment our products are constructed using uv stable aes plastic, stainless steel hardware, solvent resistant silicon rubber gaskets 
	and o-rings, lexan brand polycarbonate and 3m adhesives.
most cruzpro gauges are ce certified and rohs compliant (environmentally friendly and lead free).  all products enjoy a full twelve (12) month parts and workmanship warranty.   we ship worldwide to areas 
	not served by a local dealer and oem inquiries for branded products are welcomed.
