27th-mar-2009 06:16 pm - a poem should floatchoriambkay ryan reflects on role as nation's poet laureate online newhour 3/25/09jeffrey brown asks kay ryan whether she makes "a conscious effort to get [her poetry] down to an essence," or whether that's just the way she thinks:kay ryan: it's apparently the way i think. i would like to say that, if a poem feels really dense, it isn't good. i mean, if you put it in your hand and it falls through your hand, that's no good. it's got to float.if you have this idea of compressed language, it gives people a sense that it's going to be dense and kind of oppressive, whereas i would like to think that it can be highly selected, but not make you feel that you've just had a vitamin pill.

18th-mar-2009 04:04 pm - how strained can a rhyme be before it's too strained?choriamb good interview w/andrew hudgins: from worse to verse: quirks of behavior provoke rhymes from professor bill eichenberger - the columbus dispatch - 3/15/08 q: how strained can a rhyme be before it's too strained? a: ogden nash made a career and a lot of funny poems out of pushing rhymes just a hair too far. ("parsley/is gharsley"!) for nash, going too far is the point - and it's what makes us laugh. but rhymes are a bit like puns. some please us with their exactness or their surprise or their stretches, while others leave us cold, or actually make us turn up our noses. me, i love all sorts of puns, the worse the better. q: you actually found a rhyme for the word "scrotum." is that the poet's equivalent of scaling mt. everest? a: it's more like a kid's finding the perfect snowball to throw at a top hat. then happening, in this day and age, to find an old gentleman walking down your street wearing a top hat. then hoping that your aim is good enough to hit the hat. "factotum" is worth thinking about. "totem"? "float 'em"? also see: poets on process: an interview with andrew hudgins 11/20/2008 by frank giampietro the southeast review

11th-mar-2009 02:33 pm - an examination of the poet in time of warchoriamb"'the war, people said, had revived their interest in poetry,' said virginia woolf after the first world war. this phenomenon has repeated itself. following september 11 and, subsequently, following the most recent invasion of iraq, people who weren't ordinarily interested in poetry suddenly read poems. poets who didn't ordinarily pay attention to public events suddenly wrote poems responding to them. and while it's easy to welcome anything that increases the audience of an ancient art, that welcome may disguise perennially intractable questions. what is a desire to read poetry in a time of social crisis really a desire for? should a poet feel that by writing a poem he has truly fulfilled a social responsibility? should a reader feel that a poem responding to calamitous events is a better poem than a poem about shop windows?"an examination of the poet in time of warby james longenbach from the antioch review, winter 2009reprinted at poetry daily

8th-mar-2009 04:16 pm - be negativechoriamb going negative: a “necessary skeptic” says what he really thinks about new books by jane mead, d.a. powell, and john poch.poetry march 2009 by jason guriel"but negativity, i’m starting to think, needs to be the poetry reviewer’s natural posture, the default position she assumes before scanning a single line. because really, approaching every new book with an open mind is as well-meaning but ultimately exhausting as approaching every stranger on the street with open arms; you’ll meet some nice people, sure, but your charming generosity won’t be reciprocated most of the time. what’s worse, a tack-sharp taste, dinged by so much sheer dullness, will in time become blunted (into blurb-writing, no doubt). when braving any new book of poems—particularly by an author you’re not too familiar with—it’s best to brace yourself and expect the worst. this needn’t involve cynicism. indeed, you probably shouldn’t be opening the book in the first place if you aren’t, on some deep level, already hoping for the best—that is, the discovery of a great poem. but hope should remain on that deep level, well-protected, until the shell that shields it is genuinely jarred."

3rd-mar-2009 02:47 pm - let poetry be restored to the marketplacechoriamb"t. s. eliot, wallace stevens, william carlos williams. auden, yeats, pound, frost and others...were amateurs—in the best sense of the word. they wrote poetry for love whether or not they were paid. they had day jobs: banker (eliot), doctor (williams), insurance executive (wallace stevens), librarian (philip larkin). as they say: subsidize something and you get more of it. and boy, we have whole anthills of poets today. as epstein summarized the field, poetry 'flourishes in a vacuum.' more than 250 universities had creative writing programs when he wrote, all with a poetry component. dana gioia, in an excellent atlantic monthly article in 1991, put the figure at 200. with 10 students in each section, he wrote, unreassuringly, 'these programs alone will produce about 20,000 accredited professional poets over the next decade.'" "...cut off all the subsidies. let poetry be restored to the marketplace. maybe 150 poets would survive, as in 1941. no such cuts will happen, of course, if only because there are so many generous-hearted and wealthy people around who cannot imagine that more money for something good in itself (poetry) will not produce more of the good; and may actually stifle it."poets galore and subsidized poets  by tom bethell american spectator 3.3.09

2nd-mar-2009 03:23 pm - ransacking other literatureschoriamball around the world the same song:how globe-trotting poetries may not beat scrawls in a cave.by c. k. williams, poetry foundation "this is what happened to me and to many other poets during the the late fifties and early sixties, when much of the poetry being written in america seemed to have become overly formalized, self-referential, stale, and, if i dare use the word, spiritually lifeless. artists are always ranging over their own traditions, searching for viable models of inspiration, but i believe that our mostly unconscious realization during those years that we were at a dead end drove many of us to ransack literatures other than our own, no matter how grand our own surely is. we needed—desperately, it felt then—other cultures, other histories, other poetries, in order to discover aesthetics that would disrupt those we’d inherited. we wanted new models that would make unfamiliar demands, and offer new freedom, new inspiration."

1st-mar-2009 01:43 pm - no monster hogweed in u.s. poetry cropchoriambstepping stones: interviews with seamus heaney‘the hazel stirred’: death of a naturalist (excerpt from stepping stones) found at poetry daily____________________________________________"'remote on the one hand from the banal, on the other from the eccentric, his genius was calculated to win at once the adhesion of the general public and the admiration, both sympathetic and stimulating, of the connoisseur.' so writes thomas mann about gustav von aschenbach, great writer and national institution, in death in venice; and the description applies unexpectedly well to seamus heaney. heaney is in obvious ways unlike mann's apollonian aesthete, but he too has managed to win the love of the many and the esteem of the few, in a way that no american poet since frost has managed. as heaney observes in this important book-length interview, designed to serve in lieu of a memoir, 'in the united states, there's a great crop of ripe, waving poetry--but there's no monster hogweed sticking up out of it.' but he has always been that hogweed in the small but teeming field of irish poetry, and for the past forty years heaney has led the richly burdened existence of the responsible artist."in the word-hoardadam kirsch, the new republic march 04, 2009

21st-feb-2009 03:49 pm - u.s. poetry about to run out of greatnesschoriambthe great(ness) game david orr 2.19.09 new york times"when we lose sight of greatness, we cease being hard on ourselves and on one another; we begin to think of real criticism as being 'mean' rather than as evidence of poetry’s health; we stop assuming that poems should be interesting to other people and begin thinking of them as being obliged only to interest our friends — and finally, not even that. perhaps most disturbing, we stop making demands on the few artists capable of practicing the art at its highest levels. instead, we cling to the ground in those artists’ shadows — john ashbery’s is enormous at this point — and talk about how rich the darkness is and how lovely it is to be a mushroom. this doesn’t help anyone."

20th-feb-2009 06:42 pm - greater acceptance of comedy in poetrychoriamb "a significant change in recent american poetry is the greater acceptance of comedy and humour as intrinsically valuable – not only as literary ends but as means to ends that are not necessarily comic. poets are increasingly using comic elements, wit, jokes and humour to enhance and complicate a poem's 'statement.' the prejudice against funny poems – institutionalized in the very category of 'light verse' – is less pronounced than it used to be, maybe because poetry readings are so popular and a mirth-provoking poem is always in favour on such occasions."milan dezinsky, david lehmanthere's always someone who says that poetry is dead: interview with david lehman eurozine

"after listening to all 16 pages of his poem, which chronicles a disintegrating relationship through copious metaphors of bodily harm and imagery taken from nature, arnold heard of people in the audience who felt compelled to break up with their partners soon after. "'it might have been back luck, but it became a running joke,' arnold said during a phone interview from boston. 'i can't read it aloud anymore.'" writing it like it is 2.14.09 ben fulton salt lake tribune read an excerpt from "couple from hell" @ the anthony hecht poetry prize webpage.

(i think it is a cliché. perhaps we can come back to cliché.) there are two kinds of silence that trouble a translator: physical silence and metaphysical silence." variations on the right to remain silent by anne carson from a public space, issue 7 / 2008 poetry daily

18th-feb-2009 09:45 pm - stumbling on the poems of peter colechoriambpeter cole, a senior lecturer in judaic studies at yale and one of the publishers of the press ibis editions,  is a macarthur-holding translator and publisher of hebrew and arabic poetry and fiction. he is also a decent poet in his own right, whose work is notable especially for the way it often combines his own lines with those of translated poets. his latest collection  is called things on which i've stumbled (new directions, 2008). sometimes the translations in the book appear by themselves, as does the small excerpt of al-ma'arri's "the necessity of what isn't necessary." at other times they're combined with cole's own lines, as in book's title poem, which can also be found on-line at narrative magazine. (log in for free to read the 23 page piece.) it incorporates translated pieces of poetry, grocery lists, personal letters, legal contracts, and other documents found in a "geniza" of discarded hebrew texts. cole narrates his own struggles to grasp the texts, putting the translated poems in italics, as in this excerpt:…i feel driest watching the raina man respondingin despair, callingsoftly, thirsty—with brandy in a glass beside me;as he choosesbetween the walls at noon……………………..but not now, as my mind rangesback over silence’s changes—mercyand leaves me wondering just how we seeit’s fascinating to read the translated fragments on their own, but cole offers a format for reading them and seeing how other people’s minds might make sense out of the collection. the title of this poem and book comes from an idea in isaiah that there are certain mysteries one can only grasp by stumbling through them, as cole does while translating and writing.on a whole, things on which i've stumbled is an intriguing, though at times hermetic, collection. though cole provides ten pages of copious explanatory notes at the back of the book, many of the longer poems, both original and collage, appear to be written mainly for the enjoyment of academic audiences. at a recent reading at yale, for instance, cole referred to one called "notes on bewilderment" as "a kind of giant sea worm," written in a five-line structure he developed to digest different bits of material he picked up from conversing with other yale professors about topics like spinoza and rothko and "the quiet ecstasies of kabblablah."cole's academic poetry, like much academic poetry, is both frustrating and seductive. it's frustrating in that one often has to take notes and do research to understand some of the longer poems, without always trusting that the work will pay off in a general meaning, a new understanding of an idea, a quiet religious ecstasy, or an aesthetic high. since cole is sparse with his images, it's not as aesthetically rewarding to read his work as it is other difficult poets like eliot or even zukofsky, whose poetry cole's is often compared to.on the other hand, if one does the work necessary to understand cole's poems, one might, (one hopes) feel part of the elite club that grasps what cole is trying to do. and his formal poems about the israeli/palestinian conflict are especially fine pieces of political poetry. in these, the restraint that makes some of his academic and personal poems hard to sympathize with tones down the emotionally charged topics, portraying them in a moving and thoughtful manner.ten out of the twenty poems in things on which i've stumbled can be found on-line. this might be a problematic marketing strategy for the book itself, but it's nice for readers who want to easily check out cole's work. in addition to the title poem at narrative, here's the rest of the best:coexistence: a lost and almost found poem poetry foundationpossibly the best poem in the book. made up of cole's couplets and quotations from deuteronomy.*four poems by peter cole, jewcy (actually, there are five poems in the group: "(valent)lines for a," "homage to agnes," "the rain," "something more," "the ghazal of what hurt")*and here's an interview by bob lerner with peter cole at bomb, in which cole talks about what he’s doing in the book. it contains a paragraph on one of his poems about the palestinian/israeli conflict:“…one of the more confrontational short poems in the book—‘palestine: a sestina’—uses what is at this point a cliché of a form to take on an acute problem that has come to seem hackneyed to much of the world. my goal there was, first of all, to find a form that would force me to repeatedly employ a word that, let's face it, makes many people uncomfortable. it's not a word one can use neutrally. but there it is, stanza after stanza, defying, as it were, the imposition of a ‘formal’ solution and churning up complicated feelings and connections as it does. it's an experimental poem in a reactionary mode." palestine: a sestina hackles are raised at the mere mention of palestine,let alone the question of—who owns the pain?often it seems the real victims here are the hills—those pulsing ridges, whose folds and tender fuzz of greenkill with softness. on earth, it’s true, we’re only guests,but people live in places, and stake out claims to land.  read rest of poem, plus two others, "improvisation on lines by isaac the blind" and "the meaning of this," at jewcy.

15th-feb-2009 08:25 pm - what we need is more eccentrismchoriamb"is it the nature of beings to coalesce? i think sometimes that artists, like other lower forms of intelligence, want to 'belong.' or rather, that they want to not belong in some similar ways. they want to belong to the outside, and yet to be recognized by the inside. it’s a conundrum. because, really, in order to belong to a school or a movement or a gang or a pod, you have to—whether you’re willing to think about it this way or not—move towards a 'center.' "maybe it’s peculiar to our time, in which actual schools (academies) proliferate and spawn, that we’re seeing so much centrism. what we need is more eccentrism. who isn’t tired of the contemporary qua contemporary? who isn’t bored by innovation for innovation’s sake? it has, sadly, become the mode du jour. not even a school. a monocultural fish farm. an orchestra in which everyone is trying to solo at the same time. a tin of silvery bodies falling into place."annie get your gun: fifth in a series of eight manifestos. by d.a. powell poetry foundation-other poetry manifestos:poetry can be any damn thing it wants: introduction to a collection of eight manifestos commemorating the centennial of italian futurists. by mary ann cawsthe final manifesto by joshua mehiganmanifesto of the flying mallet by michael hofmannmanifest aversions, conceptual conundrums, & implausibly deniable links by charles bernsteinthe eighties, glory of by ange mlinkoperform-a-form: a page vs. stage alliance by thomas sayers ellispresto manifesto! by a.e. stallingsleave the manifesto alone: a manifesto by hate socialist collective

12th-feb-2009 08:59 pm - robert lowell was a unicornchoriamb"...one likes a poet to have some hinterland (ugly tory word!)—some hinterland basically of prose: to have experiences, to hold opinions, to store memories, to lead a rich and varied life of the senses. (the other type of poet is a unicorn who lives in an ivory tower: he's frightening and different and real, and we don't get him. when lowell spends an evening reading poems aloud with i.a. richards, that feels like unicorn behavior to me.) it's the famous louis macneice prescription: 'i would have a poet . . .' and so forth. this elizabeth bishop embodies triumphantly, to the extent that over the course of her life her poems—four short books—have a hard time emerging. she gets involved in the turbulent brazilian politics of the fifties and sixties (and the characteristically ham-fisted american responses to them); lowell writes: 'let's not argue politics. i feel a fraud on the subject,' but that sort of retrenchment applies everywhere, and to some extent the feeling of fraudulence too. bishop is so prodigal with sympathy, attention, interest; lowell, by contrast, seems to endow even people quite close to him (even elizabeth bishop, as we will see) with very little reality. it comes down to something like focal length—his is about a foot."the linebacker and the dervishlowell stormed the literary world; while bishop orbited its periphery. on closely reading their collected letters, a poet and critic uncovers a new way to read their mythologized friendship. poetry foundation by michael hofmann
