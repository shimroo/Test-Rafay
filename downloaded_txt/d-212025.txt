i have been looking for a hair salon near my house in encinitas and let me tell you, i have finally found it! i had my hair balayaged by jacyln. i wanted to go lighter for summer, yet still make it look natural and she accomplished that! she is awesome and so sweet and listened to what i wanted, definitely recommend!

i’ve been a steady client at jet rhys for a few years now.
i love going to this salon, my hair color has never been better. the salon itself is modern and spacious. the service is fantastic. jaclyn has colored my hair (highlights) for the last few times, she listen to my requests and gave her recommendation and suggestions. the hair re-growth (and i have dark brown hair) has been very unnoticeable and the highlights last a lot longer.
the salon staff are friendly and jet (the owner) is a pistol! i love her. always makes you feel welcome.
salon is located in solana beach shopping center with plenty of parking.

every time i have tried other salons, they do not come close to this place. sara does awesome color that does fade or bleed onto towels like i’ve had at other places (i have my hair dyed almost black). ricky does amazing bob haircuts and is very detailed and meticulous. i have moved to north orange county a couple hours away but i still plan to come here when i visit family and friends in san diego. plus they sell bumble and bumble, the best brand of hair care products (and i’ve tried tons). love this place!!

i came in the other day with my boyfriend.. he was getting a haircut from melissa and i was a color model for jaclyn. i typically never color my hair, as the last time i did i bleached my whole head and the person that did it butchered it and scared me from coloring again, but with jaclyn she did an amazing job- i told her i was a little nervous from past experiences and that i didn’t want to much of a drastic change and that’s exactly what i got and it looked amazing! as for my boyfriend, he had extremely curly hair that was out of control and melissa helped him choose a haircut that he was comfortable with and still managed to maintain a few curls! great job from both jaclyn and melissa, i would definitely come back again 🙂

this is my second time at jet rhys hair salon and the experience was just as amazing as my first. the first time i went, i colored my hair for the first time ever. jaclyn was amazing and walked me through what she was doing, made sure the color was exactly what i wanted (a deep brown) and very knowledgeable. this time, i got my roots touched up by jaclyn and added some thick chunks of color throughout (following her recommendation). it came out wonderful!
i also received a haircut by melissa, who was equally amazing. she was extremely professional, knowledgeable and experienced. melissa cut my hair exactly how i had envisioned, because she listened to me and what i wanted!
i highly recommend jet rhys hair salon! they are clean, very stylish and all of the staff are incredibly sweet and friendly. the products they use are top-of-the-line and all smell amazing! you will leave feeling like a rockstar!

i’ve been searching for a hair colorist that understands blondes and can interpret exactly what i want for years! jaclyn is the absolute best, and i can honestly say i have finally found my go-to colorist! i have had so many compliments since i started getting my hair colored by her. it’s not brassy at all and is the perfect tone of blonde. i highly recommend her if you’re looking for someone who not only listens to what it is you’re wanting, but can also make recommendations that will make the look you’re trying to achieve even better.
also, 5 stars to this salon in general! everyone here is so nice, the customer service rocks, and the owner is so kind!
