travel sketches
uyen will drop anything to travel. she has been all over the world and usually forces her family to come with her. she has gotten lost in africa near the zambezi river. she has climbed the ruins of angkor wat. she has climbed the great wall of china and swam near the great barrier reef. she hasn’t gotten to antarctica and south america yet but she’s working on it. and of course, everywhere she goes, she sketches. just click on a land to see her drawings.

[scrollmagic scenes=”about-content” align=”left”]
about the artist
uyen doesn’t care to share too much about herself. so here are the facts she feels are most important to know:
how to pronounce leuyen. it sounds like le win. or just win. sometimes even winnie.
uyen has: gotten lost in africa (alone!), seen the pope in person three times, ridden an elephant, swam with dolphins, been given an erdos number of 1.5, created over 100 books for kids (yes, that’s right), worked with a nobel peace prize winner, an academy award winner, g.w. peck, that girl, and a beatle.
uyen can: remove pits from cherries, bake tarts, draw monkeys, eat sushi, dance in her bathrobe when no one is looking, put her foot in her mouth (figuratively and literally), make christmas cookies, count to ten in five languages
uyen can’t: tread water, cook chicken, rub her eyes without making a face, say “no” when someone asks her a favor, pronounce the word “ladle”, take a serious picture, whistle
uyen would rather you not know this, but oh well: she has cold feet all the time, falls asleep before the end of every movie, doesn’t like the bottom of her feet, or the bump on her right middle finger, or her belly button.
oh, and uyen is very, very very difficult to draw.
other than that, uyen makes art in los angeles, california, with her amazingly talented artist husband alexandre puvilland, their ridiculously wonderful two sons gilbert and sullivan (just kidding, we’re not giving your their names, thank you very much). wait, they have a cat too, named sardine, and a gecko named kumquat. or is the other way around?

contact
uyen is not good on the phone. she’s even worse on email. if you can find her, she’s great to have coffee with. overall, though, i’d recommend contacting her agent, who is much more likely to get back to you.



if you’ve got a manuscript, contact …holly mcghee at pippin properties
if you want uyen to speak at your school, contact… the author village
if you only have nice things to say to uyen and aren’t really expecting a response, contact…well, just click here, i guess.

**sometimes she instagrams and facebooks, but don’t quote me on that.
