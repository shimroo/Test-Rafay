campus initiative spotlight 🔦

the ucla narcan distribution project is committed to providing students and staff with free access to narcan (the brand name for the generic medication naloxone), an easy-to-use, life-saving medication used to treat opioid overdoses. the program aims to help lower the occurrence of opioid-related overdoses, reduce the stigma surrounding substance use, and to promote a safe and healthy ucla community.


 



ucla narcan distribution project


the need for a narcan distribution project on college campuses is clear. by providing access to narcan, we can save lives and prevent needless deaths from opioid overdoses. narcan is a medication that can quickly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, restoring normal breathing and potentially saving the person's life. by having narcan available on campus, we can ensure that students and staff are equipped to respond to an opioid overdose and have the tools they need to act quickly and effectively.

in addition to the potential life-saving benefits, a narcan distribution project can also help reduce the stigma surrounding substance use disorders. by acknowledging the reality of substance use on college campuses and taking steps to address it, we can help create a more supportive and understanding community for those who may be struggling with addiction.

overall, a narcan distribution project is an important step in addressing the opioid epidemic and promoting the health and well-being of college communities. by raising awareness, providing education and training, and making narcan available, we can help prevent overdose deaths and support those who are struggling with addiction.
