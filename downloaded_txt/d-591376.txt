we need feedback from you. we want to hear news, views, 
        comment and intelligent debate about the radio industry. we'd also like 
        to hear about talent around the globe in radio. please e-mail 
        us if you have stories or comments worthy of inclusion (see our about 
        page). 

we add new links to radionewsweb.com as we come 
        across them. we also regularly test links but whatever we do they sometimes 
        fail --sometimes temporarily. if you do come across a permanently broken 
        link --as opposed to external publication archives which are no longer 
        valid --please help us to help others by letting us know by e-mail


        note- in view of the numbers of viruses, worms etc now proliferating, 
        we automatically delete messages with attachments unless 
        these have been sent by prior agreement.
we never send out replies with attachments except by prior agreement.
        we also tend to automatically delete e-mails from unknown sources without 
        a title that specifically ties in to a subject we can recognize. 

audio links note: the bbc has changed 
        various links as it introduced its i-player. as of the end of 2010, we 
        have corrected links back to december 2009, but not earlier.
