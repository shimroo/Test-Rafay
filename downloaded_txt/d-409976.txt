jerry de la cruz




















miami-based fine artist
jerry de la cruz has not only traveled extensively in the u.s.a. and abroad, he 
has also traveled through many art styles, including realist, 
surreal, and abstract. with every medium he can lay his hands on, he uses drawing, painting, photography, sculpture and assemblage to 
extract secrets from the silent materials and maneuvers them into 
prominence. as a fine artist, de la cruz is both creator and educator. an extensive fine art gallery, a "wow" section of notable 
projects and honors, and a sampling of the artist's current works are presented 
here. also included are the artist's history (resume, bibliography, etc.), 
published writings of the artist, and writings of others about the artist 
(reviews, book excerpts, etc.). please use the navigation bar below to 
explore this site. the archive site includes all works and a much larger sampling of exhibits. your frank comments are requested and welcomed.
