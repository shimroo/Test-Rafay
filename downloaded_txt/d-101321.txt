“you could look at us very much as what the japanese call “nemawashi.” preparing the ground. we till the soil, we train the students, we reach out to the business community in providing seminars, workshops — so that in a very short season, in a very short span, you have fruitful results.”

– john mcintyre
executive director, ciber
