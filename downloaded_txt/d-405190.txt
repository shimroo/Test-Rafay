	 bulleit 10 year old bourbon kentucky straight bourbon whiskey
    






green parrot package goods and spirits has that special gift for that special person on your christmas list:

bulleit 10 year old bourbon

kentucky straight bourbon whiskey
the long awaited followup to bulleit's regular bourbon and rye whiskies - a 10 year old bourbon. fantastically balanced, with great controlled sweetness, and a backbone of oak and spice.





 bulleit distilling company already has a pair of well-loved whiskeys on the market: their bourbon is a consistent fan favorite, and their rye has the supreme distinction of being declared one of will gordon's "very favorite liquors" in a recent whiskey battle. not content to rest on their laurels, bulleit recently released an extra-aged version of their flagship bourbon. select barrels of the spirit were set aside to age for a full 10 years in charred american white oak, and the result is headed to a shelf near youbulleit bourbon

the original bulleit bourbon frontier whiskey has a high rye content, which reveals itself in the scent: smoky oak blends with vanilla and a spicy rye freshness. the flavor is pretty straightforward, a sweetness from the corn joining with spices and leading to a medium finish. it's uncomplicated and enjoyable but retains a certain ruggedness, a welcome departure from similarly priced entry-level bourbons.

	 muddy waters' tribute at the green parrot
    



larry baeder and friends offer green parrot tribute to muddy waters

the green parrot will celebrate the would-be  101st  birthday of seminal bluesman and "the father of electric blues" muddy waters on wednesday, april 3rd at 9:00 p.m. the tribute, hosted by larry baeder, and  accompanied by guitarist bill blue, will include a gathering of  key west musicians offering renditions of waters' songs.







rolling stone magazine said of him, "muddy waters was the man who moved the blues north from the delta and made it electric. the leading exponent of chicago blues in the 1950s, waters came up with guitar licks and a repertoire of classic songs that have fueled innumerable rock acts, from the rolling stones and eric clapton to the allman brothers band and led zeppelin."

in his induction into the rock and roll hall of fame in 19..it was said, "muddy waters transformed the soul of the rural south into the sound of the city, electrifying the blues at a pivotal point in the early postwar period. his recorded legacy, particularly the wealth of sides he cut in the fifties, is one of the great musical treasures of this century. aside from robert johnson, no single figure is more important in the history and development of the blues than waters. the real question as regards his lasting impact on popular music isn’t “who did he influence?” but - as goldmine magazine asked in 2001 - “who didn’t he influence?”

	 tom robinson, a hero then, our hero now!
    



sitting in a rocking chair on the porch of the green parrot liquor store saturday night university of dayton alumni and green parrot employee tom robinson was pondering the dayton flyers bold if ill-fated run in this year's ncaa basketball tournament.





seeming to be in an expansive mood, tom pulls out  a small velvet pouch from which emerges an oversized and unmistakable championship ring which tom earned as an offensive guard on the  1980 division iii champion university of dayton  football squad. 




an ncaa championship ring, i ask you, who's got one of of those? 

and tom would add, "this guy!"








the flyers went 14-0 that year under head coach rick carter, outscoring its opposition that year by an incredible 509-70 margin and  crushed ithaca college bombers in division iii championship amos alonzo stagg bowl by a score of  63-0, still a record






here's tom in his most recent incarnation, stock island boy, looking in fighting-trim and like he could still get down in that three-point stance and move mountains for that flyers backfield.

tom you were a hero then, and you're our hero now!

	 country blues/folk legend, bob dylan mentor spider john koerner plays green parrot
    





spider john koerner returns to parrot







 bob dylan mentor, country blues/folk legend 










legendary country blues/folk musician "spider john koerner" will perform at the green parrot bar on thursday, march 27th, at 5:30 p.m. 






koerner hit the folk-blues scene in the early '60's playing the minnesota coffee house circuit with bob dylan, and with his band, koerner, ray and glover, and has been credited with shaping the path of american country blues and folk music.

the boston globe described him as "defying his years with a ramshackle demeanor (all gangly arms and legs and tucked-in flannel shirt) and the true essence of a hootenanny-spirited, communal, and completely off the cuff."

telling corny jokes, shouting timeless lyrics, stomping out an infectious beat, koerner is a juggernaut of joy. some artists have a built in cool factor that can be seen in their influence on others;  koerner is the man who had a great deal of influence on bonnie raitt, bob dylan, john lennon and the doors.

bonnie raitt, speaking on npr's "morning edition" said, " john was the 'old venerable one', the guy that influenced a lot of other musicians that would come up. he became the fulcrum of the whole scene. i learned a lot of things from him. it looked like he was having fun and that's just what i wanted to do and that's why i'm doing it still."

as one of folk and blues' greatest innovators, he got the blues revival of the '60's going and has kept it going strong ever since, while retaining the elements that have made him the legend that he is.

the green parrot is your southernmost center for culture of every kind, and is located at the corner of whitehead and southard streets. for additional information call the green parrot at


koerner, ray & gloverthis seminal country-folk-blues group from minneapolis formed in the early sixties and influenced a musical era with its ardent roots music. in 1963 at one twelve-hour session, the trio recorded blues, rags & hollers and put copies into the hands of a few influential people. on the strength of the album, "spider" john koerner, dave "snaker" ray & tony "little sun" glover signed a recording contract with elektra records. they cut six albums, showcasing an intriguing mix of string-band, ragtime and down-home blues. in 1996 they recorded a four-concert series and released sessions from that as one foot in the groove.  koerner, glover & ray (left to right) are pictured here at first avenue.

	 st. patrick's day at sharkey's tavern
    


another st. patrick's day at the green parrot. 

with that in mind, here's a shot of a st.patrick's day that's long gone. this photo was taken either in 1956 or 1957 at sharkey's tavern, my father's bar, outside philadelphia.

in the foreground, behind the bar, sporting a  broad grin, a hibernian string tie, and some sort of cellophane party hat, is my father, al. 

to his right is long-time bartender bill conaboy, and behind bill, wearing the bow tie, is my father's partner and brother-in-law, jimmy ranalli. jimmy's wife, my dad's sister, my aunt emma, is in the foreground, looking very youthful and also with a great smile, hoisting what looks to be a glass of beer.

i don't see my mom in the picture, although all the way in the back on the left, gesticulating wildly, is my uncle dick, seated next to his wife, my mother's sister, my aunt rita. (aunt rita,i might add, paid us a visit recently and so was perched on a green parrot bar stool, a few years back, a day after celebrating her 88th birthday.                                  rita in the parrot.

that could be my mom, obscured,  sitting next to rita, but more likely she was in the kitchen in the back tending to the ham and cabbage, which i seem to recall was the traditional sharkey's st.patty's day fare.

looking at dick, i keep thinking that if this were a movie instead of a still shot, the next few frames would show dick in his excitement doing a backflip off his barstool. i hasten to add that i know for a fact that uncle dick's off-balance appearance was generated more by his innocent enthusiasm for a photo-op than  any over-indulgence in adult beverages. sharkey's was, as you can see,  a family affair, and despite emma's beer and dick's posture, there never was a more temperate extended family. i don't know who the big guy in the middle is, but you gotta love it.

it's funny the things that strike you when looking at old family photos. what jumped out at me in this photo, besides al's tie of course, and emma's smile, was the cigarette machine way in the back on the right. i remember, as a small child, on some sunday mornings, when the bar was closed, my brother and i would go there with my father and one of our jobs was to stock the cigarette machine. and part of that job was to tape two pennies on the side of every pack of cigarettes. cigarettes cost 28 cents but since the machine did not accept pennies, customers could deposit a quarter and a nickel and get their change back taped to the side of the pack. i remember scotch-taping those pennies on, and i remember sliding each pack down the trough, down the length of the bar to my brother to be loaded in the machine.

on that nostalgic note, happy st.patrick's day from all of us at the green parrot family.

	 what's new at green parrot package goods and spirits this week is clement v.s.o.p rhum agricole.
    



 clement rhum is produced in martinique, in the french west indies,  the only geographic region in the world to have an aoc mark in the rum industry.

unlike the majority of rums, sometimes called industrial rums, which are produced by distilling fermented molasses, rhum agricloe, or agricultural rum, is a tightly controlled product manufactured from fresh-pressed,  free-runningsugar cane juice. 


to learn more, here's a recent new york times article on rum agricole from martinique.







clément v.s.o.p. begins life as a white rum (rhum) distilled from the pressings of freshly cut sugar cane.  this rum is then placed in french oak barrels for over a year before being moved to charred bourbon casks for another 3 years of aging, during which the spririt develops additional tannins and its characteristic light amber  coloring.

	 banfi chianti w /thai beef salad
    





sure, everyone loves chianti, and everyone knows it pairs well with everything italian from pasta marinara to a pepperoni pizza.







i brought home a bottle of banfi from the our green parrot bottle shop last night and matched it with a thai beef salad. it was a great fit,  from the char of the grilled flank steak to the chiles, cilantro and mint in the dressing.

	 what's coming up this week at the parrot
    




sending the press out this morning i was reminded what a great week of music we had coming up so i thought i'd share it. 
from blue-eyed soul from nola, to  up-and-coming blues-rocker samatha fish, to our homegrown-anything-goes jug band from the lane of love, to reconstructed rhumba from spam and reconstructed buena vista social club from jose elias and cortadito and wrapping up with david grisman's flat picking guitarist on a wednesday evening, it's gonna be quite a week!







eric lindell & the sunliners brings blue-eyed soul, dive-bar credibility and romping new orleans r&b to the parrot

 california-born, new orleans-schooled r & b singer/songwriter eric lindell and the sunliners bring their blue-eyed soul, blues and boogie back to the parrot stage for two funky, rootsy nights with shows at 9 p.m. wednesday, february 12th and 5:30 p.m. and 9 p.m. on thursday, february 13th.

with his cliché-free, hook-filled songs and dive-bar credibility, lindell has taken the talent-heavy new orleans club scene by storm and glowing reviews of recent recordreleases seem ready to launch lindell into the musical mainstream.

described by  jazz news as an  "extraordinary, original artist who is just getting 

his combination of sweet, blue-eyed soul, smoldering vocals and foot-stomping r&b have won him critical and popular acclaim across the country via half-dozen independent releases and countless nights in small clubs.









crossing musical borders, samantha fish makes green parrot debut 

genre-bending samantha fish makes her green parrot debut on friday, february 14th with shows at 5:30 and 10 pm.

fish is classified as a blues artist, but she crosses many musical borders. her set list  typically may include  a cover of “tennessee waltz”, a  jaunty version of steve miller’s “jet airliner,” john hiatt’s “native son,”  or a lovely, mournful version of the stones’ “dead flowers,” . you could also just as easily heartom petty’s “louisiana rain” and three tom waits covers: “walking spanish down the hall,” “heart attack and vine” and “i don’t wanna grow up” (hers is more like the ramones’ version).

fish plays rhythm and leads on acoustic guitar, but for several songs, including covers of r.l. burnside’s “poor black mattie” and junior kimbrough’s “nobody but you,” she showed some prowess on dobro,

fish, only in her mid-20s, displays an impressive knowledge of and respect for music of yore and the skills and polish that promise her a long, bright musical  future.



slove lane gang brings "swing, jug band, anything goes!" to green parrot 


the love lane gang brings their eclectic mix of swing, jump swing, jug band - anything goes to the green parrot stage on saturday, february 15th,  beginning at 5:30 pmthe love lane gang plays music that spans generations, as well as embodies them. the emphasis is on swing: classics from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, done in a refreshing new style that incorporates the hot club approach with island flourishes. dust bowl ballads, old school country from hank williams and johnny cash, rockabilly and surf music classics and little-known gems, and tunes from sixties stars like the beatles and the kinks, all fit in alongside original songs that sound like they could have come from any of those eras. offbeat instrumentation like mandolin, accordion, ukulele, washboard, and a kazoo horn section add to familiar guitar, bass, and harmonica, creating a broad musical palette which they use to color their performances. but you needn't pay too much mind to all that serious musical analysis - it's just plain fun












spam allstars electonic descarga returns to the green parrot


 blending latin, funk, hip hop and dub, the spam allstars make their highly anticipated return to the green parrot with shows beginning at 10 pm on  saturday, february 15th and  9 pm on sunday, february 16th.
a self-described descarga or cuban jam session, dj le spam and the spam allstars are a unique ensemble that has created their own niche on the national music landscape with a prolific recording routine and over 200 show dates a year.
deftly combining the live performance of his stage-mates with a cornucopia of electronically-evoked samples, dj le spam (andrew yeomanson) projects a distinctly modern voice that resonates of miami's very latin and urban soundtrack.










cortadito brings early 20th century cuban son to green parrot 
the green parrot presents  miami's premier cuban son group cortadito on sunday, february 16th at 5:30 pm
  this is the latest project by spam allstars guitarists jose elias, joined by guitarist julio cesar rodriguez, their music could best be described as sounding like the buena vista social club but in a smaller more intimate setting.
cortadito is a traditional cuban son duo which focuses on performing the music of early 20th century cuban origins. from son montuno to boleros and bolero son, this dynamic duo brings you back to a time when trio matamoros, or ignacio piniero ruled the airwaves. an era when popular music was cuban music and son montuno was influencing the world over. from time to time cortadito is backed by a variety of guest musicians which gives the group a sound reminiscent of the buena vista social club. for their green parrot show cortadito will be backed by spam allstars' mercedes abel on flute and tomas diaz on timbales.






flatpickers grant gordy and ross martin bring hot licks to parrot stage



flatpickers grant gordy (of the david grisman quintet) and ross martin promise an evening of hot licks at the green parrot bar on wednesday, february 19th, beginning at 9 pm.


 being asked to assume the guitarists’ role in the fabled david grisman quintet, a spot previously held by such guitar notables as tony rice, mark o’connor, frank vignola and mike marshall, has firmly established 

gordy as one of the preeminent young voices on guitar. just ask his boss, david grisman, who says gordy “belongs to the new elite of american acoustic practitioners who are pushing the ever-expanding envelope 

of a musical frontier.”

his work has been widely recognized for its consistent excellence and diversity. he was featured on the covers of flatpicking guitar magazine and japan’s premier bluegrass magazine, moonshiner.

 he was recently written up in just jazz guitar and in 2010, acoustic guitar magazine celebrated his debut cd in its top ten acoustic albums of the year.



gordy’s music has captured the ears of major broadcasters and he’s been heard on national public radio’s morning edition, all things considered and the prestigious tiny desk concerts. gordy was selected in

 2006 to be one of 15 participants in carnegie hall’s “porous borders of music” workshop, led by acoustic music legends edgar meyer and mike marshall. he’s played at bonnaroo music festival, the

 montréal jazz festival, carnegie hall, hardly strictly bluegrass festival in san francisco and in the uk and russia.



guitarist ross martin has performed in concert halls, honky-tonks, theaters, rock clubs, living rooms, on festival stages, television programs and everywhere in between. 

his musical path has covered as much territory as his physical one. reflecting his love of diverse genres like

 jazz, bluegrass, country, folk, experimental and classical music,  he has toured and performed with a wide range of artists including matt flinner, tony furtado, ron miles, mollie o’brien, the motet, caroline herring, dwele, sonya kitchell and many others.

	 green parrot named zagat's #1 best music/performance venue in south florida
    







the green parrot has been named the best music/performance venue in south florida in the 2014 zagat survey. 

this is a real honor, we are pleased the hard work of everyone here has not gone unnoticed. 

as i've said before  at times when we've showed up on someone's radar in this way, this kind of  recognition would not be possible without our strong partnerships with both local and national talent.

moreover i give credit to our great green parrot  staff and  our green parrot patrons.  i'm speaking of loyal, sophisticated patrons and seasoned, skilled staff who continually support our efforts and  who join together make the musicians so welcome and appreciated that  those musicians strive to deliver their best performances when they step out on our stage. not only does this audience response make musicians want to return to the parrot again and again but it spreads the word  among their peers that the parrot customers and employees are the best and most musically sophisticated  anywhere.

we would like to thank all our staff here for their professionalism,  thank musicians everywhere for enriching our lives, and mostly thanks to our patrons who repay us daily with their loyalty and enthusiasm.  we promise to remain your "the southernmost center for culture of all kinds" and will continually  strive to make the entertainment at the green parrot  the best it can be. we are extremely pleased zagats has honored us in this way.

	 doo wop is forever at the green parrot sunday
    




joey dale has parrot patrons in the palm of his hand at a recent show here.

dress up in your favorite bouffant, duck tail, bowling shirt or leather jacket, poodle skirt or any of your other favorite 50's fashions and head down to the green parrot on sunday, january 26th at 5:30 p.m. because joey dale and the gigolos, south florida's premier doo wop group will be doing the green parrot's sunday "soundcheck" and singing all the hits that people love to hear.their repertoire includes hits recorded by the duprees, the skyliners, the coasters and many more popular groups of the fifties. and encompasses not only doo wap but big band, motown, disco, blues and rock and roll, all fun and danceable. joey dale and the gigolos perform like no other and promise to keep the dance floor packed.



joey with doo wap legend jimmy gallagher of the passions


as a special treat joey will be joined by doo wap legend jimmy gallagher, lead singer of the passions, perhaps the most well known of any white doo wap groups of the 50's and 60's. one of the passions many hits was "just to be with you", released in 1959 and fueled by gallager's impassioned lead vocal, this now-classic classic chestnut became a top twenty hit on radios a cross ameica and continues to be an ageless doo wap anthem for fans of the genre. as a bit of music trivia, when gallager's demo of "just to be with you" was first delivered to the  producers at audicon records gallager was backed by a duo of studio singers called the cousins. the cousins were paul simon and carol king.
