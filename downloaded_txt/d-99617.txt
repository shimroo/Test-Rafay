pra - will your mastiff go blind?
night blindness is often the first symptom of progressive retinal atrophy (pra), 
a blindness causing, hereditary problem.
pra in mastiffs is dominant. dna test now available.

mastiffs dna tested clear of pra this information is now in the ofa database.

eye care for your dog
 
optigen testing for canine multi-focal retinopathy (cmr) in mastiffs (retinal folds)
cmr in mastiffs is an autosomal recessive disease, so the gene mutation is 
inherited from both sire and dam.  by utilizing optigen's cmr dna 
test and following their breeding recommendations, breeders can use dogs in their
breeding program regardless of the dogs' cmr genetic status and at the same time work
to eliminate the disease from the mastiff gene pool.
