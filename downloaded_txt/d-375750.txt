welcome to the town of clay
as supervisor of the town of clay, it is my pleasure to welcome you to our community and to discover all that our town has to offer.
the town of clay was originally settled in 1791 as part of the central new york military tract and was previously known as west cicero. it was carved out of the town of cicero in 1827 and named after "the great compromiser," henry clay.
today, the town of clay is home to over 60,000 residents, making it the largest town in onondaga county. we have numerous amenities, from top-notch park systems to access to miles and miles of waterways, to high-quality affordable housing. our proximity to major interstates, airports and railway systems is distinctive and one of the reasons why money magazine named the town of clay one of the 100 best places to live in the country.
as supervisor to the town of clay, i invite you to explore our website and the many opportunities available to its residents.
