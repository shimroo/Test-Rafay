introducing
        
the micro-mini liftÂ®
			world-class facelift in richmond, va!
        

the smaller incisions of a 
        micro-mini liftÂ®
         make it a 
        
minimally invasive facelift.
          


dr. godinâ€™s patented, innovative modification of the traditional faceliftâ€”the micro-mini liftÂ® â€”is designed to deliver highly-effective anti-aging results with less discomfort and downtime than a full facelift. ideal for patients in their forties and early fifties who are just beginning to notice the tell-tale signs of aging around the lower face and neck, the micro-mini liftÂ® minimizes the appearance of wrinkles and sagging by lifting and tightening facial tissue that has begun to lose its youthful elasticity. learn more about the rejuvenating benefits of the micro-mini liftÂ® here or contact us to schedule your consultation today!
