when government is constantly being asked to do more with less, the internet is playing a key role in allowing government to better serve all of its state citizens.

the internet is dramatically changing the way that american government serves 
                                          the public. taking advantage of new 
                                          technology, many state and local governments 
                                          are using the web to offer citizens 
                                          a host of gov services including:

corresponding online with local

 providing tax information and accepting 
                                            tax returns 
 applying for jobs or benefits.

                                        because they:
