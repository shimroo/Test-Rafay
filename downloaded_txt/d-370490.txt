the big orange chorus 
is a fun and friendly group that enjoy singing high-quality barbershop 
and other styles of a cappella music.  as a chapter of the 
international

barbershop harmony society, the chorus performs frequently in the 
jacksonville community.  membership in our chorus is open to men and women of all 
ages who like to sing.

    the chorus' goal is to showcase quality a cappella style vocal music in a 
fun and entertaining way.  annual spring and christmas shows, 
professionally produced and staged, are the capstones of the chorus' efforts in 
jacksonville and northeast florida.  the big orange chorus
    offers an outstanding opportunity to learn and improve vocal 
abilities while performing in the community under the auspices of an 
international organization and a world-class director and coach.  the 
chorus is growing and welcomes all singers in all voice parts.

chorus rehearsals 
are usually held at 
san jose church of christ in 

jacksonville 
on thursday nights at 

7:00pm.  certain 
special events and special performances require that rehearsals are occasionally 
held at non-standard dates and/or times.  guests would do well to call the 
chorus at (904) 355-sing or check the 

chorus calendar 
and the list below for specific rehearsal dates prior to planning a visit.
if you have any questions, please call.

    keep checking this site for news on the progress of the big orange 
chorus, florida's championship and internationally-ranked  
barbershop and a cappella chorus.
