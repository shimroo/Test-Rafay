more about uswelcome to grace bible presbyterian church! we are a reformed, bible believing church that strives to bring glory to god through the grace of our lord and savior jesus christ. we provide a place of worship where christians may have the bible taught as the word of god and grow in the grace and knowledge of jesus christ. we provide a place where those who are not christians may hear the plan of salvation and be led to receive jesus christ as their personal savior, and to provide a testimony for the historic christian faith by earnestly contending for this faith.
you are invited to join us as we grow in our understanding the great majesty of god and how to live daily in light of his glory and word.
