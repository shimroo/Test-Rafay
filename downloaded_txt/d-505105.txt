personal transportation home -- information on personal transportation technology, vehicles, policy



 


this site contains a collection of information, resources, and opinions related to personal transportation. we focus on single-person travel of distances of up to about 20 kilometers. we deliberately do not focus on conventional automobiles, as there are many sites and publications dedicated to cars. we include human-powered transportation in our scope, along with motorbikes, motorcycles, and other powered personal transportation vehicles. we have a slight bias towards human- and electric-powered vehicles, but try to be even handed in our consideration of a variety of transportation technologies. 
this home page shows the most commonly viewed links. see also the geek page for more technical/eclectic information, and the editorial pages for commentary.
