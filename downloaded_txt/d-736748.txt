maikiheya all, it's been a year. been trying to login here but i kept mistaking my password, which caused lj to lock me out thus demotivating me from coming back here for a few times already. so i finally reset my password this time.life update wise, the webcomic gig went down the drain because mangamagazine/inkblazers closed down and i became busier with my production manager job anyway. i just... overall draw less and less now, so i'm not in the best shape in regards to that. i play games mostly after i finish work but nothing new there.if you're wondering which games exactly, it's ff14 and some falcom titles (zero no kiseki, tokyo xanadu, etc...). i played and enjoyed tales of zestiria a lot earlier this year and it finally came to the west a few days ago, so congrats na and europe! enjoy the yaois and debate all you want. i also really like the visual novel series "fault", if anyone digs that genre.hmm. work and games. that pretty much describes my life now, i suppose.

maikihello. i recently remembered of lj and thought i'd give an update for the heck of it since i'm in the mood.since my last public post, i worked as a storyboard artist in a local animation studio for 2 years but the project i was mostly in is being broadcasted only in india tv, go figure. after that i quit and focused on freelancing, which strangely became a juggle between illustrating, storyboarding, jp-eng interpreting and event-managing as volunteer work (we did comic art festival kl last june).i got tired of freelancing/volunteering though, so now i'm back to having a full-time job as production manager for a 3d production studio. this time no more drawing, just mostly translating japanese into english. only worked there for 2 weeks but it's a pretty cool place so far. :)last year i've also started a webcomic series called sorcery club. it's popular enough to give me usd20 per month, thankfully. i'm still playing video games on my ps3 and vita, i still read manga and watch anime. besides one personal life drama, not much has changed in the past 3 years. xd i'm still mainly active on twitter. (i'm still loudly fangirly as usual)hope everyone here is still doing fine. :)

home not-quite-sweet home


apr. 11th, 2011 at 2:27 am



 


maikihello, i've been back in malaysia for the past 3 weeks. for good.i've graduated from university but didn't attend our graduation ceremony nor have a graduation certificate to show because my parents decided that, due to aftermath of that m9 earthquake has turned tokyo into a place that was not quite safe (but seriously, things weren't as bad as they kept exaggerating on cnn), we should leave japan and get back to malaysia as early as we could. i didn't want to leave tokyo, at least not that early but all my arguments against my mother were never heeded.i had the most hectic last 3 days of my life in japan. that was the amount of days left we had before our new flight departure time. i had to settle unpaid bills that still wouldn't arrive at the time, went for a job interview, return borrowed items to faraway friends and many more other matters, and this was back when trains were scarce because of the post-quake scheduled power downtimes and more mess. i don't know how i survived those 3 days but i did. at least i had a blast one day by meeting up with one of my favourite mangaka (who happens to be obsessed with glee too right now).it feels great how i could catch a breather ever since i reached malaysia (and actually still laze around for almost a month since, lol) but i still hate life here. i would elaborate more on that but a long life history rant will be needed, and that's not something i wanna do at 2am so i'll spare you from that for now.still, life isn't all downsides anyway. those who know me enough knows that if life gives me lemons, i make ultra sweet lemon juice out of them. besides living a very repressed life under the same roof as my parents (not right now though, they went on a 10-day pilgrimage at mecca),  i've been job-hunting while also lazing around doing things that make me happy. been busy meeting up with relatives and catching up with friends too.that's all for now i guess. heh, this turns out to be a boring update. sorry that i couldn't reply to everyone in the previous entry where i updated on my post-quake status but thank you so much for your comments. :)

maikijust saying hi to everyone and to say i'm safe in japan, along with my parents who happened to be visiting me at this time. it's very miraculous timing 'cause i'm not alone throughout all this confusion and i just happen to be preparing to move out of this apartment so my huge wall of books are already gotten rid of by the time we got that big 8.8 magnitude earthquake.anyway, i don't have furnitures in this apartment anymore so i'm staying at a hotel (my parents insisted on it). couldn't bring my laptop yesterday so that's why i couldn't use the internet much, but i've been tweeting a bit through my cellphone at least.saitama seems to be safe from any big tremors for now. anyway, gotta go back to preparing for moving now. hoping i get to hear from festivewind who's at sendai but i can't get a hold of her since yesterday. :( prayers to everyone else getting affected by the earthquakes and tsunami.

glee 2.14 "blame it on the alcohol"


feb. 23rd, 2011 at 12:38 pm



 


maikijust wanna leave a comment before i leave for errands.( read more...collapse )editted @ 24/2:i found some good articles discussing the bisexuality arguments on this episode so i figured it'd be better to plug them instead:http://chrisinthebigcity.tumblr.com/post/3477738337/http://www.afterelton.com/tv/recaps/glee/214?page=0,4on the other hand, maybe i'm somewhat glad that glee 'screwed up' with their take on bisexuality because it caused people to discuss about this. i swear i've learnt a lot more about the bisexual community in the past 2 days than i'd ever find out in my normal life. but i just find it ridiculous for people to start hating kurt (or the show as a whole) as if he just attacked the whole bisexual community when that's obviously not what he meant.don't get me started on how people automaticly blamed ryan for the bad writing/treatment on girls when, as usual, it's not him who wrote this episode. i won't deny how the show obviously lacks of proper treatment to the female characters but i'm not a feminist myself so i don't really take this personally or anything. :/

maikihappy new year, everyone! 2010 wasn't a bad year for me and despite some bad experiences, i enjoyed it a lot so here's to hoping that 2011 won't suck in exchange. it's the year of the rabbit after all and i'm born in one, so all hail to me i'm gonna positively look at this year for now. febby (festivewind) has been staying over my place for the past few days. we're enjoying each other's company. :> this leads up to this awkward interaction of ours today:( warning for suggestive language?collapse )

dec. 24th, 2010 at 10:21 pm



 


maikitoday they had a glee "private showing" at shinjuku's meiji yasuda seimei hall as celebration of the japanese dvd release (jan 7th 2011). you need to register and hope you get chosen by lottery for an invitation to this event, so i applied at all 3-4 different venues that offered invitations.i funnily won twice, and received 4 invitations in total so i brought jen_kat and 2 friends from school along with me. xd;( read more...collapse )

wow, finally a proper life update.


dec. 19th, 2010 at 1:21 am



 


maikiwell then. today was the final graduation project inspection day. ups and downs aside, i passed. i'd elaborate more about my graduation project but the whole situation wasn't really pretty, so let's just focus on the fact that i do get to graduate after all but not allowed to have my work showcased in our graduation work exhibition, which i don't mind that much anyway.i know some of you have asked to see my work, but uh, it may be over 150mb and i still wanna fix a lot of errors i left behind in the game, so i'll try to consider those obstacles first... it was quite cute when my summon-night-loving classmates fangirled at my game for looking like summon night though, heh. :)there are still a few more things i need to do to finalize my graduation but anyway, yaaaaay. no more pressure! but i'll still have pressure from job-hunting and guriha for the next couple of months so let's see how things turn out from here.------------------------skuldnoshinpu kindly gave me the heads up that saleh may likely be in totw: radiant mythology 3. i may have stopped becoming a tales fan for awhile but after the announcement of tales of xillia and ho my fudgecake god, my saleh in radiant mythology 3!!?? i pretty much have my attention back to the tales series again.........omg saleh saleh saleh saleh saleh sal-- /shot

dec. 12th, 2010 at 1:33 pm



 


maikistill slowly going through my glee season 1 bds. so i got around to episode 18 "laryngitis" today. anyway, extremely late observation on the episode. i bet half of the fandom already saw this, like, back in spring, but i wanna put my thoughts down anyway.( read more...collapse )

glee: the japanese dub


dec. 9th, 2010 at 11:14 pm



 


maikiit turns out fox japan has put up the japanese-dubbed version of glee's season 1 pilot for some time already, but it's only accessible through japanese cellphones. if you have a jp cellphone and have enough disk space, go to the barcode in this site and download the files: (add the h to) ttp://bit.ly/fpyuip of course, i jumped at the chance of downloading the episode as soon as i found out!

dragonmaster_x18 jul 2014, 09:07(no subject)full-time production manager! not bad! i got the impression that artists aren't paid too well in japan because there's so many people who want to do it. but i guess you're better off now!maiki5 jul 2014, 00:50(no subject)yeah, as long as i update 4 pages a month. xd since i had a hiatus month, i didn't get paid on that month despite reaching enough views.jen_kat4 jul 2014, 13:45(no subject)oh cool! i didn't know that you were getting enough readership for $20/month. xdb
