welcome

				thanks for stopping by. we've made a number of changes and improvements to our site.
				we hope that you will enjoy your visit. 


				it's hard to believe that as of february 24, 2020 we have been 
				together for 19 years. since marrying we
				have continually expanded our interests that include mountain dulcimer, auto racing, classic car restoration, photography, and dancing.
				we continue to include family and music as a big part of our lives.


				this site will continue to expand as tom recovers old photos and missy takes newer photos of family and activites.  
				we would love to hear what you think about your visit. don't hesitate to contact us.
		

				with love,
				-- tom & missy strothers
