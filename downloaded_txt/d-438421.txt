“i opened my first just cuts™ franchise 10 years ago and it’s been so successful that i now own eight salons! i was previously a stylist, but decided to stop cutting. i wanted to spend more time with my wife and children and enjoy a better lifestyle. i now work when it suits me! the just cuts™ academy team gives me all the support i need and my 60 stylists are great. i enjoy working with my team and running my own business is truly rewarding.”
- oliver adams, owner of eight just cuts™ salons across new south wales and owner since 1999

what do i get in return for my investment?


									you get all the benefits of joining a trusted household brand with initial and ongoing business, operational and marketing support. this makes it an optimum setup for reaching financial and personal goals as an owner, with a brand that has been in franchising for over 26 years.

can i own more than one just cuts™ salon?


									yes. in fact, just over half of just cuts™ franchise owners are multi-site owners who own two or more salons. our system has been tried, tested and refined over more than 26 years of business in franchising.
