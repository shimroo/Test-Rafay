“moon mirror” is out today!!

september 13, 2024 


“moon mirror,” the band’s new album, and first for new west records, is out today. you can also watch the new video for “second skin” directed by spencer gentz.
rolling stone said “moon mirror is one of their best…” calling it “nada surf’s most musically and emotionally passionate album in years, on the level of gems like let go, the weight is a gift, and the stars are indifferent to astronomy… a sterling tribute to the kind of inspiration that endures and deepens over the long haul.” uncut magazine called it “masterful power pop with a cerebral core… the band’s deepest and most accomplished effort yet.” mojo called it “wonderful” in their 4 star review, while no depression said “moon mirror represents a step forward for the band… one of the best albums of their long career.”
the album is available on all digital platforms, on compact disc, and standard black vinyl. there are also deluxe versions of the cd + lp that contain demos of the album tracks and vinyl in different colors. you can find all digital and physical versions of the album here.

later today we’re announcing that our new album moon mirror is coming out on september 13th. it’s our first for new west records. we wanted our fans to be the first to know about this, thank you so much for listening all these years!
we’re also announcing shows in north america, europe and the uk (see below), with many more to come. “in front of me now,” the first single from the record, is now available to stream on all dsps.
moon mirror will be released in a few different configurations, and you’re the first to have a chance to pre-order the record. there’s the standard 11-track lp, cd and digital release, but also some limited-edition, deluxe packages that have extra tracks, cool colored vinyl, and even a flexi disc. all the information is at the bottom of this email.
we’re really excited about this album, and can’t wait to play it for you on tour!
big love from us,
