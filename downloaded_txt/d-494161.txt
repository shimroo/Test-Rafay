the tipshop needs you!


stuck in a game? don't worry - you're not the only one.
if you have a games problem, this is the section for you.
erm, it's also the section if you think you can help the people who are stuck..

picture this... near a computer far, far away...

        he walks into his study after a long day at work and

slumps in front of his computer. "i fancy playing a decent game tonight," he says, loading up

his spectrum emulator. "i really want to play robocop,

but i can't get past the first stage! surely there's a place that i can get some help on

this game? it's just too hard!"

        fear not, citizen! on another computer,

not so far away (we mean this computer, you dolt) a website has been put together by

gerard sweeney and nick humphries called... dan-dan-dannnnnnnnnn!!! the tipshop!

        the tipshop aims to be the site for hints, tips,

maps, cheats, hacks, pokes - anything that will help you play spectrum and sam games. although

only recently launched, it already has thousands of entries that will help many gameplayers

in their quest to finish a lot of classic games.

        simply use the index or the search engine above

to find any helpful assistance for the game that you're having difficulty with. and, if you can't

find any help for your game, keep coming back! we're adding more and more information all the time.

you can also send us an email to be notified whenever we update the page. this list will absolutely, positively never be used for any other purpose.





if you have any help for any game that isn't already on this website, "send us a tip!"

and we'll put it in.

feel free to e-mail us with any comments you might have.



if you want to know who did what, view the credits page. a lot

of people put in a lot of time for this website - this is where we thank them.


here are some link icons - we encourage you to link to our site and search engine from your own website -

after all, that's part of the reason why we put this together, so people can link directly to the

tips pages for specific games. to link to tips for, say, chase hq,

use the url:

        https://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?name=chase+hq

you can also search for a specific type of hint by adding ;searchtype= and either cheat (cheat modes), 
bug (game bugs), map (maps), poke (multiface pokes), tip (tips), 
hack (type-in hacks), partsol (partial solutions) or sol (complete solutions).
if you don't include this extra parameter, it will search for all types of hint for the game you specify.

to use chase hq again:,
https://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?name=chase+hq;searchtype=poke will look for all multiface pokes for chase hq
while
https://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?name=chase+hq;searchtype=cheat will look for all cheat modes for chase hq

28/07/05 - you can now specify to search for the exact string, useful for searching for common game names. an example would be https://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?name=dizzy&exactname=y, which would
only search for "dizzy", rather than finding every single title with the word "dizzy" in it. you should also use this option if your game name is less than three characters long,
such as "z".

you can also now specify whether to search through the (extensive!) alias list. the default has this switched off, but if
you can't find any tips for a particular game, try switching this option on - perhaps the game is actually called something else entirely.
for example, searching for "bugaboo" wouldn't find any matches, because that's its re-release title.
so, https://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?name=bugaboo&checkalias=y will bring up
the results for la pulga.

you can, of course, combine all of these switches to refine your search even further. such as only searching for
pokes for dizzy (https://www.the-tipshop.co.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?name=dizzy&searchtype=poke&exactname=y)
try it!
