help support our hurricane recovery efforts
hurricanes helene & milton damaged vital equipment and left cma with an estimated $2.5m in damages. we’ve raised over $300k and recovered more than 200 lost items from our wish list thanks to contributions from many generous supporters and partners. your visit and donations support our recovery efforts and allow us to continue to provide daily animal care and rescue more marine life.
