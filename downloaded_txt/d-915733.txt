how to kill people





the anti-death penalty people are all in a snit because during an execution in ohio, the "victim" was injected with two drugs and took about 20 minutes to die.  oh yes, he gasped for breath a few times.  i wonder what the pregnant woman he repeatedly raped and killed by slitting her throat sounded like.

executions should not be that difficult.  simply pump nitrogen into an air-tight chamber or room, displacing all the oxygen.  the person being executed won't smell anything, won't gasp for breath, won't know anything is wrong.  he will simply fall asleep and die.

a bright idea





in a few days, a law, passed under the bush administration, will take effect, banning the manufacture or sale of incandescent light bulbs, 60 watts or below.  ah, but there is an alternative.

a new company plans to continue manufacturing and selling "rough service incandescents," which aren't covered in the ban.  rough service bulbs are meant to be used in high vibration areas, such as subways.  they have additional wire within the glass enclosure that protects and supports the filament. so, they last 12 times longer than the traditional bulb.

they are also cheaper than leds and cheaper and safer than cfls, which contain mercury. 

until your local stores have them, here is their site.

equality





you would think after being the party of slavery and segregation that democrats would want to make up for their past sins.  but, nope. 

according to a study from the new organizing institute (noi).“african american staffers on democratic federal-level campaigns are 
paid 70 cents on the dollar compared to their white counterparts; 
hispanics are paid 68 cents on the dollar,” writes ethan roeder, 
executive director of noi.

democrats never change.

well, this is sickening





once again i have been validated.  immutable truth about liberals #10. liberals don't have leaders, they have demi-gods.



here is an interesting picture.   a chicago baskin-robbins in hyde
park has erected a 3,000-pound granite boulder, with a plaque commemorating the place where barack obama went on their first date and kissed for the first time.  obama took michelle out on a date in 1989 when the two worked at the same chicago law firm.  the inscription states, “on our first date, i treated her to the finest ice cream baskin-robbins
had to offer, our dinner table doubling as the curb. i kissed her, and
it tasted like chocolate.”



(click to enlarge)








but, there's a problem.  the reason that baskin robbins is still there is that bain capital made a leveraged buyout of the chain's owner,  dunkin’ brands, and saved it from insolvency. nothing on the monument about mitt romney's former company preserving such a sacred site.

how liberals handle tragedy





the story came in 24 hours ago like most important, breaking stories do -- just a one-line bulletin saying a shooting had been reported at a theater in denver, with 10 believed to be dead.

i did more research and turned out a story 18 minutes later (fastest writer in the newsroom).

as facts came in , the story changed, as they always do.  at the end of my shift, the story was that 14 people had been killed at a midnight showing of the latest batman move in a theater in aurora.  the shooter was in custody, but the police were keeping details to themselves.

fourteen hours later, i was back at work.  the story had solidified into just the facts.  twelve dead.  the name of the shooter, that he was a brilliant student.  and, as i suspected, the liberal media added their own truthiness to the story.

good morning america wasted no time politicizing the death of 12 innocent people.  abc's chief investigative "reporter" brian ross went online and found a name matching that of the shooter who is a member of the colorado tea party.  you'd have thunk that the fact that the tea party member was about 30 years older than the shooter would have clued ross into the fact that he had the wrong guy.  but, nope. before you know it, abc was telling the world that the shooter was a member of the tea party.

then, the gun control fanatics entered the fray.

film critic roger ebert (film critic? don't quite your day job) went for a total gun ban and said it's time this country looks at its "insane" gun control laws.  maybe it's time we looked at our insane murder laws, since they apparently don't work either.

cnn's piers morgan tweeted that "america has got to do something about its gun laws. now is the time."

billionaire control freak mayor michael bloomberg also got on his gun control soapbox.

i could go on and on and on, but michelle
 malkin  is much less lazy than i am.

by the way, as long as liberals want to politicize  tragedies, 27 people were killed in obama's adopted hometown of chicago last week.  the death toll over the memorial day weekend was 47.  the st. valentine's day massacre, in which seven mobsters were killed in 1929, not only made it into the newspapers, but into the history books.  most of the killings in chicago and other violent, liberal cities don't even make it into the papers.

obama lied, freedom died






let's flash back to the campaign of george h.w. bush.  he promised america that he would impose "no new taxes."  the democrats got to him.  they promised him that if he raised taxes, they would cut spending.  the tax hike came, the spending cuts did not.  as if that weren't dishonorable enough, when reelection time came around, the democrats used bush's "lie" against him to defeat him.  liberals still portray bush the senior as the president who lied about not raising taxes.  

back to the present.  during his campaign, obama pledged repeatedly that he would not raise taxes "a single dime" for the middle class.  during his campaign for health care, he repeatedly said the penalty for not buying federal health care was not a tax. 

on thursday, the supreme court ruled that the penalty is indeed a tax, meaning obamacare is constitutional.  

obamacare is the largest tax hike in history.  it imposes 21 tax hikes, 12 of which apply to the middle class.  obama lied.  do you think liberals and the media (i repeat myself) will portray it that way?  impossible.  obama will get a pass for his "lie," while bush sr. will take his notoriety to the grave. 

once again, the only standards liberals have are double standards.

the ruling that the government can "tax" people who don't buy government insurance means that the government can now not only tax every human action, they can tax every human inaction.

if democrat policies are so wonderful, why do they always have to be forced on us?

the sleaziest of the sleazy





wow, i thought i'd seen the bottom of the barrel when bill clinton used to rent out the lincoln bedroom and sell favors to raise funds, but this takes the cake.

hey, instead of registering with bed, bath and beyond for your wedding, birthday, christening or anniversary, why not have your friends register with the obama campaign and give money to them?  have a death in the family?  simply have your friends and relatives donate money to obama -- in lieu of flowers.

you'd better take a gander at this quickly, because i don't think it will be around long.  even democrats are gagging on the stink.

i contemplate the universe










you ever notice how secularists teach theories as fact?  the big bang theory, darwin's theories, etc are all taught as if they were etched in stone -- like the 10 commandments.  of course, this is a secular habit because they think proving science will disprove the existence of god.  

supernatural: 1. of or relating to existence outside the natural world.  2. attributed to a power that seems to violate or go beyond natural forces.

according to the dictionary definition, the big bang was supernatural, because it violated all laws of nature.  first there was nothing and then there was something -- the universe.  according to the big bang theory, the entire universe was created in an instant.

one of most basic laws of science is the law of the conservation of energy. energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another.  energy is not currently being created. the universe could not have created itself using natural processes, because nature did not exist before the universe came into existence. something beyond nature must have created all the energy and matter that is observed today.

then, we get to whatever happened after the big bang. according to the secularists, the energy of the universe randomly began to form itself into everything we have today.  if the universe formed randomly, why isn't it random?  has it stopped forming?  the fact is that nothing in the universe is random; everything, down to the tiniest subatomic particle, is perfect and predictable.  if the universe were truly random, science would be impossible.  you could not expect the same reaction in an experiment to occur twice in a row.  but, the universe is so perfect that we can predict the existence of elements that we have never even seen.  we know how one element will react when exposed to another -- for instance, sodium, cesium, potassium, lithium and rubidium burn or explode when exposed to water.  and, we know that there are elements that exist that have not yet been discovered.  why?  because, according to the laws of nature, they must exist.



we can postulate the existence of planets -- planets we cannot see -- by observing the effects of gravity on bodies in the region, because we know that there are laws of gravity and that the universe follows them.

the best science fiction writers have been scientists, or people who were familiar with science.  their predictions were considered prophetic, because much of what we have now did not exist when they wrote their pulp fiction.  it wasn't prophetic.  they knew what was possible.  and, when you know what is possible, you can pretty well bet what will be probable.

science explains the how, but it does not explain the why.

why are there laws of nature and why does the universe obey them?

fyi





i'm still messing with the decor of my blog.  when i have the time.  in the meanwhile, i've just put twitchy in my featured links sidebar.  for those of you who forgot (as i did) the featured links are those that are interesting, but don't meet the criteria for my short but high-quality blogroll.  

twitchy is run by michelle malkin and deals with all the stuff going on in the twitter universe.  twitter is yet another one of those technological "advances" that i've been trying to ignore, but it's just grown too big.  our correspondents use it, so i have to learn too, to keep track of breaking news.  guess i'm stuck with learning a new skill.

if obama had a son, would he look like tyrone?






meet  20-year-old tyrone dale david woodfork.  president obama was only too  eager to claim that, if he had a son, shooting victim trayvon martin would look like him. i haven't heard obama claim a similar identification with tyone, who brutally sexually assaulted an 85-year-old woman and beat her to death and also shot her 90-year-old husband in the face with a bb gun.
where is jesse jackson?  where is al sharpton?  where are the media?  why does this story have to appear in a british newspaper???  well, obviously the left does not consider black-n-white crime to be newsworthy.  
but, here is another example.  meet 20-year-old sienna edwards.  she's dead. she was chased off a 14-story balcony by a young mother who was angry that sienna was giving her three-year-old daughter birthday gifts.  again, where are jesse and al and obama?  where is the media?  i guess the left does not consider black-on-black crime to be newsworthy.
this is just a tiny taste of what is going on in this country.  the hypocrisy of the trayvon martin story is so massive that i'm going to have to talk about it in small chunks.  i've been commenting about it on other blogs, but i think it's time to let my own readers in on my thoughts.  more later.

democrats feel, republicans think





relatives gathered in the hospital waiting room, where a family 
member lay gravely ill.  finally, the doctor came in looking tired and 
somber.“i’m afraid i’m the bearer of bad news,” he said, as he 
 surveyed the worried faces. “the only hope left for your loved one at 
this time is a brain transplant."it's an experimental procedure, 
very risky, but it is the only hope. insurance will cover the procedure,
 but you will have to pay for the brain.”the family members sat silent as they absorbed the news.  after a time, someone asked, “how much will a brain cost?”the doctor responded, “$5,000 for a democrat’s brain; $200 for a republican’s brain.”the
 moment turned awkward. some of the democrats actually had to try to 
not smile, avoiding eye contact with the republicans. a man unable to 
 control his curiosity finally blurted out the question everyone wanted
 to ask, “why is the democrat's brain so much more than a republican’s 
brain?”the doctor smiled at the childish innocence and explained
 to the entire group, “it's just standard pricing procedure. we have to 
price the republicans’ brains a lot lower because they’re used.”

talking points

over the years i've been writing this blog, i've been throwing out little self-evident truths that seem to have no exceptions that prove the rule. i've made a list of some of them and will add to it as i remember them or make up more. most of this list i've come up with myself. a few i've borrowed from others.1.  always expect the worst from a liberal and you will never be surprised.2.  never try to reason with a liberal.  they disregard any evidence that conflicts with their beliefs.3.  you can always tell what liberals are up to by what they accuse conservatives of doing.4.  liberals don't debate, they argue.5. the only standards liberals have are double standards.6.  liberals feel, conservatives think.7.  whenever you don't understand a liberal's motives, just look for the money.8.  liberals cannot be embarrassed.  they lack the gene to blush.9.  the liberal golden rule is, "do unto others but scream bloody murder if they do unto you."10. liberals don't have leaders, they have demi-gods.11. there are no honest liberals. if they were honest -- especially to themselves -- they would be conservatives.12. a liberal's business is nobody's business, but everyone's business is a liberal's business.13. liberals have an inflated sense of self-worth. they are like house flies that criticize the air-worthiness of a stealth fighter.
