how much meat do i need? 







well that depends – are you feeding a gaggle of hungry teenagers, or do you just have the in-laws coming over for dinner? 







our rule of thumb 



boneless meat: 1/2 lb. per person for adults, and 1/4 lb. per person for children.bone-in meat: 1 lb. per person for adults, and 1/2 lb. per person for children.
