hot tips
computer - web:  leverage all the social media sites you can to support your main website. a facebook business page is the most important, followed by instagram then twitter. don't forget to make sure your google and yelp listing pages are okay. but keep the focus on your main site and don't get bogged down in endless social media chit chat, which might be fun but it doesn't generate good traffic after a while.
auto:   get your car's heating system checked out for as well as all your lights. modern car systems throw a "check engine" light if the engine's thermostat is stuck open or stuck closed.  mount good mud & snow tires and even put on chains for deep winter snow driving.
outdoors:    winter is here.  wear at least one wool layer and a shell parka if hiking above 3000', besides heavier layers of fleece & a good hat. take basic emergency supplies, headlamps and snow shoes even for day hikes.




ny 30 facts:

it starts in the southern tier, off of ny 17, the southern tier expressway
the adirondack park parts are in fulton, hamilton and franklin counties.
ny 30's extension into quebec, pq 138, is over 865 miles long, goes thru montreal & ends up near labrador.
just south of tupper lake, ny 30 crosses into the southeast corner of saint lawrence county for less than a mile.
hamilton & essex counties are the only ones totally in the park, and hamilton is the 3rd largest land wise with the smallest population in ny state.
the adirondack trail is ny 30a from mayfield south to the thruway i-90.

it goes through the less used, less expensive parts of the adirondacks.
the wilderness areas are less crowded, unlike the high peaks mob scene.
