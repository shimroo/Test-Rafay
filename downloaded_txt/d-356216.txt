have a
desire to learn more about your player piano, or to see how to service
or rebuild your piano?  these two books by art reblitz (left &
right) are the finest source of information available today.  the
player piano servicing and repair book will show you  just how the
player piano works, and information on the many different player
systems in player pianos. 



the
piano servicing,tuning, & rebuilding book will give you information
to learn what is involved in a piano, and to service or repair your
instrument.

if you want to see the history of automatic musical instruments, the
encyclopedia of automatic musical instruments by q. david bowers is the
one to own.  you will find it hard to put down.  this is not
a book on rebuilding, but a book on the history of these
instruments.  you will not believe how much information with
pictures is in this one book!

book for more information and pricing.
