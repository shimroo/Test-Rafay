	 tonight in los angeles: chief + grouplove @ the troubadour
	 
    


tonight @ the troubadour is a show filled with bands we adore - chief headlines and newcomer, grouplove, opens up. haim is in the middle slot and everyone seems to love them as well. chief has signed with domino recordings and their first two singles, "night & day" and "breaking walls" sound brilliant. they jumped on the rumble: los angeles last august and delivered an evening of amazing harmonies. it seemed like over the course of two days, we got hit by grouplove from three different angles, all from sources we trust, about this la based act. we then got a copy (thanks kimi) of their ep, and the lead single, "colours" is an indie hit if we've ever heard one. now it will be our mission to get them to play our rumble party, but this is a band that needs to be on everyone's radar. buy tickets herelabels: chief, grouplove, the troubadour
