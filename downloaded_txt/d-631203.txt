get ready for 2025 by signing up for our health and wellness fair 
showcase your health and wellness business by vending at our premier event, where you'll connect with hundreds of engaged residents and network with over 80 health-related businesses, including owners and managers.
 
with marketing that reaches an audience of 70,000+ through e-blasts, social media, and print advertising, sponsorship is an affordable and effective way to grow your brand!
﻿
﻿you'll get premium booth placement, waived booth fees, and more- but they sell out quickly, so act fast!
