making a difference

logs end is a hardwood flooring company with a difference. instead of only cutting down new-growth trees, we focus on retrieving “lost” timber from the heyday of 19th-century ottawa valley logging operations. many of our logs are recovered through diving operations on the ottawa river, its tributaries and small lakes. based out of ottawa, logs end is canadian owned and operated, and is the country’s leading supplier of historic old growth flooring. meet the team »

we met them at a home show and were impressed with their approach and their products. we appreciated their professionalism and their kindness.

i installed 1650 square feet of logs end pine flooring last year. made the house look like a million bucks. very interesting product for conversation when guests are over. not many people can boast that their floors are up to 300 years old unless you sell your flooring to everyone in my area. thanks for the high quality product at a very reasonable price. you don’t get this quality of flooring at home depot.

when i was looking for a unique high-end wide plank floor, the only choice for me was logs end. they provided me with a wide selection of species, colours and grades and took the time with me to help find the perfect fit. we are thrilled with the end result and would certainly look to logs end in the future!

logs end came through for us when we were in a jam. we needed flooring on a very short turn around and rob made it happen. we were very impressed with the service and the final product and our clients got the beautiful floor they wanted so much! thanks again!

the warmth and feeling of longevity created by the fine wood products they provide is reason enough for choosing logs end, but when you add in the level of service they offer, there is really no decision to be made. no one else compares.

we are totally amazed at the quality of the flooring you arranged. it is not finished yet, but it is absolutely stunning even unstained. pierre and his son daniel were also amazing at installing it and had it all done in 2 (very long) days and the job looks so professional. thank you for recommending him. we are completely blown away by the quality of the product and service we have received.
