									“they didn’t make me feel like a patient. they knew me – val. they knew my likes and dislikes. when i go for follow-up visits, i still get a sick feeling in my stomach when i’m outside the center, because it brings back memories of everything i had to go through, but that goes away the minute i’m inside and seeing all the people who know me and took care of me.”
