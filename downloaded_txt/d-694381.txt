radical goddess thealogy



this weblog is dedicated to the goddess and to saving the planet -- by gently replacing god the father with god the mother by the year 2035.  too simplistic? nope, i don't think so. female deities are role models for unconditional love.  violent sky/war gods are dangerous, to men as well as women.  people are biologically programmed to need religion of one kind or another.  (btw, "thea"=goddess, "theo"=god)

goddessites as earth preservers





just because you’re a goddess follower don’t think all you have to do is follow the goddess (or that one particular goddess who tickles your fancy).  

no indeedy, sweeties.  in the grand scheme of things, you have bigger fish to fry. in fact, i’m afraid the key to rescuing the world from climate chaos rests on your shoulders.  your job is introducing this key to the world, and making sure the world grabs on, lobs it into the key hole, and then turns the darn thing. the key?  switching from sky/war gods to earth/peace goddesses – pronto –  no time to waste. in the distant past most of us circled around the earth mother.  and you can bet your bottom dollar we didn’t trash her.  we humans don’t trash what we see as sacred, do we?

jesus loves the little children (too much)







apparently in alabama jesus truly does “love the little
children” – all the way to sunday and back!  



in his floor-length white robes, satiny hair, and big baby blues, this
holy dude spreads a blanket, beckons a 14-year-old to sit on it, removes her
clothes, strips to his loin cloth.  fondling
the little child’s private parts, he asks her to cradle his holy penis in her
hands: 

 “’i don’t know how much these women are
getting paid, but i can only believe they’re getting a healthy sum,’ said
pastor earl wise, a [roy] moore supporter from millbrook, ala.  

“wise said he would support
moore [for the u.s. senate] even if the allegations were true and the candidate was proved to have
sexually molested teenage girls and women.

“’there ought to be a
statute of limitations on this stuff,’ wise said. ‘how these gals came up with
this, i don’t know. they must have had some sweet dreams somewhere down the
line.’”  






for more go here



why are we not surprised?  



humanity's too good now for the primitive male-god religions.  



let's scrap them for some good old-fashioned goddess ways of seeing ourselves and the world.

drilling down on trump









as goddess-loving humans, how can we trap trump and plop him
into a cage?   





for the well-being of mother earth and her children, i know
we all agree that dt must be tripped up fast.



the donald is not evil or mean – he’s just mentally
ill.  most people in the know call it narcissistic personality disorder, or “npd.” 



npd makes donald crave love and approval the way a drowning
man craves air.  to get love he’ll
literally do anything, including trying to drown would-be rescuers.  



already i see cracks in the donald’s face.  for the past week he’s gone through a
trump-hotel-full of female contempt and disgust (the women’s marches), and it’s
eating into him like lye eating into a pig’s skin.   



solution?  keep showing
him we loathe his behavior worse than kids loathe dentists' drills.  in no time flat this will shrink him into an
impotent puddle of butter.

flipping santa into a man's bod





















somewhere in the distant, foggy past, someone flipped santa
into a man’s body. 



in actuality, santa was the germanic goddess holda, who
during the christmas season brought gifts to all good children.  

santa holda flew through the air in a wagon stuffed with christmas
goodies, and drawn not by reindeer but by birds.  


"before she suffered a savage smear campaign at the hands of church and state alike, much evidence indicates that holda-perchta was a magnificent goddess, simultaneously both powerful and loving. 

"above all she was powerful. one of her most vital tasks was keeping the earth fertile enough for crops and plants to grow and flourish, a task she accomplished by traveling the earth ... every year for the twelve days between christmas and epiphany. 

"she also seems to have been the original santa claus, showering children the earth over with gifts at the winter solstice."

walking into trees








he promised the swamp would be drained,


was elected, said “rain!” and it rained,

and the old crocodiles,

wore flesh-eating smiles,

and the turtles were well entertained.



snip



a minority of the [american] electorate goes for the loosest
and least knowledgeable candidate [for us president], certain that … their
votes will be only … a middle finger to washington, 

...and then — whoa. the
joke comes true. you put a whoopee cushion on your father’s chair and he sits
down and it barks and he has a massive coronary. 



snip



and now we sit and watch in disbelief as the victor drops
one piece of china after another, spits in the soup, sticks his fist through a
painting and gobbles up the chocolates. 



snip



… he stages a ... victory tour … where he can waggle
his thumbs and smirk and holler and point out the journalists in their pen for
the mob to boo and shake their fists at. 



snip



meanwhile, the democrats wander in the woods, walking into
trees. … a lackluster black muslim congressman from minneapolis is a leading
candidate for chair of the democratic national committee, the person who will
need to connect with disaffected workers in youngstown and pittsburgh. 



why not a ballet dancer or a buddhist monk?



[and] the emperor-elect parades in the nude while his
congressional courtiers admire him and the nation drifts toward the rapids. 



from “thank you, trump voters, for this wonderful joke,” by garrison keillor
