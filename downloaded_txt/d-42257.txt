gem hut 
features jewelry items and natural gemstones for sale from around the world. we will not display or sell any type of artificial, synthetic or simulated gemstone. our goal is not only to provide gemstones for sale, but also to educate and inform the buyer. this is a gemstone gallery which can be yours. as gemstones are sold, they are replaced, and new gemstones are added frequently. if you are looking for something in particular, we take requests and do our best to provide them.

we also feature jewelry settings. after selecting your gemstone(s), be sure to visit these pages for a setting in 14k yellow gold or white gold. many settings are also available in 18k gold, rose gold, platinum and sterling silver.
