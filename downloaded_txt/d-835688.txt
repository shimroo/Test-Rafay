our reviews






"i had to be in santa monica for several days on business. i was comfortable,
                                    well-rested and close to where i needed to be. it was very convenient to be able to
                                    cook too! i saved money, and was able to stick to my strict diet"



"we loved our time here! our suite was like an upscale apartment and was perfect for
                                    our family vacation. it was very clean, modern, and comfortable. the courtyard and
                                    pool are wonderful. check-in was easy, and the staff is friendly. the location can’t
                                    be beaten!"
