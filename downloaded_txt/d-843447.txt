						"top tier customer service! great communication. beautiful trees! they secure it on top of your vehicle once you pick it out. i had a slight issue with the basin of my tree when we got it home. the delivery crew came out the night of my purchase and got it fixed. really appreciated that since i had to work all day the next day. thank you for your patience, kindness & understanding!! i love my tree and definitely would recommend this place. happy holidays!"

						"very easy experience, super helpful staff. tree quality is very good, fresh, and crisp. if you come back after purchasing one of their stands they'll swap it out for you! mainly noble is what you'll find here but just ask any of their associates and they'll be able to find you a perfect match. the trees are really well cared for, organic and sustainably farmed - these owners were actually one of the founding members of the sustainable oregon tree farming."

						"this is the third year getting a xmas tree from santa & sons. this year we moved to the south bay and this place was not close to us anymore. we went to 4 xmas tree places and kept having to settle on a tree if we wanted to leave with one. xmas isn’t about settling. we made the 40 minute drive and they did not let us down. best choices in the whole city."
