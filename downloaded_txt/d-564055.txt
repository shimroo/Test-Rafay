daniel negraneau stacked for playstation





i recently tried the playstation game "danie negraneau stacked".  the graphics are great, and it was neat to peek at my cards like in real life, and you can choose what emotion to display. but i must say i would much rather be playing for real money on multiple tables on the computer.but it did get me thinking... wouldn't it be cool to combine the great ps graphics and the comfort of the living room couch and big tv with real money playing .... and what if one of the online rooms added the emotion/face feature to add another element to online playing?

women take on the men at poker - and come up with aces





the talents required of a poker player are traditionally male traits: aggression, the ability to lie and hide your emotions. and, of course, staying up late smoking cigars.but women are finally breaking into the world of poker and some are beating the men at their own game.britain's first live all-women poker championship is being held this summer with an estimated prize of £100,000 and a promise of "celebrity status in the poker world".poker has emerged from smoky back rooms and has exploded in popularity, first by being shown on television and now by the popularity of internet games.suddenly it is not only respectable but fashionable to play, attracting more women and young people. women are still in a minority, but they have come a long way from the days when a female face around the table was rare.a yougov poll last year showed that women made up 30 to 40 per cent of online players. in casinos, the proportion of women is estimated to have increased from one to five per cent of players.rest of article

britney spears saga continues...





a couple days ago, i posted "will britney spears sue over a broken high chair?". this story gets even more interesting, and it comes from msnbc..."the antics of current white trash pinup girl britney spears and her no-means-of-visible-support husband kevin federline. the real-life beverly hillbillies recently got a visit from the los angeles county department of children and family services and a deputy sheriff. it seems a doctor reported their baby, sean preston, suffered a skull fracture six days before he was brought to the hospital. two months earlier, britney was caught driving with baby preston on her lap."

i have a 5 month old baby who is starting to use a high chair, and each day i am quite careful making sure she is buckled in, and that i don't turn my back on her even though she is buckled. because i know from my 1st child it only takes a second for them to figure out how to stand up or lean over the side of the highchair.i can't say i was surprised when i saw the headlines at the grocery store checkout lines "britneys baby falls out of high chair" and it went on to say the baby was rushed to the er.now i see britney may sue over baby’s fall from high chair. i suppose thats one way to save face if your a celebrity... blame the high chair maker. and of course, the nanny was watching the baby.tags: baby, britney, britney spears

ultimate bet





the same day i noticed ultimate buddy was working again, i found time to play a tournament (not easy with a baby in the house), so i decided to use my 1 free entry into  ultimate bet's million dollar freeroll qualifier.an hour into the tournament i'm doing good and in 300-something place. then my table freezes... i patiently waited for a 1/2 hour before this happened:ub's response:we are sorry for the inconvenience it has caused you. this tournament has been cancelled due to technical difficulties and your account has been credited with 50 ultimate points. you can use these points to register in one of the million dollars tournaments located in the ultimate points lobby.note:you need 50 ultimate points to enter our daily events, 500 points to enter our weekly events, 5000 points to enter our monthly events, or 30,000 points to make your way directly into our million dollar freeroll on july 15th.does ub really think giving me another entry makes up for wasting an hour and a half of my time?!

hot damn lucky ladies poker club





female poker novices ante up to the gameby emily seftelthe arizona republicthere will be gambling this night, you can bet on that. stacks of chips will dwindle and re-form, then dwindle again. there will be bluffs and raises and groans over lost pots -- even though there is no money gambled.more than 40 women are gathered at a restaurant in phoenix to participate in the hot damn lucky ladies' poker club. they're here to eat, drink and socialize, but most of all, to play cards. many of them are first-timers and have never played a hand of poker before."does a flush beat a straight?" one woman asks."what's the difference between them?" asks another.a little bit of instruction is in order, then, before the playing begins.the game this night is texas hold 'em, a form of poker in which players use the two cards in their hands and five community cards to make the best possible five-card combination. at a table in the back, dealer larry pabst has just laid down the last of the community cards."now, what's the best possible hand that could be made with these cards?" he asks.the novices at the table frown at the cards. "a straight?" one ventures. pabst nods. enough practice. it's time to play poker.the players aren't thinking about what their presence means to the game of poker. they're busy examining their cards, calculating how much to bet, deciding between a chocolate martini and a cosmopolitan.but this group represents a larger trend in poker: the increase in women players, from home tournaments to online gaming to casino poker rooms. it's hard to determine how many women are in the game, says eric morris, co-owner and publisher of bluff magazine. he estimates that women now make up 25 percent of players.morris credits that growth to increased exposure to the game, adding that annie duke and other female players have had an enormous impact."tv has really helped bring that out," he says. "annie duke won the championship (at the world series of poker tournament of champions) on espn. you see a lot more women now profiled in magazines and television. we've seen a lot of women subscribers coming in."maryann morrison, founder of womens poker club, a national women-only web site, has seen membership climb to more than 3,000 since december 2003, when the site was launched."at that time, it was right before the big poker rush," she says. "i noticed the difference in treatment of women at the tables and figured it would be great if women could get together."an avid poker player, morrison recalls that she was treated differently from the male players at the table. men would single her out and play more aggressively, or worse, fold or play as if she needed help. she started the site so women would have a place to meet and exchange strategies without feeling intimidated by male players.now the atmosphere at the tables is changing, she says."that (behavior) is not really apparent today, because more and more women are playing."

montana people





i haven't been playing poker the last week, or updating my blog as both of my daughters and myself have been experiencing the wonderful thing called flu (dh hasn't been so lucky...so far anyway)i did come across this the other day...montana people: weird in their own special way"we have all heard tales of strange people living in montana; the unabomber, the freedom militias, the poor sods stuck in the federal witness protection program.  i assure you the majority of people living in montana are friendly, polite, are reasonably sane, and will go out of their way to lend a hand to strangers.  now, i am a cynical californian transplanted in montana. i cannot help but feel suspicious of helpful strangers.  oh, the clerk wants to volunteer the use of his truck to haul a new desk to my home, does he? back off! i know how to use this pepper spray!  this actually happened, sans threats and pepper spray.  i bought a desk at the local staples, and then realized i had no way to get it to my apartment. the clerk offered to haul it to my place, free of charge and after work hours.  no, he was not hitting on me! the guy was at least sixty years old. he volunteered because i needed help. his no-strings-attached offer blew me away.  desperate, i agreed. he delivered the desk as promised, said, “glad i could help”, and left.  “weird,” i breathed. “what is wrong with these people?”  the clerk’s admirable attitude is commonly found throughout montana. even the children are reasonably polite and helpful.  after three years of living here, though, i remain wary. you can take the girl out of california, but you cannot take the pepper spray out of the girl.  the communities in this state are heavily family-oriented. community barbecues are held in a park near my home during the summer. fourth of july picnics, duck races (don’t ask), actual church socials—if the event is wholesome family fun it happenshere.  i do not attend these functions.  i have more born-again christian relatives in this state than should be legally allowed. a relative is usually connected to whatever community event is being held.  if i attend a single one of these events, i will be expected to attend every single event following. if i fail to do so, all of my relatives will knock on my door at the same time to find out why.  the above is an example of how closely knit the communities are. most people here are hardworking, conservative, bible-thumpers. the main topics of conversation are: huntin’ and fishin’, church, children, family in general, and ranching.for those of us more liberal minded, not married, without children, not ranchers, and disapprove of huntin’ and fishin’ any chance at conversation is limited.  nice people, but a trifle dull.  the crazies montana is famous for, though, do exist.  a large muscular man lumbered into the local humane society while i was recently there. dried mud caked his boots. black hair draped his shoulders. he wore a leather and wool coat over his flannel shirt and jeans. the coat smelled as if he justpeeled it off the back of a buffalo.  he asked for his dog in a growling voice, a scary gleam in his eyes. his hunting dog was brought in from the back cages.  the woman behind the desk told the man he needed to buy a license for his dog. he asked why. every dog needed to be licensed. it is the law.  the man burst into a passionate speech about how licensing dogs was another trick by the evil government to squash our freedom. he mentioned something about mind-control. his muscles seemed to grow along with the scary light in his eyes.  i edged away from the man while i filled out a form for a new license for my dog. each woman behind the desk kept a polite smile fixed on her face. the older woman kept her hand on the phone.  the man finally grabbed a license form and stalked out of the office, poor victimized devil, and took his stench with him.  what can you say after an exit like that? i hope the big guy is happy pawing the ground with his fellow buffalo men.  montana’s weirdoes come in all shapes, sizes, smells, and personalities, but then people do all over the world.  god bless the weirdoes for making life colorful."about the author: visit http://www.blogcharm.com/knowledge/ totry out jenny's writing exercises and read her humorous articles"i do believe this is a perfect "californian transplanted to montana" viewpoint. i also think she sees alot of us as "weird" because she doesn't have kids.as a montanian i have to say, yes we are definitely a different bunch, the majority friendly, more than helpful and family oriented. i lived in the midwest for several years, and never could quite get used to the rudeness and unfriendliness i experienced there. i am quite happy to be back in montana. here strangers say "hi how is your day" instead of cutting in front of you in the grocery store checkout lines. high school boys hold doors open for women at the mall instead of brushing past them.but i do feel, just as the governement should not be controlling online poker, the government should not be controlling us by making us license our dogs. the man described sounds like a rancher. work here in montana is hard, whether ranching, logging or working at a lumber mill. therefor, the men don't all smell like a california executive at the end of the day. if you don't like the smell of a hard working man, you are probably in the wrong state!and i don't consider myself dull... yet i'm married with children, conservative, and hunting and fishing are a couple of my favorite outdoor activites. actually, my family enjoys hunting and fishing as a family.the montana i know, there is nothing wrong with its people, nothing at all. there is no one else i would rather have for neighbors than the kind of people that go out of their way for strangers without thinking twice.

poker night food: more than just pizza delivery





from an article in the southern mississippi sun heraldwinter weekends are great for having friends over for game night.texas hold em poker and bunco are games people enjoy playing at monthly gatherings, but you can just as easily get out a deck of cards and play gin rummy, spades or canasta.heidi tobey of lexington, ky., said she and her friends started playing poker before it became a big thing. "most couples you meet play some sort of cards, uno, yahtzee, when they're getting together with family and friends," she said. tobey said she usually serves sandwiches, spinach dip and vegetables, and chips and cheese dip. "if it's just the guys getting together, they order pizza. they don't care about sandwiches, they just want pizza, beer and chips."phil kearns and his group of buddies have been playing poker for about two years. they started when kearns' wife, kim, began playing bunco with the wives of three of his friends. "we said if they were going to be out playing bunco, then we should be playing poker," he said. whoever hosts game night decides on the menu, kearns said. it includes chili, bean soup, barbecued sausages, country ham sandwiches, hot wings, chicken fingers, sub sandwiches, pretzels and peanuts.the food served at bunco parties usually is simple. but if it's a special occasion, cooks like paula goins will take extra time to make the meal more elaborate. when it's goins' turn to host the monthly party, she usually gets requests from the players for chili or vegetable soup, and pimento cheese sandwiches. once a year the group invites husbands, and then it's potluck.for 30 years, goins has been part of several bunco groups. "some are dessert groups or appetizers, or the hostess sticks to dinner. a lot of times i've done lasagna, bread, salad and dessert," she said. she once served roasted duck at a christmas bunco party. "some hostesses love to cook like i do, but some are not oriented like that, and they buy lasagna. "it doesn't matter, we just get together and have a good time. it's a fun night."doris' fudge piepaula goins of lexington, ky., has been hosting bunco parties for three decades. this recipe and the one that follows are a couple that her friends request.1 square unsweetened chocolate1 stick butter2 eggs1 cup sugar1/2 cup all purpose flour1 teaspoon vanilla1/2 cup chopped pecans, optionalmelt chocolate with butter in a saucepan on low heat. beat eggs, and set aside. mix sugar with flour. combine all ingredients and add vanilla. if desired, add pecans. pour into a well-greased pie plate. bake at 350 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. do not overbake.paula's angel dessert1 10-inch angel food cake1 pint strawberries, crushed1 tablespoon milk1 16-ounce container cool whip light, thawed1 pint strawberries, slicedfresh strawberries and mint leaves for garnishcut angel food cake horizontally into three layers. stir crushed strawberries and milk into 1-1/2 cups cool whip. place one cake layer on a plate. spread half of strawberry mixture on top of cake layer, and top with half of the sliced strawberries. repeat layers and end up with cake on the top. frost sides and top with remaining cool whip. decorate with strawberry slices. refrigerate until ready to serve.mini rachaelsfood network star and cookbook author rachael ray suggests serving a mini sandwich buffet for game night, mini versions of such sandwiches as mini grilled cheese and tomato, mini burgers and mini rachaels. here's her recipe for mini rachaels.1 tablespoon vegetable oil2 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces16 slices mini rye bread1/2 cup sweet red pepper relish1 pound smoked turkey, thinly sliced1 pound sauerkraut, rinsed and drained1/3 pound sliced sharp cheddarsuggested accompaniments:mini pickles, mini pretzels, mini chess men butter cookies.preheat oven to 250 degrees. preheat large griddle or large non-stick skillet over medium heat.to a small pot over medium low heat, add 1tablespoon vegetable oil. add butter, and melt it into the warmed oil. keep a pastry brush on a spoon rest or small plate on hand.lay out 8 slices of rye bread. dot bread with teaspoonfuls of red pepper relish. top with even amounts of smoked turkey, sauerkraut and thinly sliced cheese. top cheese with remaining slices of bread. brush griddle or skillet with oil and butter mixture. grill and toast sandwiches 2 to 3 minutes on each side. transfer sandwiches to cookie sheet, and place in oven to keep warm. makes 8 mini sandwiches.mini burgers on toasted discssandra lee, on a recent episode of "semi-homemade cooking with sandra lee" on the food network, prepared a simple menu for game night. she made mini burgers on toasted discs, poker potato chips, mini chicken pot pies, casino lemon almond cake, and fruity queen of hearts cocktail. here's her recipe for the mini burgers. other recipes can be found at www.foodnetwork.com.8 thin slices white breadolive oil cooking spray1 pound lean ground beef1 pack (1-ounce) pot roast seasoning1 egg, lightly beaten2 tablespoons worcestershire saucetoast the bread the day ahead. preheat oven to 400 degrees. take 8 slices bread and cut out 32 circles using a 1-3/4-inch round pastry cutter or an empty, clean 6-ounce tomato paste can. arrange disks on an unlined sheet pan, and spray lightly with olive oil. toast rounds for 7 minutes. when cool, store in an airtight container.to make the burgers, preheat oven to 400 degrees. mix ground beef, seasoning, egg and worcestershire sauce in a large bowl. form 1-inch meatballs using 1 tablespoon of meat mixture per ball. arrange on a broiling pan, leaving meatballs an inch apart. using index finger, gently poke holes in the middle of each meatball. bake for 12 minutes. turn temperature to broil and cook 5 minutes more. let stand 7 minutes before transferring to toasts. gently fill each burger hole with ketchup or mustard. serve warm. makes 32 cocktail burgers.

casinos marketing towards women





just a few days ago i was wondering why one of the las vegas casinos doesn't cater to women instead of men, by that i mean its always women cocktail servers. why doesn't one of the market to bachelorette parties or girls getaways and have male cocktail servers?the closest thing i could find was betfair pokers ladies night, every tuesday night from 2/28-3/28 they have a womens only freeroll.  after each freeroll event one lucky winner will be randomly drawn from the list of participants. the "ultimate night in" experience includes a very attractive dealer,  and all equipment (cards, chips, branded table cover). the handsome hunk coming into your home will teach you how to play poker and be your dealer.  he’ll bring along everything you’ll need. the poker gear, some canapés and drinks – all you have to do is invite your girlfriends around and have a great night. betfair is also giving away a seat at the ladies world series of poker event.the freeroll events are limited to 350 women only - so the odds are quite good!and no, they do not accept accounts from the u.s. :(

likelihood of congress banning poker growing





as a member of the poker players alliance, i received this urgent letter today...please take a moment and click here and voice your opposition to legislation banning online poker. if you want more info on the poker players alliance click hererecent actions in the nation’s capitol are clear signs that federal lawmakers are determined to ban online poker. on february 16, rep. bob goodlatte, r-va., and his supporters held a press conference to announce the introduction of h.r. 4777. if passed, this bill would make outlaws of on-line poker players!goodlatte and other members of congress use this bill in a misguided attempt to lump poker in with other forms of gambling. although they claim to have an exclusion for games with a “predominance of skill,” poker has been singled out. as goodlatte says, “…technology has allowed for new types of electronic gambling, including interactive games on the internet such as poker and blackjack, which may not clearly be included within the types of gambling currently made illegal by the wire act.” so he is really targeting poker players who enjoy the game online.the legislation is troubling for many reasons, but the following issues are key:first and foremost, it tramples the rights of poker players who enjoy playing online and represents a slippery slope that could lead to the federal government denying people the right to play poker in offline venues.second, the goodlatte bill hypocritically makes exceptions for some gaming activities, including state lotteries and placing online bets for horse races, even while prohibiting games of skill like poker.finally, by forcing isps to eliminate access to gaming content on the internet, the federal government is moving away from long-established protections of free speech in this country. ironically, many in congress recently chastised china for forcing isps to regulate content that chinese citizens could receive, yet those same lawmakers now find it acceptable for the u.s. government to censor the internet.rep. goodlatte’s bill has already gathered 115 co-sponsors representing districts in 36 different states. use the links in the box to the left to determine if your member of congress has signed on as a co-sponsor of h.r. 4777. please click here and voice your opposition to this legislation. let your member of congress know that we are a strong and unified voice to keep poker legal.the poker players alliance is committed to defeating this kind of egregious government intrusion into our personal lives. and with your help, we can succeed!

 gary suffir and jackie johnson, who met at partypoker.com will marry at the paris hotel in las vegas next weekthe couple first met online on partypoker.com in september 2004 in a $30omaha game in the site's virtual chat rooms after jackie defended gary in arow over a bad beat. after initially communicating via the buddy function on the website and being in consistent contact for months after that, jackie moved to new york city from las vegas to live with gary in march 2005. now a year later, they are getting hitched at the paris hotel in vegas on march 7th, with famous poker ambassador mike sexton as a witness. and the couple are rapidly stacking the deck by planning a new family."we thought that if the baby is a boy we could call it mike after mikesexton but in honor of the way we met we'll call him chip," said a smilinggary. "if our baby is a girl we may call her linda after linda johnson, thefirst lady of poker, but queenie is a possibility." what about doyle after poker legend doyle brunson? "i don't think so - my chips would be on chip." added gary, a 28-year-old new york attorney.gary and jackie are celebrating their honeymoon on the partypoker.commillion v cruise around the caribbean, starting on march 12th. with their minds on a family and the full house it would bring the poker mad couple aren't worried about building a bankroll on the cruise, they already figure they have a royal flush. "it is going to be great playing poker on our honeymoon," said jackie, who credits gary with her improved omaha play. the couple actually considered having their honeymoon in omaha, nebraska but the card-playing cruise stopping in jamaica and grand cayman won the day.gary and jackie's friends and family are taking part in a special online tournament before the ceremony, while plans for the wedding itself include a unique poker wedding cake and poker floral displays. there was speculation that the soon-to-be mr. and mrs. suffir would dress as a king and queen and request 'cry me a river' for their first dance, but their celebration of happiness and poker is being handled as straight as their poker faces.the couple couldn't be happier as they contemplate going all-in for life."we're just so happy to have found each other and we can't wait to start afamily," said jackie, a 27 year-old artist.partypoker.com spokesman warren lush said: "it is with great delight thatwe are hosting what we believe is the world's first online poker wedding. wehope that they'll have and to hold'em forever and ever."

digital prints





with a new baby, i have lots and lots of digital pictures. i'm finally finding time to get some prints made. i have been meaning to upload them to walmart.com and then pick them up when i go shopping this weekend. but i think i have changed my mind on where to have them printed.the march issue of pc world did a review of the photo services... and walmart came in last with dismal print quality at 12 cents. kodak easy share gallery was first "very good" quality at 15 cents. snapfish was next with "good" quality at only 12 cents. shutterfly was tied for good quality, but at 19 cents, i think i will try kodak or snapfish.thought for today...a good friend will come bail you out of jail... but a true friend will be sitting next to you saying. "damn that was fun".

women's card club marks golden anniversary





i just read this article in the salt lake tribune, and i have to say these ladies know how to start a ladies card club! i wonder if they played any poker, or if it was just canasta or bridge. reminds me that i need to learn how to play bunco.whether it's a friendship, a business partnership or a marriage, few relationships last 50 years. which is why rachel zaelit's card club is so extraordinary. for five decades, this group of eight women has gathered once a month to play cards, enjoy good food and savor lasting friendships. the group recently celebrated its golden anniversary at zaelit's salt lake city home, the same place the club played its first hand of canasta in november 1955. since then, the women have added games and welcomed new members and lost others, including one of the original players to death. (the group reached a high of 24.) too many years have passed for the women to remember whose idea it was to start the club or why they picked the second wednesday of the month as their official meeting day. but all agreed that as stay-at-home wives and mothers, they needed a regularly scheduled "girl's night out" to maintain their sanity. from the beginning, their husbands and children understood that few things could keep them from attending. no one is officially in charge, but all admit that zaelit keeps the group organized. the death of a close friend in november prevented the club from celebrating its 50th anniversary on the exact date. and they couldn't get together in december, because that is the one month they allow husbands to attend. so the women - who range in age from 62 to 73 - waited until january to mark the milestone. it may have been belated, but was no less sweet. it seems that zaelit and company are ahead of their time when it comes to card playing. today, a growing number of women are shuffling and dealing for fun and competition, according to the trade magazine woman poker player. women, for example, make up 35 percent of the nearly 75 million people who play poker in the u.s., according to the publication. and over the next two years, experts predict an increase, with the number of women equalling or possibly surpassing men. those numbers do not account for all the women who get together regularly to play bridge, canasta or bunko - an especially popular game among utah women. even the beauties on the popular television soap "desperate housewives" have a regular card date to catch up on the gossip of wisteria lane. initially, they made elaborate dinners for each other and lingered into the wee hours of the morning. one time, after playing cards, they decided to go bowling and stayed up until daybreak. they have taken trips to a mountain cabin together and rented a limousine for a wendover weekend. but these days, they go out to a favorite restaurant to eat and then take turns at one another's homes for snacks and chitchat and however many hands of cards they can squeeze in before 10 p.m. because after all these years, these women know card club isn't really about the cards.

powerball jackpot





eight workers at a nebraska meat processing plant have claimed the record $365 million powerball jackpot. the seven men and one woman will each receive $15.5 million after taxes under the cash option. when one of the winners, eric zornes, 40, was asked whether he was still working at the plant, he replied: "no. i've been retired for about four days now."i must say working at a meat processing plant is definitely one job i would not go back to... i have several relatives that work at them back in southern minnesota, and i don't know how they do it. i can't even stand to be a few miles downwind of the plant :( reminds me of the "roby 43" a group of farmers from roby, texas that won a $46 million thanksgiving lottery. they each receive $39,000 each november for 19 years. quote for today...please excuse my parents, they don't get out much.there are 3 kinds of people - ones that can count, and ones that can't.

sit n go's on party poker





the last 2 mornings after feeding the baby around 7 am and getting her back to sleep, i have played a sit n go at party poker. i won 1st place and 2nd place. would have both been 1st place if i hadn't gotten rivered! i had kq and went all in. i made 2 pair on the flop. and the other player had ak and an ace came on the river.oh well, i still made $19 and $9 for 45 minutes of playing while eating breakfast and still in my jammies. i can't think of a better way to start my day either. i wish i could play more sit n go's, but unless i'm sure the baby is going to be sleeping for an hour, i just don't want to get started playing a tournament. so i will stick to playing a sng each morning, and playing ring games the rest of the day.now if party would only offer a reload bonus, i would play some ring games there instead of ub.
