the ruin of all witches


a gripping story of a family tragedy brought about by witch-hunting in puritan new england that combines history, anthropology, sociology, politics, theology and psychology.“the best and most enjoyable kind of history writing. malcolm gaskill goes to meet the past on its own terms and in its own place…thought-provoking and absorbing." —hilary mantel, best-selling author of wolf hallin springfield, massachusetts in 1651, peculiar things begin to happen. precious food spoils, livestock ails, property vanishes, and people suffer convulsions as if possessed by demons. a woman is seen wading through the swamp like a lost soul. disturbing dreams and visions proliferate. children sicken and die. as tensions rise, rumours spread of witches and heretics and the community becomes tangled in a web of distrust, resentment and denunciation. the finger of suspicion soon falls on a young couple with two small children: the prickly brickmaker, hugh parsons, and his troubled wife, mary.drawing on rich, previously unexplored source material, malcolm gaskill vividly evokes a strange past, one where lives were steeped in the divine and the diabolic, in omens, curses and enchantments. the ruin of all witches captures an entire society caught in agonized transition between superstition and enlightenment, tradition and innovation.











horror movie













weavers, scribes, and kings


a unique history of the ancient near east that compellingly presents the life stories of kings, priestesses, merchants, bricklayers, and othersin this sweeping history of the ancient near east, amanda podany takes readers on a gripping journey from the creation of the world's first cities to the conquests of alexander the great. the book is built around the life stories of many ancient men and women, from kings, priestesses, and merchants to brickmakers, musicians, and weavers. their habits of daily life, beliefs, triumphs, and crises, and the changes that people faced over time are explored through their own written words and the buildings, cities, and empires in which they lived.rather than chronicling three thousand years of rulers and states, weavers, scribes, and kings instead creates a tapestry of life stories through which readers will come to know specific individuals from many walks of life, and to understand their places within the broad history of events and institutions in the ancient near east. these life stories are preserved on ancient clay tablets, which allow us to trace, for example, the career of a weaver as she advanced to become a supervisor of a workshop, listen to a king trying to persuade his generals to prepare for a siege, and feel the pain of a starving young couple and their four young children as they suffered through a time of famine. what might seem at first glance to be a remote and inaccessible ancient culture proves to be a comprehensible world, one that bequeathed to the modern world many of our institutions and beliefs, a truly fascinating place to visit.

say nothing


new york times bestseller • now an fx limited series streaming on hulu • national book critics circle award winner • from the author of empire of pain—a stunning, intricate narrative about a notorious killing in northern ireland and its devastating repercussions.one of the new york times’s 20 best books of the 21st century "masked intruders dragged jean mcconville, a 38-year-old widow and mother of 10, from her belfast home in 1972. in this meticulously reported book—as finely paced as a novel—keefe uses mcconville's murder as a prism to tell the history of the troubles in northern ireland. interviewing people on both sides of the conflict, he transforms the tragic damage and waste of the era into a searing, utterly gripping saga." —new york times book review "reads like a novel ... keefe is ... a master of narrative nonfiction. . .an incredible story."—rolling stone a best book of the year: the new york times, the washington post, the wall street journal, time, npr, and more! jean mcconville's abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as the troubles. everyone in the neighborhood knew the i.r.a. was responsible. but in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. in 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to northern ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. mcconville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.patrick radden keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in northern ireland and its aftermath uses the mcconville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. the brutal violence seared not only people like the mcconville children, but also i.r.a. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders. from radical and impetuous i.r.a. terrorists such as dolours price, who, when she was barely out of her teens, was already planting bombs in london and targeting informers for execution, to the ferocious i.r.a. mastermind known as the dark, to the spy games and dirty schemes of the british army, to gerry adams, who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his i.r.a. past--say nothing conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.

this is shakespeare


an electrifying new study that investigates the challenges of the bard's inconsistencies and flaws, and focuses on revealing--not resolving--the ambiguities of the plays and their changing topicalitya genius and prophet whose timeless works encapsulate the human condition like no other. a writer who surpassed his contemporaries in vision, originality, and literary mastery. a man who wrote like an angel, putting it all so much better than anyone else. is this shakespeare? well, sort of. but it doesn't tell us the whole truth. so much of what we say about shakespeare is either not true, or just not relevant.in this is shakespeare, emma smith--an intellectually, theatrically, and ethically exciting writer--takes us into a world of politicking and copycatting, as we watch shakespeare emulating the blockbusters of christopher marlowe and thomas kyd (the spielberg and tarantino of their day), flirting with and skirting around the cutthroat issues of succession politics, religious upheaval, and technological change. smith writes in strikingly modern ways about individual agency, privacy, politics, celebrity, and sex. instead of offering the answers, the shakespeare she reveals poses awkward questions, always inviting the reader to ponder ambiguities.

the sixth extinction


one of the new york times book review's 10 best books of the yeara major book about the future of the world, blending intellectual and natural history and field reporting into a powerful account of the mass extinction unfolding before our eyesover the last half a billion years, there have been five mass extinctions, when the diversity of life on earth suddenly and dramatically contracted. scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. this time around, the cataclysm is us. in the sixth extinction, two-time winner of the national magazine award and new yorker writer elizabeth kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the andes, marine biologists who dive off the great barrier reef. she introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the sumatran rhino. through these stories, kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by georges cuvier in revolutionary paris up through the present day. the sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.
