here we were with a middling sort of
        hotel barge driving a decent business in the champagne when it all came
        to a stop. now there are two things which will indisputably cause this
        to happen. one is for the barge to sink or for some similar terminal
        disaster to happen; the other is for the clientele to vanish en masse.
        in our case it was the latter and was brought about by the covid
        pandemic. i shall explain. 
 the people who go
        for a cruise on a hotel barge in france are nearly all from what might
        be called the anglo saxon countries. the french do not consider a barge
        a suitable place in which to spend leisure time. there is thus no local
        market. the large expensive barges mostly draw their passengers from the
        united states; others, such as merganser 2 which are smaller, from
        britain, and commonwealth countries as well as the us. i do not know
        what happened to the others but the virtual standstill in international
        leisure travel meant that merganser sat in dock for two years with us
        putting people off and off again and the barge going nowhere.
 so we decided to
        come to england where at least we had a local market. we sailed the
        barge from vitry-le-françois in france to calais, and thence from
        calais to london, where she is on a residential mooring in blackwall
        basin. she is undergoing modifications to make her suitable for
        residential use as well as for cruising.
 since we shall be
        carrying out this work during 2022 we shall not be using the vessel as a
        hotel barge during the summer of this year and have decided therefore to
        recast our websites. much of interest has happened during these recent
        months and we thought that those of you who have travelled with us or
        made enquiries of us would perhaps be interested in hearing of these
        things and if they happened to be in london coming to see us where they
        would be very welcome. 
the journey to england
first we had to satisfy
        ourselves that the vessel was physically fit for the journey. she was
        surveyed in garnier's yard, the hull was strengthened, the interior
        checked and the necessary certification (es-trin) obtained. the journey
        to calais was estimated to take 3 weeks and a passage plan was prepared
        (see below). we found it impossible to secure on board crew for this
        journey and the plan had to accommodate land based crew who had assisted
        us during previous years. as we got further from vitry-le-françois this arrangement became awkward and at arques
          the crew decided that they could not help us any further. at arques
          there is a famous boat lift, now superseded by a huge lock of some 13m
          depth. at this point in our journey repairs on the lower gate were in
          progress and we were held up for two weeks. as time passed and opening
          time approached large commercial barges gathered and we
          tried to get help. sadly none was forthcoming and, caught in the wash
          of a 2800 ton monster as it fired up to exit the lock, we sustained
          some damage. however, we proceeded and under sole captaincy navigated
          the rest of the route to calais, where we were given a berth in the
          marina. up to arques the journey had been uneventful, if slow owing to
          the need for the crew to get back home every night and the enforced
          wait at arques, but afterwards it changed. the canals of northern
          france are bleak and inhospitable; the much trumpeted camerarderie of
          the battellerie also. the staff of the vnf and calais port on the
          other hand were tolerant and helpful and a credit to their
          organisations.

the calais to london
            passage plan

this may be of interest to anyone contemplating
              cruising between calais and london. 
as with all barges
          merganser 2 is flat bottomed and before attempting a sea passage in
          such a craft weather conditions must be appropriate. consideration
          must also be given to the tidal flows during the passage, since the
          speed of the vessel is modest and it can be rather trying to find
          oneself struggling against a strong spring tide. in the middle of july
          2021 conditions were ideal and so, accompanied by my brother in law,
          david gaffan and his wife elizabeth, we set off from calais marina.
          the passage to the concrete lighter at queenborough, estimated at 12
          hours, took 11 and after some negotiation with the harbourmaster we
          stayed the night there. setting off next morning on the flood we
          arrived at the west india dock lock to find it closed and therefore
          proceeded against an ebb tide to the hermitage moorings just
          downstream of tower bridge. our destination was blackwall basin,
          operated by the canal and river trust and we found later that 24 hour
          notice was required to obtain lock service with only a small margin of
          error allowed on eta - rather difficult for an incoming barge from the
          north sea especially as they have no waiting pontoons. what's more,
          after three days at the hermitage moorings which we needed to make a
          booking, when we got to the lock the harbourmaster  said that
          they had no record of our mooring (booked and paid for since march)
          and we had to wait another day to get to our berth. to any incoming
          barge captain i would say do not try to get into the west india dock
          on arrival in london but go to st. katherine's yacht haven. they may
          be expensive but they are competent and professional and were the only
          ones who helped us to secure ourselves on a falling tide.

        blackwall basin is part of the former west india docks and is located in
        the heart of lodon's docklands. the surrounding environment is a mix of
        residential and financial buildings, is expensive and in course of
        substantial redevelopment. this redevelopment is being carried out by
        canary wharf  plc and will result in an attractive and luxurious
        mixed townscape. the marina is home to narrowboats and barges, is
        residential and houses a varied and thriving population of boat owners.
        on our arrival the harbour master described the denizens as bohemian,
        and our recent experience suggests that this description is fair. the
        canal and river trust, who run the site have tried to create a barge
        village atmosphere and have broadly succeeded, the aforementioned
        denizens being friendly and helpful. as mentioned merganser is
        undergoing modificatios and will not be cruising as a hotel barge in
        2022. however, as a concept a hotel boat cruise on the tidal thames has
        possibilities, with much to go for on the tideway, for example, saint
        katherine's yacht haven, tower bridge, the houses of parliament and even
        the thames barrier. the modifications to the barge will reduce the
        capacity to six passengers and it might be quite expensive. let us know
        what you think on ukwh@bargedirect.com
