discover how we can bake better together











bringing australians together
throughout history, different cultures have shared baked foods at social gatherings and meal occasions. these traditions continue to play powerful roles at tables right across australia. through our high quality baking products, mauri helps to preserve these diverse rituals and plays an important part in upholding the unique place baking has in connecting people, families and communities.











wholesome goodness starts with us
mauri baking products are enjoyed by millions of australians every day. that’s why we place tremendous importance on the ‘wholesome goodness’ of everything we do by:

ensuring the high quality of the ingredients we use, including knowing where they’re sourced and the integrity of how they’re produced
maintaining high manufacturing standards at all times and understanding how this impacts on end quality
delivering the consistent, high quality baking products our customers expect and deserve.












inspired to innovate
we see ourselves as baking leaders, not followers, and believe the opportunity to be innovative and inventive lives within us all. we’re passionate about new ideas and strive to bring inspiration to our customers at every opportunity by constantly creating new ‘firsts’ and ‘bests’ in baking.











baking better through better understanding
understanding the changing needs of australian families and the baking professionals who serve them is critical to mauri. we’re always looking for new and better ways to meet these needs, by fostering long-term partnerships with the australian baking community and delivering baking solutions that create real shared value.
