testimonials 



what people are saying about unreal entertainment and keynotes by joe m. turner. 










						"we recently brought joe to be part of our uber bpo summit in san francisco, where we hosted business partners and leaders from around the globe. joe delivered everything we could have hoped for and more. besides being a hit as the entertainer at our offsite dinner, he helped us creatively overcome some obstacles and challenges we faced at the venue. the next day, he was an amazing addition to our line-up of speakers, encouraging a room of our global partners with his ability to intertwine magic and insight. he later shared his model for creating amazing experiences with some more of our hq team members. what i admire most about joe is not just his ability to perform, or to communicate insights, or to deliver a quality experience to an audience; what i really admire is that he values excellence in himself and inspires it in others. highly recommended."					
lisa stonerglobal head of support operations uber 











						"joe was phenomenal at our statewide conference! he was easy to book, accessible, and flexible working with our schedule.he was impressive all the way around -- from entertaining our members with his magic the night before his presentation to his jaw-dropping presentation.our attendees are still talking about his message, humor, and of course his magic.i highly recommend joe for any event planner that is looking for their next memorable speaker with lots of pizzazz."					
cindy williamsceo, cartersville-bartow chamber of commerce 











						joe m. turner is an extraordinary speaker, performer, and entertainer. his presentations are mesmerizing and memorable. book him!					
brian tracyinternational speaker and authorbrian tracy international 











						"joe, in front of the room, not only shares magic, but shows you how you have magic, too. his ability to integrate the audience into his program and have them leave feeling that they gained something they can take home is something every event planner and leader would like to have."					
anna liottaspeaker, authorpast president - national speakers associationresultance inc,. seattle, washington 











						highly entertaining‚Ä¶ deeply educational. the emerson group is still talking about joe‚Äôs visit days after the actual session. i would highly recommend joe m. turner for both the deep business insight he delivers and for the sheer entertainment value of his performance.					
mike wallervice president emerson human capital consulting 











						"that was unbelievable ‚Äì very impressive!"					
arthur blankowner, atlanta falconsco-founder, the home depot 











						"i participated in a seminar that joe conducted at a north highland company meeting. he kept the group thoroughly entertained while delivering his key messages, in tune with the overall theme of the conference. it was apparent that he had taken the time to understand the firm, and the audience. i highly recommend joe as a professional speaker ‚Äì someone who can motivate and educate his audience, while entertaining them ‚Äì especially in conference type settings, where information overload is a risk. well done joe, and thank you."					
subhash verghesesenior manager, the north highland company 











						johnny carson loved magic. he would love this stuff! joe, you are fantastic! how is he doing that? great job! everyone, come back in an hour ‚Äî he‚Äôs going to set himself on fire!					
ed mcmahonjohnny carson‚Äôs long-time ‚Äútonight show‚Äù announcer 











						"i knew that joe could create magic... what i experienced made me feel like i was sitting at the mgm grand instead of the city club of buckhead! i loved his magical illusions and would recommend him to businesses, companies, and clubs as a great person who can bring a group together for entertainment and fun."					
amanda brown adventure photographer clothing line co-foundersouthern style manatlanta, georgia 











						"when i saw joe on the platform at an event in atlanta, i knew right away that he‚Äôd be perfect for our upcoming national board of directors meeting. he was a hit and wowed some of the biggest names in our industry! as a speaker, mentalist, and magician, joe has a great combination of communication and entertainment skills, and he knows how to use his entire palette of expertise to create the right experience for any audience. can‚Äôt wait to see him again!"					
laura stack, mba, csppast president, national speakers association 











						"joe, you were fabulous! what an amazing and classy performer! you are an artist among mere mortals. consider yourself re-booked."					
jerry farber atlanta comedy legendjerry farber's side dooratlanta, georgia 











						i just wanted to take a moment to let you know what a great job you did at our 3rd annual leadership conference last week‚Ä¶ i was extremely impressed with your creativity in preparing for our meeting with only a few short phone conferences and then an impromptu rehearsal right before the event.
