what our customers say? üòä











highly recommend!
so many times tech support is nothing more than a 'black' hole. help is required, you submit the issue and it falls into the abyss. this is not the case with macecraft software. their software is solid, stable
and their support staff is responsive and knowledgeable.i don't give out a's often but macecraft software deserves it. macecraft software is an excellent choice.

                  the response to support questions i've received have come
                     promptly, accurately and courteously.
                  

                     no hassles and no waiting on the phone, wading through a
                     phone tree of interchanges!

using jv16 for around 20 years and no issues
i have been using jv16 for around 20 years, and regclean, its predecessor before then. in its primary function of cleaning up the registry, software remnants, and making windows work better i have had absolutely no issues.the hundreds of thousands of registry entries and files jv16 has identified as unnecessary and worthy of deletion have never been in error in my experience. i have nothing but praise for this product.
