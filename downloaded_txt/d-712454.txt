the center for theology and the natural sciences (ctns) promotes the creative mutual interaction between theology and the natural sciences through research, teaching and public service.
founded in 1981 as an affiliate of the graduate theological union (gtu) in berkeley by robert john russell, ctns became a program of the gtu in 2016.
ctns’s central scientific focus is on physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, and genetics, with additional topics in the neurosciences, technology, environmental sciences and mathematics. ctns’s central theological focus is on christian theology, ethics, and spirituality, with an additional focus on science and the world religions.
internationally, ctns offers the scholarly journal theology and science, a membership program, a wide variety of publications in the field, and more. at the gtu, ctns offers seminary and doctoral courses, student advising, two annual fellowships, and events and lectures for the gtu community and the general public. we invite you to explore what ctns has to offer.
