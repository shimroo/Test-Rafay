i don't want to start any blasphemous rumours, but i think that god has a sick sense of humour, and when i die, i expect to find him laughing...

true dat

          "my experience with becoming an adult is, you come to this place where you see that you have this set of beliefs. and you run up against things that kind of defy that. you get into a situation where there isn't one simple answer and all the arrogance, all the surety of youth is either thrown back at you or it's at least ineffective. and then the world is thorny, and the world is fucked up and very hard to manage, and it's impossible to know whether you did the right thing or the wrong thing. it's about being disabused of this idea that there's a stone-cold right and wrong."-- ben affleck (of all people) in this month's issue of esquire

"remember, we were doing just fine before you got here."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``blinkies in the airglowies on your backburly manly starebarry's meat attack~~~~jebs enjoys dutch's infamous asparagussinn's "pasta fromage"beef dip! beef onion cheese dip! that you can eat with a fork!oh, leave it to the steampunks to get fancy n'shit, with their rosemary encrusted goat cheese and...mmm...cheeeese...enchilada pie to go with the lots and lots of sangria. with coke and lime. ~~~~fire, of course. ~~~~~~~sinnamon is not only a gracious hostess, but also a graceful dancer.~~~~~likewise, our host flash is a dapper, b'chaliced fellow:"sup, y'all? my head is on fire. take that, thrift store speaker."it was contagious, even, as a foray into a nearby thrift store gave me my new coat(picture doesn't do it justice) and bustier (headed for the rit pot and some fringe):~~~~oh. oh. and did i mention the homemade sushi? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~sauce is not a good percussionist.~~~~slut life heats things up...play on, playa. ~~~~~~not everybody was into the food and games. conversation, drinking, carousing, etc.but he did get his mage past the ogre assassinin to the...the...where'd that sangria go?~~~~~~~~~~~so, i was rescuing this baby, trapped in a tree, next to a kitten, and...no! there was a bear! yeah! that's it!once the rain stopped, a few of us sturdy ones took flash up on his offer of a hike to the river. "river." it was a rough trek, over hill, under dale...on my ass...sinn said it was hilarious, hearing us traipse around - we never did find the river. mmhm. some sort of magical river, that only sober people with adequate lighting can find, uh-huh. ~~~~~slut life helped flash keep the cold at bay."that's not a very manly face.""how about this?"~~~~~~~some of the fire was beyond the norm - just like its owner. ~~~~~~~~~~sinn's spinning and pasta fromage might be tasty, but i'm not sure i can say the same for her taste in decor:i keed, i keed, the nut hut has the lovely combination of personality and people-live-here coziness with touches of the art and fire (literally and metaphorically) residing in its inhabitants.~~~~*kindly insert your own freudian joke here*~~~"but you are my love, the astronaut, flying in the face of science..."~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~aforementioned thrift store (and flash's cunning mind) also yielded the evening effigies...~~~~~who's the creepy guy in overalls ogling e??let's burn 'em!~~~~~~~what, other peoples' parties don't end with people screaming at them with megaphones?
