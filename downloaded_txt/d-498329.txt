 thanks for visiting our recently updated website! we have found and studies show that couples who use natural methods of family planning have strong marriages and healthy, happy families. our culture tends to be confused about issues surrounding marriage and how to live a healthy and spiritually-rich life.we want to help! our website leads you to many of the answers you need. for testimonials, go to about us. for sample homilies on contraception, sterilization and cohabitation, go to homily helps. for q & as go to nfp q & as. (these make good parish bulletin inserts.)for written documents, audios, videos and other links, go to resources.we hope you enjoy your visit. we are glad you came!p.s.  consider bringing fr. mccaffrey to your parish for an nfp parish mission,
request a mission.  help us spread the good news about nfp.
