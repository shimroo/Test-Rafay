tips for transporting a ferrari or some other luxury exotic vehicle 
 by  fclublv / on 2020-12-12 /  in  car transport 


if you own a luxury vehicle like a ferrari or a bugatti and you’re planning to move, we’re sure you’re worried about how you’ll go about transporting your prized vehicle to your destination. you’ve invested so much money in your exotic automobile and you certainly want to protect your investment at all costs.
trusting a company to handle luxury vehicle transport can be a nerve-wracking experience but here are some important and useful tips that you can use for a more seamless process:
shipping your luxury vehicle
transporting your luxury vehicle from one place to another won’t be like sending a letter at the post office. it needs to be handled with the utmost care using specialized apparatus like a large car transporter or a covered semi-trailer. you also need to tap the services of a reputable and reliable transport company. this is your cherished possession, and you certainly don’t want to leave it in the hands of some old truck driver. the good thing is that there are plenty of transport companies to choose from, who can guarantee the safe passage of your car from your old home to your new one.
what are your shipping options?
as previously mentioned, you will need to hire a respected company to transport your luxury vehicle. this way, you will not be sweating bullets worrying about how your car is being transported. instead, you’ll have peace of mind knowing that your vehicle is in the hands of experienced professionals who will handle it responsibly and with the highest care possible.
1) trailer
if you decide to have your car sent by a trailer, you can choose from two options: an open-air trailer and an enclosed trailer.
open-air trailer
open-air trailers are usually 70-80 feet in length and have several vehicles that are attached to a trailer, which is being pulled by a large truck. while it is the cheapest option available, it comes with a serious drawback: your vehicle will be exposed to the elements and can be damaged by extreme weather conditions and other debris on the road.
and so, this option isn’t usually recommended for your luxury car. but if you consider this option, you may want to get insurance so that the transport company can assume responsibility for any damage your vehicle suffers during the transportation process.
enclosed trailer
transporting your luxury vehicle inside an enclosed trailer is highly recommended as this method offers more protection and safety for your cherished automobile. this is because an enclosed trailer has four walls as well as a roof that is composed of impact-resistant materials that can withstand any damage caused by external factors. an enclosed trailer is also capable of withstanding high pressure.
2) air freight shipping
you can also try shipping your car by air so that it can reach its destination faster than by sea. for a more exclusive and even faster shipping experience, you can even ship your car with the use of a charter plane. while there is no doubt that this option will cost you thousands of dollars, the trade-off is your luxury vehicle is sure to arrive at its destination safe and sound.
3) ocean freight shipping
this is a method that is typically employed when transporting vehicles to other countries. this method is done in one of two ways: by roll-on, roll-off (roro) method, or the container method. roro service involves your car being rolled over to a vessel before it is strapped securely to a platform. the container service, on the other hand, is a better option as it puts your vehicle inside a closed container before it is placed onto the vessel.
useful tips to use before your luxury car is picked up
luxury cars don’t come cheap, and you should make sure that it is treated as carefully and mindfully as possible. here are a few things that you can do to ensure that the process goes smoothly.
1) carefully document every inch of your car
record video footage of different areas of your car, especially the underside, rocker panels as well as exhaust fumes.
2) take note of the mileage on the odometer
there is always a chance that the people handling the vehicle might decide to take it for a joyride. and believe me, there is nothing more distressing than having your benz, or bmw took out for a spin without your consent.

pros and cons of shipping a vehicle versus driving it yourself 
 by  fclublv / on 2019-01-31 /  in  car transport 


you just landed a new job, and a move is in order. however, the destination is thousands of miles away. in addition to transporting your household belongings, there’s the family car to consider. driving it is possible, but there are other options. shipping the vehicle is an alternative worth exploring.
here we’ll explore the pros and cons to shipping a vehicle or merely driving it yourself with some help from cheap movers, the source of the best long distance moving companies in las vegas. the answer will be different for every person.
scheduling aspect
if you decide to drive the car, there’s no scheduling necessary. wake up on moving day and head off onto the freeway. hiring a vehicle carrier takes time. you must research the company and make an appointment.
depending on your location and the carrier’s style, such as open or closed sections, it can take weeks for a driver to be open for business. when you’re leaning toward the shipment option, be sure to make your appointment as soon as possible. you can always cancel it if necessary.
wear and tear on the car
driving a car that’s 10 or 20 years old across the country isn’t the smartest idea. there might be breakdowns along the way. ideally, driving a newer vehicle will keep you moving along at a steady pace. there will be wear and tear on the car in either case.
start with a tune-up on the car before you leave. the vehicle may be a couple of years old, but it can still have issues down the road. preparing it with an oil change and a tire rotation will reduce the wear on the components.
cost comparisons
there’s an upfront cost on shipping your vehicle. it will undoubtedly cost you more to ship it than to drive it.
there are hidden costs to driving the car too. the gas and lodging are apparent but don’t forget about that oil change that will suddenly be due after the road trip. when you add everything up, there’s a cost to both types of transport.
dirty or pristine
another consideration involves which type of shipping option for your car. if you’re ready to ship the vehicle, you must choose between open or closed carriers, states the drive. in simple terms, the choice is between a dirty or pristine car upon delivery.
open carriers are the semi-trucks that you see on the freeway with stacks of cars. wind, rain, hail and other weathering factors impact the vehicle. it will arrive very dirty. closed carriers protect vehicles from the elements. they’re very expensive, however. vehicles that can’t take the weathering, such as vintage cars, may need this type of transport.
professional driver alternatives
there’s a combination choice of shipping a vehicle with a professional driver, reports montway auto transport. you hire a licensed driver who takes your car on a road trip. pay the person rather than a shipping company’s charges. you can even tag along on the ride.
these drivers are thoroughly checked by their employers so that you have a safe driver behind the wheel. if you’re still debating between a shipping company and a road trip, a professional driver is a good compromise.
regardless of your final selection, perform all of your research well before the actual move. deciding on your car’s fate shouldn’t be a last-minute decision. choosing the right pathway for you will make the transition easier. your next adventure will be in a new state with your dependable vehicle.

how to prepare a collector car for long distance auto transport 
 by  fclublv / on 2019-01-24 /  in  car transport 


getting your collector car ready for transport brings along its own unique set of worries. some people equate it with sending a child off to college, while others liken it to bringing home a new baby.
by any standards, it can certainly be a stressful project, especially if you are shipping your classic auto long distance.
finding a transport carrier
first, get some recommendations. talk to other collectors, either people that you know in your area or even other enthusiasts on various classic car forums. many of these people have shipped cars either across town or across the country.
another avenue to explore is the recommendations given by museums or even auction houses. both are excellent sources of information, and they can probably give you some useful tips on how well various carriers operate.
word-of-mouth recommendations are great, but they are useless if the carrier has a dicey safety record – it is always good to double-check the potential carrier’s safety record (and their insurance status!) on the fmcsa website before deciding to call them for a quote.
this site is for the federal motor carrier safety administration, operated by the u.s. department of transportation. the database is easily searchable by dot number, motor carrier number, or company name and is free of charge.
 should i use an open or enclosed trailer?
unless you’re planning to ship a car for restoration, it will be better to send the car in an enclosed trailer to prevent damage from the weather and from hazards such as small rocks which can cause damage to the vehicle.
using an enclosed trailer will be more expensive, but you can bet that that cost will be less than the price to repair your collector car.
 what if my car doesn’t run?
if your car is in non-running condition, you will have to disclose that to the carrier up front. this information will allow the company to discuss the options that you have for loading and unloading the vehicle, as well as any fees involved.
remember, a carrier’s insurance generally only covers its negligence, so make sure that you have insurance coverage for the value of the vehicle before you think about transporting it anywhere. companies like classic auto insurance and chubb collector car insurance are well-known for being leading classic car insurance companies who are well-acquainted with the needs of their customers.
and if my car is running?
if your car is operable, it is a great idea to give the auto transport company written instructions for the operation of your vehicle, especially if it has an alarm, a cut-off switch for the fuel, or some other procedure that is not readily apparent.
it is undoubtedly a good idea to have the battery fully charged and only around a quarter of a tank of gas for loading, unloading and driving to its parking spot.
what else do i need before shipping?
thoroughly clean the car inside and out before transport. and remove any items from the interior, glove box and trunk which could move around and cause damage during transport.
this clean out will make it much easier to photograph and document any existing damage that your car has so it will be considerably easier to deal with any damage claims if needed after the vehicle is picked up.
and according to the freight specialist uship.com, the use of a non-stacking trailer will help keep fluids from other vehicles dripping onto yours, as well as the use of soft tie-downs to avoid paint scratches and other damage.
as with anything else, the price should not be your only consideration when shipping your collector car. the right carrier will make sure that your classic gets to its destination in as great a shape as it was when it you dropped it with the carrier.
