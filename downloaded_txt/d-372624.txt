these people came to our rescue! we had two weeks to get into our new home and we have two children with autism. these kidos are water seeking and so needless to say i was beyond terrified about moving in. they re-arranged their work schedule and got our fence in 4 weeks early, they put it in on the day we moved in. i cannot stress how thankful i am to this company and their effort to ensure my family's safety.
