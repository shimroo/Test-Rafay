                this is the best dealership in central & southern ca. i can say that with confidence as i have been buying harleys from several dealers in socal for the past 25 years. i have dealt with every dealership from san diego, orange, riverside, ventura and santa barbara counties. i have purchased over 15 bikes and i have to say that biggs was the best dealership by far to work with. long story, but bought my softail in 2017 and decided to sell it back to the dealer in april of this year. being without a bike really is not a good thing, so with hat in hand i went back in july to buy the bike back. they gave me a fair deal when i sold them the bike and didn't uncharge me when i returned to buy it back. the main reason is the best sales guy i have ever worked with, cody. as with all transactions, there were a few minor hiccups, but all dealt with honestly and without any of the pressure tactics you have come to expect at dealerships. needless to say, living in orange county, i will give them all my referrals, maintenance and purchases. please give cody a call, and tell him steve the deluxe guy sent you....you won't be disappointed. everyone, from retail, maintenance, parts etc are the best. i have never had any problems they just always under promise and over deliver to a surprising level...thanks cody and all, see you soon for my 5000 mile

                hello i purchased my first harley last week with the help of garrett as our salesman. i just want to take a moment and say how much i appreciated his help. he spent time showing me bikes and answering my questions on several occasions before i actually purchased. he is patient, friendly, and knowledgeable. lulu in finance was also very friendly and easy to work with. i also would like to point out how much i like dealing with chris in the parts dept; he is particularly good at public relations and has taken care of my needs promptly. thank you biggs and the staff for getting me on my harley!

                i am from florida and had just completed a coast to coast run from florida in 42 hrs. needless to say i was tired. but maintenance on the bike comes first. the folks at biggs harley davidson were great and very accommodating, they had me in and out in no time. oil change and full inspection, there waiting area was great, very comfortable etc. even met some very interesting people. thanks biggs!!

                another great day in southern california for a harley ride. first adventure to biggs for service of important items for my harley. on entry to service department i was met by kieran who checked out my bike then wrote up the service order. he was very professional, friendly and courteous. i advised i would wait for the bike and i was asked if i wanted to leave my riding jacket with helmet at the desk. i said yes and walked into the main floor browsing at everything in stock. i mentally itemized what i'd need for upcoming trip. all floor staff were pleasant friendly and helpful. a couple of hours later my bike was ready per josh. josh was very good in answering my questions and very professional. i want to thank the tech michael for a job well done and another customer friendly harley day at biggs. keep up the fine service.

                new to hd and to biggs.  shopped around a bit at the other dealerships, but was shocked by the unreasonable markups and fees that the other guys are charging.  

ended up at biggs for the fair price.  mark bradley and josh made things easy.  good communication throughout.  can't think of any reason to go anywhere else.
