				a distant prayer to the god who is near – psalm 61			


let us modify an old saying. we often hear it said, “anything worth doing is worth doing well.” yes, but is it not also true that “anything worth saying is worth saying well.” one of the things we gain from regular feeding on scripture, and especially the psalms, is a richer vocabulary for expressing our thoughts about god and our

				disappointed but not forsaken – psalm 60			


in a way there is not much to say about this psalm. further information about the terms and expression, the possible historical contexts and the alternate translations will not be very enlightening. the psalm is what it is, an expression of disappointment. but, although the standard means of studying a passage yield little when applied here, there is an important

				the god of all comfort			


scripture: 2 cor. 1:3-11 one of the first things that you notice about the bible is that it is brutally honest. it is not like most other religious books. every time you read about a hero in the bible, it turns out that they have some flaw. abraham doubted god and tried to help out with a child of promise.

				lessons from 1 john			


this article is the first of 10 drawn from the book of 1 john. these were originally presented as lessons in a bible class and have been revised for publication. each article centers on one portion of john’s letter, covering the entirety by the end of the series. my goal is to highlight many of the teachings and encouragements provided

				god saved us – not by works of righteousness that we have done but according to his mercy			


part 2 the world’s bondage to sin. honesty is always important but especially so when it comes to admitting sin in our life. the apostle paul tells us that all men have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god (romans 3:23). the bondage to slavery in egypt was, to the israelites, a never ending bondage. generations were born

				jesus, the bread of life			


in john chapter 6, jesus makes a solemn declaration about himself. he said: i am the bread of life. what an amazing and encouraging statement! but how well did his listeners understand him? and were they prepared to respond in faith? let’s follow john’s detailed account of what took place. 22 the next day [after jesus had walked on the lake

				grace and christian character			


we are a people saved by grace. grace is the foundation of our salvation and our relationship with god. and grace is also the driving force behind how we live as followers of christ. romans 12:1-2 provides profound insight into how grace transforms our daily character, reshaping our thoughts, actions, and purpose. the foundation of grace in salvation in a

				the dividing line			


i watched a video recently that popped up on youtube entitled, “this has become common in christianity and it needs to stop.” this title intrigued me so i clicked on it and watched and i was glad i did because it gave a quick example on our decisions as christians in this world. the video was like a parable and

				finish the race!			


in 2 timothy, chapter 2, paul used three illustrations or life examples that his audience would understand, one after another, to make his point: the soldier, the athlete, and the farmer. paul loved to use real life examples so that his audience could relate to his message. i want to focus on the athlete. paul said in 1 corinthians 9:24–25,

				we must all repent to be saved!			


faith alone is not enough! many years ago, i explained the gospel to a young man in west flanders. he said: “now that’s how to be a real christian! but it’s not for me. i would have to give up things i like to do!” millions of people believe in god, millions believe that jesus is the son of god,

				howling like dogs – psalm 59			


it is good that romans 8:261 is in the bible. it is good to know that the spirit helps us with our prayers. it is good to know that others have trouble praying sometimes. we may have greater trouble praying now than in the past. we have not had many good models from which to learn. the psalms are a
