website is a success!







for those of you wondering, the wordpress website went offline due to an overabundance of traffic.

my web designer, who builds websites for a living, told me that he has never seen that happen before, and certainly never on the first day!

we have already hit numbers that make the performance here on blogspot pale by comparison.

not in the old days perhaps, but at least for the last year or so.

having said that i want to thank all of you for your many years of support, and for the incredible success of today. even with all of those setbacks.

we are still tweaking the new site, and hopefully you will soon come to see it as your new home, much like this has felt like home for so many wonderful years.

trump's former doctor gets raided by trump's former bodyguard. feels "raped."  







courtesy of nbc news:  

in february 2017, a top white house aide who was trump's longtime personal bodyguard, along with the top lawyer at the trump organization and a third man, showed up at the office of trump's new york doctor without notice and took all the president's medical records. 

the incident, which dr. harold bornstein described as a "raid," took place two days after bornstein told a newspaper that he had prescribed a hair growth medicine for the president for years. 

in an exclusive interview in his park avenue office, bornstein told nbc news that he felt "raped, frightened and sad" when keith schiller and another "large man" came to his office to collect the president's records on the morning of feb. 3, 2017. at the time, schiller, who had long worked as trump's bodyguard, was serving as director of oval office operations at the white house. 

"they must have been here for 25 or 30 minutes. it created a lot of chaos," bornstein said, who described the incident as frightening.

according to bornstein trump cut ties with him after he blabbed to the press about trump taking propecia, which is a drug to prevent hair loss.

too bad he wasn't on a medication to prevent asshole-itis.

according to dr. feelgood, the thugs made off with all of trump's records, lab results, and charts.

even the ones under his many aliases.

that's right, trump even uses aliases when he visits his own doctor.

apparently bornstein also told the papers that he wanted to be the white house physician, but when trump heard about it he had his long time assistant call to deliver the bad news:

"so you wanted to be the white house doctor? forget it, you're out.' " 

oh these people are ice cold.

white house officials claim that chief of staff john kelly presents himself as a savior and calls trump an "idiot" behind his back. 







what an idiot. 

courtesy of nbc news:  

white house chief of staff john kelly has eroded morale in the west wing in recent months with comments to aides that include insulting the president's intelligence and casting himself as the savior of the country, according to eight current and former white house officials. 

the officials said kelly portrays himself to trump administration aides as the lone bulwark against catastrophe, curbing the erratic urges of a president who has a questionable grasp on policy issues and the functions of government. he has referred to trump as "an idiot" multiple times to underscore his point, according to four officials who say they've witnessed the comments.

officials said kelly's public image as a retired four-star general instilling discipline on a chaotic white house and an impulsive president belies what they describe as the undisciplined and indiscreet approach he's employed as chief of staff. the private manner aides describe may shed new light on why kelly now finds himself — just nine months into the job — grappling with diminished influence and a drumbeat of questions about how long he'll remain at the white house. 

"he says stuff you can't believe," said one senior white house official. "he'll say it and you think, 'that is not what you should be saying.'"

of course since this story broke earlier today kelly has issued a statement pushing back on the allegations:  
“i am committed to our president, his agenda, and our country. this is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to president trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.”

yeah, okay.

this is not the first time that we have heard that there is tension between trump and his chief of staff, and apparently kelly has been greatly marginalized as of late.

and also according to nbc news kelly's negative remarks about the president are not the only thing that puts his job in jeopardy:

current and former white house officials said kelly has at times made remarks that have rattled female staffers. kelly has told aides multiple times that women are more emotional than men, including at least once in front of the president, four current and former officials said. 

and during a firestorm in february over accusations of domestic abuse against then-white house staff secretary rob porter, kelly wondered aloud how much more porter would have to endure before his honor could be restored, according to three officials who were present for the comments. he also questioned why porter's ex-wives wouldn't just move on based on the information he said he had about his marriages, the officials said. 

some current and former white house officials said they expect kelly to leave by july, his one-year mark. but others say it's anyone's guess. what's clear is both trump and kelly seem to have tired of each other. 

move over rex tillerson it looks like you are about to have a little company in the "we just got shitcanned hotel."

mike pence to give speech at nra convention, where for his protection no guns will be permitted. wait, what? 







courtesy of the sacramento bee:  

guns won’t be allowed when vice president mike pence speaks friday at a national rifle association convention in dallas in order to protect his safety. 

the nra says the secret service ordered the ban, but survivors of the parkland, fla., school shooting are calling the move hypocritical, noting the organization’s fierce opposition to gun-free zones in most public places. 

no firearms or weapons of any kind will be allowed at the nra leadership conference at the kay bailey hutchinson convention center in dallas, texas, during pence’s appearance, according to an nra website. the notice emphasizes that the u.s. secret service is responsible for security at the conference, given pence’s attendance.

so wait, everybody being armed makes everybody safer, except the vice president? 

as you might imagine this smacked of hypocrisy for many people, including the parkland survivors.


the nra has evolved into such a hilarious parody of itself. pic.twitter.com/6pw6ntqae6
— cameron kasky (@cameron_kasky) april 28, 2018

and the parents of those who did not survive the parkland school shooting. 



on so many levels, this is enlightening.  according to the nra, we should want everyone to have weapons when we are in public.  but when they put on a convention, the weapons are a concern?  i thought giving everyone a gun was to enhance safety.  am i missing something? https://t.co/f4wgnhj7ri
— fred guttenberg (@fred_guttenberg) april 28, 2018

we also need to keep in mind that this is not the first time that the nra has been caught being complete hypocrites. 



it's really strange that when the nra has a speaking event, or at cpac, or at a trump rally... it's a "gun free zone". i wonder why? probably because guns kill people. #gunreformnow pic.twitter.com/mz7zpsps2f
— alternative noaa (@altnoaa) february 25, 2018

the nra is going to have to finally decide whether or not guns keep everybody safe, or if they are only dangerous to people that they care about.

really can't have it both ways.

disgraced va secretary nominee ronny jackson, will not be returning to his old job as white house physician. 







courtesy of politico:  

white house physician ronny jackson will not return to his role as the president’s personal physician, according to two senior administration officials, after a string of allegations caused the navy rear admiral to withdraw his nomination last week to lead the department of veterans affairs. 

sean conley, a navy officer who took over jackson’s role as the president’s personal doctor last month, will continue in the role, the officials said. 

jackson bowed out last week after montana sen. jon tester, the top democrat on the veterans’ affairs committee, released a document summarizing allegations by current and former colleagues that jackson overprescribed pills, drank on the job and created a hostile work environment. jackson has denied the allegations and has returned to work in the white house medical unit.

now the white house claims that these accusations had no merit and trump went after senator tester hard on twitter.  



allegations made by senator jon tester against admiral/doctor ron jackson are proving false. the secret service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful jackson family. tester should resign. the.....
— donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) april 28, 2018




....great people of montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. admiral jackson is the kind of man that those in montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. not fair, tester!
— donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) april 28, 2018




secret service has just informed me that senator jon tester’s statements on admiral jackson are not true. there were no such findings. a horrible thing that we in d.c. must live with, just like phony russian collusion. tester should lose race in montana. very dishonest and sick!
— donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) april 28, 2018

of course the question to ask is if these allegations are so unfounded, then why is jackson not being reinstated as the white house doctor?

and that question should be followed up by one asking if there is no validity then why is trey gowdy suggesting an investigation by the house?

courtesy of politico: 

house oversight chairman trey gowdy on sunday said some of the allegations against president donald trump’s ill-fated pick for secretary of veterans affairs should be investigated. 

appearing on cbs’ “face the nation,” the south carolina republican said, “i think some of those allegations do warrant being investigated,” referring to a series of allegations levied against the white house physician and now-withdrawn va secretary nominee, rear adm. ronny jackson.

yeah, something still stinks about all of this.

also keep in mind that senator tester was not making these allegations himself but rather passing on information delivered to him by white house and military members who had witnessed these incidents.

i am going to go out on a limb here and suggest that neither ronny jackson, nor the white house really want congress to investigate these allegations.

just a feeling i have.

trump's twitter targets for today, the whcd and michelle wolf. 







the white house correspondents’ dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. the filthy “comedian” totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the seth meyers weak performance). put dinner to rest, or start over!
— donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) april 30, 2018




the white house correspondents’ dinner is dead as we know it. this was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great country and all that it stands for. fake news is alive and well and beautifully represented on saturday night!
— donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) april 30, 2018

i would just first like to point out that if trump thinks he is hurting michelle wolf's career in any way by going after her on twitter he is dead wrong.

she is launching a new show on netflix, and she has just gone from a comedian that only a few people know about, to a national figure who is the subject of tweets by the president of the united states.

there is no way this hurts her professionally.

and that goes for the attacks by the conservatives, and some self identified "liberals," as well.

which by the way are completely without merit.

courtesy of vulture:

as soon as michelle wolf finished delivering her blistering white house correspondents’ dinner roast of the trump administration and the members of the press that cover it, she was, not surprisingly, criticized for much of what she said. oddly, however, a lot of that criticism zeroed in on something that michelle wolf did not actually say: a joke about sarah huckabee sanders’s appearance.

the two jokes that seemed to irk critics were her handmaid’s tale dig — “i have to say i’m a little starstruck. i love you as aunt lydia in the handmaid’s tale” — and the aforementioned line about sanders’s smoky eye, which went like this: “i actually really like sarah. i think she’s very resourceful. she burns facts, and then she uses the ash to create a perfect smoky eye. maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s lies. it’s probably lies.”

somehow this was misconstrued to be an attack on huckabee sander's appearance, which it clearly was not.

in stead it was an attack on her honesty, which, let's face it, was more than appropriate.

however both conservatives and some in the media spouted their faux outrage all over twitter.


that @presssec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive.
— maggie haberman (@maggienyt) april 29, 2018

and of course mika brzezinski also had to give her two cents. 



women who use their government positions to spread lies and misinformation deserve to face the same withering criticism as men. but leave our looks out of it. watching from home, i hurt for sarah, her husband and her children.
— mika brzezinski (@morningmika) april 29, 2018

all of this seemed to puzzle michelle wolf who responded with this:



why are you guys making this about sarah’s looks? i said she burns facts and uses the ash to create a *perfect* smoky eye. i complimented her eye makeup and her ingenuity of materials. https://t.co/slii9tydyx
— michelle wolf (@michelleisawolf) april 29, 2018

exactly.

look if you are a conservative then misrepresenting the facts and participating in faux outrage is kinda what you do.

but if you are supposed to be a "journalist" of some kind you are expected to adhere to the facts, and there were several media types who failed to meet that expectation.

and like i said all of this does nothing but help michelle wolf's career, and ensure that when her netflix show drops on may 27 that it will have a lot more folks tuned in.

so keep it up conservatives (and mika brzezinski) cause all it does is put money in her pockets.

tennessee state police form a perimeter to protect a white nationalist gathering from anti-racist protesters. did i mention this was in a state park? 







police perimeter around the white supremacist conference #amren is intense. we heckling them like hell. pic.twitter.com/mmyd8vave9
— lacy macauley (@lacymacauley) april 28, 2018



courtesy of huffpo: 

police formed a tight perimeter around a tennessee state-owned hotel saturday, guarding a white nationalist conference inside the building from anti-racist protesters gathered outside. 

american renaissance, a racist virginia-based organization listed by the southern poverty law center as a hate group, reserved the 125 rooms inside montgomery bell state park inn for the weekend conference. attendees not staying at the hotel arrived there early saturday morning. nearly all of them were men. they wore suit and ties — mandatory dress for the event — and didn’t respond to reporters’ questions as police escorted them inside.

anti-racist protesters arrived a short time later. state park rangers subjected each protester to a metal detector test before allowing them to enter a fenced-off area across from the hotel. 

one protester, beth foster, grew upset when park rangers wouldn’t allow her to bring a purse inside, as bags were prohibited in the protest zone. 

“this is absolutely absurd,” she told the officers. “nazis” from out of state, she told them, were allowed to rent out an entire tennessee taxpayer-owned hotel, and yet she wasn’t allowed to bring a tiny purse inside a section of her own state park. eventually foster — co-director of the mercy junction justice and peace center in chattanooga, tennessee — left her purse and walked through the security checkpoint. 

“it’s anti-racist activists that the state sees as the enemies,” she told reporters. “not the nazis or the white supremacists who are in our buildings, using our public restrooms, and eating in our public restaurant, plotting genocide.” 

so to be clear the police perimeter was in place before any protesters even arrived?

so they just assumed they would be violent? 

the protesters, many of whom i would assume were also residents of the state, were then not only forbidden to enter the hotel on state park land, but were corralled into a fenced off area like cattle.

and you know this is now a thing, with the nazis and white supremacists demonstrating real fear about the protesters that show up at their rallies and gatherings, even though most of the violence, and the only death, is attributed to their side.

so much for being the "master race," right?

kim jong-un says that north korea will shut down its nuclear weapons program if america promises not to invade. 







did that missile just crash into the ocean again?



courtesy of the nyt: 

north korea’s leader, kim jong-un, told president moon jae-in of south korea when they met that he would abandon his nuclear weapons if the united states would agree to formally end the korean war and promise that it would not invade his country, a south korean government spokesman said sunday. 

in a faith-building gesture ahead of a summit meeting with president trump, mr. kim also said he would invite experts and journalists from south korea and the united states to watch the shutdown next month of his country’s only known underground nuclear test site. 

the comments by mr. kim were made on friday when the leaders of the two koreas met at panmunjom, a village on their shared border, the spokesman, yoon young-chan, said on sunday, providing additional details of the meeting. 

“i know the americans are inherently disposed against us, but when they talk with us, they will see that i am not the kind of person who would shoot nuclear weapons to the south, over the pacific or at the united states,” mr. kim told mr. moon, according to mr. yoon’s account of the meeting.

i'm sorry didn't he just fire missiles over japan?

that's a little southish.

besides the only reason that jong-un is promising that he will not fire weapons at the united states is because his fucking missiles will not reach the united states.

and his promise to abandon his nuclear weapons program is most likely due to the fact that his testing site collapsed, and not because trump scared him.

however the leader of north korea has picked up on something that his former wives learned early on. if you shower trump with praise ("oh donald it's the biggest i have ever seen.") he will give you whatever the fuck you want.

essentially kim jong-un is playing trump like a bloated orange tinted fiddle.
