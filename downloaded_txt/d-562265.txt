guardian expedition led lights



last year was my  first year of running through the winter.  luckily it doesn't get too cold  here, but since the sun is usually down by the time i get home, i did  have to get used to running in the dark.  i found out pretty quickly that  once i leave my neighborhood streetlights are few and far between.  a  headlamp solved the problem of me being able to see the road, but even with  reflective gear i still had problems with drivers swerving at the last minute as  if they didn't see me.  it was a particular problem on a long curving  stretch of road where i believe that their headlights didn't hit me until the  last minute.  so, i started looking into lights to alert the drivers from  more of a distance.  after a lot of trial and error, i think the  guardian expedition led lights are the best.  they are light and  extremely bright, and come with a very strong clip that holds well to  your waist band, the strap on the back of your running  hat, or the arm band for an ipod.  they are so bright that you can  still see them clearly if you have them on your waist band and your shirt is  covering them.  you turn them on and off by twisting the lens cap, and  by unscrewing the lens cap and flipping the batteries, you can change the  light from strobe mode to steady mode.   the last light i had was  made for a bike and had the switch on the back, and the cool thing about the  lens cap system is that i can easily switch them off when i get to a part  of my route where i don't need them.  there are several mounting  options available so you could easily use them on a bicycle, and they are  available in different colors.  i got mine in blue and i'm pretty sure  from the way a few people have jacked on their brakes that they not only  see me but also might have mistaken me for a police car on a traffic  stop.  if you are looking for a good high visibility light for night  running, i would highly recommend these.  i got mine from night gear at http://www.night-gear.com

wonder what really caught his eye?



went to the inaugural greenville force indoor football game last night. the first thing my son said to me when we got to our seats were: "look, daddy. ruth's chris has a sign down on the field." (note: we had gone there for our anniversary earlier this week.)my response? "let me take a picture for mommy!"

irony



update: to our peta friends: show us the boobs, and we release the pigeons.i guess i take too much for granted. i thought the photo from the greenvilleonline.com photo gallery of the obligatory naked protest when the circus comes to town, and the dunkin donuts commentary was comic genius.alas, i think such humor must be totally lost on the female members of our species. my evidence:i sent an email to one unnamed female who works in the vicinity of the new dd location, with the attached photo of the half-naked chick, and simply asked if she heard when the new dunkin donuts would be opening. now, this unnamed female would be fully within her rights to be a little upset that i was sending around photos of half-naked chicks. her response?"i think it opens in march or april."not even an acknowledgment that a picture of a topless chick with an exposed thong was in her inbox. makes me curious as to what else is in her inbox...)i passed along the link to ms. mora, as well, so she could add it to her website's press-clippings. she responded: "don't get what our peta protest has to do with dunkin donuts."but she did invite me to be one of her myspace friends. we're buds now.
