the policy institute at king’s college london, in partnership with the world values survey association, ucl and the behavioural insights team, are pleased to announce a one-day international conference on polarisation. increasingly, there is real concern about cultural, political and social divides, and their potential implications for how we live well together, both within and across nations. how connected we feel to others, our faith in institutions, the health of democracy, and the personalisation of politics are just some of the issues being addressed by current research. in this conference, we aim to bring together international perspectives to explore how theories of polarisation and their applications in empirical work are evolving in a comparative perspective.













								 china as number one? the emerging values of a rising power 
								

one of the most significant global events in the last forty years has been the rise of china— economically, technologically, politically, and militarily. the question on people's minds for decades has been whether china will replace the united states as a superpower in the near future. but for china, this power must be comprehensive — having strong economic and militant forces are only two pieces of the puzzle. china must also possess soft power, such as attractive ideologies, values, and culture. china as number one? explores china's soft powers through the eyes of chinese citizens. utilizing data from the world values survey, the contributors to this collection analyze the potential soft power of a rising china by examining its residents' social values. a comprehensive study of changes and continuities in the political and social values of chinese citizens, the book examines findings in the context of evolutionary modernization theory and cross-national comparison.
