lisbon heritage hotels collection  boutique hotels  live the charm of tradition in the historic center of lisbon

lisbon heritage hotels were created with the idea of promoting charming hotels that reflect portugal’s and lisbon’s tradition and culture.
property and management of portuguese families, the lisbon heritage hotels are installed in old houses and small historic buildings in the lisbon’s historic center.
these small hotel units offer a romantic and welcoming environment. besides that a special balance has been struck between local traditions and modern-day requirements thus creating an authentic alternative to formal luxury hotels. the hotels’ location in lisbon’s historic center facilitates immediate contact with the most genuine aspects of the city, ranging from its monuments to the local flavours.
our small collection of romantic boutique hotels in the historic center of lisbon includes: as janelas verdes, heritage avenida liberdade hotel, hotel britania art deco, hotel lisboa plaza and solar do castelo.
