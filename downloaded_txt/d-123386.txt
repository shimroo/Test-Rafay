kbr helps student secure two consecutive positions at nasa
landing a coveted role at nasa is a dream for many, but for dana gardner, it became
                                    reality. the opportunity presented itself when kbr contacted uhcl's health and human
                                    performance institute (hhpi) to fill a temporary position at nasa johnson space center.
                                    at the time, gardner was a graduate research assistant at hhpi. today, she works at
                                    nasa as a full-time employee of uhcl.
