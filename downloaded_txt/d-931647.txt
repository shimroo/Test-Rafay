covid-19 wastewater monitoring
the gary sanitary district actively monitors our system to measure the levels of sars-cov-2, the virus responsible for covid-19. even before symptoms become apparent, sars-cov-2 can be detected in solid waste. by monitoring these levels in our wastewater, we can gain insights into the current covid-19 activity in the communities we serve. you can view the current data here. (data last updated january 6, 2024 from samples collected during the week of december 18, 2023. most recent data are subject to change.)
