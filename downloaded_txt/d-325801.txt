i can't lucid dream anymore, so here is how i get ideas these days. when i want to see a painting or hear a poem, i lay down with an ipad mounted above me. and then block out all light and sound by wearing bose qc35 noise canceling headphones and a sleeping mask. i first listen for each line of a quatrain. they come fast (the moment i put my mask back on). when the quatrain is completed, i then watch my hypnogogic imagery for the painting that goes with that quatrain. that is not as easy as it used to be. i will think the words "i am thinking about thinking." if i don't see an image, i wait until i have a dream about it that night. or just add the quatrain to my website without a painting to go with it. i accept any ideas from myself that seem to have come from somewhere other than me.




 i have given up making pastel paintings due to old age. set of six 282 is where i switched to ai prompting. i have been posting them on reddit at https://www.reddit.com/user/seasickapetite/

i don't keep track of inspiration to keep work slow but they seem equal enough.
sometimes i turn the painting titles into quatrains and vice versa.

ask a world by endless chose.
what it arts and what it throws.
and on its hunch it carries those.
secret votes the ladder knows.

who was that just singing.
ten times and discover she was gone.
doctor i have a fever.
one lifetime and "i am song".
