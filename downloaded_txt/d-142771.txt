designations & lineups













































































































feedpro®
feedpro optimizes selection for increased production and moderate body size while maintaining body condition score and daughter fertility. this revolutionary index designates sires with the genetics to improve income over feed costs and maintains health and reproductive traits.
learn more



fertilitypro®
fertilitypro identifies sires with semen that will likely improve pregnancy rates. this designation is assigned by examining industry sire conception rate (scr) values, along with intensive in-house semen quality evaluations.
learn more



grazingpro®
grazingpro sires are selected to improve the profitability of grass-based production systems by transmitting outstanding daughter fertility, greater longevity, mobility, moderate stature and improved component yields.
learn more



robotpro®
robotpro identifies sires that transmit the desired traits for robotic milking systems. these sires are selected by focusing on components and milk yield, udder health, longevity and durability, as well as functional udder traits.
learn more



showcase™
showcase sires earn this designation through outstanding breed-leading type or show-winning pedigrees. this designation is for customers who want to produce the next show winner or improve the overall type in their herd.
learn more



gender selected™
gender selected designees have sex-sorted semen available. select sires continually collects conception data from herds using gender selected semen to calculate sexed semen fertility deviations and removes bulls from the lineup that perform unacceptably.
learn more



elite sexed fertility™
the elite sexed fertility icon designates sires that can help you achieve the highest sex-sorted semen conception rates, enhancing the return on your investment! this designation identifies gender selected™ sires with above average conception performance
for sex-sorted semen in both 2m and 4m products.
learn more



mastitis resistantpro®
sires which excel in multiple indicators of mastitis resistance are more likely to deliver genetic improvement. mastitis resistantpro uses a combination of cdcb mastitis resistance, cdcb somatic cell score (scs) and zoetis mastitis resistance.
learn more



gforce™
the gforce lineup indicates sires with elite genetic evaluations based on a combination of traditional pedigree data and genomic data, but does not contain actual daughter data. this combination of data increases the reliability of a young sire’s genetic prediction prior to the availability of actual daughter data.
learn more



gforce+™
the gforce+ lineup includes proven and young sires selected based on rigid semen quality standards and their high-ranking sire conception rate (scr) from progeny test semen usage. gforce+ sires must have outstanding genetic merit, a highly reliable sire stack and actual calving ease observations.
learn more



progeny proven
if you want the most reliable sires available for your breeding program, look for the progeny proven icon. this lineup designates sires with an evaluation based on both genomic data and actual daughter performance data.
