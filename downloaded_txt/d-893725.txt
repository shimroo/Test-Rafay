  st. peter claver family, these scripture verses give insight into the future work of the church, but they also provide insight into our lives.

when the apostles work solely on their abilities, they fail. they grow tired and weary. when they listen and follow christ, the fruits are abundant. when the church follows christ obediently, she grows and prospers.

as catholics, when we open ourselves to jesus and follow his will, more often than not, we see blessings and grace.

  st. peter claver family - in light of st. josephine bakhita's memorial, the church encourages us to pray and bring awareness to the evil act of human trafficking.

an absolute sin against the dignity of the human person, human trafficking is a "business" that harms millions of people.

  on october 1, 2000, pope st. john paul ii declared st. josephine bakhita a canonized saint of the church.

kidnapped as a child and sold into slavery many times, she endured years of suffering from her masters. eventually, she was freed, remaining with the canossian sisters in italy. in 1890, she was baptized and took the name josephine margaret and fortunata.

she received all three sacraments of initiation on the same day. on february 8, 1947, her last words before dying were, "our lady, our lady!" she is the patron saint of sudan.

  st. peter claver, although the walk to calvary would not begin for jesus and our lady until the miracle at the wedding feast at cana, we see a small glimpse of calvary and the cross in these words spoken by simeon.

through god’s grace, he knows that many will reject jesus, and, in turn, our lady will feel that same pain in her heart. part of her vocation is that she will be the suffering mother. here, the church sees the beginning of our lady’s sorrowful heart.

join us for daily mass, monday-saturday at 7:30am.

  are catholic schools in the united states focused on academic excellence? personal integrity? citizenship? yes to all of these things - but at the core, being a part of a catholic school is about holiness.

that's what makes a catholic education so incredible. on this catholic schools week, let's offer up our prayers here at st. peter claver for the continued growth of our catholic schools.

  perhaps it's unsurprising that one of the most beautiful cities in the world is also home to one of the most beautiful churches.

once the chapel and reliquary of the french monarchs, visitors are transported into another world when they enter sainte-chapelle, which has walls that are almost entirely stained glass. but the chapel's beauty isn't just for show; the stained glass windows depict the entire story of salvation, from genesis to christ's resurrection.

like many other churches built in the 13th century, sainte-chapelle is truly sacred scripture in the form of architecture.

  the whole world is longing for salvation - for freedom that is total, for joy that lasts, for life that fulfills. but like so many of jesus' contemporaries, it's easy for us to overlook this salvation when it's offered to us. when it shows up in our midst. in many ways, we'd rather go on in our self-sufficient imperfection than embrace true freedom if it means giving up comfort or total control. but christ is always reaching out to us with this offer anew.

st. peter claver family, let's recommit to embracing it.

  perhaps no painter's handiwork is as recognizable as caravaggio's. the italian renaissance artist's hyper-realistic oil paintings and bold colors have a way of capturing the eye. but caravaggio is also a master of using his artistic techniques to shed some theological light on his subjects.

in this painting depicting the focus of today's feast day, st. paul's conversion, the italian painter uses a style called "tenebrism" to create the dramatic effect of a light shining amidst the enveloping darkness. the light is meant to symbolize the presence of god, who overwhelms saul, knocking him onto his back and opening him to conversion.

let's pray that all of us at st. peter claver might respond to god's grace similarly.

  st. marianne cope is only the 11th catholic saint to have lived in what is now the united states and is one of the most recently canonized, having only been declared a saint in 2012. her life took her from germany to new york and, finally, to hawaii. she spent her last decades on the island of molokai, educating and caring for members of the leper colony.

to spread joy, she was known for bringing brightly colored scarves to women on the island. st. marianne cope, patroness of outcasts, help all of us at st. peter claver love the misfortunate as fervently as you did.

  when jesus began his ministry, he didn't abolish john's baptism with water. instead, he supernaturalized it, making it a channel of his grace through the power of the holy spirit.

this is actually a beautiful metaphor for the way god's grace works in general. grace doesn't destroy natural things but lifts them up and makes them more than they could be on their own. god wants to do this with everything in our lives: our relationships, our work, and even our free time.

the key is to let him by always being open to his grace. come receive an outpouring of it at lord's day mass, this weekend.

  st. john of the cross, today's saint, was a 16th-century spanish mystic. one of his most well-known themes is "the dark night of the soul"--a time of detachment that prepares us to receive god more fully.

in a way, the "mini-lent" of advent is a "dark night," preparing us to receive jesus christ on christmas day with wide open hearts.

let's ask st. john of the cross to accompany all of us at st. peter claver during this advent season!

  on december 2, 2017, 33 people from our parish consecrated themselves to jesus through the immaculate heart of mary under the priestly direction of fr. adrian. the divine mercy ministry was formed from this first group as well as a ministry committed to eucharistic adoration.  last weekend, a group of parishioners, led  by fr. riz renewed their consecration. 

let us be truly grateful to our mother mary, and her son, jesus, for the graces showered upon our parish. may they and our special saints, saint faustina, saint maximilian kolbe, and saint peter claver, continue to help us live up to our consecration promises.

  emmanuel means "god with us." god was with us in the flesh when jesus christ was born in a manger in bethlehem and lived among his people. but jesus also left us his presence in a permanent way: the eucharist.

in the blessed sacrament, god is really with us. the eucharist is truly an emmanuel moment.

  john the baptist lived a pretty radical life. why'd he do it?

today's gospel gives us a hint: the word of god came to him.

the word of god, of course, is jesus. and every part of john's mission only makes sense through his encounters with jesus, beginning with their first encounter while they were both still in the womb. john has encountered the word of god, and is in turn motivated to tell others about him--even if it means living in the wilderness and eating locusts!

are we similarly motivated to share jesus with others? if not, it might require first renewing our encounter with the word of god. here at st. peter claver, let's pray for this gift.

  st. ambrose of milan accomplished a lot in his life. after all, he's a doctor of the church! but perhaps his greatest achievement was helping st. augustine become catholic.

  we are called to love our spouses as jesus loves us. one of the many ways jesus shows love is by serving. he washed his apostles' feet at the last supper to show us what loving service looks like. think of one out-of-the-ordinary act of service you can provide for your spouse this weekend out of love for them.

  the catechism tells us that our co-responsibility for the common good makes it “morally obligatory to pay taxes, to exercise the right to vote, and to defend one’s country.” (ccc #2240) through prayer and a well-formed conscience, bring christ into your choices today!

  hey, if you show up to mass an hour early, that's okay. spend some time praying for your st. peter claver community!  or, visit our first class relics of st. faustina kowalska, st. maximilian kolbe, and st. peter claver in the children's liturgy room. 

otherwise, enjoy the extra hour of sleep!

  offer today’s sufferings for your deceased loved ones. choose to fast from something or take up a small mortification. set your alarm to go off every hour and pause to say, “lord, i offer this up for the sake of n's soul.” it is the best gift you can give!
