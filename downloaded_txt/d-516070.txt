thanks for such a fantastic weekend. it was inspirational. i learnt so much in such a short time. it really did exceed my expectations. to have such fantastic mentors sharing their knowledge, experience and insights was just wonderful, and i would definitely like to come to further training weekends or weeks!





the strength of the conservation message was incredibly refreshing and welcome, and a real spur to try and help to get things going in this field, whether novice or professional. the manner in which you made us all feel truly comfortable with the subject matter, regardless of experience, is something i personally very much appreciated. i am still amazed we managed to cover so much in such a short space of time.





many thanks for taking the time and putting so much effort into producing a course that is both encouraging and inspirational to new wildlife film makers. you have offered an opportunity with this insight and have provided a great basis to move forward from. i have certainly come away eager and enthused to continue this work.
