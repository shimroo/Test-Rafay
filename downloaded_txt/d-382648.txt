investing in community-led solutions



we are proud to announce the recipients of our 2025 participatory grants to support community-led solutions dedicated to “narrow the front door” to the child welfare system by awarding $1.4m over two years to 14 grassroots organizations working to strengthen new york city’s families. in line with our approach to shift power and resources into the hands of impacted communities, yff made these grants through a participatory process to resource community members to support the change that they seek. all grant-making processes and decisions were led by a committee of community leaders who have been personally impacted by the child welfare system. selected grantees focus on movement-building, policy, and advocacy; direct and concrete support; prenatal, maternal health, and early childhood services; and culturally relevant mental health resources for community healing. the yff’s 2024 participatory grantmaking committee outreached to over 75 grassroots organizations, reviewed 46 inquiries from community based organizations with budgets under $1m, and selected 14 grassroots organizations for awards.

through a robust public-private partnership, the youth & families forward fund supported the research, model development, launch, advocacy and scaling of fair futures. this first-in-the-nation program for young people in foster care from 6th grade through age 26 provides 1:1 coaching, tutoring, and academic, career, housing, and independent living supports so young people can reach their potential and transition successfully to adulthood.  in 2022, a youth-led advocacy movement and coalition of over 100 organizations in nyc was successful in securing and baselining $30.7 million in public funding for the fair futures model and its expansion to serve young people in the juvenile justice system. the youth & families forward fund helped to establish the center for fair futures and continues to support the center’s core infrastructure, operations and youth-led advocacy.
