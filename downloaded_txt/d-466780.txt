recently released



minnesota pollution control agency’s oversight of smith
              foundry (february 13)



            while mpca initially disputed findings from the u.s. environmental
            protection agency’s (epa’s) may 2023 inspection of smith foundry, it
            later collected the data necessary to reproduce epa’s findings. mpca
            deferred to epa’s enforcement of emissions and pollution control
            equipment violations at the foundry, but it reports that it has
            taken steps to strengthen its air quality monitoring.
