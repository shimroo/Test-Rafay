improved management and integrations with azure services via azure arc's support for hybrid cloud environments.
new storage features, which include storage migration service enhancements, support for larger clusters, and improvements to storage spaces direct.
enhancements to kubernetes, container performance, and windows containers in azure kubernetes service to improve support for containerized applications.
support for more powerful hardware configurations, including more memory and cpu capacity, with enhanced performance for virtualized workloads.
file size reductions during transfers to increase efficiency and speed through the use of server message block (smb) compression.
an integration with azure automanage for easier deployment, management, and monitoring of servers in hybrid and on-premises environments.
improved networking features, such as enhanced network security and performance as well as support for dns over https.
enhanced vpn and hybrid connectivity options, such as an smb over quic capability that permits safe, low-latency file sharing over the internet.
improvements to windows subsystem for linux and tighter integration for cross-platform management, which provides better support for executing linux workloads.

vmware esxi – tpm – vtpm and windows 11
trusted platform module version 2.0 (tpm 2.0) is required to run microsoft’s windows 11. this restricts the operating system’s installation on newer pcs, it also means users with older hardware are likely to be forced to upgrade. while the virtualization world is often more forgiving when it comes to hardware requirements, trying to install windows 11 on vmware’s esxi platform usually present the error: “this pc can’t run windows 11”: 
windows 11 installation error in vmware esxi
running windows 11 as a virtual machine on vmware esxi requires a virtual trusted platform module (vtpm) present. for more details on microsoft windows 11 requirements see, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/windows-11-requirements.
while vmware supports vtpm and doesn’t require a physical tpm 2.0 chip, to use it, you need to configure a number of different services, depending on your vmware platform version, including vcenter, vsphere native key provider and more, making it a complicated task – especially for those running home labs. for more details see, https://core.vmware.com/resource/windows-11-support-vsphere#section2.
the next steps will take you through downloading the tpm iso image used to bypass the windows tpm check.
