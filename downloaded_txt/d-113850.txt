we are the service employees international union (seiu), a union of about 2 million diverse members in healthcare, the public sector and property services who believe in and fight for our vision for a just society: where all workers are valued and all people respected—no matter where we come from or what color we are; where all families and communities can thrive; and where we leave a better and more equitable world for generations to come.





                         join the fight!
