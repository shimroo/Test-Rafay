undergraduate research is a useful way to develop the skills you will need in your career field, even if you are not planning to be a researcher. not surprisingly, those who participate in research mature their skills at a faster rate than those who do not participate. this provides you with a distinct advantage for entering the workforce or acceptance for additional schooling. learn more about research opportunities.

after graduation, chemistry majors either gain employment in a (bio)chemically related field, go on to graduate programs in chemistry, biochemistry, neuroscience, or engineering, or enter a health professions program. learn more about career opportunities here.
