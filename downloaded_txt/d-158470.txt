“doctor naj and his care team are truly phenomenal. i have been through egg retrieval and now ivf twice with him and have been consistently impressed by the level of care i receive in office but also in email/ phone when i have queries along the way. i cannot recommend his practice enough.”
- lia m.






“amazing clinic with awesome staff! never have to wait for the appointments. they almost always get you in immediately, which is very efficient & hardly happens in other medical practices. dr. naj is funny, knowledgeable and reassuring. which are all very valuable qualities that are very hard to come by.”
- keri l.






“i can’t say enough wonderful things about dr. najmabadi and the whole team. not once did they ever make you feel like just a patient; i was always greeted by name every single time i walked into the office. i always felt like i was receiving undivided attention. one of the things i respect most is dr. naj has been nothing but honest with us from the beginning. he explained all of our options and the chances of getting pregnant with each procedure, was patient when he went over all costs and tests, and we never felt pressured to do anything without taking time to think everything through.”
- marrianne r.






"dr. naj and his staff have been incredible during the ivf process. my partner and i are currently banking embryos and we wouldn't wanna do it anywhere else. we interviewed a few other places, and the center for reproductive health was by far the best. a few reasons: their offices are clean and inviting, the staff is incredible--yadira, diana, selene, donice, yolanda, jennifer, and spencer always greet us with a warm hello, and are always available to answer questions in person or on the phone. dr. najmabadi himself is warm, assured, and professional. we know we're in good hands."
- i q.






“the ladies in the office are all fantastic!! you can tell they love doing what they do, and offer their support to the patients, which helps a lot. diane is such an amazing & experienced ma; gina, yadira, cindy and everyone in the office are all very compassionate and supportive. this clinic is a rare find, and i would highly recommend this clinic if you are seeking the services they are providing.”
- keri l.






"we were lucky to found dr. najmabadi! after almost one year of treatment in another center which it is supposed to be one of the best in la, i felt very disappointed...they treated me like a number so it was a relief when i found the center for reproductive health & gynecology. dr. najmabadi is extremely professional and kind, he made us feel really comfortable. the whole team is fantastic. thank you so much again!"
- carole s.






"i can happily report that i am pregnant, thanks to dr. najmabadi and his excellent staff! this is after 4 failed attempts with other doctors and a loss of hope. dr. n is kind and patient, and will explain all of your options and answer your questions. his staff is skilled, kind, and always greets me by name. i wish i could go to them for all of my medical needs! thank you to dr. najmabadi and your amazing team."
- dee k.
