2100 w. girard updates 
members of our board have been able to tour the facility to understand intake and living situation which was discussed at our june meeting. we have developed an active relationship with the managers of the facility. we will have a full board meeting with the managers at the end of this month with the goal of developing faq’s about the facility as a resource for the neighborhood and be able to facilitate 2-way communication between the facility and the neighborhood.
we have set up a google group. you can email (2100-girard@fairmountcivicassociation.org) any tips photos or other issues you have related to the facility. you can email president@fairmountcivicassociation.org to join the group where you can see information we have gathered and collaborate with neighbors on issues.
if you witness a crime or there is a medical emergency please call 911 and describe what you are witnessing. it is important to describe the behavior that you witness and not whether the person is homeless or not. if you encounter trash or drug paraphernalia use 311 to report.

27th and pennsylvania intersection improvements
on 9/16 our board member dustin dove coordinated a meeting with richard montenez from the streets department and jawad pullin from councilman young’s office along with 30 or so residents related to improvements at the intersection at 27th and pennsylvania. many improvements were discussed but an immediate remedy suggested was a pilot program to make 27th street one way all the way from pa ave, so that you would not be able to turn left from aspen st.  there would be no impact on bus routes. we are looking for feedback from immediate neighbors before sending a letter of support.
it would look like this approximately.
