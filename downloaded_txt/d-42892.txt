step sequencer tech demo

15 years ago, i released this video of me playing with a new iphone app.

that app no longer exists, but i wanted something similar – but i’m getting sick of the app store scene. lucky for us, technology has advanced in the last 15 years!
can this be done in a web page now? indeed it can! want the app directly on your phone? it’ll do that too! 
there are a couple of changes i made to this implementation. because you can specify exact frequencies in the web audio api, i decided to go with a different tuning system, “just intonation”. the tuning system we are all used to, “equal temperament”, is great for playing in multiple keys – but everything is always a little bit out of tune. just intonation only really works in a single key, making it an excellent choice for really beautiful chords and melodies.
it also has a button to save a snapshot of your creation to a midi file! :-)
try it out! (no ads, no cookies, just a thing that makes fun sounds.)

i’ve done a guest character over at bfdia for a few episodes. you can check it out here:

why am i a panflute? long story… but if you need an in-tune panflute, you can print your own from jane kass music, one of my crazier side projects which makes professional-level instruments for your 3-d printer.







ambiances in ultrawide!

come hang out at a tavern in port merrick! enjoy this very wide ambiance from sea of thieves! you can almost hear the tales being told…
so there we were! just me, old peg-nose pete, and a crate of planks, stranded on a sandbar with the tide rising fast. as the water crept up and the sharks started circling, pete gets this mad glint in his eye. says he’s got a plan, but all he needs is for me to distract the sharks.
“distract the sharks‽”, says i!
“are ye mad‽”, says i!…


cloudpunk featuring “ætherwave”
for the more active among you, take a trip to a beautiful future in cloudpunk! this video features a set of original music from “ætherwave”, a british/estonian ai that is running a pirate radio station in the city. her only goal is to get humans to chill out. “let’s do more to care less.” 32:9 aspect ratio.








wizard circus

one moment, i’m summoning a thundercloud to dazzle the crowd; the next, i’m filling out forms for performing dragons, because apparently, fire-breathing counts as “pyrotechnics”, and that requires a separate permit. the clowns unionized last week; the phoenix keeps setting the cotton candy on fire… running a circus sounded like a great idea initially. now i think i’m going to go back to assembling an army of undead abominations. just… way fewer headaches.

my music cometh to roblox!

i’ve known about roblox for a long time. my music has always been available for anyone to use, but roblox has always stopped people from using it. i’ve been trying for years to find someone who could allow my music to be available on that platform. and it is finally happening!
i’ve submitted my entire catalog, and it is starting to be included! not every piece is available as of today, but hundreds of pieces are now available! 
if you’re a roblox developer, you already know where to look. if you have questions; i have no answers. i’m just happy that it is finally possible to use my music in roblox!
i’m very excited! like, “too-many-exclamation-points” excited!!! go roblox!







virtual horizons: ultra-wide ambiance for ultra-wide displays

if you’re into immersive visuals, check out virtual horizons yt, a channel dedicated to creating stunning, ultra-wide ambiance videos for those of us with large, 32:9 monitors or anyone looking for high-resolution serenity.

the videos are up to 8k at 60 frames per second. these are not really gameplay videos. they are more “digital landscapes” designed for relaxation, sleep, or just filling your space with something visually cool.
there are no huds, or story interruptions, the emphasis is on exploration and scenery within some of the most beautiful games out there, including red dead redemption 2, hogwarts legacy, the witcher, eastshade, sea of thieves, and cyberpunk 2077.

if you want a calm and immersive environment or need something to help drift off to sleep, give it a try. very long playlists are available for both ultra-wide, and normal-wide (16:9) screens. happy (chill) exploring!

man, these are pretty.
