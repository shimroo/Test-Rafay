abundance flows from the god in you



























“god is like an infinite ocean. the ocean doesn’t care if you approach it with a teaspoon, a glass, or a tub to collect water, so you might as well tap in and let it flow! enjoy the infinite good that god is.”



before the “secret,” there was rev. ike's “principles of abundance,” based on the divinity within.



— reverend ike







































rev. ike near his home in the carmel highlands, monterey county, ca, circa 1975. he loved the outdoors. at one point in his life, he walked or ran in nature every day. it was one of his ways of clearing his mind, invigorating his body, and communing with spirit.



abundant life through higher consciousnessrev. ike is a man who transformed his life from poverty to wealth in all areas, as he defined it in the mantra he consistently shared: “health, happiness, love, success, prosperity, and money.” he taught thousands of people how to transform their lives by renewing their minds and self-conceptions. he left volumes of teachings to continue to help people achieve similar fulfillment in their lives. this can include you.many people, including the media, got hung up on the bling and wealthy lifestyle, but he did not. to rev. ike, objects of material wealth were conveniences and playthings he enjoyed. his priority was always on the spiritual. his thinking was, to paraphrase scripture, “seek first balanced, right living through higher consciousness, and all things shall be added unto you.” balance and right living are not moral judgments but gauges of a soul-based harmony that emerges in one’s life when one focuses on what matters. doing the right thing easily flows from this. having all one needs easily flows from this state of mind and being. this is what rev. ike taught and still does, as he said he would, “from the great beyond.”
