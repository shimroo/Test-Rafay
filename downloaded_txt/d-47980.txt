welcome to fcn
the furry critter network currently features breed descriptions/photo galleries for cats, dogs, cavies, horses, and birds. while it is not our goal to sell animals over the internet, it is our goal to give you information to aid in making a choice.
35 years of breeding/rescuing horses and dogs on our family farm.

mission
the furry critter network currently features breed descriptions/photo galleries for cats, dogs, cavies, horses, and birds. while it is not our goal to sell animals over the internet, it is our goal to give you information to aid in making a choice.

                  the transport of animals is an owner decision. most reputable breeders will not have their animals shipped without first screening the prospective owner to determine if their animal is going to a loving home. at the furry critter network we encourage and support this behavior. rescue facilities operate in very much the same manner.

                  taking on a new pet is adding a new member to your family. please weigh the decision heavily before embarking on an endeavor for which you may not be ready. each animal represents a life deserving of love and respect. always keep in mind, "it may only be part of your life, but for the animals you adopt, it's their whole life." i hope you have found this site of use and we endeavor to provide the most accurate and timely information available!

                  rescuing horses and dogs has been a passion of mine for many years, which was the genesis of this site back in 2001. unlike most who rescue, i don't have issue with purebred breeders who are in the game for the love of the breed. those that are in it soley for the money, are the people that i have issues with. over the years i have witnessed levels of cruelty that haunt me to this day. i can't solve the problem, but i can endeavor to do my best to educate and encourage positive behavior towards our furry friends.

aspca
the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animalsâ® (aspcaâ®) was the first humane society to be established in north america and is, today, one of the largest in the world.

                    our organization was founded on the belief that animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands of humans and must be protected under the law. headquartered in new york city, the aspca maintains a strong local presence, and with programs that extend our anti-cruelty mission across the country, we are recognized as a national animal welfare organization. we are a privately funded 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and are proud to boast more than 2 million supporters across the country.

                    the aspcaâs mission, as stated by founder henry bergh in 1866, is âto provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the united states.â




 
petfinder
if you canât find the pet youâre looking for on petfinder, donât give up. some shelters maintain waiting lists for specific breeds, so donât be afraid to ask! there are also breed-specific rescues for just about every breed, and most of them post their pets on petfinder. (petfinder can even e-mail you when a pet that fits your criteria is posted â just click âsave this searchâ at the top of your search results page.)




 
rescue me
jeff gold, founder, rescue me! animal rescue network

                    jeff gold lives in watkinsville, georgia on the same property as rescue me's animal rehabilitation center, with 18 rescue animals. shown with him in the photo to the left are maggie, izzie and cortez. in 2003, after learning there was nobody doing boxer rescue work in georgia, gold founded boxertown, an organization which helped find homes for over 500 boxers during its first two years. based upon this success, gold came up with the vision for rescue me! â a network which helps all breeds of dogs, cats and other animals find good homes, anywhere in the world. rescueshelter.com is also a free service of rescue me! and provides the world's largest and most up-to-date directory of animal rescue organizations for all breeds of dogs, cats and other animals, including a comprehensive directory of wildlife rehabilitators in over 150 countries.
