welcome to the most comprehensive database 
        of its kind in the world. it contains 109735 locations 
        with over 45.115 name changes once, and 5,500 twice and more. all locations are 
        east of the oder and neisse rivers and are based on the borders of
        the eastern provinces in spring 1918. included in this database are the 
        following provinces: eastprussia, including memel, westprussia, brandenburg, 
        posen, pomerania, and silesia. it currently list most towns or points, 
        points being: mills, some bridges, battlefields, named trees, cenotaphs 
        etc. as more information becomes available, (books, maps, your input
        etc) this database will be updated. i would also ask to advise me of 
        any mistakes you may find at:
ukrickha@memlane.com  
        
you have several ways or criteria to search.
        1. german name
        2. older german name
        3. kreis/county
        4. by the next larger town, (this is a proximity search.)
        5. today's polish, russian or lithuanian name.
        6. by family name

for my polish visitors: no consideration 
        is given to any accents of the polish language.
any language evolves over time. below is 
        a list of letters and words which may have been changed and you may consider 
        in entering these changes into your search.
 c with g or k, ck with k, cz with sch, dt with t,
        f with w, ff with w, ie or i with ü,.
ph with f, t with d, th with t, tsch with sch, x with chs, y
        with i.
thal with tal, torf with dorf, guth with gut, louise with luise, hoff 
        with hof
the word torf may not be confused with today's word torf which
        is peatmoss.
also consider the possible misreading of the old german writing of c 
        which looks like a l . m which looks like a w or vice versa and b which 
        looks like an l as well. please refer to the alphabet in the map section.
how to use database:
        in order for you to find the name of the 
        town that you are looking for, we have allowed the use of wild cards. 
        either * or ? can be used instead of a letter.the following examples will 
        demonstrate how to use the wildcards.
ex. if you know that the german town you 
        are looking for starts with an a, but you do not know any other details 
        you do the following:

place an a followed by nothing.

ex. if you know that the german town you 
        are looking for ends with the letter ten, but you are not sure of what 
        the city name begins with you could do the search as follows: *ten, but 
        enter the province as well, since you are going to have too many returns.
if it contains the syllable: ten, place 
        *ten* in the search field (this would return entries like altensiedel, 
        entenfang, etc.) which contain both the syllables - ten - within.
the ? wildcard is a pattern matching card 
        and is best used when you know more about the town that you are looking 
        for.
ex. as in the first example you are looking 
        for a german city that starts with an a, but this time you also know that 
        there are 4 letters in the name and it ends with an n. so you would place 
        the following in the german name text box:

a??n. ( this would return entries like 
          arun,aton etc) each question mark will return a town with one more letter. 
a???n five letter town like: abken, alben. 
a????n six letter town beginning with 
          a and ending with n like: ammern,adrian,alexen. 
a?? will return all three letter towns 
          beginning with a: like abo, alk. 
a??? will return all four letter towns 
          beginning with a: like abow, auer. 
note more information will not increase 
          your chance finding your ancestral home, but enter your province if 
          possible it will reduce the amounts of returns. keep it brief. bitte 
          eingabe kurz halten, dann haben sie eine größere chance den 
          ort zu finden.

good luck in your research. viel glück
