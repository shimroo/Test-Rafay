dedicated to serving the biomed/htm professionals of this region since 1978
the north carolina biomedical association originated in the late 1970s when a group of bmets were invited to meet at the area health education center in the wake county medical center in raleigh, north carolina. this original group of individuals established the foundations and guiding principles, which have made the north carolina biomedical association the superlative organization that it is today. the by-laws formulated by this group established the principal objective of advancing the development of personnel involved in the selection, operation, repair and support of biomedical instrumentation of health care institutions.
