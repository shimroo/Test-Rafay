the halkirk highland games, a traditional and spectacular scottish sporting event is held in caithness in the far north of scotland, near to thurso, the north coast 500 travel route and the famous end of the road landmark of john o‚Äôgroats. it is always held on the last saturday in july and attracts a crowd of around 3,000.
the 2025 games will be held on saturday 26th july 2025.
the games is the premiere sporting event in the north of scotland. the prize money of ¬£21,000 is one the best in scotland and attracts the country‚Äôs best amateur and professional competitors. there is additional money of ¬£21,000 on offer for breaking ground and national records, e.g. ¬£1,000 on offer for breaking a world record in the heavy events and ¬£300 for a new ground record in the track and field events.
there are over 100 events packed into an afternoon and it is the scottish version of a mini olympic games. there are normally dozens of competitors from all over the country and often from abroad. the ‚Äúheavies‚Äù are the kilted strongmen who toss massive wooden cabers, throw scots hammers and weights and putt the shot. a sight not to be missed. there are pipers, highland dancers, track and field athletes, cyclists, clay pigeon shooters and children, all competing for top prizes. spectators are kept informed of all the action by both our roving commentator and announcer. surrounding the arena are entertaining side-stalls, charity stalls, a thrilling fun fair, plus food and drink stalls/marquees.
