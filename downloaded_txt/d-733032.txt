 isaiah: 
									"yahweh blessed the sabbath day, and set it 
									apart as holy"

									 




									the hebrew three-letter homograph shin 
									bet/vet tav, when pronounced shabbat
									(sabbath), means rest at conclusion of 
									labor; when pronounced shevet, it 
									means dwelling; with an added silent letter 
									as shin bet/vet ayin tav and 
									pronounced shivat, it is the number 
									seven. sabbath is a time to conclude our 
									labor in order to dwell with god, a time 
									related to the seventh day of the week and 
									ultimately to the seventh millennium.
 


							sabbath is neither only for jews nor only for some 
							previous era. it was created for adam  man, and for 
							eternity! it was created as the seventh day of the 
							week (sunset to sunset), never to change. it is to 
							be kept holy  meaning dedicated to our savior, in 
							contrast to our other days of labor. it is the time 
							created for god to dwell with man  in the original 
							eden (when god was finished with his work of 
							creation), in our weekly day to meet with him 
							(setting aside our weekly work), and in the future 
							when messiah will dwell in eden/paradise with the 
							meek who inherit the earth (when our redemption is 
							completed). sabbath is a glorious crown of gods 
							creation, when everything says holy!


							 


							by working six days looking toward observing the 
							holy sabbath day, we show our faith in our creator 
							by memorializing creation week, and we display our 
							hope in an eternal dwelling with our savior. we live 
							in dedication to god  holiness!

yahweh: "they 
									shall teach my people to distinguish between 
									the holy and the common"

righteousness 
									relates to acts of god or man. yahweh is 
									righteous. the righteous acts of yahweh 
									are spoken of in 1 samuel 12:7, daniel 9:16, 
									micah 6:5, and revelation 15:4. his 
									judgments are righteous. he is not subject 
									to our judgments  he holds all rights. the 
									righteous acts of the saints are mentioned 
									in revelation 19:8. the righteousness of a 
									man relates to tzedaqah - deeds of 
									obedience to gods instructions. 
									righteousness does not apply to animals or 
									inanimate objects. 

holiness is 
									distinct from righteousness. holiness 
									relates to men or objects that are 
									dedicated/consecrated to gods service. god 
									may dedicate things to himself, such as 
									people, places, times, or objects. 

when god 
									sanctifies something, we must remember to 
									keep it holy." 

man may 
									dedicate things to god, such as buildings, 
									animals or money. these things then become 
									holy/sacred/sanctified. using them for a 
									common purpose would be profaning the holy.

now it will come 
											about that in the last days the 
											mountain of the house of yahweh will 
											be established as the chief of the 
											mountains, and will be raised above 
											the hills; and all the nations will 
											stream to it.  and many peoples will 
											come and say, "come, let us go up to 
											the mountain of yahweh, to the house 
											of the god of jacob; that he may 
											teach us concerning his ways and 
											that we may walk in his paths." for 
											the torah will go forth from zion 
											and the word of yahweh from 
											jerusalem. 
											isaiah 2:2-3
