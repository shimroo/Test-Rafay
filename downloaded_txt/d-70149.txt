the fort mchenry guard is a historical organization sponsored by the national park service and the patriots of fort mchenry. it is composed of specially recruited "volunteers in parks" who provide visitors with a touchstone to the past.
the guard is trained and equipped by the national park service to represent the u. s. corps of artillery, the baltimore fencible artillery, and the u.s. sea fencibles during the battle of baltimore in the summer of 1814. the guard provides early 19th century military demonstrations, historical interpretation, and official ceremonies on weekends during the summer months. volunteers also portray citizens and their everyday activities in early 19th century society in baltimore and at fort mchenry.
