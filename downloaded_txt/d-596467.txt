if you truly want to play golf at a higher level then read this web site carefully and try to absorb the information because i can assure you that the effort will be in your best interests.
you will only reach your full potential by adopting the perfect impact position as seen in these still photograph of top professional golfers.
it is important to understand that the golf swing can only be performed correctly by pivoting the hips, for example, during the back swing movement the hips pivot so that the right hip is gradually raised to its highest position whilst the left hip is gradually lowered to it lowest point.

                from the moment you begin the down swing movement the pivotal action of the hips is reversed, so that the left hip gradually begins to rise to its highest point whilst the right hip drops to its lowest point.
as long as the whole body is held in the fully twisted condition it achieved at the end of the back swing movement, the pivotal action of the hips during the down swing movement will automatically forces the upper body to rotate around its axis and follow the movement of the hips.
very important.
basically the down swing is all about activating the pivotal and the turning action of the hips for a mill-second before the  whole twisted body to allowed to rotate around the axis of the spine whilst held as a one piece unit -- and carried out as a single movement.
it is important that the hip movement must always lead and control the rotational movement of the whole twisted upper body unit throughout the down swing and the follow through movement.
 
                  but importantly, the down swing is performed at a ridiculously slow pace whilst the club head is whipped into the contact area. ( just watch the professionals on the tv - matthew jordan is a classic example.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
most handicapped golfers believe that simply swinging the arms  to hit the ball is the correct way to play golf, and that is why they remain high handicapped golfers, yes the arms are used to hit the ball, but only whilst the arms interact.
======================================================================================================================================================================
very low handicapped golfers perform the down swing movement  with the magic move .
as you perform the  magic move, the right elbow is drawn into the waist line and simultaneously the hips begin to pivot and turn to face the target area .
this pivoting action is vital so that the left hip reaches  it maximum height a fraction of a second before the club head strikes the ball and at that point the hips are forced to turn towards the target area at the same speed the club head is moving towards the target area.
**important **
                  at the precise momenjt the club head strikes the ball, the hips must also be forced to turn to fully face the target area at the same speed the club head is moving towards the target area.
during the down swing movement the hip pivot action is the controlling factor, and the more separation you can achieve between the rotational movement of the hips before the whole twisted body unit   follows, the better, and after the club head has struck the ball and the interaction of the arms is completed, the arms must follow the flight of the ball for as long as possible. 
 
this  action enables professional golfers to hit the ball exactly as they wish, a draw, a fade or a straight shot depending on the set up at the address position, the thrust of the right shoulder delivers the club head into the back of the ball with the all important power.

 

the golf swing that i teach in this web site is based on my experience of learning to play golf  from being a hacker to a reasonable golfer and during this period i have  learnt how to play much better golf  and     i  pass this information to you.
the basic golf swing is a very simple process which becomes progressively more difficult as you try to hit the ball further but  i only wish that i had learnt the correct way to play golf 40 years ago -- but this is your chance to jump that time gap.
 
*** you may wish to look at an excellent series of videos produced by chris ryan who is a pga professional coach who can expand on my basic principles of the golf swing ***
 


unfortunately most golfers who read this web site will dismiss my analysis of the golf swing without a second thought because i am not a "celebrity golf coach" -- therefore it is only the golfer who is prepared to have an open mind about my teachings and go to the golf range to practice  my instructions -- these are the golfers that will prosper.
 
so   if you really  want to play much better golf and you are prepared to absorb this information, this web site will teach you how to play a very consistent and accurate game of golf.
just remember, the golf swing that i as described 
                    in this web site has exactly the same principle movements that 
                    allow the majority of the professional golfers to play the game 
                    at the top of their profession.
 
so if you have an open mind on how the golf 
                    swing is performed and you are prepared to accept that the golf 
                    swing i teach is an accurate reflection on the way the professionals 
                    golfer play the game, but describing the important factors that 
                    will enable you to hit the ball long and straight, then you 
                    will already be on the road to achieving a very good golf swing.
 
as a point of interest you often hear top golf instructors say that that a golfer should only have one or two swing thoughts 
                    as they prepare to make a golf swing -- in reality this 
                    only applies to a golfer who has already developed a well structured 
                    golf swing.
therefore if you want to reach the stage of having a well 
                    structured golf swing it is vital that you learn the basic principles 
                    and the basic movements of the golf swing and practice these 
                    movements until they become second nature to perform.
