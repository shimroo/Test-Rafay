winning patent monetization strategies 



 



the patent business is a game of strategy. many will play. few will win.  to win, you need quality patents and you need to make the right moves at the right time. you can’t do it alone. you need a team of experienced professionals around you.welcome to tynax. if you have quality patents and you’re looking to generate profitable revenues from your intellectual property investments, you’re in the right place. we’ve been monetizing patents since 2003. today we focus on sourcing patents and cases for some of the world’s leading patent monetization firms. where patent brokers generally represent sellers in simple patent sale transactions, we specialize in representing buyers—brokering sophisticated arrangements, often involving multiple parties, designed to maximize the value of a portfolio of patents over several years. we’ve built relationships with buyers, sellers, brokers, investors, litigators and we’ve successfully helped many of our clients generate a profitable return on their patent investments. to help inventors and entrepreneurs, we’ve published a range of books, papers and podcasts explaining how the patent industry really works and giving you the market intelligence you need to succeed in the current intellectual property environment.

confidentiality 



we understand the sensitive nature of patents and the information you submit to tynax will be protected and will only be shared with a small number of tynax clients, each working under a confidentiality agreement.  when submitting claims charts and evidence of use, it’s important to recognize that tynax clients are not operating companies but patent monetization firms. to enter a binding non-disclosure agreement with tynax, please complete this signed nda document: tynax mutual nda pdf and submit it as an attachment together with your submission. 



how to maximize the revenue from a patent 



if you want to maximize the revenue potential from a family of patents, simply selling the patent isn’t usually the best route. you need to find the right players and make the right moves. all patents are different and what works best for one might not work for another. each opportunity essentially requires a custom business plan. in some cases, the best strategy might be to engage a top tier law firm, raise finance and run a long-term licensing campaign. in other cases, extensive prosecution may be necessary before the patents are ready for licensing.  



our clients—the patent monetization firms represented by tynax  



the patent monetization firms we represent operate a variety of business models. some are looking for mature patent portfolios. others are looking for applications with early priority dates. each of our clients has its own strengths.  where one may be particularly strong in patent prosecution, the strengths of another may be in litigation and another may be particularly strong in the area of financing. the one thing in common with the tynax patent monetization firm clients is that they’re the best of breed, and each one has generated hundreds of millions, or billions of dollars from patents in recent years.

tynax exchange listings 



after more than 15 years, we’ve retired the patent exchange section of our website. we developed a more effective system for matching patents with prospective buyers. if you previously submitted patents and listed them on the exchange, don’t worry because your patents are still in our database and they’re being matched with our buying clients. when one of our buyers expresses an interest in your patents, we’ll be in touch to follow up with you.  



prospective clients 



we build trusted, long term relationships with a small number of patent monetization firms, each specializing in a particular area of the market. our clients have a proven track record of converting patents into profitable revenues and each one has a different approach and business model.we provide our clients with a unique, secure online console where they can quickly review patent portfolios available on the market. more than 8,000 portfolios have been submitted over the last several years. we’ve rated every one of them and the console provides clients with the ability to quickly make a decision to “pass”, “pursue” or “postpone” with regard to any particular listing. when we receive a “postpone” decision, we wait for infringement to develop in the market. when we receive a “pursue” decision, we go to work brokering a transaction. whether it’s an assignment or some other form of arrangement depends on the patents, the inventors and the business plan. our business model involves long-term revenue- and profit- sharing partnerships with our clients, who are all somewhat different.  we don’t like to waste anyone’s time. reviewing patents is time-consuming and expensive, so we try to avoid situations where our clients are competing with each other. for that reason, we like to work with a diverse set of clients, each looking for different types of opportunities.if you’re in the patent monetization business, you’re looking for quality patents and cases, and you have a particular niche in which you excel, we’d love to hear from you.
