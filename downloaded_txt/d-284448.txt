and why are micro teacup poodle puppies, teacup yorkies and tcup poodles so expensive? usually, the tinier the teacup puppy, the more money that they cost.the reason that breeders charge so much for teacup puppies, is that true teacups are very hard to get! it is rare to even get more than one in a litter, also, most breeders put a lot of tlc in raising these tiny teacup poodle puppies, teacup tiny toy and teacupâ puppies, 24/7. how much is your time worth?? teacup puppies also require extra care, and most can'tgo to a new home until they are at least 12 weeks old. and, in the case of extremely micro teacup poodles, (we have had some the size of hamsters at 8 weeks old), sometimes they are not ready to go until they are 4 months or more. so be very leery of people selling "teacup poodle puppies" teacup yorkieâ  puppies, teacup micro poodles and teacup tiny toy puppies out the door at 6 to 8 weeks old!thanks for your interest in one of my tinyâ  teacup poodleâ  puppies, teacup tiny toy puppies,â  louisiana teacupâ  poodle puppy breeder....tony dougiaâdougie cajun teacup poodles & micro teacup poodles, teacupâ poodle puppies for sale.â teacup yorkiesâ walker, louisianaâsmallestpoodle4u@aol.comor call tony 225-955-2721 for info on ourteacup poodles & teacup yorkies & teacup poodle puppies for sale, teacup yorkiepuppies for salethank you for visitingâ http://www.smallestpoodie4u.comteacup poodles - teacup poodle breeders - teacup poodles for sale -teacup poodles, toy poodles,micro teacup poodles for sale -â tiny toy poodle, louisiana teacup poodle breederteacup poodle puppies - tiny poodle puppies - very tiny teacup poodles- micro teacup poodles-teacup yorkie - teacup yorkshire terrier puppy - yorkshire terrier breeder - yorkies - designerdogsteacupâ pocket poodleâ - teacup maitipoos -teacup yorkie - louisiana teacup breedervelvet touch kennel lines1home1teacup designer puppiesteacup puppies parents1teacup poodle puppiesteacup yorkie puppieslinks to other breeders:www.collettscountrykennel.comwww.fancypoo4u.comclick below to see puppiesâ site updated â  â 09/28/2024www.smallestpoodle4u.comwww.imperialshihtzu.netâ we sell and ship teacup poodle puppies to texas teacup poodles, new york teacup poodles, california teacups, florida teacup puppies, we also ship teacup poodle puppies to boston, massachusetts, new jersey ,los angeles, california teacup puppies. teacup poodles to denver, colorado,â â
