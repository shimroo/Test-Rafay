press archives 

the inside story

leasons learned






about this website: on this website you will find news clippings, documents, photos, maps, and much more on the history and key issues surrounding the proposed and controversial yucca mountain repository project. situated in southern nevada some 90 miles from las vegas, yucca mountain is currently the only site in the united states that was studied in detail for the mined geological disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel and defense high-level waste.  

eureka county's involvement: there are ten (10) designated affected units of local governments (aulg's) in relative proximity to yucca mountain. these aulg's were granted authority to provide information and public involvement opportunities regarding federal decisions about yucca mountain. accordingly, eureka county, nevada [a designated aulg] maintains the yuccamountain.org website.

what exists today at yucca mountain: as of 2022 the only infrastructure that exists at yucca mountain is a single 5-mile exploratory tunnel that was constructed for site characterization activities. there are no waste disposal tunnels and no waste handling facilities at the site.  moreover, certain key legal and regulatory decisions have not been granted for the yucca mountain site including a water permit from the state of nevada, a license for construction authorization from the nuclear regulatory commission, and a federal land withdrawal from the bureau of land management. additionally, there is no railroad access to move waste to the site. for historical info see our inside story webpage and our leasons learned webpage.


readers note: while this website is being maintained and periodically updated, it largely remains in archival status. the website is composed of 6,500 files in 22 subdirectories occupying 2.7 gb.  for more infomation about yucca mountain, see the what's new page.
