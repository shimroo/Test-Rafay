welcome to the website of cathie hoover studios, owned by the self-proclaimed:
"queen of rickrack."
i believe it is my responsibility as a teacher to encourage students to create unique fabric creations, whether the end product is a quilt or garment. i am extremely successful with inspiring and guiding students in the creation of their own designs with their unique color choices.
whatever your skill level, i can help you improve your techniques. please join me at a locale near you or suggest that your guild hire me for a lecture and workshop.  
update 2021: i look forward to teaching again when we can all safely gather.
