murder                     a convicted murderer and rapist was executed by nitrogen gas on thursday â 14 years after he was transferred to alabama while serving a life sentence in michigan for a separate murder.   demetrius frazier became the fourth inmate in the us to be put to death by the method as he served his sentence for the 1991 murder of    pauline brown at the holman correctional facility. frazier, 52, was convicted of capital murder for breaking into    pauline brownâs birmingham apartment and raping her at gunpoint before killing her when he was 19.in his last moments on earth, he attempted to atone for his crime of killing brown.âi want to apologize to the family and friends of pauline brown,â he said. âwhat happened to her should have never happened.âfrazier also appeared to call out michigan gov. gretchen whitmer as he waited to be executed, saying, âif you cannot stand up for the constitution of michigan, how are you going to stand up for the us constitution when you run for president?â according to the montgomery advertiser.his final words were: âdetroit strong. i love everyone on death row. letâs go.âfrazierâs mask was then closed, and the gas began flowing at 6:13 p.m. he had no visible movement by about eight minutes later, and the curtains to the execution chamber closed at 6:29 p.m. he was officially pronounced dead at 6:36 p.m. frazier confessed to murder after he was arrested in his home state of michigan for killing     14-year-old crystal kendrick in 1992 â a year after killing    brown. during his trial, prosecutors said frazier robbed brown, 41, after he sexually assaulted her. he then shot brown in the head when she only had $80 to give him. frazier returned to her apartment later to look for money and had a snack from her kitchen while brown lay dead on the floor for hours.                          âbecause sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,        therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.â             ð¥ ð¥ðððð«ðð¥ð·ð new nation news for 06 february 2025

trumpâs promised clampdown on illegal immigration. the arrests were the result of scores of coordinated raids around the country, which saw some of the very worst violent offenders clapped in irons after freely roaming the country under the biden administration. those busts included dozens of members of the vicious venezuelan tren de aragua prison gang â as well as multiple ms-13 gang members â at least five âcareer criminalsâ nabbed by the drug enforcement administration and scores of others wanted for murder, kidnapping, child molestation and more. ice has shared daily âenforcement updatesâ on x since jan. 23, outlining their daily arrest totals, as well as detainers lodged â formal requests for inmates to be held until they can be picked up by immigration officials. through tuesday, officials made 5,537 arrests and lodged 4,333 detainers, giving authorities a running start in what is shaping up to be a lengthy and resource-intensive enforcement effort. the white house â which has imposed a daily quota of at least 75 arrests from each of iceâs 25 satellite offices â has also been sharing details of some of the high-profile busts around the country.  posted by the bobster                           church of england's liverpool bishop resigns after sexual assault allegations                   education dept. to investigate

sentenced to 17 years for shooting at louisville mayoral candidate in 2022   louisville, ky.  a kentucky man who shot at louisville mayor craig greenberg when he was a candidate in 2022 was sentenced friday to 17 years and 6 months in federal prison after a tense sentencing hearing where greenberg spoke of the harm the attack has caused.  quintez brown was arrested shortly after leaving greenbergâs campaign office, where one of his six shots grazed greenbergâs sweater. four other staffers were in the room with greenberg, and one of them rushed to close the door on brown after he fired.greenberg, who was elected mayor later that year, said in court friday that he saw a man he didnât recognize come to the door of his campaign headquarters, and when a staffer tried to engage the man in conversation, âi saw a gun pointed directly at me and iâll never forget the sound of those gunshots fired,â greenberg told the court. greenberg said in the ensuing days, he felt âfear and confusion that made me physically numb for days.âbrown, 24, pleaded guilty in july to federal charges of interfering with a federally protected activity and discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. the plea agreement called for a sentencing range of 15 to nearly 18 years.us district judge benjamin beaton said brownâs attack was premeditated and was a threat to the communityâs political system. he ordered brown to be on supervised release for five years after he is out of prison.                 breaking bombshell! trump just seized over 300 billion

black-on-white:  31-year-old white mother who held twin bi-racial newborns as black ex sex-pal shot them to death ready to be a mom again: âit took me 9 yearsâ                           in hindsight, the red flags were everywhere.                     but when florida mom megan hiatt, 22, decided to end her abusive relationship back on nov. 13, 2015, she never imagined her ex, gawain rushane wilson, would grab his ar-15 and fire several shots as she cradled their 5-month-old twin daughters, hayden rose and kayden reese, in her arms.                     by the time he was done, wilson, 28, killed both girls, hiattâs father and himself.                     hiatt was shot seven times. bullets struck her chest and abdomen. her lungs and kidneys were the only organs not pierced. the gunfire hit her left wrist and shattered her left leg and knee.                     she lost her left eye and was unable to walk.                     hiatt had packed her things ready to leave wilson for good on that tragic day. a close friend and her dad, travis james hiatt, 49, stood outside wilsonâs jacksonville home to provide support. she was discussing a co-parenting plan with him when he âstarted shaking physicallyâ and became âvisibly distraught.â                     âwe were on the couch; he had reese, i had rose, and we were feeding them bottles,â she said. âmy things were packed into a truck outside, and he flew into a rage.â                     âhe asked, âare we over?â                     âyes,â she replied.                     âare you sure weâre over?â                     âweâre not meant to be in a relationship together,'â she said.                     wilson stood up, âthrew reese on the couch,â and went to the closet where he kept his firearms.                     âhe told me, âi am going to murder your dad, and youâre going to watch. iâll show whatâs over, bitch.'â                     when he heard hiatt scream, her father came barreling through the front door. wilson opened fire. over and over, hiattâs fearless father was downed by bullets, yet continued to push himself back up.                     wilson, who was an engine mechanic for the navy, then turned the weapon toward hiatt and the girls.                     âat this point, i know weâre going to die,â she said. âwhat am i going to do battling an ar-15? i was hysterical, and i was ready to die with daughters in my arms, protecting them the best way i could.â                     after fatally shooting the âsweet and beautifulâ babies and critically wounding hiatt, wilson stood over the mother of his dead daughters and shot himself in the head.                     âat the end, when everything had happened, i could hear my dad dying, and i was crying,â hiatt recounted. âi told him, âiâm so sorry, i didnât know he was going to do this.'â                     when asked why he wouldnât just stay down, her father âsaid he wanted to take every bullet he could so there wouldnât be any more bullets left for me and the girls,â she said.

(mark 7:13, 1 corinthians 1:17, and colossians 2:8-23).                     therefore we hold to true biblical ministry of preaching christ crucified to sinners, and building up the saints in christ through good doctrine, obtained only through studying and teaching the king james bible rightly divided (2 timothy 2:15)  hillview baptist church website             shorewood bible church on youtube           we are an independent, self-governing, self-supporting, self-propagating local body of believers.  we maintain no organizational affiliations with any other group, although we gladly fellowship with others of like precious faith.                     our purpose as a visible, localized manifestation of the body of christ is to glorify god by promoting "the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery" committed to the apostle paul (rom. 16:25, eph. 3:1-9) and carrying out "the ministry of reconciliation" committed to our trust as ambassadors of christ (ii cor. 5:18-20, ii tim. 1:13,14).                      to this end and following the ministry strategy of the apostle paul (acts 14:21-23), we have established three biblical priorities for our ministry:  shorewood bible church website                         thanks for visiting
