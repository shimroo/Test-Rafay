currently there are many people around the globe reporting “covid-19 dreams”, which reflect the unexpected situation in which we all find ourselves.  esteemed iasd members have been contributing interviews, articles and research on dreams during the pandemic.  we hope you will find this compilation of information to be useful.   


this portal includes photos and bios of iasd’s dac members; a “diversity response” contact email; resources in the form of websites, publications, podcasts; and links to diversity-related exercises for dreamers such as the powerful and healing dream-incubation exercise dolores nurss has initiated in the iasd facebook group.




interest in dreams seems to be increasing all the time while, at the same time, people have to be very selective about what they want to read. the basic idea of dreamlinks is to provide links to articles on dreaming, dream research and other dream-related topics (rather than the articles themselves) to make selecting easier: one just has to click on the link to access the webpage of interest.


iasd is happy to offer online courses in the science and psychology of dreaming and in the science of lucid dreaming for those iasd members and non-members who would like to take these as part of an independent study program. 





mission statement: international association for the study of dreams is a non-profit, international, multidisciplinary organization dedicated to the pure and applied investigation of dreams and dreaming. our purposes are to promote an awareness and appreciation of dreams in both professional and public arenas; to encourage research into the nature, function, and significance of dreaming; to advance the application of the study of dreams; and to provide a forum for the eclectic and interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and information.

data you provide to us through your use of iasd digital assets helps to inform the iasd about how best to provide you with a fulfilling user experience as it relates to our mission.  our goal is to ensure that your data is secure, and that iasd only uses your data subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.

if you don't want people to know your e-mail address, for example, don't include it in any message you post publicly. please be extremely careful when disclosing any data in chat rooms, forums and other public posting areas. we are not responsible for the use by others of the data that you disclose in chat rooms, forums and other public posting areas.

opt-out of communications

we communicate with users on a regular basis via email. for example, we will use your email address to contact you regarding membership renewal and dues payments, iasd elections,  to confirm a request you have made of iasd, to send you notice of upcoming payments that are due, to send you information about changes to our products and services or to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. generally, members cannot opt-out of these communications since it is necessary to keep members of informed of specific information regarding membership and actions related thereto.

iasd provides you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communications from us, such as messages or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on iasd digital assets or if you do not want us to share your personal data with third parties. for emails, you may opt-out by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within the text of an email. we will process your request to unsubscribe as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. 

your choices & obligations

data retention

we keep your data for as long as you are a member/contact or as long as your relationship with iasd digital assets continues and as required by law. we retain your data while your membership is active or as necessary to continue to provide services including fulfilling orders, accessing online courses, conferences and forums. this includes data you or others provided to us and data obtained from your use of iasd digital assets. there may be some instances where we retain non-personal data in a depersonalized or aggregated form.

rights to access and control your personal data

you can access, change or delete your data if you have an iasd account by logging into your account. you can also email us at office@asdreams.org or call 1-209-724-0889.

we collect your data in many ways, most often where you provide it to us, and we provide you with several options for collecting, using and sharing of your data, including deleting or correcting data you have provided to us.  we offer you settings to control and manage your data through your iasd member account.

for personal data that we have about you:

delete data: you can ask us to erase or delete all or some of your data (for example if you resign from being a member) and we will work hard to honor all requests in a timely manner.  in some instances, we may not be able to delete your personal data in order to comply with applicable laws (for example, it is necessary to keep the financial records of a transaction with you).

change or correct data: you can edit some of your data through your iasd account. you can also ask us to change, update or fix your data in certain cases, particularly if it’s inaccurate.

object to, or limit or restrict, use of data: you can ask us to stop using all or some of your data.

right to access and/or take your data: you have the right to see your data and take your data and we will work with you to be sure we can provide the most complete set of your data and a secure way to transfer your data.

resignation/account closure: we will keep some of your data even after you resign your membership with iasd or close your iasd account in order to fulfill any final service requests.  please note that we will retain your data even after you have resigned your membership or closed your iasd account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our user agreement, or fulfill your request to “unsubscribe” from further messages from us. we will retain de-personalized data after your account has been closed.

your data may continue to be accessed by others until they refresh their cache.

please note that iasd will not delete or restrict access to data about you where you have published in an iasd journal or other iasd publication including our conference programs and newsletters.  we will not delete historical data that reference your service to iasd.  we will not delete any comments or posts you have made on any of iasd’s social media accounts or on any other of iasd’s digital assets.  

website security

no data transmissions over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any data you transmit to us and you understand that any data that you transfer to iasd is done at your own risk. however, iasd uses website security measures consistent with current best practices to protect its website, email and mailing lists. these measures include technical, procedural, monitoring and tracking steps intended to safeguard data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration or destruction.

credit card data is transmitted using secure socket layer (“ssl”) encryption or transport layer security (“tls”). member and purchaser data are a high priority and we use our own protective measures, as well as the security of our software and hardware vendors.

we realize there can be incidents of misuse or unauthorized program incursions, as almost every website, service and user encounters. in those instances, our goals are to move quickly to isolate the problem, ensure or restore proper functionality and minimize any inconvenience to our users. as appropriate and necessary, iasd will notify the relevant authorities of these incidents of misuse or unauthorized program incursions of the iasd website.

data retention

iasd retains information only as long as necessary to accomplish the business purpose for which it was collected and to comply with its legal, irs and contractual obligations, and then securely disposes of that information or converts it into non-personal information by aggregating it, de-identifying it, or otherwise anonymizing it so that it does not directly or indirectly identify you and cannot, with reasonable efforts, resources, and technologies, be used to reidentify you.
