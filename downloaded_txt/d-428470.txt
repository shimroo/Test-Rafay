our promise
we believe people are resilient by nature. resilience means people have what they need to recover quickly.


our programming uses outdoor adventure to unlock resilience.


more resilient people are healthier. they also can help others become resilient in the:
   • classroom
   • workplace
   • family and
   • community.

the work we do here has the power to help our community to bounce back when something tough happens.

my son has had the best week so far. he has already asked if he can come again sometime!  almost everything he has got to do this week are first time experiences for him.parentadventure camp“i knew this program was going to be monumental from the moment we held our first information meeting. so much of what i believe our young children are missing in today’s society is covered in spades by the lac. the summer sessions…made a world of difference for this group of young men.”matt spottswoodd, assistant principallansdowne elementary school“lac understood the needs of our clients and adapted well. each session gave insight and aligned with previous goals set and the girls looked forward to returning every week. lac made coming back easier each week and each client received something different to keep with them forever.”joyia johnsonmaryhurst academy“lac has been an excellent partnership for our bereavement camp for the past two years. the staff is dedicated to go the “extra mile” for collaboration purposes with our agency, but also for the children to have a fun and meaningful experience at camp.”holly benderbluegrass care navigators
