watch the bbc storyworks short film on cwb!we were excited to participate in a short film made by bbc storyworks on our work at the center and how it is supported by design. the film is part of the online series "in pursuit of wellness", presented by the global wellness institute and in collaboration with olson kundig.click the image on the right to watch a 1-minute trailer, and watch the full, 5-minute video here.

we are a landmark! the center for wooden boats is now a landmark as designated by the city of seattle. this  includes the floating structures of our south lake union home (also known as waterway 4) and the old boathouse (also known as the wagner floating home). we are incredibly grateful to our community for writing to the board on our behalf, and to those who gave testimony during the hearings. a special thank you to sarah martin for her tireless research and expertise. application was made possible with support from 4culture. learn about the landmark designation, how it came to be and what it means for us in this short video produced by cwb volunteer shelley sabin.
