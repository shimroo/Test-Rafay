the 
                        perfect dump - every once in a while, each of us experiences 
                        a perfect dump, it's rare, but a thing of beauty in all 
                        respects. you sit down expecting the worst, but what you 
                        get is a smooth sliding, fartless masterpiece that breaks 
                        the water with the splashless grace of an expert diver. 
                        but that's not the end of it. you use some toilet tissue 
                        only to find that it was totally unnecessary. it makes 
                        you feel that all is right with the world and you are 
                        in perfect harmony with it.
the 
                        beer dump - talk about nasty dumps. depending on the 
                        dumper's tolerance, the beer dump is the end result of 
                        too many beers. it could have been 2 or 22, it doesn't 
                        matter. what you get is a sinister, lengthy, noisy dump 
                        accompanied by a malevolent fog that could close a bathroom 
                        for days.
the 
                        chili dump - hot when it goes in, and rocket fuel 
                        when it leaves. the chili dump stays with you all day, 
                        making your tush feel like a heat shield.
the 
                        cable dump - long, curly and perfectly formed like 
                        2 feet of e13 telephone co-axial cable. it loops lazily 
                        around the bowl, like a friendly serpent. you wonder admiringly, 
                        "did i do that? where did it come from?" you 
                        leave the bathroom pleased with yourself.
the 
                        latrine dump - in case you didn't know, a latrine 
                        is a hole in the ground with a tent around it where soldiers, 
                        boy scouts and flies go to dump. tip: don't ever, ever 
                        look in the hole.
the 
                        mona lisa dump - this is the masterpiece of dumps. 
                        it's as perfectly formed as it can be. delicate and slender 
                        with intricacies that would make da vinci weep. and just 
                        think, you made it yourself. you may even want to break 
                        out the polaroid, but maybe that's going a bit too far.
the 
                        empty roll dump - you're done...you reach for the 
                        toilet paper only to discover that empty cardboard cylinder. 
                        a mild panic begins coldly in your throat. you could use 
                        the curtains...no, someone would say "where are the 
                        curtains?" then what would you say? the rug?...too 
                        cumbersome. then you must come to the same conclusion 
                        that every "empty roll dumper" must face...pull 
                        up your slacks, tighten your tush and wriggle yourself 
                        to the nearest full roll.
the 
                        splash back dump - you send the dump on its way, it 
                        drops like a depth charge into the bowl creating a column 
                        of cold bowl water that washes your bottom with a startlingly 
                        unpleasant shock. now you're wet and embarrassed.
                        tip: blot instead of wiping.
the 
                        aborted dump - you are in mid-dump when the phone 
                        rings. what do you do? abort! pinch it off, go for the 
                        phone, and save the rest for later. it isn't pretty, but 
                        you've gotta do what you gotta do
the 
                        caesarian dump - pain, that's what this dump and childbirth 
                        have in common. its simply a case of too much dump trying 
                        to go through too small a hole, and there's no obstetrician 
                        to help.
the 
                        alfresco dump - everyone has had to go outdoors from 
                        time to time. this can be a rather pleasant experience 
                        really. the open air, the nature, and a good bush all 
                        contribute to the peaceful ambiance that our primitive 
                        forefathers must have enjoyed. what can screw up this 
                        harmonious interlude is a troop of brownies or a patch 
                        of poison ivy.
the 
                        childbirth dump - this is a dump that is simply too 
                        big to go through the aperture provided by nature for 
                        the purpose. you sit there, thinking over your dilemma. 
                        first it hurts, and it isn't going to get any better. 
                        you wonder if you'll ever see your loved ones again. you 
                        imagine the newspaper headlines screaming "man dies 
                        trying to hatch monster loaf". you realize you'll 
                        have to resolve the crisis before you can leave the bathroom. 
                        basically there are only three things you can do:
1. 
                        scream 
                        2. call an obstetrician 
                        3. hope like hell have enough vaseline to get you through 
                        it.
the 
                        tijuana trot dump - the phrase "sh*t happens" 
                        really applies here in a big way. when the ice in your 
                        tainted margarita makes contact with your lower intestinal 
                        tract, the fun begins. for the next 72 hours you'd be 
                        better off if you carried your own portable toilet with 
                        you because you will spend most of that time on the pot 
                        and the rest of the time in a fetal position. now you 
                        realize why mexico never had a navy.
the 
                        machine gun dump - you're just sitting there in a 
                        state of sublime peace when all of a sudden you emit a 
                        group of noisy gassy bursts that break the silence like 
                        machine gun fire. the guy in the next stall hits the floor 
                        like a combat veteran cradling his umbrella like an m16...damn 
                        commies.
the 
                        sound effect dump - you feel a noisy one coming on. 
                        relatives, friends or work mates are within earshot, so 
                        you must employ some clever techniques to cover the disgusting 
                        sounds you are about to emit. timing is obviously very 
                        important here. at the precise moment of release, try 
                        the following sound effects: 
1. 
                        flush the toilet 
                        2. sing the first two stanzas of your national anthem 
                        
                        3. drop a handful of quarters on the floor 
the 
                        security dump - you have enough on your mind when 
                        you're in the bathroom without worrying about a lockless 
                        door and someone bursting in to find you in mid-dump mode. 
                        so how can you prevent this embarrassing spectacle from 
                        taking place? one way is to strategically place your foot 
                        against the door. if you can't reach to do this...hum 
                        loudly
the 
                        cling-on dump - for the most part you've completed 
                        your dump, but there's one little morsel that refuses 
                        to drop off. you're getting impatient. someone else wants 
                        to use your stall. so, you grip the seat with both hands 
                        and wriggle, twist and pump but that last little stubborn 
                        piece just hangs there, suspended, clinging like a canned 
                        peach between you and the bowl water. maybe the person 
                        pounding impatiently on the door has scissors
the 
                        houdini dump - you go, then you stand up to flush, 
                        and the darn thing has disappeared. where'd it go? did 
                        it creep down the pipe? did you dream the whole thing? 
                        is it lurking out of sight? should you wipe...maybe you 
                        should just to make sure you went. should you flush? you'd 
                        better, because if you don't, you know it will reappear 
                        and smile at the next person who comes in
the 
                        flu dump - you feel so bad that you don't know which 
                        end of you to put down first. you have roaring cramps, 
                        so you sit down. then a wave of nausea rolls over you 
                        like a cold fog, so you stand up and cramps squeeze your 
                        intestines like a vice so you sit down again...up down 
                        up down. don't you wish mom were close by?
the 
                        porta-pottie dump - construction workers and outdoor 
                        concert goers will tell you about going in a portable 
                        toilet. my best description would be, "its like taking 
                        a shit in an upright coffin". its claustrophobic 
                        and it smells bad...best advice...go in a paper cup.
the 
                        proctologist dump - in the beginning, the lord created 
                        the earth, the sky and the firmament, but i hope he didn't 
                        create this dump, because there is nothing biblical about 
                        it, you run out of gas. that's right, you run out of propulsion. 
                        the dump is right there at the end of your barrel and 
                        refuses to go any further. you grunt, you squeeze, you 
                        wriggle but it just stays there like a lump of lead. you've 
                        only got two choices here. one is to squeeze the damn 
                        thing back up your intestine and wait until next time. 
                        the other is to pretend you're a proctologist and go after 
                        it yourself. not a pretty picture is it?? 
the 
                        whole roll dump - no matter how much you wipe, it 
                        doesn't seem to be enough. you blow the whole roll and 
                        you have to flush 25 times too. the whole episode is consumer 
                        waste.
the 
                        graffiti dump - you flush the dump and the swirling 
                        motion of the receding bowl water forces the dump to the 
                        porcelain sides, scraping a creative squiggle on its way 
                        down. you flush again but the curlicue hangs there...love 
                        it or leave it. its your choice.
the 
                        encore dump - ahhhh, you're done, so you wipe, put 
                        yourself together, wash your hands and are about to vacate 
                        the bathroom when you feel another dump coming. you have 
                        to return for a curtain call. the world's record is seven 
                        encores.
the 
                        born again dump - this is a dump that's going so badly, 
                        you say "lord, if i live through this, i'll take 
                        up religion" you always get through it, but seldom 
                        keep the promise you made in desperation, because a born 
                        again dump is like childbirth...you forget the pain quickly.

                        the kind where you wipe your butt fifty times and it still 
                        feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper between 
                        your butt and your underwear so you don't runie them with 
                        a stain. 
second 
                        wave poopie

                        you've pulled your pants up to your knees, and you realize 
                        you have to poopie some more.

                        plunger.

                        tap poopie

                        bobber poopie 
                        you are in a public restroom with two people waiting on 
                        your stall, you poopie and flush two times, but several 
                        golfball pieces are still floating above the water line.

the stolen  poopie 
 the poopie you take at a techy toilet, with an automatic flush, that is flushed so quick that when you whirl around to see the poopie you worked so hard for, you are left with a violated and un-satisfied feeling. you never got to see that poopie.                        

the hershey kiss 
 when you poop and just a little nugget comes out but your ass makes a smack sound like it's giving you a kiss.
