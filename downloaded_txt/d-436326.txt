the critical role of designit’s undeniable that "attractive" things hold an edge over those perceived as unattractive. the old adage "don’t judge a book by its cover" seems to be frequently overlooked in practice; people do, in fact, make judgments based on appearances. this tendency is not merely a matter of opinion—it is now supported by quantifiable data. case and point…94% of first impressions are design related. — source: british study: trust and mistrust of online health sites, dr. elizabeth silence75% of users judge a business's credibility based on its website's design. — source: stanford web credibility project, dr. b.j. foggsince consumers are bombarded with information from every direction, visual design has become a critical factor in capturing attention, fostering engagement, and driving business success. it's no longer enough to simply offer a quality product or service; you need to ensure your brand stands out in a crowded marketplace. visual design plays a crucial role in shaping how people perceive your business and how effectively you communicate with them.
