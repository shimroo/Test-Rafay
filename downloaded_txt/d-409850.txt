 emergent meetings are planned to confer the masonic degrees














our concept
in addition to dignity, excellence, and fellowship, the european concept is known for its dedication to a number of primary tenets





initiatic experience
the initiatic experience will have a sense of awe to our ceremonies 





the festive board

elegance of dress
in the style of european lodges, members are expected to dress properly in tuxedo, as well as a lodge apron and white gloves





enlightening education
