"it's the best pie i've ever tasted!"mac pie began when friends of sheila everitt encouraged her to go into business knowing they were eating the most delicious macadamia nut pie they had ever tasted. she began catering kona's parties, then supplying famous big island restaurants with her handmade dessert sensations. when requests for her now world-famous pies began rolling in, her family incorporated and opened shop in the keauhou shopping center in kona. the popularity of hawaii's #1 dessert is contagious.mac-pie is fashioned after sheila's grandmother's traditional southern chess pie using the favored local macadamia nuts with other premium island ingredients. maui raw sugar, fresh hawaiian eggs, fresh creamery butter, along with pure doublefold vanilla and a light dusting of macaroon coconut combine to make a unique, most irresistible pie, unequaled anywhere. mac crust, our exclusive handmade butter macadamia nut crust alone will tempt you to experience for yourself and conclude what sheila's friends confirm--"it's the best pie i've ever tasted!"
