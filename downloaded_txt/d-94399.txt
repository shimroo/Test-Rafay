                            we got back to the island pretty tired. thank you very much for a fantastic golf get away. all four of as were impressed with the hospitality and service we received at all the courses and hotels.

we played 36 @ tobiano 27 @hyde mnt 36 @ gallaghers , predator,the ridge course and the front nine on the old course. we were most impressed with tobiano. every hole has a beautiful view, absolutely loved it. bring your best game there .

gallaghers canyon also a gem. love the old style golf. the ridge course. there are some fantastic holes on this track. how they built it is beyond me. only played the front on the original course. much more open than the ridge.

to top it all off we had 30 degree weather all week. not bad for the middle of sept. ross we would like to thank you again for organizing a awesome trip. looking forward to booking our next trip.

                            thank you for helping pull together another excellent golf trip to kelowna.

i have been "chairman" of our annual golf trip since its inception 8 years ago. this summer (2010) was our second trip to kelowna, and the second time i relied on you to orchestrate the hotel bookings, tee times, and ground transportation.

once again, i was impressed by your professionalism and attention to detail. your course recommendations over the past couple years, including the bear, the quail, predator ridge, gallagher's and shannon lake, have all been well received by the guys. in fact, this year was unanimously tagged as the "best" and "most memorable" of all the previous trips by my friends.

as it will fall on me to plan our 9th annual trip next year, i have no doubt that we will be returning to kelowna for the third consecutive year... and i will be in touch early in 2011 to start putting that together with you again.                        

                            alan keats                        





                            we have finished our brief but intense trip of golfing in kamloops. all the arrangements were flawless and we were left to enjoy the golf. thank you. the tobiano course was especially great.
