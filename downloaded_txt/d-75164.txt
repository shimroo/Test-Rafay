                                        world-famous arenas such as radio city music hall and madison square garden. torres
                                        has shared stages with musical icons, including gladys knight, lionel richie, tito puente, jerry rivera,
                                        deborah cox and tayor dayne. for over two decades, she has been a popular iheart media radio personality
                                        on nyâs 103.5 fm, wktu. and judy is no stranger to the stage as she played aunt toni anne in the
                                        longest-running off-broadway show, my big gay italian wedding! and, she has recently appeared in films
                                        such as elliott loves, televised on hbo latino. in addition, she had her first supporting role as dawn in
                                        the film, fists of love, which received the award for best family drama, in the nyc film festival. this past
                                        year, she landed her first tv role as mimi martinez on the highly-rated cbs drama, blue bloods! and, for
                                        the last five years, as a way to give back, judy spends her spare time as a certified master life coach.
                                        

                                        born to a cuban father and puerto rican mother, judy was raised in the bronx, ny by her mom,
                                        alongside her three brothers and younger sister. her resilience today stems from the difficult childhood
                                        she faced and the hurdles she overcame since then. having to endure and witness domestic violence
                                        issues left her helpless and unable to speak up. judy struggled with an ongoing weight and
                                        self-esteem issue and ultimately struggled with bouts of what she calls the âdark cloud.â
in 2005, judy was unexpectedly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, (no capitalizing the letters, âms,â
                                        please, because, to her, the disease doesnât deserve to be that important). it is an auto-immune
                                        disease without a cure that attacks the central nervous system in a series of exacerbations and
                                        remissions. 
                                        

                                        her initial episode left her temporarily blind for nearly three months and though she eventually regained
                                        some of her vision, the experience led her to withdraw into herself. for judy, things began to turn around
                                        when she was reminded that although her sight was taken, her voice was not. judy received the muchneeded âwake-up callâ when she was able to meet and speak to celebrity montel williams, an ms advocate
                                        also living with the disease. he told her to âkeep her mind strongâ and from conversing with him about his
                                        personal experience in such detail, judyâs perception was changed from one that was disheartened to one that
                                        was empowered. by looking at the world through fresh eyes, she was able to inject freshness and diversity into
                                        her music that engaged her listeners and encouraged them to face their personal demons. realizing she could
                                        still pursue and engage in her passion for music, she was enabled to find her inner strength and pull herself
                                        back into the arena of living, and as brenã© brown so beautifully stated, âdaring greatly!â
                                        
















no reason to cry is an autobiographical musical about the life of judy torres. born & raised in the
                                        bronx, torres tells how she overcomes financial, social & physical obstacles to manifest her dreams
                                        of becoming a professional singer. despite lacking the necessary resources, her unstoppable efforts &
                                        passion finally landed her a record deal in 1987, recording a new genre of 80s music called freestyle.
                                        while her first recording, no reason to cry, took her on a ride to the taste of some fame, some
                                        fortune & sold-out performances at world-famous venuesâ¦no one knew of her simultaneous
                                        struggles with bullying, failed relationships, a diagnosis of an incurable disease, and depression
                                        that followed her throughout her life.
                                        

                                            today she tells her tales of these struggles through music, sharing the secret and sacred
                                            truth of her experiences & how, ironically, her own music and her fan s who follow her saved
                                            her life. no reason to cry has become a mantra for many...and for judy torres, she hopes,
                                            her lifeâs legacy and gift to others!
                                        

                                            in her early life, she believed she had to be silent to survive, but through judyâs music
                                            she found her voice. in this show, listen with an open heart as she invites you to
                                            remember that no matter how tough life gets, thereâs no reason to cry!
