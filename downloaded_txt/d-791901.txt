hallowthankmas





that time of year which always seems to overwhelm us,that season some call hallowthankmas. we are already seeing the ads and hearing the news about how hard it may be to travel and the need to buy tickets. so, as we plan and hope and dream, remind us, god of the lonely, of all those around us who will not be able to travel this year, just as they have not been able to afford to travel, or have anyone to visit, for so many years. that time of year which always seems to seduce us to spend more on costumes and buy more candy than we will ever give away (or should eat) is here. and we begin to make lists of what we will get for our aunt, the tools our brother might need, how many toys and gifts for each child or grandchild, all the while mindful of the stories of the most popular giftsalready being on backorder. so, as we plan and hope and dream, remind us, jesus of the forgotten, of all those around us (maybe even friends, neighbors, family) who hope they can afford, much less find, a simple, single present for each member of their family, and wonder if they can put together a costume for their child. that time of year which always seems to sneak up on us, no matter how early the sales, and ads, begin has done it again, and we are already stressed out with the planning, the worrying, the scheduling, the list making, and soon, the delivery folks will be dropping off more and more stress on our porches and doors. so, as we plan and hope and dream, remind us, spirit of pauses and silence, that not everyone gives into the buying and accumulating and worrying, but find the simple pleasures of a quiet afternoon with a close friend, the silence of a long walk in the woods, the gentle peace of staring at the stars, and who are more than willing to share these gifts with us. that time of year is upon us, god in community, holy in one, so, we pray we might find time this year to discover the peace, the hope, the silence, the grace you offer to us in every moment.  amen.(c) thom m. shuman

how easy





we cry out for peaceand offer our prayerswhile continuing to mutterangry words about othersunder our breath, pausingto stir the kettle of bitternessbrewing in our hearts,quietly planning the revengewe would wreak upon allthose we think of as evil.we recoil in revulsion at the images we seedisplayed on our devicesof rubbled buildings andbullet-holed kibbutzes,of little children carried lifeless from their homes,of hospitals reduced to morgues,while never having givena thought to the plight,the fears, the nightmaresof those on both sides until these last few days.we like, love, sharesocial media postings, memes,pictures, diatribes postedby people who know no more than we do(about the history, the landor the faiths or the politics,the reality, the hopes, thesolutions tried over and over,the promises made and brokenthen recycled once more)simply because they appealto our emotions, or the outrageof those who add fuel to our own.lord, in your mercy . . .(c) 2023 thom m. shumanvenmo: @thom-shuman

peace? 





 as long as we thinkall it takes is a handshake(while keeping the hiddenhand clenched in a fist).as long as we believeit can be accomplishedaround tables rather thansitting in an open circlewhere we can see thevulnerability of one another.as long as we are convincedit is the repeated useof the same word overand over again, while ignoringthe broken promises of so long.as long as we trust it to prayers and not thegritty efforts of listening,nor the grubby work of baring our souls,nor the gut wrenching realityof admitting our evil,what chance does peaceever have?(c) 2023 thom m. shumanvenmo: @thom-shuman

as close as (john 20:19-31)





in these moments
especially in these moments
we suddenly realize how
much we miss the human
touch (yes, even us introverts), so
you invite us to reach out
and touch 
your wholeness offered
for our brokenness,
your healing given
for our hopelessness,
your love poured out
for our loneliness

when we put on masks
and need to stand 
as far away as we can
from one another, you
come and breath 
peace on us, so we
might find serenity in
all the confusion, so we
might find comfort in
the midst of all the uncertainty.

canticle 23 for these times





god is the health care folk
all around us:
encouraging us to stay home;
reminding us to wash our hands
so we can help others be safe;
teaching us how to be mindful
and watch over ourselves and others.

even as we shelter in place,
we will not give in to fear,
for god is with us,
in those who call us and care for us,
in those who shop for us,
and those who treat us.

around a lonely table,
in a houseful of family,
in a hospital with strangers,
god feeds us with grace,
pouring out hope upon us,
filling us with peace in sleepless night.
i know, without any doubt,
that god's gentleness and compassion
are walking right beside us,
showing us the way home
to the one who holds us 
in love's heart forever.

canticle 95







gospel, country, hip hop,

rock and roll, r & b, classical:

let every genre raise a song

to you, o god.

we will come jumping and jiving

into your living room, clapping

our hands in time to our songs:

for you are beyond words,

and music is the common

tongue to speak of you!

you cradle canyons in your hands

and shape everests from dust,

you float islands like rafts

across the oceans of the world.



we come running to jump up

in your lap, and laugh as

you bounce us on your knees,

and then sit on the floor

as we play marbles together,

and you listen to our silly jokes.



you ask us to pay attention, and

oops!

we run off, slamming our doors

as hard as we can as if to test

how far your patience stretches.

but

if we put our ears 

up to the doors and listen

very carefully, we might just hear

your heart beating slowly,

hoping we would come out

and sit at your feet to hear

your stories of grace

canticle 121







our
eyes cast down onto

sheol’s
road, you tip up

our
chins so we can see hope

leaping
over the horizon,

running
our way through

creation’s
flowery fields.



you
help us to stay steady

on
our feet in the gusts of life;

we
won’t catch you daydreaming

you
hold us, and all your children 

tight
to your heart, refusing

to
nod off no matter how weary.



you
are our babysitter, our guardian;

you
are a shady oak on a hot day,

cooling
us with sweet lemonade,

showing
us how to use a telescope

to
explore the moon each night.



you
refuse to let the malicious

to
gain power over us;

you
wrap us in your arms

when
we tremble with fear.

whether
we are relaxing at home,

running
errands, facing down bullies,

trying
to stand up to injustice –

wherever,
whenever; here, there;

yesterday,
today, tomorrow

you
are

with
us, beside us, for us
