paintings that live at the intersection of art and science

 

my work  celebrates the biodiversity of the natural world and addresses our cultural (dis)connection from nature. i live and work under the redwoods in marin county, california with my husband, a scientist, and my vibrant 9-year-old daughter.

about the artist
bozic’s work evokes the tradition of tightly rendered nature illustration, which she explodes with highly emotional, surreal metaphors. not so much departing from reality as articulating it more deeply. as nature is ever more subjugated by human impacts, bozic corrects the balance sheet. she establishes inescapable chains of consequence among the myriad species whose interactions create the world. the work is beautiful, celebratory, but can also be quite difficult. the complexities of natural processes like death and decomposition percolate through pictures of otherwise shining life.
