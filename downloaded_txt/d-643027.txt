'cat with telephone 
      in landscape': mixed-media
    (collection of jamiroquai the jazz-rock group: london, 1997)

to 
                counter the increasing cynicism, aggression, deviousness and madness 
                of our millennium, it is imperative today for art to be aggressively-beautiful, 
                child-like, pure, flamboyant, direct, and unafraid of any form 
                of ugliness or deceit.

                without such beauty, life today is a desert sans water: the killing-badlands 
                of mad-max skinheads. there is really no alternative any more; 
                this madness and dishonesty has reached a point of life vs. death.

                i have been driven by dreams of pure beauty ever since i first 
                saw a wild red rose in the first garden of my childhood in calcutta. 
                the fearless spectrum of stained-glass windows, gold-flecked miniatures 
                and medieval illuminations in worship of a fearsome and dazzling 
                beauty, mesmerised me into this state known as 'artist'...

                .... now, beauty is my armour. i am protected by it; saved by 
                it. i have no intention of taking off my full metal jacket --- 
                for this is war. i am ready...

                .... my armour shines like the sun, in links of gold and silver 
                chain-mail, as i battle to keep beauty alive. all the dazzling 
                colours of heaven and hell's kaleidoscope flicker-off my metal 
                warrior's garb; my face shines with the shocking colours of my 
                war-paint... an artist, a writer, with my brush and pen my arms, 
                i fear nothing... i am ready; ready for battle.

                .... look at all of my dreams. read each and every word of my 
                prayers. now i lay them all bare before you; joyful and unafraid 
                before your cynical gaze.

                .... if any glimmerings of these, my private paradises and glittering 
                infernos, touch even the smallest shadows of your soul, feel free 
                to let me know all of your thoughts.
