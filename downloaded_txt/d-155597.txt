us + you = a perfect collaboration to remember our fathers.can we help you find something?

 




 

this connection is as exciting for us as it may be for you!



if you’re like many of us, you’re realizing that you may know less about your father or his service than you’d like. and that you don’t recall meeting many other wwii orphans. with any luck at all . . . both situations may be about to change!

was your father killed in world war ii?




    please join us!
  

 














our founder’s welcome:



i am ann mix, the founder of the american wwii orphans network and i would like to welcome you to our new website. we are glad you found us and we encourage you to browse the site and learn about our fathers, the men who fought and died during wwii. please join us in remembering and honoring these brave men.when i began awon in 1991, i had never met another person whose father had died in wwii. nearly all of our members will say the same. we now know that 183,000 children received survivor benefits from the us government as the result of wwii. if you are one of these people, you have come to the right place. awon is for you.  we will understand and relate to your experiences growing up with a father lost during wartime. we will help you locate information about your father’s military service, about his unit and about the war itself.  please join with us as an orphan member of the american wwii orphans network. if you did not lose a father in wwii, but would like to help us with our mission to honor our fathers and to identify and support those 183,000 us orphans, please consider joining us as a supporting member. ~ in their memory
