susanne schuenke
fine art
 
my style is recognizable to the amateur observer as well as the professional and the connoisseur. in this style, i work with a wide range of topics and degrees of stylization without losing my artistic core.
throughout the work a dominant, harmonious flow of idiosyncratic curves and dynamic lines keeps its balance with the inner structure of the over-all composition. such lines. figures and characterized objects, and even capture abstract concepts.
the work may be expressed in a semi-naturalistic way, in stylization, or in various degrees of abstraction. it is my aim to connect the observer with the intrinsic beauty dwelling in the colors and forms, simultaneously presenting to his/her intellectual inquiry a rich offering of the representational intentions.
