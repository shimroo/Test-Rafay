our neighborhood playgroups are the heart of las madres 



welcome to las madres neighborhood playgroups!
las madres was founded in 1953 and operates as a non-profit today. we’re a group of parents and other caregivers, just like you, who organize playdates, parent only events, a local education fair, parenting education, business partner discounts and other group activities.  playgroups are the heart of las madres and are formed annually throughout santa clara county. groups are organized by the year of your child’s birth and meet in your neighborhood. playgroups meet often for socializing and playtime, and once formed, stay active within las madres for 4-5 years. we warmly welcome moms, dads, grandparents and other caregivers with children under the age of 5 to join at any time.  take a look around our site to learn more and sign up for your 2 month free trial when you are ready.  we look forward to welcoming you!

membership benefits




playgroups
playgroups are where most members connect with other parents and the children enjoy playdates. nothing substitutes for the ability to build friendships with parents who are faced with similar parenting issues. our playgroups span across silicon valley and are organized by neighborhood, and then by birth year.




exclusive events and programs
las madres organises events to support our entire organization and our wider community - movie afternoons, baseball games, events at the children's discovery museum, luncheons, santana row mommy & me and many more.  we also have community service, parental education, diversity and inclusion programs, you can participate in. 





online community
las madres has a vibrant online community.  there are literally 100's of groups you can join, here are a couple of examples - chit chat, about town, working parents, looking for a school? deals & steals, search & find.  also, there are social groups - crafting, gardening, organization groups and support groups - allergies, parents of 3, postpartum groups to name a few.




member discounts
one of the great benefits of las madres is our business partner program. las madres partners with many local businesses to offer fantastic discounts to our members on products, services and local attractions that parents find useful.
