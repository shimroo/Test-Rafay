europe will not be part of ukraine-russia peace talks, us envoy says





guardian:europe will not be part of ukraine-russia peace talks, us envoy sayskeith kellogg tells countries to offer concrete solutions and boost spending instead of complaining about talks rolefrom right: keith kellogg, the us vice-president, jd vance, and the secretary of state, marco rubio, at a meeting with ukraine's volodymyr zelenskyy on the fringes of the munich security conference on friday. photograph: matthias schräder/appatrick wintour in munichsun 16 feb 2025 02.22 aedteurope will be consulted – but ultimately excluded – from the planned peace talks between russia, the us and ukraine, donald trump’s special envoy for ukraine has revealed.asked if europe would be present at the planned talks, keith kellogg said he was from “the school of realism, and that is not going to happen”.“it may be like chalk on the blackboard, it may grate a little bit, but i am telling you something that is really quite honest,” he said on saturday.“and to my european friends, i would say: get into the debate, not by complaining that you might, yes or no, be at the table, but by coming up with concrete proposals, ideas, ramp up [defence] spending.”kellogg’s remarks will cause consternation among some european leaders who do not trust trump and believe their country’s security is inextricably interwoven with the fate of ukraine. the polish foreign minister, radosław sikorski, said the french president, emmanuel macron, had invited european leaders to paris on sunday to discuss the situation.kellogg said one reason previous peace talks between ukraine and russia had failed was because of the involvement of too many countries that had no ability to execute any such process. “we are not going to get down that path,” he said on the margins of the munich security conference.ukraine’s president, volodymyr zelenskyy, had earlier used his speech to the conference to warn that europe was likely to be excluded from the negotiations. he urged europe to step up and form a european army in which ukraine would play a central role.zelenskyy says time has come to create an 'armed forces of europe'european leaders, battered by the confrontational speech by the us vice-president, jd vance, on friday, are increasingly apprehensive about trump’s approach to a ukraine peace deal and fear an agreement may be struck that is advantageous to the us, but has long-term implications not just for the security of ukraine, but for europe.the polish prime minister, donald tusk, said on social media: “europe urgently needs its own plan of action concerning ukraine and our security, or else other global players will decide about our future. not necessarily in line with our own interest … this plan must be prepared now. there’s no time to lose.”jd vance’s munich speech laid bare the collapse of the transatlantic allianceread morekellogg said the critical issues were to ensure the war did not start again after a ceasefire and to determine how ukraine retained its sovereignty. he said this would require a credible security guarantee, adding that trump, as the sole decision-maker in the us, was not yet in a position to define such a guarantee.he said: “trump would need a full range of options”, and that “all options are on the table”. he said he was working on “trump time”, adding he expected an agreement in weeks and months. a key issue was to agree how breaches of any ceasefire agreement were handled, he said.kellogg said he was working with his contacts in the nato alliance while steve witkoff, the middle east envoy, was in contact with the russians.zelenskyy told europe to avoid being abandoned at the negotiation table by trump. “let’s be honest – now we can’t rule out the possibility that america might say ‘no’ to europe on issues that threaten it. many leaders have talked about a europe that needs its own military – an army of europe. i believe that the time has come. the armed forces of europe must be created.“a few days ago, president trump told me about his conversation with putin. not once did he mention that america needs europe at that table. that says a lot. the old days are over – when america supported europe just because it always had. ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement. and the same rule should apply to all of europe. no decisions about ukraine without ukraine. no decisions about europe without europe.”he added: “president trump once said: ‘what matters is not the family you were born into, but the one you build.’ we must build the closest possible relationship with america, and – yes, a new relationship – but as europeans, not just as separate nations. that’s why we need a unified foreign policy, a coordinated diplomacy, the foreign policy of a common europe.”with many european nations facing increasingly eurosceptic electorates, his ideas about integration are unlikely to take off, but his remarks may galvanise europe into more detailed discussions about what military role they can play in ukraine, including by putting troops on the ground to protect a ceasefire.the nato secretary general, mark rutte, urged europe to remain engaged with trump, and not to believe he was about to abandon europe or ukraine. he said “we are one family” adding the americans “are right, we are not spending enough”. he said he expected nato to adopt a new spending target in may to be reached in four or five years’ time with clear milestones, and a possible defence spending target above 3% of gdp. the current target of 2% was not enough, he said.olha stefanishyna, ukraine’s deputy prime minister for europe, took a more optimistic view of us intentions, saying: “there is a very serious intention and determination to end the war in a just way, and that it should be ended in a manner that it does not happen again. we are not only talking about ending the war, but also preventing it happening again.”zelesnkyy is trying to fend off a bid by trump for the us to take control of 50% of ukraine’s rare earth minerals. he rejected the offer after the propsoed contract did not contain the expected pledges to provide us security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire.asked about the deal in munich, zelenskyy said: “we are still talking. i have had different dialogues.”the us treasury secretary, scott bessent, offered zelenskyy the deal during a visit to kyiv on wednesday, after trump suggested the us was owed half a trillion dollars’ worth of ukraine’s resources in exchange for its assistance.zelenskyy is looking for any way to lock the us into a long-term protection of ukraine from future russian threats, but knows that in a vulnerable bargaining position, trump can make demands it will be hard to resist.

despite ceasefire, israel still destroying homes in gaza





al jazeera:despite ceasefire, israel still destroying homes in gazaanalysis of satellite images shows israel has destroyed dozens of homes in possible breach of the ceasefire terms.(al jazeera)by al jazeera staffpublished on 15 feb 202515 feb 2025israel has destroyed dozens of homes in rafah, southern gaza, despite the ceasefire between israel and hamas, satellite imagery analysis conducted by al jazeera’s fact-checking agency, sanad, has revealed.the crossing between egypt and gaza at rafah, which has served as a critical lifeline into the enclave for decades, was closed by israel in may 2024.recommended storiesrecord number of journalists killed in 2024, israel mostly responsible: cpjrebuilding gaza: what it would take to win this uphill battleat least 25 palestinians killed by israeli forces in jenin this yeartrump’s gaza takeover ‘plan’ puts egypt in a tough spotsince seizing control of the border area, in breach of its 1979 peace agreement with egypt, israel has been digging in in the philadelphi corridor, a 14-km (8.7-mile) strip of land along the boundary between egypt and gaza.israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has emphasised the importance of remaining in the corridor, despite the illegality.according to sanad, the images, taken between january 19 and 21, show the israeli army to have built sand fortifications across the rafah crossing.additionally, the agency said, a new military outpost has been established just to the north of the crossing.the army has also constructed a 1.7 km (1.1-mile) road surrounding the crossing, running parallel to the sand fortifications.israeli forces have also kept thousands of rafah residents from their homes, israeli military vehicles shooting at dozens of people trying to go home, injuring and killing them.israel, in essence, is constructing “a buffer zone that allows you to push any kind of fighters or, in technical terms, any hostile within an otherwise friendly environment away from you”, palestinian defence analyst hamze attar said.as part of the ceasefire, which began on january 19, israel agreed to reduce its forces in the area before completely withdrawing its troops by the 50th day of the agreement.however, analysis carried out on satellite images taken between january 19 and february 1 shows the israeli army has continued construction in the area, demolishing and bulldozing 64 buildings within the city of rafah, specifically in the as-salam, idari, and tel zaarab neighbourhoods.the demolitions occurred only 700 metres (766 yards) from the egyptian border. at the same time, sanad also identified at least six homes razed in tal as-sultan, west of rafah, a little more than 750 metres (820 yards) from the egyptian border.“this is a war crime because they are destroying residential houses,” attar said, referring to the fourth geneva convention, which prohibits the destruction of private property.meanwhile, munir al-bursh, director-general of the ministry of health in gaza, said on tuesday that israeli attacks, unexploded ordnance, or fatal injuries sustained earlier have killed 118 people since the ceasefire agreement took effect.in addition to military breaches of the ceasefire, israel has not allowed in sufficient amounts of essential humanitarian aid, such as food, fuel, tents, and emergency shelters.rafah mayor ahmed al-sufi said most of the city’s residents remain displaced, with an estimated 200,000 people sheltering in the al-mawasi khan younis area and other locations across gaza, unable to come home.according to him, initial estimates indicate that 90 percent of rafah’s homes have been damaged, with approximately 52,000 units suffering various degrees of destruction.source: al jazeera***kt comments:shai-loks continue ethnic cleansing of gaza and west bank, undoubtedly encouraged by trump's reckless unlawful pro-israel remarks.

new meaning to bang for your buck: cops find bullets, casings, even live ammo at kuala langat e-waste recycling plant





 new meaning to bang for your buck: cops find bullets, casings, even live ammo at kuala langat e-waste recycling plantenvironment department head of dangerous materials azlan ahmad said recycling ammunition without a special permit is illegal and that ammunition is listed as an explosive material. — reuters file picsaturday, 15 feb 2025 7:51 pm mytkuala lumpur, feb 15 — a bullet “recycling plant” was uncovered during a police raid today on an illegal e-waste processing factory that has been operating on the sly in kuala langat, selangor for the past two years.the raid was part of op hazard, conducted by the central brigade general operations force in cooperation with the municipal council and the environment department, the star reported.around 70 to 80 workers were detained for inspection during the operation.“we found bullet casings, fired bullets, and live ones as well,” deputy director of the internal security and public order department datuk mohamad suzrin mohamad rodhi was quoted as saying.“we believe it was from outside malaysia,” he added.some 50 tonnes of material were found during the raid at the telok panglima garang factory, and between 70 and 80 workers have been detained for investigations.according to the news report, the spent bullets and their casings were found in various states of smelting; some had also been formed into metal bars ready for export.suzrin said the ammunition at the facility posed an environmental risk.“they retrieve the valuable bits and leave the dangerous parts here, leading to more damage,” he was quoted as saying.environment department head of dangerous materials, azlan ahmad, highlighted that the illegal factory was dangerous for many reasons.“for example, the smelting area had no proper ventilation for the smoke.“this is the first time such a raid has uncovered ammunition, and we are viewing the matter seriously,” he was quoted as saying.

time to un-seat us on the un security council





time to un-seat us on the un security councilby dr rais hussinin recent months, the united states has made a habit of exiting international organisations, from the world health organisation (who) to the united nations human rights council (unhrc).these departures, typically justified as pragmatic rejections of bodies that no longer serve american interests, raise a pointed question: why stop there? why not withdraw from the most powerful international forum of all – the united nations security council (unsc)?for decades, the united nations (un) has served as the central platform for international cooperation, with its security council intended to preserve peace and security through collective action.yet recent developments signal a deeper structural crisis: the us has withdrawn from or defunded several major un-related bodies and international organisations even while retaining a privileged position on the unsc that allows it to block resolutions – particularly regarding israel’s actions in gaza.as the world watches the ongoing tragedy in the occupied palestinian territories, many wonder whether it is time not just for israel to be unseated from the un but, more consequentially, for the us itself to withdraw – or be removed – from its security council seat.the un was established on the back of the 1945 yalta conference, an effort by war-weary nations to forge an international order premised on cooperation and the “sovereign equality” of all states.instead of one nation dominating global affairs, the un charter envisaged a balance of power and mechanisms like the security council to prevent future world wars.yet, in the decades since the cold war, the us has progressively expanded its global reach while paying lip service to the un framework.its permanent security council seat, with the power of veto, turned into a powerful diplomatic tool.around the world, washington repeatedly leveraged that veto to block resolutions critical of its own foreign policy or that of close allies – chief among them israel, especially in the context of repeated war crimes in gaza.over and over, the unsc’s ability to censure or sanction israel for violations of international law has been paralysed by a simple “no” from the us.under president donald trump’s first term (2017–2021), the us withdrew from the paris agreement on climate change, slashed funds to unrwa (the un relief and works agency for palestine refugees), withdrew from the who, and exited the unhrc.us president donald trump (image: getty images)trump 2.0 has doubled down on these isolationist signals, issuing an executive order on feb 4, 2025, that officially ended us participation in the unhrc once more and cut additional funding to unrwa. israel soon followed suit.such actions have practical ramifications. when washington halts its financial contributions – often some of the largest among un member states – international agencies find themselves in sudden crisis.the experience of the world anti-doping agency (wada) is instructive: the moment it decided running contrary to washington’s preferences, us funds were frozen, plunging it into disarray.a similar pattern emerged with the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (opcw), which faced significant pressure to tailor its statements and investigations in syria to us’ positions.this effectively undermines the independence of these international organisations and contravenes the principle of sovereign equality at the heart of the un charter.if the us has spent the past few years exiting or defunding a range of international organisations – from the who to the unhrc – why should it continue to occupy a seat that grants it such disproportionate leverage over global peace and security?in practical terms, the us has already signalled, through its many withdrawals, that it no longer sees the un system as a framework worthy of its compliance or financial support – unless it directly serves us strategic or economic goals.moreover, calls for fundamental un reform are growing. the collective “global south” has long been marginalised in international decision-making, but this is beginning to change.countries in africa, asia, and latin america are increasingly asserting their voices on the global stage, demanding a seat at the table and a say in the decisions that affect their lives.the us’ withdrawal from the unsc could accelerate this shift, creating space for new leaders to emerge and new solutions to be proposed.as the tragedy in gaza rages on, with un experts, human rights groups, and humanitarian agencies denouncing relentless attacks on civilians (even un staff and facilities), the lens of moral urgency too insists that if the us can so readily exit or defund key arms of the un system, it should not simultaneously wield a veto that perpetuates suffering on such a massive scale.(image: reuters)expelling or suspending israel from un might have symbolic resonance, but history shows that israel’s leadership, emboldened by us’ support, is not easily constrained by membership status alone.a more decisive step would be to dislodge the very power that funds, arms, and defends israel – namely the un removing or persuading the us to exit the unsc would strip away the near-automatic veto obstructing rigorous international scrutiny and accountability and making the council impotent in the face of grave violations in palestine.if washington is already in the process of what some term “self-isolation” in global affairs – exiting treaties, lambasting international oversight bodies, and ignoring long-established norms – then it is better for the us to formalise that disengagement by vacating its unsc seat.the steady exodus of the us from global institutions has already shaken the viability of critical international frameworks.whether one views these actions through the lens of a “business-like, cost-cutting president” or as a calculated step toward dismantling multilateralism, the effect is the same: washington demonstrates little regard for diplomatic consensus and the principle of sovereign equality.if washington no longer considers itself bound by the un system’s founding principles, perhaps it should forfeit its ability to shape and block the decisions of the world’s highest security organ.some might argue that the us’ withdrawal would leave a power vacuum, but this is a risk worth taking. the current system, in which a handful of nations hold disproportionate power, is unsustainable.it is time to move toward a model of global governance that is truly representative of the world’s diversity.as the world faces existential threats from climate change to expanded warfare, the impetus for meaningful structural reforms is more urgent than ever. – feb 13, 2025 dr rais hussin is the founder of emir research, a think tank focused on strategic policy recommendations based on rigorous research.

israel murdered a quarter of a million gazans





pearls and irritationsjohn menadue’s public policy journal why did the idf reveal all to the new york times?by keith mitchelsonfeb 4, 2025the new york times gained remarkable access to more than 100 israel defence force soldiers, who confirmed that altered idf practices caused the outrageous death toll among palestinians in gaza. everyone should read the original article.the new york times investigation “israel loosened its rules to bomb hamas fighters, killing many more civilians” from 26 dec 2024 is a brilliant piece of investigation and a chilling disclosure of idf operations during the 15 month-long destruction of gaza. nyt reporters reviewed military records and interviewed over a hundred anonymous idf soldiers and officers, including 25 who determining bombing targets. quoting: ‘the order (relaxing targeting constraints), has not previously been reported, and had no precedent in israeli military history’. ‘mid-ranking officers were given leeway to attack many targets, many of lower military significance, often with such high civilian cost.”‘the investigation found israel severely weakened safeguards meant to protect civilians; and adopted flawed methods to find targets and assess civilian risk. it failed to review civilian harm caused. it ignored warnings from within the idf, and from u.s. military officials.”it eventually meant rank-and-file hamas militants were targeted at home, surrounded by relatives and neighbours. idf planners argue crude models were used to locate potential targets, such as cell-phone activity in neighbourhoods. upper limits on civilian casualties also likely became a ‘daily objective’, rather than a rarely reached failure.the nyt confirmed that at 1pm on 7 october 2023 the idf ordered the relaxation of the rules protecting palestinian civilians, yet, “only a few weeks later there were virtually no limits on the number of civilians who could be killed, alongside loosely defined ‘hamas targets’ in gaza”. these revelations seemingly try to explain the outrageous numbers of gazan dead, despite idf spokesmen claiming throughout the war that “it only targets known hamas operatives”. the investigators noted “over 90% of the bombs dropped on gaza in the first weeks of the war were 1000 and 2000 lb” monsters that could destroy entire buildings, indiscriminately killing many; bravely noting many bombs were american made.interviewing gazan survivors as well, the nyt noted that most palestinians killed in bombing raids are not accounted in health ministry death tolls, as their bodies were unrecoverable from the building rubble. killing of 20, 30, or rarely 50 civilians to destroy a single military target were described.idf soldiers could drop one-ton bombs on any infrastructure, on military targets, on islamic fighters at home, eventually on their wider associates. targets included lookouts, money changers, and suspected underground tunnels (where israeli hostages might also likely be hidden).the nyt investigation contains candid and deeply disturbing information, confirming the assertions of independent humanitarian agencies working in gaza, that precise targeting of hamas operatives was ‘a fiction’. aerial images of gaza show a wasteland of utterly destroyed buildings, with every house bombed. the idf made the entire population homeless, while forbidding rebuilding.the medical journal lancet published an estimate of some 186,000 unidentified-dead buried under building rubble, though newspaper haaretz suggests a lower number. adding this first estimate to nearly 49,000 war dead identified to gazan health authorities, and another 20,000 mostly child deaths from starvation, and 5,000 deaths because hospitals are destroyed, the latter reported by american healthcare workers to president biden on 2 october 2024, the aggregate of the victims reaches almost a quarter of a million gazans dead.the hannibal directivethe nyt particularly noted ‘the order (relaxing targeting) has not previously been reported, and had no precedent in israeli military history”. the investigation makes no mention of the secret hannibal directive which has a 40 year-long precedent in israeli military history, which allows israeli military hostages to be killed.the hannibal directive was invoked in israeli occupied palestine during the hamas incursion at precisely 12 p.m. on 7 october 2023, along the newly described targeting of palestinians in gaza one hour later.earlier, at 6:30 a.m. on 7 oct 2023, hamas militants had breached the fences surrounding gaza and entered israeli occupied palestine. from then the idf was trying to prevent insurgents attacking military installations and stopping kidnapped israelis being transported back to gaza as hostages. idf battles in occupied palestine continued from the 7 to 9 october, killing thousands of insurgents and israelis alike.some of the 100 solders interviewed by the nyt must have fought in occupied palestine from 7 -9 oct, yet no mention is made of hannibal. the nyt article implies the relaxed targeting was uniquely applied against palestinians in gaza. yet the ‘relaxed-targeting’ of israeli civilians and soldiers captured by hamas was a hallmark of the idf war in occupied palestine under the hannibal directive order.the israeli government claims all idf actions were against hamas. yet accounts from idf solders and civilian survivors have indicated many israelis killed during the hamas incursion died at the hands of idf soldiers wildly applying the hannibal directive, ordered by their commanders. these events have been published in israeli newspapers, and by chris hedges realnews network.the netanyahu government claims the 1200 israeli deaths on 7 october were exclusively due to hamas terrorists. the government used these initial israeli deaths to justify the murderous destruction of all gaza, which the nyt vividly describes in their investigation.lack of access for israeli journalistsisraeli media has not been afforded access to such numbers of serving idf personnel, rather, occasional named israeli soldiers personally revealed limited operational details. israeli newspaper haaretz reprinted the nyt investigation, suggesting other mainstream israeli media should do so too.i believe the details revealed by idf soldiers who spoke to the nyt are true, yet i find it unlikely that 100 serving soldiers would speak of illegal methods, and show restricted military documents to reporters, without the approval of their commanders. interviewees said idf actions in gaza were because of “existential fear of hamas” (for all 470 days?). one might expect disenchanted soldiers upset with idf brutality could reveal heinous methods, but not 100, speaking anonymously because of military secrecy. perhaps anonymity is to avoid potential prosecution for war crimes.when provided with a summary of the nyt’s findings: “the israeli military acknowledged that its rules of engagement had changed after oct. 7, regarding targeting of gazans”. this clearly shows that idf command allowed such damaging information to be revealed to the nyt. otherwise why admit it, and why now after 15 months of insisting on the correct conduct of the idf in pursuing hamas?my reading is that the government wants to bury knowledge of the hannibal directive being ordered in occupied palestine from midday of 7 october 2023, which involved the illegal deaths of hundreds of israeli civilians by idf hands. claims of relaxation of targeting of palestinians at almost the same time and date, larded with many gory details, smothers other illegal actions from the distant start of the war.the government believes if the world hears in the nyt the brutal realities of palestinians murdered in their homes from 100 authoritative, but anonymous soldiers, they will think only palestinians were ever targeted.the israeli government does not want allies to realise their idf killed numerous israeli civilians claimed as murdered by hamas. many israeli hostages being released in prisoner-exchanges confirmed, some in face-to-face meetings with netanyahu, that the idf tried to kill them from their first moments of capture by hamas, and throughout their long months of captivity. as more hostages return, these first-hand accounts will be heard again.as israel commences a new bombing campaign against palestinian cities in the west bank of occupied palestine, claiming them a “hotbed of islamic terrorism”, we know from the nyt report the methods they will be using.keith mitchelsonkeith mitchelson has a 40-year experience in academic and commercial biotechnology sectors in the uk, china, and australia.

hadi revisits ‘allah’ controversy, warns of misuse by non-muslims





hadi revisits ‘allah’ controversy, warns of misuse by non-muslimspas president tan sri abdul hadi awang stepped back into the ‘allah’ word controversy, this time saying ‘kafirs’ using the word in ‘mistranslations’ may mislead muslims.he explained that the word allah carries a profound and comprehensive meaning that cannot be accurately translated into other languages.he also explained that while non-muslims may use the term, their usage often does not align with its true meaning and misusing the word, particularly in religious contexts like bible translations, could mislead muslims and must be prohibited.hadi explained that the word allah cannot be translated into a single word in other languages because no term can convey its precise meaning.“there is no other language that can translate the word allah. it cannot be done. allah means god. but ‘god’ can refer to many things – idolaters appoint stones and other objects as their gods.“allah has no other deity. so how can it be translated? ‘god’? ‘hudaya’ in persian? what? it cannot be done – it does not fit. the word allah must remain,” he said.“the non-believers also say allah. but when they say it, their pronunciation is incorrect. it does not align with the true meaning. we cannot stop them, we cannot silence them. but the misuse of the word allah – that is not allowed,” he stressed.therefore, he emphasised that prohibiting the misuse of the word allah must be enforced to prevent confusion and the distortion of islamic beliefs.“that is why there is a prohibition – it cannot be used recklessly. if non-believers misuse it, we must oppose it. they use it to deceive, to mislead muslims.“they translate the word ‘god’ in the bible, in altered scriptures, as allah. the intention is to mislead muslims, especially malays – to make them think it is the same god, when in reality, it is a different appointed god, with other deities. that is wrong,” he added.“but we cannot completely prohibit non-believers from using it. what can we do? if they say it, they are wrong. if they say it, they sin; if we say allah, we are rewarded.***kt comments:i refer to hadi's comments: "... idolaters appoint stones ......... as their gods"there is an english saying: "people who live in a glass house should not throw stones."reflect on that, and i include jews as well.

problem with petronas is lack of disclosurep gunasegarampublished: feb 14, 2025 8:00 amupdated: 11:00 amcomment | despite the extensive reportage of its activities and segmental breakdown, the problem with the national oil corporation petroliam nasional bhd or petronas is its lack of disclosure in terms of its profits according to geographical location.without that disclosure, it is impossible to determine how badly it is doing internationally and where. under open competition, petronas is unlikely to be doing well in the international arena because it simply does not have the scale that oil majors such as shell, exxonmobil, and bp have.a multitude of ills, misfortunes, misreadings, and mistakes can be hidden from the public eye, making it impossible to determine which of its operations geographically are very profitable, which are less so, and which are making losses.its problem is not, or to be more precise, not yet sarawak and eventually sabah, which account for most of its malaysian petroleum and gas assets and profits. both states are angling for a bigger share of that pie. that’s a topic for another day.the government’s position remains that under the petroleum development act (pda) of 1974 which established petronas, all petroleum-based assets in the country are vested with petronas.any change to that will require an amendment to the pda. so far, there’s no sign it's being done.staff cutslast week, its president and ceo tengku muhammad taufik said petronas is looking to cut staff to ensure it can continuously contribute to nation-building. but really, he should explain what is causing petronas’ troubles first in clearer terms.“petronas is a national oil company but it has always operated as an international oil company. and our competitors have made such tough decisions as well,” he said at an editors’ briefing in kuala lumpur.he added that margins (after-tax profit as a percentage of revenue) were as high as 40-45 percent before but now they are as low as 20 percent. “the current margin projections could even go down to 16-18 percent,” he said.this is illustrated in the diagram obtained from a petronas announcement. it shows that petronas’ margins were at or below its peer group, which included bp, shell, and exxonmobil.however, petronas’ so-called peer group is not a good comparison because, in malaysia, petronas’ petroleum and gas assets are owned by it - the other so-called peers typically don’t own assets, they are contractors.thus, petronas’ malaysian margins should be as much as two or more times the peer groups. but they are not. why?international losses?the only possible explanation is that their international operations have very low margins and may even be making losses in some areas. this is not an outlandish assumption; it’s a fact that petronas lost billions in its canadian lng operations as explained in this series titled petronas in canadian conundrum by kinibiz nearly 10 years ago.sadly, the situation still prevails with insufficient information making analysis difficult. petronas needs to be more forthcoming with these if it wants to be a truly transparent and accountable organisation. right now, it is not.petronas’ international operations have expanded over the years since then-prime minister dr mahathir mohamad allowed it to go overseas under his grandiose plans from the eighties and nineties onwards.now, they are substantial, as indicated by petronas’ overseas capital expenditures or capex. (see chart from petronas below).international capex matched domestic capex, but we don't know exactly how much profit each is making - the revenue and profit breakdowns are not available publicly.their geographical breakdown only lists revenues according to customer locations, crucially not according to the areas which generate them - a clear attempt to fudge figures.need to be forthcomingso, until petronas is more forthcoming with their figures we need to guess as to how well they are doing overseas and domestically. our bet is on great domestic profits and poor international performance.petronas is the only fortune 500 malaysian company, ranked 167 in terms of revenue. in 2023, it made a net profit of rm80.7 billion, a fifth down from 2022’s rm101.6 billion. in the first half of last year, it made rm32.4 billion, down a fourth from the previous half’s figure of rm40.2 billion.it is yet to report its full-year results for 2024.since its inception, it has contributed rm1.5 trillion to government coffers, a huge figure. it is a major government company and it needs to be run well. for that, it must be more forthright, open and honest with its disclosures.otherwise, the public will rightly start asking questions. better to disclose everything now rather than be caught with its pants down later.p gunasegaram holds the chartered financial analyst designation issued by the cfa institute. he was previously head of equity research at brokerages in malaysia.

malay elites and malay politics





letter | malay elites and malay politicsi lourdesamypublished: feb 14, 2025 9:03 amupdated: 12:19 pmletter | recently, the proposal by the minister in the prime minister’s department (religious affairs) na’im mokhtar, to introduce a new set of guidelines for muslims participating in non-islamic events was rejected by the cabinet as “unnecessary”.of course, everyone knows it was because of a backlash from both non-malays and malays.while this is welcome, it is important to understand why this proposal was made in the first place. the proposal is worrying because it reflects a certain determination to control the minds, actions, and behaviours of malays in their daily interactions with non-malays in the country.in one sense, the proposal is surprising because it came from the madani government which is supposed to be a “unity government”. the proposal would not have contributed to national unity.on the contrary, it would have restricted interactions between malays and others in the country, which could be detrimental to national unity and national development. in fact, it would be a betrayal of the very foundations of the madani government.then, what is the rationale behind the proposal? it is not rocket science to see that it is a continuation of the old politics to cement the hegemony of malay-muslim political control over the country. this objective has characterised malaysian politics since 1969.two undercurrents have provided the motivational force for this direction in malay politics and political culture. one was the feeling of relative deprivation by malays that their country had been taken over by others, especially the chinese.chinese dominance in urban areas and business was visible. it reinforced malay discontent and fear of “losing” their country to immigrants.opportunity for self-enrichmentthe new economic policy (nep) of 1971 was primarily aimed by the malay-dominated bn government to take back the country for malays, although it was couched in the language of economic and social restructuring.this mindset has remained strong in malay politics and has dictated all government policies and programmes since 1969. there was some accommodation for non-malays but the goal was clear - malay dominance in politics, economics, commerce, and government administration.it was malay nationalism, a reaction to what was perceived as non-malay dominance in the country. the social contract theory was used to justify affirmative action in favour of malays.this malay-hegemony politics could have worked if there had been more restraint on its outreach and more accommodation to the non-malays. the nep was hijacked by malay elites who saw in it an opportunity for personal gain and self-enrichment.malays in positions of power in politics, government, business, ngos, and even religious organisations saw the opportunity to make money in the name of “malay-muslim rights”. it was no longer malay nationalism, but simple opportunism.this led to increased corruption, nepotism, and exploitation of national wealth for personal gains.keeping malay identity intactthis abuse of power in the name of malay rights by malay elites could only work as long as two conditions prevailed. one, the malays had to continue to believe in the need for affirmative action for them and that the non-malays were the cause for their economic and social backwardness second, the malay identity in terms of race and religion remained intact.any dilution in the identity would undermine affirmative action and hence the power of the malay elites. it was important and necessary that the malays remained as malays.hence the continuing reinforcement of the concepts of the malay race, islam, malay culture, and malay language.any signs of cracks in the malay identity, such as greater interactions with non-malays, greater personal freedoms, more open minds, and more open debate on religion and race were considered trigger points that could undermine the prevailing malay politics dominated by malay elites.hence, all such breaks in the malay identity had to be prevented. this has been the prevailing malay political strategy and culture since 1969.it was not nationalism or patriotism. it might have begun as malay nationalism but quickly degenerated into opportunism. the proposal made by the minister is a manifestation of this need to retain the malay identity.opening malay mindshowever, the reaction to the proposal from the malays shows clear cracks in the malay identity as one monolithic group. this development is inevitable.the malay ruling elites can’t use race and religion to keep the malays locked mentally and emotionally forever. there are forces at work that are opening the malay minds.the nep provided access to education and social mobility to many malays which gave them a certain level of security and confidence to question malay politics.urbanisation brought malays to cities and towns where they interacted more with non-malays and often worked side-by-side in organisations.the internet and social media exposed the malays to information that challenged the controlled narratives of governments and government agencies like the islamic development department (jakim).intellectual discourses by prominent malay leaders like mohammad tajuddin, siti kasim, mariam mokhtar, bakri musa, and others helped to check the skewed narratives of malay politics offered by governments and the malay elites, especially the narratives coming from pas, bersatu, and certain elements in umno.organisations like g25 and sisters in islam have offered more inclusive interpretations of islam in a plural society.the numerous court cases involving malay leaders in corruption and other crimes have contributed to undermining the credibility of malay leaders as champions of malay rights and islam.the royalty is also playing a critical role in defining a broader perspective of islam and malay hegemony.all these factors will inevitably make it more difficult for governments and agencies like jakim to operate as in the past.change may be slow, but it is inevitable. therein lies the hope for malaysia.

azalina didn’t verify abang jo’s comments on petros issue, says ex-s’wak ag





fmt: azalina didn’t verifyabang jo’s comments onpetros issue, says ex-s’wakagrex tan-15 feb 2025, 05:04 pmjc fong says there is no evidence the premier agreed to accept that the petroleum development act 1974 governs sarawak’s petroleum industry.11shares1280total views: 1,039former sarawak attorney-general jc fong spoke out against narratives that depict the state’s efforts to consolidate its oil and gas rights as attempts to undermine petronas.subang jaya: law and institutional reform minister azalina othman said has not verified her claim that sarawak premier abang johari openg agreed to accept the petroleum development act 1974 to govern the state’s petroleum industry, says former state attorney-general jc fong.he said azalina was not present at the meeting between abang johari and prime minister anwar ibrahim. this made her comments in parliament hearsay.“there is no evidence as to whether the premier had agreed that petroleum sarawak bhd (petros) can only distribute 6% of the gas. she was not at the meeting.“what she said in parliament is hearsay. she should have had the courtesy to refer to abang johari or the premier’s office to determine what he has agreed to,” he said during a forum titled “fifty shades of federalism” at the subang national golf club today.on feb 12, abang johari said there were still matters to be resolved between petronas and petros on the issue of oil and gas rights in sarawak.he said there were still some “grey areas” both parties must look into, but a resolution was in sight.“there is a sense of finality, but some grey areas remain due to misinformation.“in reality, the situation is clear, but misinformation has muddied the waters,” he said.the sarawak premier’s comments came after azalina said in parliament sarawak had accepted that the petroleum development act 1974, not state ordinances, dictates the operation of malaysia’s petroleum sector after a meeting was held between anwar and abang johari on jan 7.azalina said petronas accepted petros’s role as sarawak’s sole gas aggregator, excluding liquefied natural gas (lng).fong said sarawak was still engaging the federal government on this matter and the state “knows a way forward that would not hurt petronas”.he said sarawak held the rights to distribute oil and gas, as enshrined under two exemption orders signed under the malaysia agreement 1963 discussions during previous federal administrations.fong also spoke out against narratives that depicted sarawak’s efforts to consolidate its oil and gas rights as attempts to undermine petronas.“it’s not true. petronas is still in charge of manufacturing and exporting lng.“it is weird to say that a fortune 500 company would be getting into (big) trouble if they lost one business (deal) in sarawak.“all these narratives are not good for national integration and unity. sarawakians love malaysia and sarawak in equal measure,” he added.fong also said the gas produced in sarawak is not utilised sustainably, as 94% of it is exported to japan and korea.he said retaining natural gas for local use would facilitate the implementation of the sarawak gas roadmap.“we would use this gas to generate power and transmit electricity to peninsular malaysia, where gas reserves could be fully depleted by 2032,” he said.
