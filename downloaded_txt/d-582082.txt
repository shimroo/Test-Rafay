gratzi, gratzi 






i h0pe all of you out there in holiday land
 have not lost your tasty turkey dinners over the jessica simpson  and 
nick lachey breakup.  i know, i know; it's a tough day for us all.  but 
if we keep our heads about us, and refrain from asking "why?  why?" or 
claiming that we thought they were really and truly going to last 4ever 
because of creepy daddy simpson, well, that' s the main thing.now we're spared further nick and jessica inundation and holiday specials.and if that's not something to be thankful for, i don't know what is.i hope you and yours had a lovely day; i can now vouch for the tasty chat n chew cuisine, and hats off. -kd
