we recently had a great experience with delta air systems in replacing our old furnace and ac.
everything from start to finish was smooth and well done. tanya was very professional with providing and explaining various options and features. communicating with her was a pleasure, there was no pressure at all. she was open to answer any questions on the matter even on weekend days. the installation crew (liam b. and fabio) did an excellent job of removing the old furnace and ac and installing the new units. they were professional, friendly, and knowledgeable, providing information about the work done and helpful tips on taking care of the installed equipment. finally, tammy registered the equipment with the manufacturer and sent the invoice allowing a convenient option to pay in two installments. we highly recommend delta air systems to our friends, neighbors, and others.

the entire experience with delta was exceptional from the first contact with jordan wood to the installation. she was very prompt in setting up the initial appointment.  i had researched a couple of hvac installers in the area and found delta to have the best reviews online. i did talk to 6 installers in the area and delta had the best quotes.  jordon went over all the options with lennox and daikin. i was really impressed with her knowledge of the products offered and the government rebates. she also offered a lot of good tips on the union gas audit and recommended a auditor who did a great job of walking me through the audit.  she was very professional and even carried a portable printer which is better than the handwritten information most hvac vendors provide. subsequently all my questions got very prompt email responses and i was able to get an appointment a week after my audit. considering my air conditioner was broken, i really appreciate the quick turnaround. on installation day, jordon wood was around to make sure there was no issues and things were of to a good start.  the install was done by vince, matt and rob. they were done by the eod. they did a very clean job. he installers were great. they arrived early and took a lot of time at the end of the day to show me the whole installation, they kept us informed all the way and were very patient with all of our questions.  they registered at the manufacturer for warranty and the ieso rebates.  thanks to jordon, vince, rob, matt and every one at delta.definitely recommend this company!
