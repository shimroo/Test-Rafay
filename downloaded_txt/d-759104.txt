know your librarytake a moment to discover your library catalog



 
 


  
 


  
 




in past days, the library card catalog was that vintage piece of furniture with all the tiny drawers. library visitors flipped through the soft, well-worn cards inside to look up books by author, title, or subject.



 

  


   
 
 




things have changedthe online catalog may not have the same old-time allure, but it has charms of its own. everyone has found at least a few of them!you can tell whether a book is in the library or not, without going to the shelf.see what you currently have checked out and the due dates.request that items be held for you and delivered to the library branch of your choice.renew books online.



 
 


  
 




your library account can do more for youthese are some of the less known features. sign up for an alert when a new item arrives. you can be alerted about items on a subject that interests you, new titles by a favorite author, or a specific title you are hoping for.keep a private list to keep track of the books you have already read.create a list of items you want to read or watch. update the list online from anywhere, use it when you are here in the library.



 
 


  
 



the new look catalog offers you another view
   
 
 




same library, new look!we have two ways to see the library catalog. you can stay in the classic text-based catalog that lets you search authors, subjects, titles, keywords and more, or opt for the new look catalog. it lets you search, yet shows you our library in a more visual way.love seeing photos of book covers? try the new look.enjoy getting lists of bestsellers or reading ideas? try the new look.the new look also includes a few details about each author, awards lists, reading levels, and more.it's super-easy to add titles you find in the new look catalog to your 'want to read later' list.explorewe're happy to show you how to do any of these things on the catalog, or you can explore for yourself on the 'secrets of the online catalog' page.
