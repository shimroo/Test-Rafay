welcome to nurses housenurses house is a nurse-managed, nonprofit organization dedicated to helping registered nurses in need.














































founded as a respite home on long island for nurses…



nurses house provides short-term financial assistance to registered nurses who are unable to work due to illness or injury. as nurses dedicate their lives to caring for others, nurses house’ mission is to support nurses in their own time of need.




now, 100 years since its founding, our mission continues and is more important than ever.






















while registered nurses dedicate their lives to caring for others, many of them need help in their own lives with basic housing and healthcare costs. we have helped thousands of nurses recover and find stability in times of personal difficulty, and with your help our mission can continue.

our impact



“after my first cancer diagnosis, i continued to work. my second cancer diagnosis was caused by the treatment i received from my first. now, i am on disability and not only do i feel financially compromised but i miss working as a nurse so much. i am so humbled by the thought of nurses helping other nurses. thank you so much for nurses house. i am so grateful.”



“the kindness you have shown me by assisting me with my medical bills will never be forgotten. you are all angels who came into my life at my most vulnerable. the mission of your organization is a blessing to many nurses. your grants allow relief which allows more time for healing. thank you again for helping me during my lowest and most difficult time in my life.”



“i am profoundly grateful to nurses house for their unwavering support and dedication to nurses in need. they truly embody the spirit of compassion and generosity, and i wholeheartedly recommend their services to any nurse facing financial hardship after experiencing illness or injury. thank you, nurses house, for being a lifeline for nurses like me when we need it most.”
