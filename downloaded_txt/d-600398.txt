the incredible hulk cocktail





apparently, there is a cocktail named after me. thus, it's called the incredible hulk. it's main ingredients are: 2 oz. of hennessy cognac and 2 oz. of hpnotiq vodka. it's not the best drink in the world. obviously it's only made because of the fact that it is green and has an awesome name. and it's the strongest drink you'll ever taste. and then it will bash you! the dude in the video has to add pineapple juice to take off the edge of the alcohol. and then he put his skirt back on.

the incredible hulk movie of 2008





did you all see my new movie last year? they've made a couple of new ones about me in the past few years. i think they may have got it right this time. i can't believe edward norton is playing me, dr. bruce banner. my favorite movie last year was definitely iron man. i can't wait for the sequel. i heard that mickey rourke was going to be a bad guy in that film. he and i used to do coke together in the 80's. i mean, it's not like there was anything else to do. i kid, i kid. i wonder if the hulk sequel is in production.

hello.  kevin church here.  if you didn't know, i'm the guy who helps hulk write this diary and it's pretty obvious that old jade jaws isn't going to update any time in the foreseeable future.first of all, i'd like to apologize to the fans that (still) come back to check things for not making this post earlier.  i'd also like to thank them for their continued support of this silly little project.  i do notice that this site still gets hundreds of hits each day, and am very sorry that there's not been new content.i'm not ruling out the possibility that hulk may one day grab me by the shoulders and point me towards the keyboard, but it's looking unlikely at this time.in the meantime, you may want to check out my blog (where you can also find out about the comics i've written,) or the rack, a comic strip about a comics shop that i created and very frequently write.again, thank you for your support.  i'm removing the comments from this blog to avoid spammers, but you can reach me via email - kevin(dot)church(at)gmail(dot)com - if you'd like to comment or just say hi.

stupid marvel comics has given hulk's enemy modok (that stands for mechanical something something something kittens) his own internet diary blog website.hulk has found out that modok now lives in brooklyn which is where hulk lives.hulk thinks he has some smashing of stupid bigheaded modok to do.and then maybe hulk can get a sack of taquitos.

a lot of people talk to hulk, wanting to know how hulk about the comic books that marvel comics makes about hulk.  hulk thinks they are pretty ok most of the time, even if they have stupid stories like this stupid "mister fantastic and tony stark and nick fury shoot hulk into space and he comes back later and breaks a bunch of stuff" story that is happening soon, but hulk has to give special "props" to jeff parker because he writes stories that are good and not stupid.  if you see a comic that says "marvel adventures: the avengers" and it is written by jeff parker, you should buy it because he makes comics that are more like the world hulk knows and lives in, even if hulk would never be part of any team called "the avengers" that had stupid stinky wolverine on it.you can buy marvel adventures comic books with "the avengers" in itty bitty books that are small and reprint five or six stories and they are cheap like $10 so you should buy those.  here is a link for the first little book.  you should be able to find more at your local comic book store.  if you live in brooklyn like hulk does hulk recommends that you visit rocketship because it is a very good store that has comic books and you should ask alex or mary if you can not find them.the end(no, really: wolverine is smelly.  imagine a wet kitty-cat that's rolled around in something dead and you are part of the way there.)

this is a comic book that is coming out in a few months about the hulk and his friend franklin richards.  hulk really likes franklin richards a lot because he is a nice little boy and even though marvel comics shows that franklin richards's dad reed richards shot hulk into space because hulk was really bad, that did not really happen.  hulk is not in space and hulk liked reed richards and sue richards a lot and johnny flame a little bit and rock man not at all.the end!

there is a movie coming out about hulk's friends the fantastic four.it is the second movie they have made about them and even though stupid ben grimm is a stupid stupidhead that is stupid, hulk is happy to see his friends johnny torch and reed stretch on the big screen like they deserve.  hulk thinks there is something wrong with susan invisible, though, because the actress playing her looks like she is lost like a kitten in a gravy boat.here is the commercial.

hello hulk got this email and hulk is wondering if he should help because hulk needs some money and if hulk had some money maybe hulk wouldn't have to go look at the stupid jobs section of the new york post and daily bugle.   no, hulk does not want to work construction, thank you for asking.  hulk does not like to say things to girls that walk by and hulk can't whistle very well.with due respact   dear  friend,my tel number 00226 78 02 43 42it is my wish to solicite your assistance in a bussinesss transaction that will be of benefit to you and i.i came across sum of money belonging to a deceased customer of the bank, bank of africa, alhaji dahiru j musa, a citizen ofabidjan cote'd'ivoire who died on the recent crises in that country. the rebels in the city of boakery bombed alhaji musa'recidence during one of their raids.he and all the members of his family were killed in that bomb incident.alhaji musa is an international bussiness man and a major supplier of yamaha machine parts in this country.the money we are talking about is in the bank treasury box waiting for the next of kin because the deceased died since two years ago and living no other contact as in next of kin in his bank file and the bank law stipulates that any money that stays in the bank custody for over two years without withdrawal or payment will be conficicated into the bank private use.he has an account with this bank which he uses to finance his bussiness in this contry.this is my bank website in burkina faso.         www.bkofafrica.net)the said amount was usd$1m.(one million united states dollars).so right now that is the area i need your assistance to act as next of kin to the deceased man so as to inherite this fund for our own benefit  and i am here to guide u and to funish you with all the necessary information concerning the deceased man bank account.thanks and remain blessedi suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal.from mr musa  sobibra.    my alternative (musa_sobibra@myway.com)do you think hulk should take advantage of this offer?  hulk thinks hulk could make money and not have to live off the "stipend" that the avengers still pay hulk because they are afraid hulk will come over and raid the refrigerator and make jarvis cook a turkey for hulk again.hulk has never told you people how nice jarvis is.  jarvis is very nice.  he is the avengers' butler but he is not like "jeeves" because he does not have a website called askjarvis or anything like that but hulk thinks he is better because hulk doesn't have to type on the computer to ask jarvis things like "why do rainbows make hulk happy?" or "can you please make some more yorkshire pudding?"here is a picture of jarvis from a comic book about the avengers.the end.
