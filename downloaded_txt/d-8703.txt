tet is name for vietnamese lunar new year. the holiday has its own traditions, each year has zodiac animals (some are different – cat instead of rabbit),  lucky plants and flowers are apricot blossoms and kumquat trees, sticky rice cakes, chicken and candied fruits are special foods. delightfully illustrated!
