come join the smith official dna project at familytreedna with a dna 
	kit. or, did you do a ydna test with familytreedna but not part 
	of the smith official dna project on familytreedna? 
	
instructions on how to join here. or, if you tested dna 
	(autosomal) with a different vendor (ancestry, relative genetics, sorensen, etc), 
	you can do a 3rd party transfer to familytreedna (ydna) 
	(autosomal)) 
	. when you join the smith official dna project on familytreedna, the admins 
	are sent a message welcoming you to the project.  we also welcome all who have tested mtdna or family finder/autosomal by 
	having you list your tree (ydna groups are the baseline to compare other 's 
	trees). we hope those who are able will test ydna especially with the smith 
	surnames; the more people we have to compare against the better we can know 
	and sort out the ancestries and family lines. if you have not done dna yet,  
	you are invited to send in your tree to info@smithsworldwide.org.
