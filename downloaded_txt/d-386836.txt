          testimonials
        















by popular demand we invited michael to present at our annual offsite (which brings together the c ’suit from our 12 ipps representing a 10gw+ global portfolio), following on from a presentation he made three years prior. it did not disappoint, a great session with insightful views which both reflected on previous forecasts (which proved to be profoundly accurate) as well as evolving trends such as the hydrogen rush. michaels holistic, pragmatic and analytical approach combined with his engaging speaking style, makes for a great thought provoking session every time!




                  liam smith, director, actis                







michael gave a fascinating and informative keynote presentation at our company-wide strategy session. as we focus more of our business on green energy and infrastructure, michael was the perfect speaker to inspire the team, generate new ideas and expand our thinking around the energy transition. the session was very well received and we look forward to working with michael and his team again.

michael gave a very engaging and thought-provoking presentation, which led to a vibrant discussion. the board and management team of export credit norway really appreciated it. just what we asked for!






                  ivar slengesol, director strategy and business development, export credit norway                







if you didn’t get the chance to listen to michael’s speech when it started, i encourage you to look at it again. if you were here, have a look at it again. it’s one of the best speeches i have heard on this topic in a long long time.




                  anthony cox, deputy director, environment directorate, oecd                







michael was the perfect choice to moderate our inaugural sustainable finance forum. he kept all the interventions to the point, providing just the right amount of information-rich context, led a great panel on green finance and handled all the protocol around the launch of the abu dhabi sustainable finance declaration. i look forward to working with him again.




                  thomas hirschi, executive director, financial services regulatory authority, abu dhabi global market
