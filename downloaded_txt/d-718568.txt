kattis dolls









hi and 
    welcome to kattis dolls, one of the oldest sites on the internet dedicated 
    to mattel face sculpts, as there is where my doll collection once started. 
    the site has evolved from the early days, but the old site is still present 
    "behind" the new one. i added a whole new part for kelly and her friends as 
    kelly always will be one of my dolly loves and i am missing the li'l friends 
    site.  
    this site is intertwined with my  swedish blog (link below) and there will occasionally 
    be links to and from. 





kitty still is very much part of my doll world so she 
    is integrated into the logo :)

my dolls are not for sale. they 
are just show offs from my personal collection - otherwise noted. 
i still don't consider myself a 
know-it-all on these matters but i share what i think i know. 
i am still, after all these years the absolute queen of typo etc etc, so if you 
think there is something i need to change, 
please let me know here katti at kattisdolls.net
and keep your fingers crossed i will find the 
time to actually read it. 
you guys that know me (sort of) in private, also know i have a (just as private) 
facebook page.
