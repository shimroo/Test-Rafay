dumb resolution



i have a lot of experience setting objectives and targets. i do it for a living and i pretty well know how to put together a target, commitment or goal that actually spurs people to change what they do.it may surprise you, then, that i have made a dumb new year's resolution. it's dumb because it's not smart -- specific, measurable, achievable, realistic or time-bound.my resolution is: 'to enjoy going to the gym'.since coming back to the uk, i've been to the gym twice. both sessions have been good -- i think i enjoyed them. does that mean that i'm keeping my resolution?well, it's hard to say. it's hard to say because 'to enjoy' is pretty vague. what does it mean? i also don't know how to measure it. am i having more fun than i had last year? should i enjoy myself more tomorrow? what level of enjoyment should i have (whatever 'enjoyment' means) within three months? what about by new year's eve 2009? is it really possible to enjoy going to the gym or are those gym junkies deluded?speaking of new year's resolutions, i brought macadamia-centred chocolates back to the uk so that my workmates could have a taste of australia. would you be surprised if i told you that about a quarter of the people to whom i offered a chocolate declined because they were on some kind of new year's resolution diet?i was astonished. how can one resist chocolate-covered macadamias?but i shouldn't be surprised, really. after all, i too have been on an no-chocolate regime.back in september last year, having completed my one month chocolate ban, i reintroduced chocolate back into my diet. for a while, it was going well. i ate a bit of chocolate here and there. but then, my chocolate eating started to ramp up. one day, just as i was putting another piece of pointless-sweet-no-flavour chocolate in my mouth, i realisedthat i had reverted back to my former ways.so i made a new resolution and that time it was a smart resolution. i am only allowed to eat chocolate with greater than 70% cocoa content.specific? yes. i know exactly what i am allowed to eat, and not allowed to eat.measurable? yes. it's a pass/fail criterion that applies 100% of the time, although i have made exceptions for spectacular chocolate cakes on three occasions.achievable? yes. if coeliacs can avoid wheat products and vegans can avoid animal products, then resisting milk chocolate should be a piddle.realistic? yes. it's not like an indefinite ban on chocolate -- clearly, i would fail that resolution. with this goal, i'm allowed to have the yummiest and best chocolate but avoid the incidental stuff (e.g. team mates bringing in cakes and sweets). it's the incidental (accidental, non-deliberate, unplanned) chocolate eating that has increased since moving to london.time-bound? yes. the resolution was applied immediately and lasts forever.forever!

time for a change?



this is interesting: mi6, the uk's secret intelligence service is advertising for recruits via facebook.gone are the days where you are secretly tapped on the shoulder while studying at oxford or cambridge universities. now anyone posting their most personal details on social networking sites can work for mi6. (just kidding, i can't work for mi6 because i'm not a british citizen but isn't that the ultimate cover anyway.)i used to live ten minutes away from mi6 headquarters. i walked past it whenever i walked home from work. the building is bristling with cctv cameras. i am sure mi6 have lots of grainy black and white photos of me on file.mi6 headquarters in south london -- isn't it an ugly building? i think of it as a wedding cake.i used to also republish this blog and my photos on facebook. i really liked being able to bring my writing and photos to all my more passive and non-rss-cluey friends through facebook. reluctantly, though, i have now deleted almost all my original work due to this statement in facebook's terms of use:'by posting user content to any part of the site, you automatically grant, and you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant, to the company an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide licence (with the right to sublicence) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such user content for any purpose, commercial, advertising, or otherwise, on or in connection with the site or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such user content, and to grant and authorise sublicences of the foregoing. you may remove your user content from the site at any time.'i've thought about removing my work from facebook for a long time. it was a difficult decision -- i feel the risk of facebook using my work in a way i didn't like was low and the benefits of facebook delivering my work to friends were high.but... i found out i cared about these things more than i originally thought when a non-profit website used one of my photos without giving me credit. i was very upset, even in this case, where it is for a good cause. (they denied that it is my photo but i have proof.)sigh. oh well.

marigolds



for me, washing dishes is meditative. as i wash the dishes, i am also flushing away all my worries. also, dishwashing is exciting -- suds, water water water, clean! it's like magic.the day after moving into my cambridge home, my housemate di exclaimed, 'joan, you're so funny! what are the marigolds for?''marigolds?' what was she she was talking about?di pointed to the new yellow dishwashing gloves that i had just hung over the kitchen sink. 'that's what we call kitchen gloves in the us.'i had bought the gloves on my first trip to the supermarket. gloves are an important aid to my dishwashing habit.'why are they called marigolds?' i asked.'oh, i think it's a brand name,' di said.interesting. what was it about marigold gloves that had turned the brand into a generic noun? (*)the next time i was in the kitchen section of the store, i noticed the hanging rack of marigold kitchen gloves. i wanted to try them out but i hesitated. they were more than four times the cost of the basic brand of gloves i had bought (£1.25 compared to £0.30 a pair). could marigolds really be that special?i shrugged and picked out a small yellow pair to put in my shopping basket.i have now been buying marigolds for all my dishwashing needs for two years. they really are the best ever dishwashing gloves. lined with flocked cotton, marigolds feel so nice when i put them on. they also last a lot longer than the basic gloves.in conclusion, marigolds make dishwashing even more enjoyable.(*) other brands-turned-generic-nouns/verbs include:'gladwrap' for 'cling film' (australia)'hoover' for 'vacuum cleaner' (uk)'xerox' for 'photocopier' (usa)'kleenex' for 'tissue' (usa)'fedex' for 'courier' (usa)'ramen' for 'instant noodles' (usa)'tivo' for 'hard disk recorder' (usa... can someone confirm this?)'rollerblade' for the noun 'in line skates' (international?)'photoshop' for 'digital image editing' (international?)'powerpoint' for 'computer presentation slides' (international?)(defunct?) 'walkman' for 'portable casette player' (international)(emerging) 'google' for 'web search' (international?)goodness! of course i should have expected it -- people have written about this topic already. see wikipedia -- genericized trademark, and a slideshow on aol -- brand icons that made a 'name' for themselves (a bit us-centric but i didn't know jacuzzi was a name brand!).other suggestions welcome, especially for australia (i suspect 'esky' is one of these).and why does it seem that the us is prone to turning brand names into generic labels? this is also interesting -- examples from other languages and countries.

the 'indefensible' 5% target



since the carbon pollution reduction scheme white paper was released on monday, i have been perplexed.it had all been going so well. kevin rudd (my facebook friend) fulfilled my little heart's desires when he ratified the kyoto protocol. after seeing penny wong speak in london, i was so impressed that i adopted her as my hero.but now this -- the unconditional 5% by 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. five per cent? did i hear correctly?on the face of it, it seems so pitiful, so unambitious. i didn't understand! and until i understood kevin and penny's rationale, i would withold condemnation.today, i  read through the executive summary and selected chapters of the white paper.now i understand.before anyone protests or supports this scheme and its target, please, please take the time to read at least the executive summary to understand the key details. (in fact, i beseech you to do this for any issue on which you wish to express an opinion.)5% from what baseline?my first question was what the baseline year for the 5% reduction was. the kyoto protocol and european union policies (with which which i am most familiar) are based on 1990 emissions. so when the uk says it's aiming for a 26% reduction by 2020, it's compared to the 1990 baseline year.our 5% target is from a 2000 baseline year. after looking through our greenhouse inventory and the abs, it turns out that this is not much different to the 1990 year (although the australian government have argued that 2000 is a more challenging baseline).yearnet greenhouse gas emissions(tco2e)australian populationnet greenhouse gas emissions per capita(tco2e/capita)1990552 648 00017 million332000552 813 00019 million29tco2e -- tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. other greenhouse gases are converted into the same global warming impact as a tonne of carbon dioxide. for example, over 100 years, methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide so one tonne of methane is 25 tco2e.why our 5% is worth their 20%the government believes that a 5% cut by australia represents the same effort as the european union's 20% cut because of this key point: australia's population will grow by 45% between 1990 and 2020, while the eu's growth has flatlined during the same period. you can see how it is harder to stabilise (or reduce) emissions while your population grows. each additional person will produce additional emissions through his or her direct consumption (electricity, heat, food, goods) and employment activitiy.so the logic is that if nations a and b set the same target, and nation a's population doubles, then nation a has to work twice as hard as nation b to achieve the same absolute reduction in emissions.table e1 of the white paper executive summary compares australia's total and per capita reduction commitments with those of the eu, the uk and usa. i've reproduced it here.country2020 targets2020 per capita reduction2050 targetsaustralia5-15% below 2000 levels (4-14 per cent below 1990 levels)27-34% below 2000 levels (34-41% below 1990 levels)60% below 2000 levels (60% below 1990 levels)european union20-30% below 1990 levels24-34% below 1990 levels60-80% below 1990 levelsunited kingdom26% below 1990 levels33% below 1990 levels80% below 1990 levelsproposal   united states (proposal of president-elect obama)return to 1990 levels25% below 1990 levels80% below 1990 levels60% by 2050the white paper states that the government is still committed to reducing emissions by 60% by 2050 (presumably from the 2000 baseline). this is in line with the eu and, until recently, the uk (who just this month set itself an 80% target by 2050). i am not sure how the government expects to ramp up from 5% to 60% reduction over 30 years, and i will be looking at the strategy if/when it is released. however, i believe that getting the emissions trading scheme established is an important structural change to the economy. it could be the thin edge of a giant wedge of change.20% renewables by 2020i was worried that the 5% target would not be big enough to transform the energy market to support competitive renewables. although emissions trading is the government's main climate change mitiation measure, i am relieved that there is a separate target for renewable energy --- 20% of electricity supply by 2020. this isn't as ambitious as it could be but at least the commercialisation of renewable energy is recognised as a strategy to be specifically managed.credit where credit's duei wish to give credit where credit is due. when it is implemented, australia's carbon pollution reduction scheme (cprs) will the broadest in the world. below, i've compared it to the world's first scheme, the european union emissions trading scheme (eu ets). australia cprseu ets phase 1 (2005-2007)eu ets phase 2 (2008-2012)coverage of greenhouse gas emissions75%40%46%participating sectorsenergy activities, transport, leakages/losses, industrial processes, waste and forestry*energy activities, ferrous metal and mineral industries, pulp, paper and board activitiesas for phase 1, plus a number of new industries (e.g. aluminium and ammonia producers)greenhouse gases includedall six kyoto protocol gases -- carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, hydrofluorocarbons, and perfluorocarbonscarbon dioxidecarbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons* excludes agriculture and deforestation (17% and 10% of emissions in 2000, respectively)it is useful to note that the aim for phase 3 of the eu ets (post-2012) is to cover all greenhouse gases and all sectors, including aviation, maritime transport and forestry.in non-conclusionmy quick review of the white paper has led me to conclude that the government's proposal is defensible in terms of international standards for action on climate change.however, please note that i have made no comment on:the justness or effectiveness of relying on a (single) market-based approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions;the adequacy of the targets set by the eu, uk and us (to which australia claims parity); orthe reliability, desirability or controllability of the population projections that have led the government to its small absolute target.but i am relieved that there is a logical basis for the 5% target, which i can now explain to those people who are equally perplexed as i was.bibliographyaustralian bureau of statistics (2001), 'a century of population

messy in translation



i was enjoying yum cha at a chinese restaurant in bayswater, west london. yap said to me, 'do you know that word?' he pointed to this character.'luàn,' i read. i knew this word. my mum had always lamented at how luàn my bedroom was. 'it means messy.''ah,' yap nodded. he smiled. 'are you sure?' yes, i was sure, but then yap pointed to the small print underneath the character.oh. perhaps my mum had been more distressed about the state of my room than i thought.

home, year 2



at 2 am last tuesday, damjan and i flew into tullamarine airport. home! home, for the first time in over a year. perhaps annual trips home will be the normal pattern of things.previously, i had made a list of distinctively uk features. i am now seeing melbourne as if i am a newcomer, and here are some of my observations.as soon as i walked out of the airport, i smelled melbourne. melbourne smells like vegetation and rain. london never smells like that, even though it rains a lot and there a big parks about.despite my first week here being cloudy and rainy, when the sunlight appears it is as white and bright as i remembered.there is much less advertising in melbourne compared to london. it is refreshing to take public transport without being bombarded by ads. i love sitting in my suburban train to the city facing a shiny white wall. however, melbourne trams are as ad-heavy as london buses.only about one in ten people on the train are wearing headphones. in london, 90% of people use headphones! there are also relatively few people talking on their mobile phones. in the uk, more than half the people i see on public transport and walking on the street are on the phone (if they're not wearing headphones).it's easy to slip back into car use, both as a passenger and a driver. melbourne is so car friendly that car feels like the natural mode of transport. london is so car unfriendly that even short car commutes have made me feel ill and stressed.the kids from my high school look puny.

boots twin



i am a little freaked out after visiting boots today. there are really big posters of a mother and daughter hanging from the ceiling. the mother's face is obscured and the daughter is smiling into the camera. i had to look twice to confirm it but it's true -- the girl looks almost exactly like me!

making things clear



i was in the fifth floor kitchenette at work, watching dave fill up his plastic cup of water. when he finished he turned to me, expectant and uncertain. clearly, he sensed the 'i want to say something to you' vibe of my loitering.indeed, there was something i wanted to ask. i have spent the past year watching people fill up plastic cups of water in the kitchen. people would take a plastic cup, fill it, drink from it, then very conscientiously place it into the plastic recycling bin. meanwhile, two shelves of perfectly reusable ceramic mugs hovered above the filtered water tap.my company is full of environmentally friendly people, yet despite recurring requests, the stacked column of plastic cups continues to be replenished.i wanted to ask someone about this. today was my lucky day because dave is a nice englishman and probably wouldn't be offended.'dave,' i said. 'is there some reason you use a plastic cup instead of a mug? is it...' i paused, '...a cultural thing?'dave looked surprised, then lifted up his cup of water and gazed at it for five seconds.'i don't know,' he began. 'i guess i wouldn't drink water from a mug. i never thought about it.'so he thought about it. 'i think it is a cultural thing. i feel like i need to drink water from a clear cup.'now this was something that hadn't occurred to me! i had speculated to myself that there was something wrong with having a handle on the cup, or that mugs were too big for water.'oh! thank you for that,' i said.later, i tried to corroborate my findings with chris, another englishman.'i use a mug for water,' chris said. 'but i can see why others might not want to. i think it's because mugs are sometimes stained. when you have tea or coffee, then you don't mind because you can't see. but because water is transparent, the staining probably puts people off.'

        my complete profile




i am a sustainability consultant in a large engineering design company. i've just come from a great year of learning and thinking at cambridge university. before that, i worked in environmental management in my home town of melbourne, australia.i love dancing, especially hip hop, lindy hop (swing) and latin dancing.i bought my first digital slr in 2005 and am learning to live up to it. hopefully, you will see improvement in the photos i post.i like personality psychometrics, having dabbled in it for work. other things that make me happy are cooking, eating, public speaking and debating, washing dishes, putting groceries away after shopping, blowing out matches, and getting a bargain.i am less keen on jogging, cold calling, travelling, country music, and changes that cannot be reversed.one of the key defining moments in my life was when i got up and was the first person to dance at the dance social at year 7 camp.
