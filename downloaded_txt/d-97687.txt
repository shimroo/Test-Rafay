dark hand & lamplight



seeing a dark hand & lamplight show is enchanting. you are taken into a world that’s romantic and inspiring, slowly immersed in a thing part concert, and part pop-up book.toronto’s doug paisley sings stories with his guitar, while shary boyle paints and animates live artwork on an overhead projector. the combination creates an encompassing experience, tranquil and endearing. often tinged with sadness, and always very beautiful.you sit trying to predict the possible ways of manipulating her drawings through the projector. she’s thought of them all. transitions that falsify focus and depth to the flat images. ways to have her characters travel down long rivers and experience varying emotions. ghosts and birds even take flight over the audience as she moves the projector itself.it’s a performance from the start. they dress as pioneers, and enter by candlelight.  there are brief visual/musical interludes between longer pieces.  and the projections and soundtrack of each regardless of length, are choreographed to cue and sync together on beat and in tone. each song relates to each scene, but do not explain one another, and the viewer is left with their own impression of the whole.[mov] dark hand and lamplight – digging in the dirt

white rabbits - fort nightly



the last five weeks of my life have involved wandering through european cities finding the external fortresses and treasures reflecting the internal conflicts and answers that i was seeking to better understand.  it was no cliché renaissance dream of “finding oneself”, no much mocked after travelers lament, in actuality nothing more than a mere vacation from my self and that other anti-culture city life that my body left behind in the exotic basin of los angeles.in my tourist trap dodging and backpack sidestepping one of my multiple musical companions was the fantastically appropriate album fort nightly by the new york rockers the white rabbits.  the excessive percussion and danceable, swing step beats made fort nightly a reasonable soundtrack for my city spectrum meandering and instantaneously turned white rabbits into one of my new “go-to” bands of the moment.  there is some type of dirt ridden, dive bar, middle finger conglomeration going on here that sounds so much more wholesome than it’s described.  maybe its because they have put the piano so far up in the mix that it actually sounds like the white rabbits have slipped in through the back door of some decent establishment with their noise makers and guitars and enough confidence that they aren’t ever kicked out.  album opener “kid on my shoulder” has moments that could have found itself comfortably positioned anywhere in the first half of jeff buckley’s my sweetheart the drunk.  but besides those fleeting moments fort nightly contains a sound that is recognizably their own.  it’s just nice to have an album to care about again.[mp3] white rabbits – the plot | artist page | more mp3s | buy fort nightly |labels: white rabbits

the transmissions - burning the winner



los angeles can be a cold and lonely place for any resident, artist and professional alike; however, using the "power in numbers" approach, people have taken to forming clubs, hangouts and collectives.  the central second is a collective of bands out of silver lake and the surrounding pockets of la, including rc favs the happy hollows and the henry clay people.my biggest complaint with most "la" music is that no one takes any chances; however, the common thread running through the central second collective is having the confidence to create unique music. hearing the transmissions full length, burning the winner, helped me realize this thread of fearlessness.  burning the winner is full of slowly cooked songs, which rest on a foundation of discord and fragmented riffs.  every song on the album bypasses the 3 minute pop structure, allowing the listener to sink deeper into the world of the song.  in that sense (the approach to listening) it feels closer to a noise record. the transmissions show off their live energy in the second half of burning the winner, showcasing three songs not on the album proper. it proves to be a smart choice - one that will send a lot of people to their myspace page for some tour dates.  "head (live)" brings out the washington dc, fugazi sounds that are hinted at in the first half of the album.  hearing this grit and integrity, come out of a city famous for having neither characteristic, puts a smile on my face and makes my morning commute across town a little easier.[www] the transmissions - i'll run it| artist page | central second collective |

broken social scene presents: kevin drew – spirit if…



it’s interesting how kevin drew, the mastermind/co-founder/baby genius behind the broken social scene phenomena, is taking stock in the bss corporation by giving the brand name band a sponsorship role in the release of his new album.  it’s a pretty straightforward marketing ploy on drew’s part but it’s not an unjustifiable gesture. spirit if… plays under the same umbrella as its parent company but without much of the bravado and side stepping through genre and songwriting identities that the previous bss albums have done.  but there in lies the paradox with this whole spirit if… project where guest appearances come from many of those who frequent the amoeba like organism that is broken social scene.  is it another bss album that just got stamped with an ego trip of a title or is it truly a solo effort that the title somewhat suggests?  fortunately at the end of the day i’m not finding myself hitting my head against the curb as i try to make ends meet in the soundness of my little paradoxical observation.  i’m just stoked there are some new kick ass tunes to make me feel something.[mp3] kevin drew – back out on the...| official site | myspace | more mp3s | buy spirit if… |labels: broken social scene, kevin drew

akron/family – love is simple



my introduction to akron/family came from a fellow student as she shared the infectious haunts of “raising the sparks” through a single headphone speaker.  the post lecture hall listening party hardly did justice to the song that she was eager to title as “song of the year”.  but despite my less than appropriate listening environment, this situation proved a stepping stone for my conversion and imminent love affair with the tribal pop chorals of akron/family’s creative gems.on their new release, akron/family is found shifting to the sounds of a slightly different tune as they proclaim their new mantra in the appropriately titled love is simple.  the album is filled with love songs that incorporate lyrics that some have found to be a tad on the sappy but can easily be translated as a reflection of a mere fun, nonchalant side of the band that seems to be coming out more than on previous recordings.  the brilliant “ed is a portal” follows suit in the akron/family canon of tribal pop chaos with an open house choral arrangement and kitchen sink percussion that ends in a summation that makes a pretty steady trajectory toward camp elephant 6.  though love is simple is fairly complex in its arrangements it is a lighthearted ride through the typically depressing genre of love song sing alongs that conclusively triumphs in it the albums overall intentions.[mp3] akron/family - ed is a portal[mp3] akron/family - phenomena| official site | more mp3s | myspace | buy akron/family music |labels: akron family, akron/family

free blood @ cloud city



everyone is going to tell you: free blood’s the side project turned full time project of former !!! drummer, john pugh, and his friend, fashion designer madeleine davy. they’ll say they’re loud, and funky disco punk, and that they‘re from brooklyn.i’m going to tell you, that if you like out hud or lcd soundsystem, then free blood might be the best thing to happen to you all year. if you’ve had a hole you couldn’t fill since dfa 1979 retired, free blood might be your new favorite. it’s noisy and there’s lots of screaming and i wanted to hurt myself dancing from the tension of it first listen.the getty was thick through with fog for the last of their “fridays off the 405” of the year. lots of people were out and it was very beautiful, but as you’ll see in the video no one braved fill into the stage so it was tough to get the crowd dancing. i imagine the gettys a bit more cavernous than the basements and bars free blood’s been playing. that being said, judge for yourself. they’re not shy.[mov] free blood - quick and painfulplease excuse the sound quality. the poor mic on my little point n’ shoot.free blood have an ep out in the states next month, and say their album should release beginning of the new year.
