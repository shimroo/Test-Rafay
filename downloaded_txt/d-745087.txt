   customer reviews     
  
"we selected havelock pool to add a beautiful and functional pool to our yard. we were very impressed with their professionalism, attention to detail, expertise and total focus on client satisfaction! we are enjoying a pool that is state of the art in technology and comfortable for an extended swimming season in north carolina.""we interviewed many other vendors and selected havelock pool for their expertise and competitive pricing. at the beginning of this project, we did not know how important that expertise would be in installing the pool systems, coordinating the electrical, landscaping and water systems. havelock did it quickly, efficiently and took care to teach us how to make it work properly. they have been more than willing to come back, make adjustments, answer questions and advise us on how to get the best experience from our pool.""we would highly recommend them to anyone considering a pool- you will be extremely satisfied with havelock pool!"— edward & tina s., morehead city, nc

"my thanks to you for making a 16-year dream come true. as you can see from the photo, my pool is beautiful and i have already logged quite a few hours just enjoying my oasis. my literacy student came for a day of swimming and said that she thought she was "dreaming" as she bobbed around on a float.""i have only good things to say about your crew. chris delivered everything he promised, including transplanting the azalea bushes by hand! he did a splendid job in working out the logistics for the removal of the extra soil in my yard. after i contacted the emerald golf club to see if they could use it, chris arranged for it to be loaded onto their trailer. i understand it is now behind the 5th green. that was a win-win situation!""i put quite a lot of effort into interviewing other firms (even in greenville) and there was no question in my mind that havelock pools was the right choice. frankly, i took a little bit of information away from every firm i spoke with and it made me a much more informed client. the dolphin charms all my neighbors and was priceless when it came to cleaning up after a storm in which branches and plants landed in the water.""once i'd removed the big stuff, it just went to work tirelessly.""i am looking forward to many years of enjoying my dream. thanks again for making it come true."— diane s., new bern, nc

"in january of 2011, my wife and i started checking with area pool companies for different type pools and of course prices. after interviewing several pool companies, we decided to have "havelock pools" install our pool.""our decision to go with "havelock pools" was based on their sincere dedication to details, their desire to be sure we received exactly what we wanted and cost.""they started the job on the day it was scheduled to start, and as the project progressed, they kept me informed on each step of the project. they were also continually asking me, if i had any concerns, questions or comments they could address.""'havelock pools' did a great job with our pool. we are completely satisfied with their work and the professional way they handled the entire project.""if you are considering installing a pool, i highly recommend "havelock pools". it is a company that strives on honesty, integrity, and satisfying the customer, all at a reasonable price.""a satisfied client"— charlie b.
  





 
  
i am the property manager for shipwatch villas condominium inc. located at n. topsail beach. we have a 34 year old pool that had many crack in the surface and tiles. it had gotten where we were having to drain and repaint the pool yearly due to deterioration of the surface.we contracted with havelock pool and spa to refinish the pool. chris hamilton who was my contact was not only professional but extremely knowledgeable about pools. from the onset we were pleased with the speed, quality and manner of all employees we came in contact with.our end product is magnificent and all owners are pleased. not only did we receive service with the pool being refinished but chris came out and helped make sure our chemicals were on target and has followed up with us to make sure things were going smoothly.our homeowners association and i highly recommend havelock pool and spa and would welcome any inquiries you may have. if you would like to see our pool please give me a call and i will make arrangements for you to visit.once again i want to thank chris and his wonderful staff such a wonderful job.— patti s.
