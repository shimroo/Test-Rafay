“very humble and would recommend a good place to do business”
 
it was merely a phone call that i had left a message with the phone administrator to talk to technical sales rep. the rep that returned the call was very knowledgeable and very easy to talk with and ask questions. was very humble and would recommend a good place to do business.
 
cal and amanda h.

some of my favorite things about expert it are


always able to talk to someone on the phone.
having basically 2 account managers (rod and david) that are so involved in everything is so valuable, it has allowed me to voice my concerns, escalate items and audit quickly and efficiently.
expert it is willing to explore new ways of doing things/program capabilities to fit our needs.
always easy to talk to and willing to work with you to find solutions.
they solved problems in a few days that our last it company couldn’t solve in months.
competitive prices.
having an exceptional it business in our local central alberta community is invaluable.

“we couldn’t be happier”
 
we have been with expert it solutions for over 3 years. we struggled with previous it companies, so it was a wonderful change for us when we switched to expert it solution. we no longer deal with the daily frustrations of it challenges. they have a great team that is dependable, friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. we couldn’t be happier!
