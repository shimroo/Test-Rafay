a 
              note regarding the google ads: it's not my intent to make any money 
              off these web pages. i do it strictly for fun, as a hobby. the revenue 
              from the ads just about covers the cost of my web hosting service.




 

greetings 
	  halloweeners and welcome to my web pages. i've created these pages to 
	  present some original ideas and some variations on ideas presented by 
	  other haunters. i am neither an engineer nor artist, i just love creating 
	  props for halloween and am happy to share them. 
for 
        an extensive listing of halloween projects, be sure to visit mark butler's 
        monsterlist.  
        also, here’s a link to a directory of haunted houses, you type in 
        your location and it will show you all the 
        haunted houses, hayrides and haunted trails within 75 miles.
