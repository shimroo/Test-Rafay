vita excolatur



in an appropriately loose translation, the latin phrase "vita excolatur" means "the life well lived". it also moonlights as the title of a sex & sexuality magazine produced by students at the university of chicago. this publication includes adult content. in fact, that's pretty much the point.

reboot (for real)



after a successful reboot (thanks to jackie todd) in may 2010, vita is back (bitches!). we are currently working on our o-week issue, re-orientation. it should hit campus sometime third or fourth week, so keep your eyes and ears peeled. on that note, we are now looking for students who are interested in coming on as permanent staff, particularly those with web or layout design knowledge, though we also need editors, writers, photographers, and models alike. vita welcomes creative contributions of all kinds, whether you have an idea for a photographic spread or you're a fiction writer looking for a more erotic outlet. we are now accepting poetry, creative fiction and non-fiction, photography and other artwork, investigative reports, and any other ideas you may have. even if postering campus is the only time you can give, please contact us at vita.excolatur@gmail.com. it takes all sorts of people to make this publication a reality. so, bring it on! we'll be more than happy to oblige.

the o-issue



we are currently working on the upcoming issue of vita excolatur (the o-issue) and we realized something.  we need your help!we're assembling a map of campus and we need your anonymous stories of unusual and titillating locations for sexy times in hyde park. feel free to provide the full anecdote or amusing advice, or simply "the ledge on the university side of pick hall".we're also looking for sex/dating advice you'd like to impart to the incoming first years, or the upperclassmen who haven't gotten it yet. for example, "dinner at a campus dining hall and a movie at doc do not a real date make." which is, for the record, true.you can anonymously comment here, or send your thoughts to vita.excolatur at gmail.com
