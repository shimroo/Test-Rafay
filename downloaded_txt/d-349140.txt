welcome to the department of communication in the college of liberal and fine arts. we are the largest department in colfa, with over 800 students and 25 full-time faculty. at the undergraduate level, we specialize in communication studies with concentrations in public relations and health communication. a communication degree is an excellent way to gain strong workforce relevant skills such as multi-media writing, public speaking, critical thinking, analysis/problem solving, and teamwork.
in addition to our undergraduate degree in communication, we also offer an undergraduate degree in digital media influence. this degree is designed to appeal to digital content creators that want to sharpen their digital skills, learn to precisely target audiences with persuasive messaging, and become effective media influencers.
for prospective graduate students, we offer an expanding master’s program with over 40 active graduate students and enrollments growing annually. our graduate faculty specialize in a wide gamut of research areas such as:

digital communication

our students are involved with campus life through several registered student organizations led by our passionate communication faculty as their advisors including: prssa (public relations student society), aaf (american advertising federation), awc (association of women in communication), and story-tellers at utsa.
