we learn and work on treaty 7, treaty 6 and métis ancestral lands red deer polytechnic recognizes that our campus is situated on treaty 7 land, the traditional territory of the blackfoot, tsuut’ina and stoney nakoda peoples, and that the central alberta region we serve falls under treaty 6, traditional métis, cree and saulteaux territory. we honour the first peoples who have lived here since time immemorial, and we give thanks for the land where rdp sits. this is where we will strive to honour and transform our relationships with one another.
