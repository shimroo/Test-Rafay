our web site
gottfried and friedrike dickow pagel brought their large family to texas in 1850. as the family has grown, we have spread across america.

								this web site is meant to reestablish ties between far-flung cousins and to help them learn of our pagel family heritage. your contributions of family lore and photographs will greatly enhance our enjoyment of this site.
we hold an annual pagel family reunion. our 2024 reunion will be held on saturday, july 13th from 1 to 5 in la grange at the fayette public library meeting room. we would love for you to meet with us! e-mail family historian rox ann johnson to get more information or to add your name to our pagel reunion mailing list.	


many thanks to our cousin, clay maeckel, for providing space on his server for this web site!
