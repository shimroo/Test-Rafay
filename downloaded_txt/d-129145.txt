it all started in 1999

            
            what sets teammates for kids apart from other non-profits is the small/unique team of donors that have supported our work since 1999.  ever since day 1 of our foundation, 100% of the donations made to teammates have gone directly to help kids in the areas of health, education, and inner-city services.

100% of the money goes to the kids, it’s not the goal, it’s the rule!

“this is the most important thing i've ever done!” 
- garth brooks

 teammates for kids began in 1999 with the love and support of 67 major league baseball players who made a pledge to help kids.

since then, over 4,700 professional athletes from baseball, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, rodeo and racing have joined our team.
"once a teammate ... always a teammate"

100% of all money donated goes to the kids
 quite simply, teammates for kids exists to do everything we can to help kids. it’s that simple and that important! we accomplish our goals by partnering professional athletes, corporations, celebrities and now, for the first time, individuals from the private sector.

 because the foundation’s overhead expenses are privately funded, 100% of all money donated goes to the kids.
that’s not the goal ... it’s the rule!

a teammate since 2009, one of the leagueâ€™s best defenders is on his way to canton this summer.
a teammate since 2009, one of the leagueâ€™s best defenders is on his way to canton this summer.

to help build a championship-level defense to complement their already high-powered offense of the early 2000s, the indianapolis colts used their first-round pick (11th overall) in 2002 to choose defensive end dwight freeney.

for his career, freeney totaled 125.5 sacks, 148 quarterback hits and 128 tackles for loss. he was credited with 47 forced fumbles, a figure that is tied for fourth on the nflâ€™s all-time list, and twice forced three fumbles in a game.

freeney played 218 regular-season games over 16 nfl seasons, the first 11 with the colts.

he appeared in 22 postseason contests, including three afc championship games and two nfc championship games. he won a super bowl ring with the colts and played in two other super bowls. in the postseason, he totaled 11 sacks and 12 tackles for loss.

congratulations dwight â€¦ we are so proud that you are a teammate!

 
teammate hayward nfl man of year	  +
cam heyward was named the 2023 winner of the walter payton man of the year award at the nfl honors show in las vegas.
cam heyward was named the 2023 winner of the walter payton man of the year award at the nfl honors show in las vegas. 

a teammate since 2016 and possibly the best pittsburgh-born steeler of all time rightfully earned the nfl honor, which is presented annually to the player who makes the most impactful difference on-and-off the field.  in addition to being a teammate, he created the heyward house foundation, is active with upmc childrenâ€™s hospital, cafe momentum and his own craigâ€™s closet program, among others. 

heyward returned to his hometown when the steelers drafted him with the 31st overall pick in 2011, and heâ€™s been chosen as an all-pro defensive lineman four times, with three first-team nods. heyward also has been a team captain since 2015.

cam closed his acceptance speech, â€œi know i can carry this on i canâ€™t run as fast as walter, and i won't try, but iâ€™ll make sure i do my part.â€

we know you will and we are proud to call you our teammate!

 
mauer on his way to cooperstown	  +
teammate joe mauer earns first ballot entry into the hall of fame.
joe mauer, a teammate since 2006, was the first pick in the 2001 mlb draft.  a local (st. paul) high school hero he more than proved to the minnesota twins that he was the worthy no. 1 overall choice.  mauer won batting titles in 2006, 2008 and 2009, becoming the only catcher in history to lead his respective league in batting average on three separate occasions. voted american league mvp after a sensational 2009 season, mauer is one of six catchers ever with at least three gold gloves and three silver sluggers. unusually tall for his position at 6-foot-5, mauer batted .306 in a 15-year career spent entirely with the twins, accumulating 2,123 hits and 143 home runs.

he joined johnny bench and ivan rodriguez as the only catchers to be voted into the hall of fame in their first year of eligibility.

"i don't take this announcement lightly," said mauer, â€œi have the utmost respect for the hall of fame and the players that went ahead of me and have done great things â€¦ i can't wait to get there and show my kids some of the history of this game -- this beautiful game."

the voters got it right joe, we are proud to call you our teammate!
