exploring the world of the fiddle: a guide for aspiring musicians


					on october 21, 2024					by todd diaz					with					0 comments

the fiddle, an instrument deeply rooted in various musical traditions worldwide, is celebrated for its versatility and expressive sound. whether you’re drawn to the lively jigs of irish folk music, the soulful melodies of bluegrass, or the intricate rhythms of classical compositions, the fiddle offers an accessible yet richly rewarding musical journey. this article delves into the history, types, and key considerations for anyone interested in learning or purchasing a fiddle.
the fiddle vs. the violin: what’s the difference?
a common question among beginners is whether there’s a difference between a fiddle and a violin. technically, the two instruments are identical; both are string instruments with four strings, tuned in perfect fifths, and played with a bow. the distinction lies in the style of music played and the setup of the instrument.
in classical music, the instrument is typically referred to as a violin and is set up with a focus on precision and clarity. in contrast, in folk or traditional music, the same instrument is called a fiddle and may be set up with a flatter bridge, making it easier to play chords and fast passages often found in folk tunes. the term “fiddle” is more associated with informal, folk-based music, while “violin” is linked to the classical and orchestral world.
the rich history of the fiddle
the fiddle has a long and storied history that spans centuries and continents. its origins can be traced back to the medieval period when early string instruments such as the rebec and lira da braccio were popular in europe. these instruments eventually evolved into the modern violin in the 16th century in italy, thanks to master luthiers like andrea amati and antonio stradivari.
the fiddle became a staple in many cultural music traditions, from the celtic reels of ireland and scotland to the cajun music of louisiana, the appalachian old-time music of the united states, and the métis fiddle music of canada. its portability, relatively simple construction, and ability to produce both melody and rhythm made it a favorite among traveling musicians and settlers.
choosing the right fiddle
when searching for a fiddle, especially if you’re a beginner, several factors should guide your decision:

quality of sound: the sound quality of a fiddle can vary greatly depending on its construction and materials. high-quality fiddles are typically made from solid wood, such as spruce for the top and maple for the back, sides, and neck. these materials contribute to a rich, resonant sound.
budget: fiddles are available in a wide range of prices, from affordable student models to expensive, handcrafted instruments. for beginners, a decent quality fiddle can be found in the range of $200 to $500. as you advance, you may want to invest in a higher-end instrument.
playability: the setup of the fiddle is crucial for ease of play. this includes the height of the strings (action), the curvature of the bridge, and the responsiveness of the bow. it’s advisable to try out a fiddle before purchasing or consult with a teacher to ensure the instrument is comfortable to play.
aesthetic preferences: while the sound is paramount, the appearance of the fiddle may also be important to you. fiddles come in various finishes, from natural wood tones to more stylized varnishes. some musicians prefer the vintage look of older instruments, while others might be drawn to the pristine finish of a new fiddle.

learning to play the fiddle
learning to play the fiddle can be both challenging and rewarding. unlike some instruments, the fiddle requires precise finger placement and bowing technique to produce a pleasing sound. beginners often start by learning basic scales and simple tunes, gradually building up their skills.
many fiddle players learn by ear, especially in folk traditions where reading sheet music is less common. this method encourages the development of a good ear for music and improvisation skills. however, formal lessons can provide a solid foundation in technique and music theory, which can be beneficial in the long run.
where to buy a fiddle
fiddles can be purchased from various sources, including music stores, online retailers, and specialty shops. when buying a fiddle, especially for the first time, it’s often best to visit a music store where you can try out different instruments. experienced staff can provide valuable guidance and help you find a fiddle that suits your needs and budget.
online retailers like amazon, sweetwater, and fiddlershop also offer a wide range of fiddles, often with customer reviews and detailed descriptions that can aid in your decision-making process. if you’re considering a used instrument, platforms like ebay or reverb can be good options, but be sure to ask for detailed photos and information about the instrument’s condition.
conclusion
the fiddle is an instrument that transcends cultures and genres, offering a unique blend of melody, rhythm, and emotion. whether you’re drawn to its role in traditional folk music or its potential for classical and contemporary styles, learning to play the fiddle is a deeply rewarding experience. by choosing the right instrument and dedicating time to practice, you can master this versatile and timeless instrument.

button accordion tips for beginners


					on april 22, 2023					by todd diaz					with					0 comments
										- accordions, main 


those wanting to learn the button accordion should familiarize themselves with certain tips to make the most out of their practice sessions. these will enable them to get the most from their learning experience.
step one is selecting an instrument with enough keys for your level of skill and expertise, and finding an accordion instructor who can offer more specialized help.
1. don’t forget the bass buttons
one of the key aspects of learning accordion for novice players is remembering to press down on all five bass buttons at once. this is particularly essential when starting out on this instrument for the first time.
most accordions utilize what is commonly referred to as the stradella bass system or standard bass (sometimes abbreviated to “stradella bass”) which uses columns of buttons arranged in a circle of fifths on the left side of their instrument.
in this layout, the central c button is marked with a bump for easy identification by touch. just above it are an f and bb keys; further along comes an m.
as well as these bass buttons, accordions also feature so-called chord buttons constructed on the same root note of their bass row notes, creating major and minor triads, dominant seventh chords (minus their fifth note) and fully diminished 7th chords.
2. pay attention to your finger position
one of the key aspects of button accordion playing is being aware of your finger position. failing to position them correctly could prove costly when it comes to playing bass buttons effectively and creating the best possible sound.
not to forget is that the layout of the bass buttons on your accordion also plays an integral part in whether or not they will be easy for you to play, with some models featuring stepped bass button boards which make thumb placement simpler.
however, this can be uncomfortable as your thumb becomes constrained by the bass strap and may result in poor posture.
to avoid this scenario, it is wise to begin your accordion playing journey on the inside row of its bass board – this will give your hands a better idea of where they should go when playing on both the inner and outer button boards of an accordion bass board.
3. practice makes perfect
many have heard the saying that, “practice makes perfect.” it can serve as an encouragement for individuals to put in effort in something and strive to do their best.
as part of learning an accordion, it is crucial to familiarize yourself with all the different buttons on the instrument. each button can help produce various sounds and create melodies of its own.
learning how to play diatonic or chromatic button accordions requires becoming familiar with how different kinds of buttons affect the sound that you create.
diatonic button accordions consist of 2 or 3 rows of buttons tuned to specific keys, making this popular type of accordion suitable for playing a wide range of musical genres.
this system also makes chord-playing much simpler by eliminating the need to identify all of its constituent notes; an invaluable asset for beginners who might otherwise feel intimidated by having to figure out how to play multi-octave chords on a keyboard.
4. keep your fingers healthy
playing the accordion puts your fingers under extreme strain, so it makes sense to protect their health as much as possible. one effective strategy for doing so is limiting how much bellow pressure you apply to each button while at the same time moving your fingers quickly and efficiently.
to do so, it will be necessary to learn some essential techniques. first of all, find the appropriate hand position for each note – this will make playing much simpler and less demanding on your fingers.
pay special attention to the other button accordion for sale, particularly its bass buttons, which are especially vital for newcomers to the instrument. utilizing them correctly will allow you to play more notes consecutively – an essential skill for beginners – as well as keep your hands from cramping during long songs.
