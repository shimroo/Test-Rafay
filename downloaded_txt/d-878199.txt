arrow air dao - open source evtol aircraft community


homeaboutcommunityblogdocsdiscorddocslaunch daowelcome to arrowpoint to point travelfor everyonedecentralized & open sourcearrow is a decentralized community building vertical-takeoff and landing vehicles (vtols) along with the services and infrastructure that will revolutionize the way we transport people and goods.join our communityopen source air travelprogresswe're open source & community builtcheck out some of our progress belowvtol futureour visionarrow's vision of the futureusing the power of open source collaboration, we are working towards creating a more efficient, sustainable, and equitable transportation system that utilizes vtol aircraft and advanced software. our goal is to allow anyone to succeed by making our technology accessible to everyone.accessible & affordableair transportation should be a button away for everyone. we believe that building in public can help humanity achieve point to point travel and cargo much quicker than building in private.a shared globalrideshare networka network of vtol aircraft coordinated in a safe and efficient manner, facilitated by arrow's open standard rideshare and delivery protocol.open source hardwarewe are committed to making our vtol aircraft designs open source and welcoming passionate community members to contribute to projects that help us reach our goals. global infrastructure of vertiports & depotsarrow will provide open standards for infrastructure like vertiports and delivery depots to enable a global infrastructure that is cabable of bringing vtol technology anywhere.blockchain technology unlocks collaboration & incentivesblockchain technology allows the arrow dao to efficiently allocate $arrow tokens to any meaningful contributor.it's the future of borderless collaboration.decentralized &â shared ownershipdecentralization and aligning incentives allow us to bring all stakeholders together to create the future of air transportation. we believe that everyone can benefit from being a part of our transparent ecosystem.read arrow's visionfutureour visionhardwareopen source vtolhardware engineeringas software technology advances, we can do more and more of the engineering process without a physical presence. instead of machined prototypes and wind tunnels, we can use cad models and cfd testing. this type of virtual iteration will be expanding to almost the entire engineering stack over the next decade.manned aircraft: project featherspearhead, feather &â riserbatterieslightweight and powerfulavionicsopen source avionicsstructure &â aerodynamicsaerodynamics is the study of

complex logic. we're developing open source solutions.services docsarrow daowe're doing this differentlywhy arrow is differentarrow is bringing the engineering ethos of web3 to the hardware space. instead of closely guarding trade secrets, we'll be building entirely in public with all of our work open source. using this model, we will build a global community of people working towards our shared vision and have a larger "brain trust" than any company building in secret could have.open sourceopen source hardware means the design specifications, schematics, and other related material are freely accessible and modifiable.remote global talentwe're leveraging professionals and experts from all over the world who work remotely.rapid scalingopen source communities and organizations can quickly iterate on designs, source materials, or shift production scales.shared ownershipshared ownership fosters a sense of community, and can lead to diverse input and better products.decentralized ownershipblockchain technology allows us to easily reward contributors for their ideas. alignment of incentives is much easier now that we are able to establish a culture of rewarding valuable ideas with a token allocation.dentralized governancedecision-making authority is distributed across our community rather than being held by a central authority.read moreonline collaborationdiscordhow to join thearrow communitybuilding in public means that contributors don't need to be interviewed and hired before they can begin work. anyone is free to contribute towards our vision and will be judged on the merit of their work. follow the steps below to get started!1. join our discorddiscord is the main hub for our organizational coordination. we have various roles for people with different
