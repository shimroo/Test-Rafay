 tristan - appreciate your cover of the hotlinking issue at google. perhaps you should see what sen patrick leahy is saying about this also. i think more people need to support what leahy is doing.  as regards google, they do not respond to legal [email removed - click "add a comment" to view email] when you have serious copyright violation. in fact, they appear to support the link farms like  connect.in.com  and allow them to holink images. because they are notified by those having commercial relationships with adsense about the redirect issue and because the original content is stolen using their search engine, i believe they are liable. i can see google has done nothing about the multi-billion hotlinking industry since you posted in june, and that leahy has to subpoena google to attend anti-piracy hearings.

 thanks! currently i use a dslr camera (sony a700), but in the past i used other cameras (mostly dslr or bridge-type). i get inspired by lots of things i see that i feel are visually interesting.

 hi, i am a college student and have picked your photography as my inspirational artist's work. as i need info on you for my porject i was wondering if you could tell me what camera type you used for most of your images, and if it's not too personal why and how you were inspired? (the work i am looking at is your black and white train tracks and tunnels) thank you colette pettitt

 your photos are amazing. i'm glad i didn't see where that pink hair pic came from. if i had, you would have never left me a message on my blog and i might not have seen your site. these images are incredible. the diversity and the colors in them are outstanding. you are very talented! :)
