﻿zazu is spayed, current on vaccines, microchipped and negative for fiv/felvadoption fee: $120hmas reserves the right to deny any adoption for the best interest of the animal. in the event multiple applications are received, hmas adoption counselors and staff will choose the best fit for the animal. it is not first come first served.come meet her during our public adoption hours or privately by appt.tuesdays & thursdays 5-7pmsaturdays 1-5pmat 21918 180th street, hutchinson.to complete an application, follow the link below and email this to contact@heartofminnesota.org :https://www.heartofminnesota.org/how-to-adopt
