as you are designing your perfect kitchen there are a few things that you want to keep in mind.
 
coordinate – while counter-tops and flooring are pretty permanent fixtures in your home, you can use wall color to link your room to the rest of the house and to make it feel balanced. for example, if you have a granite counter-top, you can choose a color from the granite to use as your wall color, and select another color from the counter-top to use for your cabinets. even though you will have several colors splashed around the room, they will feel cohesive.
balance – use color to balance the look of your room. you can use your accent color sparingly throughout the room to create balance in your space.
