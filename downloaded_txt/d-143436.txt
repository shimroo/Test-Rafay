testimonial

		i jut received my ring from my family as a birthday gift. with 10 years 
		in the royal newfoundland constabulary i did not have any tangible 
		symbol of my service except my badge until now. this ring says it with 
		unstated dignity. to receive it from those you love is especially 
		satisfying. thank you for that.

		we are all members of the brotherhood, be safe.
