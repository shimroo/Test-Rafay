      celebrating over 50 years in business ​fraser optical opened in the spring of 1964 at the intersection of 13 mile and groesbeck. fraser optical moved what would ultimately become the main office to 14 mile and groesbeck, which is where it still resides today. the business remains 100% family owned, and grew from a single location to six locations around metro detroit. dr. anthony stefani passed his business to his three sons in the 1990s and finally retired. he lives a happy life in florida and michigan. the three sons (andy, mike and mark) continue to run the business successfully today.
