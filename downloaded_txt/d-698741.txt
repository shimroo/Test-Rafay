on modern flute
"also on last night's program was shun-san for solo flute, by kazuo fukushima, a japanese composer. robert billington played the short work, which combines an oriental style and sound in a western structural framework. the sometimes breathy, sometimes steely tones, the microtones, simultaneously sounded tones and a host of other effects were all well-played by billington." owen hardy, the courier-journal, louisville, ky
". . . i was quite impressed with the flutist, robert billington." john schuster-craig, the louisville times, louisville, ky
". . . hurry, ye happy shepherds, beautifully sung, and excellently accompanied by solo flute, played by robert billington." raymond barr, coral gables gazette, coral gables, fl
"conductor doris lang kosloff and players seemed to work well together, resulting in nice string articulation (with fine violins in cortigliani), sweet flute phrasing (in the workâs echoed themes) and well-modulated dynamics." robert carreras, operatoday.com.
"the playing included lustrous solo flute (robert billington) and harp (ana maria bolivar) playing in the overture." robert carreras, operatoday.com. 
âone bright spot was the fine playing of principal flute robert billington, who gave a warm and evocative account of the long entrâacte melody leading into act 3.â  david fleshler, south florida classical review.
âunder doris lang kosloffâs assured direction, the orchestra sounded remarkably secure and vibrant. robert billingtonâs silvery flute solos commanded attention.â  lawrence budman, south florida classical review.
 âopening with a taut and forceful overture, beverly coulter led a strongly contoured performance that never flagged. she drew some powerful and expressive playing from the ensemble. beautifully articulated solos from violin, horn, harp and, particularly, robert billingtonâs flute, brought arrietaâs colorful instrumental writing to the fore.â lawrence budman, south florida classical review.
âorciuolo drew much improved playing from the small orchestral forces. flutist robert billingtonâs pure tone and supple phrasing made the solo in the prelude to act iii a highlight of the evening.â  lawrence budman, soth florida classical review.
âthe strings were consistently strong and ana maria bolivarâs elegantly turned harp solo and robert billingtonâs reliable flute accompaniments to suitsâ solos took instrumental honors.â lawrence budman, south florida classical review.





on one-keyed traverso
"in a beautifully coordinated flute quartet in d major, op. 41, no. 1 by pleyel, the players fleshed out the music with natural inflections and tasteful nuances. from the start, the pleyel flowed like a lively conversation between four friends. . . the pleyel bloomed with billington's velvety soft sound." sharon mcdaniel, the palm beach post.
"...there was some very attractive work here, and the audience gave the camerata a warm reception. perhaps most notable was the playing of flutist robert billington, who offered pretty work in a sonata written by nicholas chedeville, a vivaldi contemporary who published the music under the more famous composerâs name. billington was also a fluid soloist in il gardellino, the d major flute concerto replete with bird song imitations that sounded much mellower than a modern performance thanks to the darker sound of the baroque flute." greg stepanich, south florida classical review.
ârobert billingtonâs lithe, agile baroque flute animated bendaâs sonata no.2 in g major, a melodically delightful soufflã©. the brilliance and energy of billingtonâs reading of the final allegro was particularly distinguished.â lawrence budmen, south florida classical review.
âthe program concluded with myslivicekâs lightweight trio in b-flat majorâ¦ billington, buckton, alamilla and paulson-thorp gave the score their best efforts, â¦ and the concluding menuetto was particularly lovely and elegant.â lawrence budmen,  south florida classical review.
