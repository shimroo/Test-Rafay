his holiness sri swami chandra swami





my beloved gurudev was born in bhuman shah village, montgomery district, which is now in punjab pakistan, march 5th 1930. his parents called him suraj prakash (sunlight). his mother was herself the daughter of a renown saint and his father was the general manager and power of attorney of the dera, or shrine of a famous udasin mystic, baba bhuman shah after which the village was also named. from his very childhood suraj prakash, who was to soon become swami chandra swami, udasin, loved babaji. he says he used to weep in his love for babaji. swamiji says, "....without him i do not have any independent existence at all", and, "i am the creation of babaji. i became what he made me." gurudev was a loveable, mischievious little boy, the apple of his mother`s eye! playing hooky from school to fish in the dera`s fish tank. until gurudev at the age of eleven years had a deep mystical experience looking into the eye of a fish he had caught. from that day he never ate meat again and ofcourse, gave up fishing forever! he loved brown sugar cakes and often was chased by his mother for keeping sticky balls of brown sugar under his pillow! he loved to listen to his mother`s daily reading the guru granth sahab (the wonderfully lyrical and devotional scripture written by guru nanak dev and his successors, including some poems of mystic saints). at the same time gurudev loved to sit in secluded places by himself. from his very childhood gurudev had many visions of saints, even with his open eyes. he was known for having clairvoyance and knowing future events even though he was too young to understand what was happening! even at ten, eleven years of age he was able to sit for hours in samadhi, beyond body consciousness. an interesting feature of his birth is that he did not open his eyes for one month and appeared even then to be enjoying a deep samadhi. but as a young man in school gurudev also enjoyed sports and won competitions at district and even state level in shot-put and long jump. he was captain of the volley ball team in college and was voted all round athletic champion in the college year book! this was a great boon for gurudev`s disciples many years later. gurudev often organized sports events in shot put and long jump and even two-day long badmonton competitions in the ashram. they were so much fun! gurudev is a wonderful badmonton player beating opponents much younger than himself! even as i write this an involuntary smile comes on my face as i remember gurudev`s teasing, cheering, conjoling and above all laughter throughout these ashram tournaments as gurudev mischieviously whispered magic mantras to the badmonton birdie as the on lookers and his opponents shouted "no cheating"!gurudev was also very sincere in his studies and his professors loved him. and he loved them! i was present when many years after gurudev had long left worldly studies his beloved chemistry professor called for him from his death bed. it was an unbelieveably moving experience to see the love between them as gurudev lovingly placed ganga water in prof. gupta`s mouth as he breathed his last (this is a customary practise of hindus at the time of death). i was also fortunate to be present when after nearly forty years gurudev visited his birth place and several of his high school professors gathered to meet him! they were so happy to see him, and he also was so moved to see them. but baba bhuman shah ji was always watching over his spiritual son and appeared in dreams to his family members and mentors advising them that gurudev was destined only for the spiritual path and no other. gurudev was initiated into the udasin order by the mahant (spiritual head)of the dera of baba bhuman shah ji where his father was the manager at the age of seventeen. five years later at the age of twenty two gurudev was intitiated as a full fledged monk, or sannyasin, by sri swami krishna dassji who was the mahant at the famous udasin math (shrine) sri chand chinar ashram in srinagar, kashmir. now swami chandra swami, gurudev gave away all his worldly possessions, including his sports trophies!, and took to the life of a spiritual sadhu. gurudev spent many many years living in secluded places in kashmir and hardwar. what a pleasure and privilege to hear hundreds of gurudev`s stories of the many experiences and adventures he had at those places! i might mention that one of the caves gurudev lived in for many years situated on the tawi river in jammu kashmir, was also occupied by sri mahavir hanumanji and swamiji had many experiences with hanuman and also several people actually witnessed hanuman there. this cave is still there and is also called hanuman gufa (cave) as well as chandra gufa (in honour of my gurudev).by the time i met gurudev in 1974 he was living in a small ashram near the ganges in hardwar and was keeping mauna (silence) for six months of the year. in 1989 gurudev sold this ashram and now lives in a very large beautiful ashram on the banks of the yamuna river near vikas nagar, uttranchal. he now abserves complete silence since the last 20 years or so. for a more detailed account of gurudev`s life and teachings please write his ashram for purchasing his book song of silence. address of the ashram: sadhana kendra ashram, village domet, p.o. ashok ashram, district dehradun, u.a., india
