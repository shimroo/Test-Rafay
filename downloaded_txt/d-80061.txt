sunshine has graced us on this weekend of winter celebration.
                warm weather and lack of snow kept most riders on the trails.
                off-trail conditions attributed to several injuries on what is
                known as "bullet proof" snow. 




record snowfall  reported at
                  alyeska resort 
over 283" of the most sought after commodity
                  in girdwood fell during december 2006. the previous record
                  was from january 2001 at 274".



just before christmas we recieved
            over 40" in 3 days. on top of a previous weeks accumulation. that
            makes for a lot of shoveling!

            alyeska
                  resort...was sold to john
                  byrne iii of utah, and cirque property l.c. dec. 1, 2006. marking
                  a new spark of positive energy to girdwood's morale. celebrated
              with a fireworks show from the north face. 
as a girdwoodian, i am optimistic
            that we will see some much anticipated improvements over the next
            few years. here are other
            links to newspaper stories regarding the purchase:
