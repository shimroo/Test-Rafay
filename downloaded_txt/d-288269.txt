annual economic impact











“hiring a veteran just makes good business sense. in today’s environment, we are way past just doing it because it is the right thing to do. it will improve your bottom line. veterans possess the skills and attributes you need. they are disciplined workers, who consistently display pride, leadership, responsibility, and professionalism in everything they do. they will understand the mission of their civilian employers and make it a priority to get them results – all while exemplifying a strong work ethic and a good sense of teamwork. statistically, they stay with a job longer and progress faster.”
