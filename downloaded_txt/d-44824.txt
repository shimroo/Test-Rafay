*attention*
pursuant to code of alabama (1975), §34-9-15 and alabama administrative code, r. 270-x-2-.07, all licenses and permits issued by the board of dental examiners of alabama shall expire october 1st of each year.  this is not a new statute or board rule.  the board voted to return to the original date provided for in our state law to ensure statutory compliance as an agency.
should you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please contact executive director w. blake strickland at (205) 985-7267, ext. 8, or by email at blake@dentalboard.org.
 
pursuant to code of ala. (1975) §34-9-15(c)(1), a license or permit that has not been renewed on/before january 1st of each year is automatically moved to a “suspended” status.  the term “suspended” in the context of an expired license/permit is not a disciplinary action but merely indicates the license/permit is inactive as a matter of law.
