gpax webinar invitation 

 

the bellicose foreign policy of the u.s. continues to fuel instability and war worldwide in misguided efforts to attain global hegemony. in europe, the mideast, and the pacific, u.s. covert and overt actions are undermining political stability and endangering peace. the webinar will explain how this process works, review the historic record, and address the dangers posed by continuation of covert and overt u.s. actions that harm other nations and threaten our own national security. 

webinar details: february 17, 2025 7:30 pm et, 6:30 ct, 5:30 mt, 4:30 pm ptyou must pre-register for the webinar here or click on the link below https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/ng2cjo_3sg2odcl4ojffmq 

panelists:matthew hoh has been a senior fellow with the center for international policy since 2010. in 2009, matthew resigned in protest from his post in afghanistan with the state department over the american escalation of the war. he advocates a foreign policy centered on diplomacy, human rights, and international cooperation, rather than militarism. he is a disabled veteran of the u.s. marine corps who served in iraq. butch ware is a lifelong activist and educator specializing in the history of empire, colonialism, genocide and revolution. he is an associate professor of history, black studies, and islamic studies at the university of california, santa barbara. butch has been working as a public intellectual, activist, artist, and organizer, supporting communities across the country and around the world to challenge imperialism, ethnic cleansing, and endless war, and to build sustainable, just, peaceful alternatives rooted in african, indigenous, and abrahamic traditions. butch was the vice-presidential nominee for the green party in 2024. daniel kovalik, a human rights lawyer and author, is a strong critic of u.s. interventionist foreign policies. he opposes regime change operations, economic sanctions, and military interventions, arguing that these tactics often violate international law and worsen conditions in affected countries. kovalik emphasizes the importance of respecting national sovereignty and addressing global issues like poverty and inequality through cooperation rather than coercion. dr. jill stein was the green party candidate for president in 2024, 2016, and 2012. jill advocates for cutting military spending, ending u.s. interventionist wars, and closing overseas military bases. she supports replacing militarism with diplomacy, promoting international cooperation, and respecting international law. her approach prioritizes addressing the root causes of conflict, such as poverty, climate change, and inequality, and redirecting resources toward global humanitarian aid and development.  the webinar moderators will be madelyn hoffman, a co-chair of gpax, and noura khouri of the green party of california. madelyn hoffman is an environmentalist and peace activist. madelyn served as the director of new jersey peace action from 2000 to 2018 and has been a prominent figure in the green party, running as their candidate for u.s. senate in 2018 and 2020, and for governor of new jersey in 1997 and 2021. noura khouri is a u.s. born palestinian human rights activist and community organizer based in oakland, california. over the past two decades, noura has dedicated herself to advocating for palestinian rights, serving as a campaign strategist and organizer. she has lived and worked in occupied palestine and egypt, gaining firsthand experience in the region’s complexities 





note:  the petition below (from amp) is to stop nj assembly bill a3558 from coming out of committee to the assembly floor. 

 

new jersey zionists are pushing a3558, a dangerous bill that adopts the flawed ihra definition of antisemitism to suppress our activism for palestine. this bill aims to silence us and prevent the truth from being heard, but we won’t let them succeed! 

take action now! use the action tool via the button below, to email the nj assembly leadership and bill sponsors to oppose a3558. let them know we will not back down—we are committed to defending our constitutional right to organize and advocate for palestinian rights! 

say no to ihra in new jersey!

attention:  join the green party in signing on to the free speech petition put forward by fight back better and let the nj legislature know that the infringement on free speech that is being proposed is unacceptable.there are a pair of laws being promoted in the nj senate (s1292, s2937)  and a corresponding version of one of the laws in the nj assembly (a3558) . one proposed law set (s1292 / a3558) would impose the “ihra” fictitious definition of anti-semitism which falsely identifies criticism of israel as “antisemitism” as nj state’s legally accepted definition of antisemitism.the other proposed law s2937  – which currently only has a nj senate version provides the enforcement mechanism. it calls for the removal of nj state funding from any school, library, college, local town, non-profit or any other recipient if found to be lacking strict adherence to enforcing the false conflation of criticism of israel as antisemitism.

our state legislature is at it again! 

first it was the “gutting” of the opra law, now they want to keep 3rd party and independent candidates off the ballot by increasing the number of signatures required on candidate petitions.  the assembly bill has already passed, and on tuesday, 1/14/2025 the state senate skipped voting on the same, as amendments are being made.  please sign the petition below.  we will keep you up to date as to the status of the senate bill.  we will fight this affront to democracy!

!!! gpnj bylaw changes for review prior to the may 4th, 2024 state convention !!! 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

  proposed changes to 2021 green party of new jersey bylawssubmitted april 2nd 2024     the following are proposals for changes to the current 2021 green party of new jersey bylaws for consideration by greens at the 2024 annual convention. section 5 – executive committeeoriginal 2019 section:section 5 — executive committee section 5.1 – composition 

2021 amendment: split c & d leaving c as is and altering d to be a 1 year break instead of 2 years. current bylaws were not updated correctly in 2021, as shown in italics above.  this bylaw will be restored, applying above amendments. 
2024 proposed bylaw change #1: sect. 5.1 (c) should be altered and worded as below (changes in italics):(c) an officer may serve on the executive committee for two (2) full terms in the same office, after which a period of one year must intervene before the person may again hold that office. an exception is made for the office of treasurer. if there are no nominees for a vital position, an existing officer can be reinstated in that position with a consensus vote (100%) of attendees at the annual state convention, for a term of 1 year.justification:with regard to sect. 5.1 (c), it is submitted that while such provisions encouraging wider participation in important positions are laudable, for smaller organizations they can and do conflict with efficient operation. if an executive officer is not performing to standards, the annual election should provide for adequate accountability as well as adequate democracy. leaving a vital position vacant would hinder the ability of the party to continue in its functions. 

current section 5.2section 5.2 — co-chairs 

the three co-chairs of the party shall rotate presiding at meetings of the party and of the executive committee; issue a call for a special convention or a special meeting of the executive committee or the new jersey green council when deemed necessary; and perform such other duties as may be assigned by the party or the executive committee. the three co-chairs of the party shall decide together which of them will be members of which committees, based on each co-chair’s skills. all standing committees must have at least one of the party co-chairs as a member. the three co-chairs of the party shall be responsible for promoting those issues primarily concerning traditionally disenfranchised groups, and for recruiting for positions of leadership in the party from among those sectors.2024 proposed bylaw change #2:delete third paragraph in bold.justification:while laudable, stylistically the green council should delete  the last paragraph of sect. 5.2, given the purpose of bylaws as rules and procedures, as opposed to substantive policies which are listed in the platform and the pillars and values in these bylaws. 

2024 proposed bylaw change #3:change item (b) of section 6.5 to read:the new jersey green council is required to meet two (2) times each month, with the scheduled days at the discretion of the co-chairs. a simple majority of the new jersey green council members shall constitute a quorum. justification:though much can be accomplished via electronic means (emails, chats, etc.), live (via zoom or in person) interaction creates better communication and speeds the ability for all parties to understand an issue. at times the discussion process is elongated when done strictly via electronic means.  meeting twice a month for an hour to an hour and a half meeting does not create a burden that would affect any green council member from being able to uphold their responsibilities elsewhere.
