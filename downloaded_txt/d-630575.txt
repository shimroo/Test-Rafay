“every legend has a basis of truth.”-carl denham






























































































in 1932 merian c. cooper’s colossal creation, king kong, was first revealed to the world. the story of kong, his prehistoric skull island home, and his iconic battle atop the empire state building immediately stamped themselves into the world’s collective consciousness. questions inevitably arose: how could such fantastic mysteries still exist? we have the answers.welcome to king kong of skull island!





































the origins of the kong mythos



ever since king kong stomped his way into the world’s consciousness questions have been asked. what is the history of king kong and his skull island home? artist/author, joe devito, recorded his findings and discoveries about king kong and skull island in two original stories, skull island and the history of skull island. these stories have since been novelized and expanded into several books. these make up king kong of skull island, which reveals the details surrounding the earliest beginnings of the kongs, the human civilization that lived on skull island, the building of the wall, events leading to the arrival of carl denham and the capture of king kong, and the aftermath of kong's tragic fall from atop the empire state building. king kong of skull island is the first fully comprehensive king kong origin story and the only such prequel/sequel created in partnership with the estate of kong’s creator, merian c. cooper.
