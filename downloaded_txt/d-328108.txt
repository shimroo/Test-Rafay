our exceptional breakfast 



is an event, an occasion 



our breakfast is often described as ‘exceptional’ and is well worth getting up for. served between 7am-10am each morning. our menu is full of fresh and wholesome ingredients, bursting with flavours that will satisfy even the most discerning taste buds.we are firm believers in slow food so we take great care and pride in making, baking and cooking everything ourselves from scratch each day. as a family, we are passionate about the quality of food we consume and only use the very best, locally-sourced food in our kitchen.

absolutely beautiful hotel	
"we stayed in a suite, and it was the nicest room we’ve ever seen. the room decor was stunning, down the the finest detail. the staff were so helpful and friendly. the breakfast was delicious, and even the presentation was out of this world. the location was great, walking distance to everything. would love to go back, and would highly recommend."
