welcome jenny hamilton, who has joined the doudna lab as a postdoc!


congratulations to postdoc fuguo jiang who was honored with the rna society/scaringe award, an award that was established to recognize the achievement of young scientists engaged in rna research and to encourage them to pursue a career in the field of rna. fuguo was recognized for making great strides towards understanding the crispr-cas9 genome editing complex, working alongside his colleagues in the doudna lab. he has combined x-ray crystallographic data and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy approaches to describe the mechanism of dna target recognition and key structural states of the type ii crispr-cas9 family. these proteins are powerful tools from genome editing in a wide variety of organisms.
