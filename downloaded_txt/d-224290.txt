providing tanning salon owners and operators valuable training and certification
ntti’s objective is to provide the indoor tanning industry with 
        valuable, affordable and convenient training for tanning salon owners 
        and operators. our mission of education is simple— to improve 
        the professionalism and reputation of the indoor tanning industry. formal 
        training teaches salon personnel how to recommend proper exposure times 
        for each tanner and it also helps them to understand the technical aspects 
    of indoor tanning. ntti is recognized in all 50 states. louisiana requires in-classroom training for ntti's basic tanning certification. 





online training
certification is only a click away
salon owners and staff have the ability to become certified 
        online, on their own time schedules.
professional expertise gained through ntti’s 
        online programs has helped to increase tanning consumer 
        confidence with the most up-to-date information available 
        in the industry.
the ntti online learning center makes learning more 
        accessible because it removes the physical boundaries 
        of the classroom, reduces class scheduling restraints 
        and offers easy access to industry training via any 
        online computer. it is especially appealing to those 
        salon operators who, for some reason, cannot attend 
        regional distributor trainings or trade expos. the following 
        highlights ntti’s lineup of online courses.




basic tanning certification


the basic certification course is designed 
              for owners and operators and covers a range of 
              topics including: skin anatomy and function; understanding 
              ultraviolet light; the tanning process; determining 
              an exposure schedule; eye protection; and state 
              and federal regulations.
ntti certification is recognized in all 50 states. louisiana requires in-classroom training. 





salon operations and procedures course


managing and operating an indoor tanning salon 
              is not a simple task. although the daily procedures 
              may seem like second nature to the experienced professional, 
              the novice salon operator may find them overwhelming. 
              this program provides the operational procedures 
              salon owners must use and understand in daily operations. 
              although some details may vary slightly depending 
              upon location and business goals, the program offers 
              solid steps to use as effective guidelines.






lotions and skincare course


the lotions and skincare course highlights 
              the importance of quality skincare and clears 
              up misconceptions about the most common ingredients 
              found in indoor tanning lotions. the course includes 
              merchandising and display tips, as well as a section 
              on salon necessities needed to keep a tanning 
              salon one step ahead of the competition.
one of a salon’s best resources for specific 
              product training is from the distributor or manufacturer 
              of the products the salon carries, so take advantage 
              of their programs. this course provides salon 
              operators with an online option to reinforce product 
              knowledge.






introduction to sunless tanning


ntti also offers an online certification course 
              for the rapidly growing sunless segment of indoor 
              tanning. for the past five years, sunless is one 
              of the fastest-growing segments of the indoor 
              tanning industry. in fact, looking fit's® 
              top 250 statistics reveal that 40 percent of salons 
              offer at least one sunless stand-up booth and 
              22 percent offer sunless airbrush or hvlp turbine 
              services.
the sunless process and products course covers 
              the basics about sunless tanning and is designed 
              to help salon employees address customer needs 
              and promote another increasingly popular service 
              for the tanning industry.






sunless airbrush technician course


this course is designed specifically for the airbrush 
              or hvlp technician. based on research and tests 
              conducted by leading manufacturers of sunless spray 
              systems, this course takes the technician from setup 
              to application while discussing technique, safety, 
              pricing and more.
