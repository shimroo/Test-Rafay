it's the start of school again...





but, i'm not going. this time last year, i watched as my friends were mostly saying things like "can't wait to see you!" "2 weeks, roomie!" "when are you arriving on campus?" "let's meet up when we are back" and most of all "seniors baby!"  - it was sad to not be apart of that class as i had graduated already. i wasn't sad i had graduated, gotten married and moved on with life, but rather that it all came so quickly and that i wasn't a part of what was going on.over the next few weeks, things weren't so bad - i visited as people were now close again and i was happy to be just where i was, even if that was in daleville, indiana. landon and i had a lot of fun having cookouts, christmas parties, and all that goes along with it.this year is different. i knew fewer people returning to campus and more people who are out doing just what i am doing - working. it is completely different this year as i talk with those same people that last year were so excited about going back about searching for jobs and learning to be happy wherever life has taken us this far.that being said, i still miss college in many ways. today, i was running errands for work - buying boxes of paper, a hole punch, binder clips and moving boxes, and at office depot i saw 2 girls. they looked about 19. they were buying notebooks, paper, pens, and looked to be dressed up for the occasion - you know, "hey, let's go buy stuff for back to school!" and then a day was made of it. as i saw the things they were buying i had a sudden urge to buy all of it. i've done that for 15 years every fall, buy new school supplies. i secretly love it and it's one of my favorite things - like buying a trashy, flashy magazine. yes - in my mind, those things are just about equal excitement - it's very sad. instead, i continued with my purchases for work and went on my way. but it made me remember a few of my favorite college memories.1. sitting at my desk in swallow robin my sophmore year striving to write my paper on women in america. that feeling in my fingers and mind as i look at the keys and try to think of where to start.2. walking across campus on a sunny day being able to enjoy the outside. most of those days were in the summers and i could slowly walk to work or across campus and not worry about being late. or when i had time to sit outside sr and enjoy the grass, the breeze and all the goodness of the midwest.3. running to handy andy to buy breadsticks and hurry back to catch an episode of friends before having to get to class. i remember moving in in '04 and someone saying that handy andy was now circle k but it should still be called handy andy. i never called it circle k - even though that is it's name.4. stolls through the union to visit. those ladies were my friends and brought so much happiness to my day. but i really should change that - they are my friends. (and this includes angie too) i miss them and our talks often. i saw penny the other day and had a long time to catch up. i felt more alive after that than i have in a long while.5. walking onto my floor in swallow and feeling that it was mine. there's too much to say about sr, alexis, ashley, etc etc - too much to say.those are just a few of the many. this fall is definitely different than last fall, but i'm still the girl that loves the first day of school and getting ready for it. i'm kind of longing for a "first day" of school just so i can go shopping and buy new clothes and everything - too bad that i have to pay for it now.maybe i'll just buy a new notebook, a trashy flashy magazine and the new sharpie pens.

i don't really remember...





the last time i posted anything. something about organizing my house and i was supposed to post pictures. as you can see, i failed to do that. i have posted some pictures on my new website -meyersville.googlepages.com   that's pretty fun. lots of pictures - pretty much all that it is.i don't have too much to say, but i'm working a new job - and have some free time right about now and thought i would write something. my new job is in anderson - deflecto had to end my assignment and can do that pretty easily since i was only temporary. now, i have a 2 month position before moving to work with the battle creek revolution. things are coming together and i think we are doing alright. i'll let you know the details as they come together.so mom, phil, liz, nancy, and liz's friend eden are all in france right now. i wish i was there. it is such an amazing place and race and everything about the experience. i'm glad they are there though - i just hope that someday we can all go together. who knows if that will ever happen.other than that, it's just been working, summer evenings playing cards with friends, cookouts, lake (only a few weekends) and trying to pull things together before the end of the summer - which just so happens to be coming a little too fast.

re-organization





i'm planning some re-organization. my craft room needs updated. i know, i finally got it livable and made it a mess again. but i've found to source of the problem. there is too much furniture and not enough storage space.time to go to my mom's barn and see if i can beg to use some of the stuff out there - sounds pretty hard doesn't it? right. i'm hooping i can find just what i need. i have an idea - so i'm just hoping that it works.my plan is to call her when i get off work and see if i can go over to her house tonight (i was exhausted until about 6 minutes ago when i bought a mt dew...refreshed!) i want to get this project on a role by this weekend - quick, i know but i think it's doable.in other news, lz...lawyer...etc. meeting on friday. hoping to solve some things - but i don't have high hopes anymore. lz is just the problem. i don't remember a part of the past 12 months he hasn't been a part of in one way or another, maybe soon i'll be free from him again. eventually. hopefully.and finally, landon was going to have a tryout - but the league shut down the day before he was going to play. the whole thing shut down - closed for reorganization before the next season. right. no idea what that means. but instead we went to alabama - what seemed like a good choice only led to my car overheating and blowing the engine. great week huh?back to reality...but tim is going to fix my floor and bathroom soon!! yay! btw the tile we picked out (the aqua blue-ish one) matches and will work perfectly. i bought my new shower curtain and am quite excited! can't wait to see this in the end!

frustrated..and excited





i can't stand lz.i have a meeting with the lawyer tomorrow. i'm so tired of this entire issue and want it to be finished. we want the $$ owed and to be done. we had a blowup this weekend/last week about file sizes and issues. managed to kind of get it figured out and are back to just the basic issue. at least we have the pictures as far as we know.not sure entirely where to go from here. but i'm just plain sick of this.in other news....the great news....landon has a tryout on thursday for a hockey team in wooster, ohio. it is a one game tryout. we are going to be heading over there on either wed night or thurs morning. there is a pregame skate at 10 a.m. the coach told landon to be at. the game is at 7 p.m. that night. after that game he may or may not be signed for the rest of the season. but  either way, he is playing in a professional hockey game. he's real excited and so am i! at least there is something good this week =)can't wait to find out what happens.

things i hate about winter





i am usually not the first one to complain about the winter weather. i know that i live in indiana and it gets cold, snowy, ice covered, a bit windy and so forth. i also know that i should always have my gloves and hat on hand with a blanket and a shovel with a candle in the back of the car. because - you know - a candle can save you from freezing.now i have recently lost my 2 pairs of gloves...i should probably remember to look in the evening with the lights on rather than in the morning as i'm trying to leave for work in the dark with the lights off. so for now, i have giant playing in the snow gloves to wear - which i am keeping in the car in case of emergency - as a good indiana girl would do - but for using the key to my car, they are failing.as to my complaints...i just can't hold it in any longer. so...my list of things i hate about winter.it's cold. my hands get dried out my lips get chappedheat costs a lotthe sun goes down within an hour of me being home from workmy dogs get stuck inside all dayscrapping ice off cars - the worst is when it builds up while running errandsdirty car - salt from the roads and melted snow is the worst. it's coldi have to wear 5 layers just to keep warmi'm always coldi think you get my point. =)

2008 resolutions....even though i don't like making them....





what's the downside? it can never hurt to have some good old goals.2008eat breakfast (maybe even once in a while with lando)save money - we've already started doing this better, kind of. we are working towards it anyway. eat healthier and exercise (note i did not list this one first on purpose) - landon made me a workout and i've joined sparkpeople with mom and sisters. take weekend trips - something we really want to do, so why not?eat dinner at the table every now and then - a good idea, if i do say so myself.i do believe i have started off with some very good plans. we will see if they continue. it is decided though that mom, karen, liz and i do like sparkpeople and have found it to be interesting. i have my first trophy of spark points....probably a waste of time on that part, but as for keeping track - i like it.

laryingitis...or however you spell it.





yes i have that. my voice is gone. literally - gone. i can almost whisper, but that takes a lot of work. i called my boss today and said i'd be in around noon - she replied with "why?" i thought she was in an off mood and angry i was not going to be coming in....i responed with something like - "well by then i should be able to get there...." or something to which she interrupted me and said i shouldn't come in at all. i told her i would think about it and call her back later. she told me again to stay home and rest.i called her back about 11 - knowing there was no way for me to go in since i couldn't even say hello to someone who walked through the door. frustrated since i'm already taking off friday - now this makes for a 3 day week. but, i can't speak - and being a receptionist for a good part of the day - this is a good/important part of the job. at 11 when i talked to her she told me not to come in tomorrow unless i was better. i told her i wouldn't, she responded with "promise!" and i said okay i won't come in unless i'm better. so i'm going to be calling in tomorrow as well. this makes for a 2 day week - frustrating because i do not feel sick, but i know i can't do the job. i'm irritated because it makes for a 2 day week this week, 3 days the next, 4 days the next.....and i don't get holiday pay or sick days. ugh!oh well. luckily things are fine and lando is working this week. he told me not to worry and just take it easy. so - that is the plan. in the meantime i have gotten a lot of things around here done and it is good to have the break.i sure hope i can talk on wednesday. we bought some tea today and i have been drinking that and trying my hardest not to speak. if i happen to wake up cured in the morning i'll be back at work, but i doubt that. =/
