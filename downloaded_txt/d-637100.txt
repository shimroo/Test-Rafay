you said it when you said goodbye.
you said you'd anchor near.
you said i'd feel you in the wind, but all i feel is air.

i strained to catch the whispers, too.
i strained but couldn't hear.
i strained to find the signs you left behind, but they weren't clear.

you turned on life before you lived.
you turned our father gray.
you turned your back too fast, and through the cracks, you slipped away.

they drew you to the sugared rot.
they drew you in like prey.
they drew the death-laced line that took the life you lost that day.

we had a pact; you knew it well.
we had so little time.
we had an understanding shared, but now it's only mine.

you chose to never have a choice.
you chose to claim it's fine.
you chose to shoot the poison, smoke that death, and cross that line.

i tried with every breath i gave.
i tried to circulate.
i tried, denied, i cried– i would have died to change your fate.

you said it when you said goodbye.
you said you'd breach the gate.
you said that you would run like wind—i guess you’re running late.
