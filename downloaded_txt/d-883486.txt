body system





fit and slim has taken natural herbs (plants as food), combined them and formulated them in such a way that their potency is guaranteed. they use a process of such a high degree (called standardization), that ensures you are getting the highest quality of product available. then they make everything user friendly by identifying them as supplements for specific systems of the body: respiratory, cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; immune; metabolism; etc. how many of us know how to eat in such a way that makes our metabolism burn fat? 90% of all americans do not!.




circulatory system





anyone with concerns about varicose veins, blood pressure or cholesterol; difficulty with focusing their attention or poor memory; who has a high stress lifestyle, or doesn’t get enough exercise has need of a program that will strengthen the heart, improve circulation, build up the cell linings of the veins, improve collagen, increase metabolism, reduce stress levels, improve alertness and concentration, and increase stamina and endurance.


















energy & weight





7 out of 10 people are overweight, while 3 out of 10 are watching theirs. in 1983, weight-loss was a $16 billion industry. today, weight-loss is a $40-50 billion industry and “growing”. if the programs on the market were working, the industry should not have the tremendous growth that it has. how many of us know how to eat in such a way that makes our metabolism burn fat? 90% of all americans do not and that is one of the main reasons for weight problems. what is needed is a program that begins with cleansing the body’s systems. once the body is able to deal with healthy nutrition, the second stage is food supplementation that burns fat, suppresses the appetite, provides healthy energy along with vitamins and minerals, and also builds lean muscle mass and improves the metabolism and thyroid health. .




immune system





frequent illness can involve any of the following: infections, sore throats, headaches, colds, flu, sinus problems, allergies, cysts, tumors, growths, stress, weakness, etc. all of these are a product of a low immune system. and the more antibiotics we take, the more dependent we become on them and the weaker we become. our bodies are more than able to heal themselves in most cases; however, without the proper nutrients that promote self-healing, we have incredible concerns. to build up the immune system, we must first remove the toxins and poisons that are trapped in our colon, liver and kidneys. once we have “flushed” out the harmful properties, a program rich in vitamins and minerals that works to build up the heart and lungs, and all the other bodily functions will allow the body to heal and then maintain good health. .




intestine system





all of us have petted animals, gone barefoot, drunk from water fountains, shaken hands with others, and, obviously, breathe air and eat food. these are all ways by which parasites enter our bodies! because these parasites live and breed in our colon, we are all affected in various ways: frequent illness, body odor or bad breath, lowered immune system, difficulty digesting red meats and/or dairy products, depression/irritability, yeast/fungus problems, and slowed metabolism which leads to obesity. the following program will kill the parasites, cleanse the colon, provide the enzymes to digest food properly, and supply the vitamins and minerals to strengthen the body, allowing the intestinal system to run smoothly and without discomfort.
