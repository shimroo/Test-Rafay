i'm back.. possibly





something that isn't news is that i suck at maintaining a blog. i regularly have ideas about writing and then i don't follow through. i also regularly end sentences with prepositions. i'm a borderline terrible person.  in the last two years i've completed my master's program. i'm currently unemployed and am crashing with my parents. i'm also borderline a super lame person. 

during the last month of unemployment i've sent out a bunch of resumes and have caught up on a lot of television. now i'm moving on to on demand movies, because really, i have the time. i'm also adding a diy project because it seems like it is something i should probably do with my time. i refuse to say "do it yourself" out loud, though. i'm just painting the bathroom.

so here we go blogging. i seem to reach out to you in my time of need. thanks for being here for me even when i ignore you for years at a time. blog > me.

baby come back





i'm going to be writing here more regularly.  school is almost finished for the semester, a home stretch that has been bombarded (literally) with bomb threats.  i think we are almost up to 90 in almost 2 months.  crazy stuff.

my ability to procrastinate is so great, that i decided i need to blog again out of the blue. hello adhd.

i'm going to uganda next month for about two months.  i'm excited, and will be hopefully posting pictures and such here during my trip.

darfur






i went to see john prendergast this weekend. he is visiting pitt and showing a few of his films.  this one was 3 points and i'm going to see one about rape in the congo on monday. what uplifting topics!

the guy is an inspiration really. however, i can't help but think about his personal life. his hair and his friends brad pitt and george clooney make me suspect he is a playboy.  did i just say his hair? yep, i totally did.  on a professional level i wonder this as well.  has he had to give up certain personal relationships in order to live a life defending human rights? will i have to?

freeze






i took this picture this morning. one of braddock's multiple churches. so many churches in such a small place shows how once this community was bustling. the main thing that drew me to this church is that i have no idea if it is functional. for the most part, things in braddock are portrayed as crumbling which for the most part, they are. but there is a little niche here that i call frozen in time.  there are many buildings that don't seem broken, windows in tact, signs out in front, and if you were anywhere else you would just assume that they were businesses. only here, that means absolutely nothing.

this church has a sign in front about services on sunday mornings. maybe it is true, maybe there is a small congregation that attends weekly. there is also the possibility that no one has opened those front doors in 15 years.

won't you be my neighbor





yesterday i went to the library to find out how to go about getting a library card. it is a very historic place, but i didn't stay very long. when i was leaving, a group of kids came in. i would guess they were about 10, as their tornado-like entrance was not accompanied by an adult. 

they were coming in while i was approaching the door to leave. the last boy to come in with the group, sees me leaving, turns and walks back to open the door for me. 

"thanks, bud" i said.
"you're welcome." 
"you have a great day."
"thank you. you do, too." 

kelli brown always uses the expression "warms my heart," so i'm pretty sure i picked up the phrase from her. as i walked towards my car, my heart felt so warm. a simple quick gesture from this sweet little boy made my entire day. i thought about his family and what a good job they were doing raising him. i thought about his luck of the draw growing up in this town of shambles. i thought about what he would be like in a few years. would he keep this sweet demeanor or try to be more tough to fit in with his peers? braddock teeters on abandoned and amazing. there really are amazing things going on, and i hope that he is a part of it. the after school programs, the urban farms, the free things offered at the library. places like this need to succeed not for the people that have lived here forever as much as for the kids who have just started to.

la la la la





i love song covers.  i'm not really talking american idol per say,(there have been a few) or youtube sensations (although i do get a kick out of the occasional filippino group that loves jason mraz). i love when artists cover songs and not only sing them well, but change up the feel. or if the artist is of a different gender and makes the lyrics take on all new meaning. i have so many that i really do enjoy. i will spread them out though, as not to make one post kind ridiculously long.

my first selection is leona lewis singing snow patrol's run.



leona can pretty much sing anything and make it sound amazing. she transformed this melodramatic alternative-ish pop song into a power ballad. i'm not a huge fan of vibrato, but her choice for this song is unexpected and makes it sound almost haunting. she doesn't do a lot of crazy runs just because she can. beautiful.
