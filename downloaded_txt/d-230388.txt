welcome to birch bay, the nw’s premiere village by the sea
birch bay has been a featured vacation destination for over 100 years and has been named the most tax-friendly spot for retirees in the entire state of washington. featuring miles of pristine beaches, a vibrant small town feel, loads of water activities, and the most beautiful sunsets in the nw, it’s no wonder that people flock to birch bay both for vacation and to live permanently.
