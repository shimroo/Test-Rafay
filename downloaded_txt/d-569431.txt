a cd of amy fedel's favorite bedtime songs by her sister, her friends
            and her dad 
proceeds from sale of this cd will go to madd and other
            organizations and projects that help prevent kids from getting injured
            by drunk drivers. lisa, amy's sister, who was 5 at the time of the accident
            that took amy, spent 3 weeks in a coma, then spent over a year in rehab
            and recovery. she had to re-learn how to walk, talk and take care of            herself. a portion of the proceeds from the sale of this cd will also
            go to programs that help kids recover after surviving injuries from
            drunk drivers.
