hunter

hunter was an emergency rescue!  slsr received an urgent plea on march 22, 2023 to save a stray samoyed in kansas who was hit by a car.  he was picked up by animal control and brought to an er vet.  after the 5 day stray hold was up, slsr had to quickly jump into action or he was going to be euthanized that night due to his extensive injuries.  he is a sweet boy with a good prognosis and we took him into our rescue.  he came to us with multiple broken bones and severe internal injuries. after his multiple surgeries he was released into a medical foster home where he had to be confined to crate rest for about 8 weeks.  his foster parents cared for him in their home for the following several months until they became foster failures and adopted him in october, 2023.


simba

simba is a 7 year old male samoyed who came to us in august 2021 from canton, georgia. like many of the dogs that come into our care, we donât know anything about his prior owner or what his life was like.  he was found on the street and placed in cherokee county animal shelter. sadly, his owner never responded to repeated calls to retrieve him. luckily, a volunteer committed to finding simba a forever home took photos of simba and called several rescues finally reaching st. louis samoyed rescue.  our rescue immediately said yes to taking him in and transportation was arranged from canton, ga to nashville, tn where the mcnamee family picked him up and brought him to their home in st. louis.
the mcnamee family had recently lost their 14 year old scout who was also a st. louis samoyed rescue alumni, rescued in 2013. âit was perfect timing when we learned about simbaâ, said vicki mcnamee, secretary for the rescue. âit was a week before school started so we didnât hesitate to say yes to fostering simba.â he acclimated to the family and their routines very quickly. heâs sweet, talkative and a true samoyed male. every morning he goes into wake his human brother for school, jumps on the bed and gives him a big kiss. about three weeks into fostering, he was a foster fail, no one could imagine having to give him up. simba  was officially adopted in september 2021. from vicki, âiâm so grateful to have simba in our family. thanks to the woman who contacted our rescue, the shelter and wonderful transport volunteers for getting simba to us! he is a wonderful dog with a lot of life to live and love to give!â
simba enjoys sleeping in on the weekends,  cookie treats from treats unleashed and friday family movie night. we are looking forward to making many new memories with starting with his first easter egg hunt and a trip to south haven michigan. we hope he loves the beach!





scotty

scotty was pulled from a local animal shelter in missouri, where he was taken in as a stray.  scotty was approximately 8 months old when slsr took him in.  he was a wild child! no training and most likely pulled from his litter too young left scotty with a lack of manners!  scotty has improved by leaps and bounds with his foster family, including samoyed and berner foster sisters.  scotty's foster family is continuing to work on his training and hoping to get him started in agility soon!


willow

willow came to slsr with digestive problems, anxiety issues, and in desperate need of dental surgery.  willow had extensive periodontal disease and infections, which caused her to lose over 20 teeth.  once willow recovered from her dental surgeries, she was like a new dog!  willow now lives in her forever home with her family and samoyed sister, boo!





tasha

here is a pic of maddie sue, now tasha with slsr alum isis. maddie sue and her sister were released to a rescue.  maddie sue's rescue was having a tough time adopting her out because she had some anxiety issues.  slsr took in maddie sue and found her forever home with a family who had adopted another samoyed, isis, from slsr.  maddie sue, now tasha, is doing great in her new home with sister isis!


ana

ana, formerly coralina, came to slsr as just a pup who had ended up a shelter dragging her back leg. an amazing anonymous donor paid for anaâs leg amputation surgery after we received several vet recommendations that her leg was not able to be saved. her foster home helped her recover from her surgery. once again, our foster and ana were just the perfect match. 
anaâs dad says ana is doing great. ana doesnât know sheâs a  âtripawdâ! ana loves to go with her mom and dad on 3 to 5 mile walks.  after her walk, anaâs mom takes her for a ride, and her dad says he knows ana and her mom sometimes sneak off for a hamburger and usually a new toy!





mimi

mimi came into slsr from a central illinois shelter in the summer of 2018.  she got to ride with several samoyed rescuers on a transport over to slsr.  we were told by the shelter that her vision was not great, and she may have some eye issues.  we got her right into the vet and some eye specialists.  after lots of phone calls, board discussions, and vet opinions, we found out that mimi is blind in one eye and has a very, very limited amount of vision in her other eye, but she may be able to see shapes of some sort.  the vet staff fell in love with mimi (not surprisingly!) and one of the vets asked to foster her while she was in their care.  the next thing we knew, one of the vet techs asked to adopt mimi.  what a perfect pair! she takes mimi to work with her every day, so she is able to give mimi her eye medication, which is needed multiple times a day, and if mimi has any additional eye issues, she is in good hands! mimi lives with her black lab brother and her hooman in st. louis.


dominic

dominic came to saint louis samoyed rescue from a hoarding situation with over 170 samoyeds in iowa. for the first few years of his life he was kept in a barn, fighting for food and had almost no human interaction. the local humane society was working with the hoarder, taking 4 or 5 dogs at a time that the hoarder was willing to relinquish. a slsr member agreed to foster dominic and help him get used to life in a home. he was so dirty and matted that they had to cut mats off his neck just to get a collar on him for the ride home.  dominic was extremely unsocialized but luckily, he followed his foster sister cassie everywhere. she taught him how to potty outside, ride in a car, and go to grooming and most of all, to trust people. dominic is now a happy and healthy dog! he goes to doggy day care, is starting to open up to other people and has learned some commands. as often happens, he was a foster failure and is now a permanent member of his foster family with sisters cassie (samoyed) and marcie (chowmix). he is a beautiful boy and will continue to know love and understanding for the rest of his days.





lily

laska came to slsr a very anxious and scared sammie, which came out as aggression to certain other dogs. laska found the perfect foster home who was committed to working with her. laska and her foster mom and dad went thru several rounds of training sessions to help laska gain confidence, help her family understand her triggers, and help laska work thru her anxiety. laska graduated with flying colors, changed her name to lily, and lives with her foster, now forever family! her family says sheâs wonderful and they just love her!


hermie

hermie has been looking for his forever home for quite some time. a 4-year-old active samoyed, we know he had at least 3 homes before he came to us. hermie loved to play with other dogs and was wonderful in a crate but needed manners and leash training. he was exceptionally friendly, sweet, and smart! we knew we needed an experienced dog owner that could be the âalpha dogâ that hermie needed. along came tom from minnesota who had lost his wife and his samoyed in the last year. he had samoyeds for over thirty years and wanted a dog to take everywhere with him and play with his grown childrenâs huskies. hermie and tom hit it off immediately. hermie is loving life in minnesota where even in the winter, his dad leaves the window open for hermie in his bedroom, samoyeds love to sleep in the cold!!





sugar bear

two years ago i started fostering sugarbear from st. louis samoyed rescue.  the first couple of months were challenging as we got to know each other in.  this handsome boy has become a wonderful companion as we go on walks and enjoy retirement.


duke

duke, an 11 year old samoyed who came to st. louis samoyed rescue on may 7, 2022. he was found by local authorities as a stray in a rural area outside of kansas city. he was quickly identified by his former groomer in a photo she saw posted. apparently duke lived with two brothers, one who was tragically killed in a motorcycle accident. after several attempts to contact the owner by the authorities, his rescuer reached out to slsr for help. duke came to us with a large fatty tumor on his chest and a small tumor on his eye lid which were removed. in addition, his teeth were cleaned, nails trimmed, a full blood panel was done, he was given pain medication and all of his vaccinations are now up to date.

duke is currently in a foster home with an slsr board member. he is very sweet and grateful to her for taking him in. she said he is a loving, attentive addition to her life. duke knows she is smitten with him! he has quite a personality and loves to go shopping on the counters to see if there are any goodies his foster mom may have left. although he is very careful not to damage anything he does sometimes hit the jackpot.  some successful duke raids result in shared guilt; duke for getting caught and his foster mom for being outwitted by duke.
