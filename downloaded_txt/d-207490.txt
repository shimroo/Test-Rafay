private institutes
these private institutes offer dynamic and specialised training courses, but qualifications obtained from these providers are not accredited by asqa.







 

what’s the difference between tafes, rtos, universities and private institutes?

what is a tafe?
tafe stands for "technical and further education". these institutes deliver and assess nationally recognised vocational training (vet), and issue nationally recognised qualifications. tafes are government-run education institutes, and offer broad certifications in a wide range of qualification levels. 
tafes offer a range of government funded courses and partially subsidised courses, and are an ideal pathway to getting job-ready skills and experience. 
what is an rto?
rto stands for "registered training organisation". these are education providers who are not government-run, but have been registered with asqa to deliver nationally recognised vet qualifications — which means they have a tick of approval from the government. 
these government approved qualifications are called “accredited qualifications”, and they signal to employers that your training meets strict australian skills standards.
if you’re looking to study an accredited qualification, look for providers with this badge.
what is a private institute?
similar to rtos, private institutes are run by non-government organisations, but they aren’t registered with asqa to provide nationally-recognised training and education. some private institutes are registered with teqsa (an independent national quality assurance agency for higher education) while others are unregistered training providers. 
the qualifications offered by private institutes are not accredited by government bodies in australia. although, the training is dynamic and fast-paced to keep up with modern industries.
what is a university?
a university is a public or private institution of higher education and research. these institutes meet strict requirements as a self-accrediting institution through the tertiary education quality and standards agency (tesqa) in australia. 
the qualifications awarded by universities is an academic degree (bachelor, master or doctorate level) in your field of study. a degree can be internationally recognised by employers and can be requirements for some specific roles and fields.
