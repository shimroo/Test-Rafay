"50th anniversary live - third night" out now!
new single and video "i love the night" also released
 
today, blue öyster cult is celebrating the release of "50th anniversary live â third night" the final installment of the live album celebrating the band's 50th anniversary.
in september of 2022, blue öyster cult enthralled fans with a unique trilogy of sold-out shows, each dedicated to one of their first three albums. founding member albert bouchard made a special appearance on all three nights, adding a nostalgic touch to the historic milestone.
for nearly three hours each night, the band delivered a spellbinding set, weaving through the entirety of their now-classic initial trilogy of albums and treating fans to a mix of favorites, deep cuts, and classic hits. the atmosphere was electric, and frontiers music captured the magic, releasing each night as a special individual package.
this electrifying performance, which includes the bandâs third album "secret treaties" performed back-to-back, hits shelves today and promises to be a spectacular follow-up to the band's historic three-night stint at sony hall in nyc.
to help roll out the album's release, blue öyster cult shares a new live performance video for "i love the night."

blue ãyster cult's legacy spans over five decades, captivating fans with intelligent hard rock loaded with classic songs. hailing from long island, ny, the band is renowned in the hard rock and heavy metal scene for their pioneering work, earning both critical acclaim and commercial success.
cited as a major influence by acts like metallica, blue öyster cult boasts a timeless catalog, including iconic tracks like "(donât fear) the reaper,"
"godzilla" and "burnin' for you." the creative vision of the original core duo, donald âbuck dharmaâ roeser and eric bloom, is complemented by richie castellano, danny miranda, and jules radino, forming a powerhouse lineup.
as the band embraces its status as a "classic" phenomenon, they continue to create vibrant work, offering a refreshing alternative to mainstream trends. with a relentless touring schedule and the critically acclaimed album "the symbol remains" released in 2020, blue öyster cult remains an enduring force, ready to ignite the stage once again with the upcoming release of "50th anniversary live â third night" on frontiers music srl.

the release will be available as a cd/dvd, bluray, orange marble vinyl, black vinyl and a "plain" black vinyl/white label version, (akin to the look of test pressings). in addition to being available individually, three different bundles of these items are available to order at the frontiers store.

blue öyster cult's 
          "ghost stories" out now!
blue öyster cult's latest album has arrived

this is the link to order to buy or stream the new album: buy "ghost stories" as cd, lp or download/stream
watch the band's new video for "cherry"

"ghost stories" is a collection of reimagined and newly completed songs that date back to blue öyster cult's hit-making days of the late '70s and '80s. the tracks contain all original members, eric bloom, donald "buck dharma" roeser, allen lanier, joe bouchard and albert bouchard, (with one exception being a newer recording of the beatles "if i fell" from 2016).
the tracks were originally written in the period around the same time as the albums spectres/fire of unknown origin/revolution by night, but ended up unfinished and left behind.
with newer software that is able to "demix" these pre-production tracks, producers richie castellano and steve schenck were able to separate the mixed pre-production demos, and then record new tracks in order to complete the songs. for example, joe bouchard submitted a new lead vocal for "so supernatural," and current böc guitarist/keyboardist richie castellano filled some other holes in the arrangements to complete the songs. then all were remixed into the tunes you hear on this new release! 

for an in-depth look at how "ghost stories" was brought to fruition, watch this youtube video where schenck and castellano explain the process.
the album is available on cd, lp, limited edition purple lp, as well as a blue vinyl lp offered by newbury comics, and digital formats.

the legendary american hard rock band blue öyster cult celebrated their 50th anniversary with a very special set of 3 sold-out shows in a row in september 2022 at sony hall in nyc.
for this historic career milestone, each show featured the band playing in its entirety one of their first three albums (blue öyster cult, tyranny and mutation, and secret treaties), followed by a set of deep cuts and classics from their other albums. founding member albert bouchard was a special guest on all three nights.
the band played for nearly 3 hours and delivered an amazing set performing the self-titled debut album back to back and the second set also included some fan favorite and deep cuts along with some of their best-known songs. blue öyster cult were truly on fire. all in, they played for nearly three hours for the delight of the fans that filled the venue.
the frontiers label will release each night as a special individual package. 
for over five decades, blue öyster cult has been thrilling fans of intelligent hard rock worldwide with powerful albums loaded with classic songs. indeed, the long island, ny-based band is revered within the hard rock and heavy metal scene for its pioneering work. they occupy a unique place in rock history, because it's one of very few hard rock/heavy metal bands to earn both genuine mainstream critical acclaim and commercial success.
the band is often cited as a major influence by other acts such as metallica, and böc was listed in vh1's countdown of the greatest hard rock bands of all time.
upon the release of böc's self-titled debut album in 1972, the band was praised for its catchy-yet-heavy music and lyrics that could be provocative, terrifying, funny or ambiguous, often all in the same song. böc's canon includes three stone-cold classic songs that will waft through the cosmos long after the sun has burned out: the truly haunting "(don't fear) the reaper" from 1976's "agents of fortune,"" the pummeling "godzilla" from 1977's "spectres" and the hypnotically melodic "burnin' for you" from 1981's "fire of unknown origin". other notable bãc songs include "cities on flame with rock and roll," "then came the last days of may," "i love the night," "in thee," "veteran of the psychic wars," "dominance and submission," "astronomy," "black blade" and "shooting shark."
the intense creative vision of böc's original core duo of vocalist/lead guitarist donald "buck dharma" roeser and vocalist/rhythm guitarist eric bloom is complemented by richie castellano on guitar and keyboards, and the longtime rhythm section of bass guitarist danny miranda and drummer jules radino.
"we realized we're a 'classic rock' band. that's what we are, that's what we do best, and that's what we know," declares the band.
they're proud of böc's classic sound, and pleased the band is creating vibrant work for disenfranchised music lovers who don't like the homogenized, prefabricated pop or sound-alike, formulaic rap-metal that monopolizes the radio airwaves and best-seller charts.
bãc has always maintained a relentless touring schedule and an album of new material, the symbol remains, was released october 9th, 2020, to rave reviews.

blue öyster cult's new album has arrived

this is the link to order to buy or stream the new album: buy "the symbol remains" as cd, lp or download/stream

 amazon best sellers rank: #4 in cds & vinyl (see top 100 in cds & vinyl)
  #2 in rock (cds & vinyl)

the wait is over... the new blue öyster cult album, "the symbol remains" is officially released, along with a new video for the song "the alchemist." 
with 14 new songs, blue öyster cult's new album, "the symbol remains," is packed with killer riffs, sweet harmonies, crunchy guitars and a dash of twang. the album captures, at long last, the creative side of a band that has been playing shows on the road consistently for nearly two decades. "symbol" offers a palette of sonic variety and interesting song topics, including sword and sorcery, vampires, modern technology, and apathetic bar brawls, courtesy of lyricist john shirley, a frequent contributor to the band's later catalogue, as well as o.g. back-in-the-day writer richard meltzer-author of some of böc's most cryptic lyrics. and a special surprise with an appearance of founding member albert bouchard, who returns to add percussion (cowbell, of course) and backing vocals to the opening track, "that was me."
a genuine epic.
lead guitarist buck dharma wrote six of the tracks, including "box in my head," an earworm of a song that is rich in melody and intricate vocal harmonies. of the contributions by guitarist richie castellano, the palace intrigue in the lyric of "the alchemist," based on a story by h.p. lovecraft, matches perfectly with the sinister music, and is a standout track. jules radino also contributes a song with the hard-rocking "there's a crime."
the fire's origin remains unknown, but the symbol remains the same for an ageless blue öyster cult in 2020. never pretenders and certainly not now, böc's authenticity is what's made them an enduring treasure of rock 'n' roll.
mixed by master mix engineer tom lord-alge, the album packs a punch and is extremely diverse yet continually rocks hard. blue öyster cult is back! 
it's really f—ing good, and blue öyster cult suddenly sound transformed anew, into a slightly slicker but no less thunderous version of the band that brought us such seminal cornerstones as "tyranny and mutation", "agents of fortune" and "spectres".
both dharma and castellano share lead guitar duties, weaving in and around each other, their personal styles representing both the classic melodic and modern styles of guitar playing.
the album is available on cd, 2xlp, limited edition color 2xlp (white vinyl has limited remaining copies), and digital formats.
