we choose a world that is fair and just


quote of the week:
“trade has ever been the extinguisher of war, the eradicator of prejudice, the diffuser of knowledge.”
-henry george -protection or free trade (1886)



the mission of our school is based on the ideas and writings of american political economist and social reformer, henry george. his seminal book, progress and poverty, is an all-time best seller in economics. his ideas continue to influence political and economic thought and still resonate and remain relevant nearly a century-and-a-half later. join us at the henry george school of social science to discover what we can do together.
