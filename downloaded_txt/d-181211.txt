  tennis history:
"the 700-year-old french game of tennis, traditionally as much a lady's as a man's game, was introduced to the u.s. in 1874 by a woman, mary e. outerbridge..."
see more from this sept. 9, 1946, time magazine cover story on women's tennis and 1946 wimbledon and forest hills champ pauline betz now on the tennis articles page.

time magazine, may 23, 1955:
    in her first column, the san diego union's new women's sports editor maureen ("little mo") connolly, retired as the world's greatest lady tennis star at a ripe old 21, showed that sports punditry is as easy for her as smashing a tennis ball down an opponents throat.

    lamented little mo in great pontifical style: "[on] the american scene today ... we're reducing sports to a cluster of numbers on a board ... we ... are expecting our champions to be stadium automatons, the human equivalents of the balls in a super pinball machine ... we're watching for the numbers to light up and forgetting the play."
