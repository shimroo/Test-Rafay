what is the 4th amendment?the fourth amendment to the united states constitution is a crucial component of the bill of rights and provides protections against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. it reads:"the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."the fourth amendment serves several essential purposes:protection from unreasonable searches and seizures: the primary purpose of the fourth amendment is to safeguard individuals from arbitrary or unjustified intrusions by law enforcement or other government agents. it ensures that people have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their personal spaces and belongings.probable cause requirement: the fourth amendment establishes that before conducting a search or seizure, law enforcement officers must have probable cause. probable cause means that they must have a reasonable belief that a crime has been committed, and the search or seizure is likely to yield evidence related to that crime.warrant requirement: generally, the fourth amendment mandates that searches and seizures should be conducted with a warrant issued by a neutral and detached magistrate. the warrant must specify the place to be searched and the items or individuals to be seized. however, there are exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as when there are exigent circumstances or when certain exceptions apply, like searches incident to arrest. exclusionary rule: the fourth amendment also gives rise to the exclusionary rule, which states that evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment may be excluded from criminal proceedings. this serves as a deterrent against unlawful searches and seizures and encourages law enforcement officers to follow proper procedures.privacy rights: the fourth amendment underscores the importance of privacy rights, emphasizing that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their personal spaces, including their homes, vehicles, and personal effects.the fourth amendment has been the subject of numerous court cases and legal interpretations over the years, shaping the boundaries of when and how law enforcement can conduct searches and seizures. these legal precedents help to strike a balance between protecting individual rights and allowing law enforcement to carry out its duties effectively.call (703) 382-5840 or contact us online using the secure request form here on our website. we offer free and confidential consultation, in person or over the phone/virtually.

have questions? we are here to help. still have questions or can't find the answer you need? give us a call at 703-382-5840 today!





will i go to jail for my misdemeanor charge?



most misdemeanors carry a possible punishment of up to 12 months in jail, but a lot depends on the nature of the offense. if this is your first offense and you are convicted (including a guilty plea), we have an excellent record of working with prosecutors to seek an alternative to jail time.



what about felony charges?



felony charges are much more serious, and the penalties often include a mandatory prison sentence, particularly for federal felony offenses. we work vigorously for acquittal or, where appropriate, to reduce charges to a misdemeanor. whenever possible, we fight aggressively to help our clients avoid the possibility of a harsh prison sentence.



how much will my dui/dwi charges cost me?



the amount of legal fees you pay your attorney depends upon what you expect your lawyer to do for you. every law firm is different because every law firm offers various levels of service. if it is your choice to initially plead guilty; that will certainly cost less in legal fees than fighting a conviction all the way through trial. the criminal penalty can include a hefty fine, but most are significantly lower for a first offense.



will i lose access to my children because of my domestic violence arrest?



the law does include some provisions that may prevent an abuser from gaining unsupervised access to their children, depending upon the circumstances of the arrest. there are provisions for access and parenting time under predetermined conditions. your children’s safety will always be the first priority in these types of cases.



why does having an experienced criminal defense lawyer make such a difference?



remember, it is the prosecutor’s job to convict you. you will be going through a process that is unfamiliar to most people. you will be attending hearings, undergoing questioning, and giving statements to various police investigators. at any turn, you could say or do something that can have an incriminating impact on your case. an experienced criminal defense lawyer knows from experience the strategies police and prosecutors will use against you. the prosecutors know which defense lawyers can be trusted when working toward a common-sense plea agreement. it takes years to build up that trust and integrity.
