welcome to my appreciation site of battle of the planets.  battle of the planets was an adaption of an original japanese cartoon - kagaku ninja tai gatchaman (science ninja team gatchaman) basically, to make it appeal more to western audiences they removed lots of the violence inherent in japanese cartoons, and translated and simplified the story to make battle of the planets. an even later remake saw the series renamed to g-force.  on this site you will find details of the episodes and characters,wallpaper to brighten up your computer, in the transmute section you will find 2 nifty screen savers which i have created, and a link to the amazing cuban boys remix of the battle of the planets theme. you can also leave any comments in the guest book."g - force princess, tiny, keyop, mark, jason and watching over them from centre neptune their computerised co-ordinator 7-zark-7! watching, warning against surprise attacks by alien galaxies beyond space! fearless young orphans, protecting earth's entire galaxy. always five acting as one....dedicated, inseparable, invincible!click to receive email when this page is updated powered by netmind
