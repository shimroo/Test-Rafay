oregon’s shimmering blue gem
seven millennia of rain and snowmelt have filled mt. mazama’s volcanic crater with the clearest water in the world. crater lake national park provides diverse habitats for an array of wildlife, and for visitors the comforts of the historic crater lake lodge as well as camping and cabins. open all year long, there’s nothing quite as breathtaking as a bluebird winter day with crater lake radiant in a fresh white blanket of snow.

                crater lake
              



oregon’s shimmering blue gem. artists, photographers, and sightseers gaze in wonder at its blue water and stunning setting atop the cascade mountain range. it’s a must-see spot during any trip to southern oregon. born out of the eruption of mt. mazama 7,700 years ago, the mountain collapsed and created a nearly 2,000-foot deep crater. seven millenia of rain and snowmelt have filled the crater and has resulted in one of the world’s clearest bodies of water. scientists have measured the water’s clarity to as deep as 120 feet.

your guide to southern oregon stargazing

this area of cosmic wonder includes portions of malheur, lake and harney counties to the east of larger southern oregon cities like medford, klamath falls and ashland. they are so sparsely populated that the region is also known as the oregon outback. and while much of the nighttime world grows brighter every year, as much as 11 million acres of outback are on track to become an official dark sky sanctuary in 2023. that would be the largest area of its kind, and good news not just for curious humans checking out the milky way but also for wildlife that needs the dark to thrive.
