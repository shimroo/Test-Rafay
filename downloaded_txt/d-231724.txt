aww covid schmovid, man!

go clap your fins & slap on some
high-test sunscreen, funseekers! 
at long last this pan-damn-ic 
is well on the wane after a 
sad, soul-stifling, 30-month
slapdown of the entire tropical
dive vacation industry -- worldwide.
new hope & joy are billowing back 
like plumeria trees in springtime.


high time to re-seize the seas,
all you island-starved sunseekers!
welcome to the web's longest-running,
photo-filled resource for tropical
snorkeling & scuba diving vacations.
we're seasoned experts at sea-escapes,
sharing trip tips since "pioneer days"
of the rowdy pre-cell-phone usenet...
on bulletin boards (bbs), years  before 
there even existed a worldwide web.

that's why our loyal tribe winks & 
thinks there's a bit of "retro-chic" 
in our unrepentingly enthusiastic
old-timey vapor wave site design! 
so come on in & have some fun --
click in, choose, cruise & peruse 
from more than 777,000 words
plus 3,000 vibrant & colorful photos
of wild islands, beachside resorts, 
& most of this blue planet's best
luxury scuba diving liveaboards.



weary of cold robo-reservations 
via soulless cell phone apps?

a friendly tropical travel pro?
our top dive trip planners will 
be happy to help you -- any time.
