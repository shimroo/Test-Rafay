dc's community living room.  we reflect the eclecticism of our nation's capital by redefining the american cafe culture.tryst is known for having huge lounging sofas, eclectic art on the walls, with no corporate coffee and no matching silverware.  you can stop by for a quick cup on your way to work, or you can lounge all day with a great book.  our specialty coffees and menus are favorites for regulars and tourists, and we’re famous for always serving two animal crackers with each drink.  we’re right in the center of the adams morgan neighborhood of dc, and we’ve proudly been a part of the community since 1998.we build meaningful connections, one animal cracker at a time.



please note that we currently offer outdoor seating on our patio, indoor dining, contactless carryout, and delivery. we only accept walk-ins at this time and seat guests on a first come, first serve basis. most of the time, we can get you seated quickly but please feel free to call us at (202) 232-5500 to inquire about potential wait times. in the event there is a wait, we will text you once your table is ready.
