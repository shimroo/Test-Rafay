madison pipes and drums

community
we are commonly available to play for parades, memorials, and more. we hope to bring a little joy with our music! we’re available for hire as individual pipers and as a band. we are also available free of charge for some charitable events, such as protective services and military memorials and badger honor flights. contact us here for more information.


























education
we aim to teach the community about celtic music and culture, and are available for a wide variety of events. if you’re interested in learning a new instrument, we have instructors for both the great highland bagpipes and for drumming, and can start with virtual lessons. find out more about how to start here.


























fellowship
as a band, we compete together, play music together, and have fun! we aim to be a welcoming place for rookies and old hats alike. check out more about who we are and what we’re up to on our events and yearbook pages. interested in taking lessons or joining our band? learn more here.
