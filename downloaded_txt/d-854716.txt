                    michael edwards’ online database is the natural evolution of his revered fragrances of the world reference guidebook, which began in 1984. updated daily by michael and his team of evaluators, the database contains product information on over 55,000 fragrances from around the world.
                

                    in the database, all fragrances are classified by family, note and sub-note using michael edwards’ fragrance wheel. bottle image, olfactive pyramid, launch date, brand, olfactive direction, perfumer and bottle designer are just some of the searchable data points we record for every fragrance.
                

                    perfume critic luca turin calls it “the only comprehensive, historically accurate, factually reliable and artistically consistent database of fragrance in existence.”
