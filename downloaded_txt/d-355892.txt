  what is the drone policy at nashville district lakes and waterways in the cumberland river basin?
answer: the u.s. army corps of engineers nashville district drone policy governs the operation and use of recreational unmanned aerial systems (uas) at all nashville district lakes within the cumberland river basin.
the guidance has designated approved locations to fly drones for hobbyists, while at the same time prohibiting drones where people are camping and recreating such as designated swim beaches. the policy also prohibits uas flights near critical infrastructure such as locks, dams, power plants and switch yards.
drones should be operated in accordance with applicable state laws and federal aviation administration regulations including any uas registration requirements. they may be flown only during daylight hours only and while maintaining a visual line of sight of the aircraft while it is in operation.
operators will be held liable for damage to corps of engineers property resulting from piloting a drone or any other activity associated with operating a uas.
the operation of unmanned aircraft that harasses or jeopardizes wildlife, including listed endangered and threatened species or critical habitat is prohibited. critical habitat include areas that contain the physical and biological features that are essential to the conservation of a given species or group of species and that may require special management or protection.
violations may result in removal from federal property and potential citations.
the authority to approve exceptions to the policy is delegated to the operations project managers. call the lake resource manager’s offices for more information or to request an exception to policy.
at corps of engineers operated and maintained locks at tennessee valley authority projects in the tennessee river basin, the tva drone policy applies.

about our history


collapse all expand all
  about the nashville district
army special order 191 created the nashville district aug. 18, 1888, to develop the lower cumberland river. this led to construction of the old locks above and below nashville, and eventually today’s modern dams. lt. col. john w. barlow became the first nashville district engineer.  his task was to oversee the construction of a series of locks and dams on the cumberland river. 
the trousdale building at 609 broad street in nashville was the first district office in 1888. engineers on the cumberland eagerly seized upon the idea of locks and dams to facilitate year-round navigation on the river.  over the next 40 years, 15 locks and dams were built on the cumberland river and were kept in service until the modern, multi-purpose dams that are now in operation were constructed.
today the nashville district is responsible for navigable waterways in the cumberland and tennessee river basins; flood risk reduction; hydropower and recreation at nine multipurpose projects in the cumberland river basin; and protection, preservation, restoration and improvement of natural resources. the nashville district headquarters is located in the estes kefauver federal building in nashville, tennessee.  the federal building has been the home of the district headquarters since 1974. 
nashville district facts

the nashville district geographic area touches seven states and covers 59,000 squares miles. 
the nashville district's geographic area is represented by 14 senators and 20 congressmen.
the nashville district has the capacity to produce more than 914 megawatts of clean electricity from nine hydropower plants in the cumberland river basin. 
this nashville district operates and maintains 1,175 commercially navigable river miles, almost 10 percent of the total within the u.s. army corps of engineers.  
nashville district team members operate and maintain 14 navigation lock projects: nine on the tennessee river, four on the cumberland river, and one on the clinch river.
wilson lock in alabama has the highest single lift east of the rocky mountains, which is between 93 and 100 feet, depending on the current river water level.
nashville district operates 10 lakes, 273 recreation areas, 108 playgrounds, 72 swim areas, 104 hiking trails, 108 picnic sites, 25 campgrounds and 3,203 campsites in the cumberland river basin. 
park rangers manage 336,106 acres of public lands, 3,800 miles of shoreline and 201,385 water acres with 22 fishing docks and 281 boat ramps in the cumberland river basin.
lake cumberland has the only operating gristmill in the corps, a national historic site, which has survived fire, rebuilding, and time. the mill has a 40-feet overshot waterwheel, the largest of its kind in the world.
two nashville district lakes, lake cumberland and dale hollow, make it possible for national fish hatcheries to be co-located just downstream.  water, which is withdrawn from deep in the pool, supplies the hatcheries with the necessary water temperature that trout require to flourish.  and those same structures, along with center hill dam, make it possible for those species to do well downstream of the dams because of their inherent mission of flood damage reduction that requires water storage over long periods of time. 
the total capacity of water in corps lakes is 4.07 million acre-feet.

  mill springs park
monticello, ky. -- walking the grounds of mill springs mill on the shore of lake cumberland will take your mind and soul to another time - the past. old battlefields, new innovations and extensive restorations, make up much of mill springs mill's history. by taking a stroll through mill spring's park, one is instantly immersed in the culture and history of another time.
it all began in 1700 when hunters and explorers, called "long hunters", found a place "with excellent springs near a waterfall." the settlers were no doubt amazed at the sight of 13 springs flowing from the hillside! here, price's station, one of the first settlements in kentucky was established and eventually became a fur trading center. in 1774 daniel boone and michael stoner passed through this area.
the story of mill springs mill began around 1817 when charles, john and dr. james metcalf settled in the area and erected a cereal grinding mill, or a grist mill as they were usually called, for the milling of corn and wheat. the mill was equipped with 48 inch french burrs, millstones for grinding wheat and corn. flour and cornmeal were custom ground for families who brought their grain by wagon or horseback on milling day.
the year 1824 brought the destruction of the metcalfe mill and factories due to fire. john metcalfe took on the task of rebuilding and reconstruction was completed in 1839.
in 1825, a post office was established near the mill and was called mill springs, kentucky. john metcalfe, jr. was designated the first post-master.
on jan. 19, 1862, blood was shed on the grounds of mill springs as the north fought the south. coveted because of it's easy defense capabilities, ferry landings, commandment of the river and easy approaches to cumberland gap and the mountain pass at jacksboro, tennessee, the battle of mill springs, as it came to be called, was one of the first great battles of the civil war. it proved to be one of the most significant for federal troops as well by marking the very first major defeat of confederate forces. the first break in the confederate defense line in kentucky occurred and marked the beginning of union operations leading across tennessee and mississippi.

in 1877, mill owner lloyd lanier and arthur rankin, skilled millwright, purchased the mill and all other included properties, then promptly erected the present 34 x 40 foot, three story mill which remains a magnificent sight to see. from 1879 through 1907 mill owners and operators included ike lanier, j.m. sallee, robert lanier, dr. j.s. jones, and i. d. ruffner. in 1885 the new firm j.s. jones and company modernized the mill by installing new machines and steel roller mills for milling flour.

bolan e. roberts bought the mill in 1907 and operated it as "diamond roller mills." in 1908, the 28-foot cedar wheel was replaced by a steel water wheel. still in use the wheel is one of the largest overshot water wheels in the world. the wheel has a diameter of 40 feet, 10 inches, and a breast of three feet. powered by 13 natural springs located beside the mill, it is thought to be one of the largest of it's kind in the world.

a 15 horsepower auxiliary crude oil engine was added in the 1920's to supplement power to the mill springs mill during low flow.
thomas roberts operated the mill under the name of the "diamond roller mill" until 1949 when the federal government acquired the mill and lands as part of the lake cumberland project.
in 1963 the monticello woman's club and other civic organizations, with aid from the kentucky department of highways, reactivated the mill. in 1973 the mill was designated as a national historic site. in 1976, a major restoration to the structure and grounds was completed by the u.s. army corps of engineers. traditional tools and skills were used to render the mill as close to the original work as possible. the use of mortar was forgone to make the restorations as close to the original millwrights, andrew denney, as possible. old fashioned cut nails and even the paint colors were carefully duplicated. mill springs is now on the national register of battlefields and is one of 25 civil war battlefields that is included on a special endangered battlefield list.


  wilson lock and dam
towering in size, incomparable in scale and ambitious in design, the wilson dam project, constructed from 1918-1927, established a standard for the nation for future waterways improvement.  the largest mass concrete united states lock & dam yet built, it was the first federal hydroelectric project as well as the first corps of engineers multipurpose effort.  congress, noting the combined benefits of flood control, aid to commercial navigation and the production of hydroelectric power in a single project, soon mandated these elements be evaluated in all new investigations.   in 1933, the completed project amazed and inspired newly elected president franklin roosevelt to create the tennessee valley authority.   this act revitalized a region and provided a blueprint for development of water resources nationwide. 

wilson dam marked the first successful attempt to tap the potential of the tennessee river.  efforts to develop the river for economic purposes dated back to the 1830's.  inadequate, they failed to achieve significant results.  the barrier of the muscle shoals continued to divide the residents of the tennessee valley geographically and socially.  poverty stricken, the region led the nation in grim categories like illiteracy, lowest per capita income, infant mortality and the availability of electricity and running water.  initially authorized for national defense, the completion of wilson dam paved the way for a period of development that harnessed the river.   rapid industrialization and economic diversification swept the valley.

based on a survey report submitted by nashville district engineer, major harry burgess, the wilson dam was the most ambitious american public works project of the period.  the massive structure, 137 feet in height and more than 4,500 feet long [world record] required the excavation of nearly 1.5 million cubic yards of earth and rock and consumed 1.3 million cubic yards of concrete.  at 94 feet, its lock lift established another world record and remains the highest on the system.  at peak construction, more than 4,000 men labored at the site, requiring the construction of a small town to house them and their dependents.    after 75 years wilson, at 630,000 kw is still among the highest capacity hydroelectric plants in the nation.   at a total cost of nearly $47 million, it truly was an extraordinary project for its time.

simultaneous with wilson's construction, nashville district conducted a comprehensive survey of the economic potential and future improvement of the tennessee river.  the final report, advocating power-navigation dams on the main stem and power storage dams on the tributaries, became the foundation of multipurpose development in the valley.  when created in 1933, the tennessee valley authority, using wilson as a model, implemented these advance plans.

the construction of six multipurpose dams and the pressing of other initiatives gradually awakened the region from its torpor.   flood damages fell, barge traffic, barely a million tons a year in 1930, surged and the availability of affordable electric power transformed everyday life in the valley.  in 1933, muscle shoals became the first community to receive electric power via the facilities at wilson dam; within a few years, more than one hundred other municipalities would join it.  this new development, as one economist noted, gave the residents "universally high standards of living, new jobs, leisure, freedom and an end to drudgery, congestion, noise, smoke and filth."  much of this remarkable transformation has its roots in the wilson dam, the pathfinder federal multipurpose project that unlocked the potential of a dynamic, but isolated region.
