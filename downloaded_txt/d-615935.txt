testimonials


boom mower

“tiger builds one of the most powerful boom mowers money can buy. with the ability to reach 20 feet in the air, along with the power to cut almost anything in your path, tiger is the only mower we will work with.”
— frank johnson- angelina county operator



all tiger products

“i have spent my adult life in municipal sales and have worked with a lot of companies that sell municipal equipment. tiger has been a leader in quality equipment, parts supply, and service after the sale. when purchasing a tiger product i know that if it requires manufacturing support, no one steps up to the plate better, no one. when you have top of the line service staff working with you every step of the way, you know that whatever tiger product you purchase they are there to stand behind the sale. tiger is the best product that we represent.”
— jim wesbecher- salesman for wm nobbe & co.



tiger dealer

“i have been a tiger dealer since 1984 and in those 35 years, tiger has always gone above and beyond to take care of all our customers mowing needs. tiger is continuously making product upgrades to enhance the dependability and longevity of all their mower models.
in addition to the equipment itself, tiger's parts and service departments are second to none - providing timely responses to technical questions and quick turnaround of repair part orders customers need to get back to mowing, rather than leaving equipment sitting in the garage.”
— al fulton- tiger dealer- dexter co.
