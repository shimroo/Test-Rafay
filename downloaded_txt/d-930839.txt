testimonials“i’ve been with dr. shane since 1999 when i purchased my first horse, ciai. he was the only vet in charlottesville willing to travel to remington, va to perform a pre-purchase vet exam! i was a bundle of nerves at the prospect of this horse not passing but he put me at ease, answered all my questions and gave me his honest opinion with recommendations for conditioning her. i’ve had other horse people try to talk me into using other vets but dr. shane’s dedication to the well-being of the horse and his willingness to listen to the horse owner are the reasons i won’t use another equine vet. the other great thing about dr. shane is his educational sessions he provides at equine events, he’s informative, funny and explains disease processes, injuries, etc. in layman’s terms. thanks dr. shane!”— lori ange



“five years ago when we brought my daughter’s horse home and purchased a second one, i was concerned about finding a vet i would be comfortable with. dr. shane was recommended to me by a friend and i have been so pleased with the wonderful service and care that our horses have received. he is patient and willing to answer any questions or address any concerns that i might have at the time. i have always been grateful for my friend’s recommendation.”— susan hodges
