youth group
wpc offers many opportunities for students to understand the gospel of jesus christ. we include students from grade six through high school graduation. our youth engage in activities intended to foster deeper connections with each other, our church members and, most importantly, their faith in jesus christ. weekly bible study, off-campus events, service sundays, conferences and summer missions and development trips are part of the program.

about wpc
																																				we are a pcusa church, founded in 1991, that believes in a god of love and grace. in response to god’s love we offer our praise and thanksgiving by worshipping together in the power of the spirit, and by sharing the good news of christ in proclamation, study and song.
worship at wpc, held in our beautiful sanctuary, is an inspirational hour for all. a spirited worship service is held at 11 a.m. every sunday morning. special services are offered during the easter and christmas seasons.
