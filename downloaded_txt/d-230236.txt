welcome to the marlboro college archives at emerson college.
on july 23, 2020, emerson and marlboro colleges entered into a historic alliance that would carry on marlboro’s legacy of rigorous, independent scholarship while strengthening emerson’s commitment to the liberal arts.
just as emerson looks to honor the marlboro tradition of self-directed study through the marlboro institute for liberal arts & interdisciplinary study, this website aims to preserve the digital footprint and virtual community of marlboro college for those who called potash hill their intellectual home.
here you’ll find content archived from marlboro.edu; resources for marlboro alumni; and stories and profiles about marlboro students, faculty, and alumni as they continue their scholarship in boston and beyond.
