our impact
0families served0mortgages paid off0+volunteers per year
our affordable home means the world to my family.  as homeowners we never have to throw our money away on rent anymore.  personally, it gives us a sense of accomplishment knowing that now we have a place of our own — a place to call home and raise our family in.
