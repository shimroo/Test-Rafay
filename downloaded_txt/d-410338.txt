our pillars in action


 















riya paranthan, od, northwest eye clinic, bellingham, wa
“it’s about having access to other peers so you don’t feel like you’re on an island by yourself. you’re not isolated. you are a group of professionals who, at the end of the day, want each other to do better.”



 



 













kennard herring, od, nostalgic eye care, philadelphia, pa 
“pecaa has been a tremendous help for me growing my practice from day one. my most valued pecaa max membership benefit is the business advisory team. i have had bryan help me with my business by the numbers, i have had kayla help me with my optical, i have also had shelby help me market my practice, which has been very impactful in building my patient base.”



 



 













mary baker, od, overtake family vision, bellevue, wa
“when i got my first rebate check, i couldn’t believe that my rebate check was more than my membership fee and that pecaa actually pays me to be a member. pecaa gives me discounts and rebates that increase my profitability.”
