"... todd (storz) and some others were sitting around figuring out
what they could do on their station and they noticed that wdsu had a program 
called the top 20.  and they thought if the top 20 was successful, that the 
top 40 would be even better - and that's what they said - we're going to be 
twice as good as wdsu 'cause we're gonna play - the top 40."
