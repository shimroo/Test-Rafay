financial options


amsig understands there is no “one-size-fits-all” finance plan. that’s why we offer an array of choices to help you find the solution that best suits your organization’s needs! you can save on the bottom line by taking advantage of cod discounts (when applicable), maintain a “best practices” account with amsig credit approval, free up cash flow with long-term financing, or leverage your customer’s buying power with a joint check agreement – particularly useful for new businesses on the rise.
contact our sales department for more information on available cod discounts and our joint check agreement policy.
if you prefer a standard net 30 arrangement and are a new amsig customer, please contact us and let us know how we can help further.









security


amsig understands the security of your equipment is vital to your business and mission. that is why all of our trailers’ cabinets are lockable, why all of our signs come with passwords, and why we do not publish those default passwords on our website. we offer many additional security features such as removable terminals, hidden clasp locks, locking lug nuts, tamper alarms, and gps.
the number one security measure you can take to protect your signs from “hacking” is to change the default passwords.  the center for internet security recommends strong, complex passwords. amsig message signs have multiple levels of access, and the ability to have multiple accounts for each level of access. creating unique passwords will provide you the greatest “first line of defense” after physical security of your cabinets.
the next most important step in securing your amsig signs is protecting them from “remote hacks,” which can involve harmful message displays, or malicious cellular activity. amsig’s secure vpn removes the need to acquire a public static ip address from your cellular carrier in order to operate your signs remotely, which means someone with ill intent will not be able to find your devices quickly or easily. this affordable security solution comes with access to our its cloud manager software. contact us today to learn more about amsig’s vpn and its cloud manager.


continuity of service


american signal company’s webbexpress firmware (wx) has set the industry benchmark for ease-of-use, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and ntcip compliance. since wx has become our standard message sign firmware our partners have noticed a significant savings in time and money that was once dedicated to sign operations and maintenance.
have you acquired amsig signs manufactured since 2012? they likely uses wx, which allows for ota updates and the greatest level of ntcip compliance in the portable message sign industry.
do you have older amsig signs? they can likely be upgraded to the wx firmware with a small and simple hardware kit. you can achieve ntcip communication compatibility and the same operator benefits of our latest model signs with a wx upgrade. contact our service department today for more information!
would you like to learn more about wx, ntcip, or the upgrade process? check out why you should upgrade to wx, or contact us to let us know how we can serve you!
