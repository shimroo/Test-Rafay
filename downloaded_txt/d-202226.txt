what our customers are saying
creating quality airboats is what we do, customer satisfaction is top priority






i have had two panther airboats, the only reason i sold the first panther 14 foot was to replace it with a 16 foot panther. both boats are 1999 marsh masters 350 ci and 350 horsepower. 2:1 keway gearbox. over 1,000 hrs on the 14 ft replaced the starter twice. i would replace hei ignition every 2 years as a preventative measure. anyone who knows me will tell you i am in the woods every week, unless they are closed. neither boat has left me in the woods. if i should buy another boat it will be a panther. i have over 400 hrs. on the 16 ft. both boats run dry.

1st time i came in contact with an panther airboat, it was work related it was a simple unit fast turn on a dime & stylish, and yes i was impressed of the sure horsepower behind me. now some 20yrs later. i see your still the most requested. i even praise you airboat to others who maybe lookin. i never owned one but my company had it. good machine.

danny, spud and the guys at panther airboats built me an awesome boat! these guys are a pleasure to deal with. honest no bs stand up people that are very refreshing to work with. as i have said a few times already, i am so glad that i chose this company to build my boat! they were friendly and nice to work with from the beginning and “unlike several of the builders” wanted to know what i wanted in a boat, not which one of their “cookie cutter boats” did i want. i can not say enough about these guys! great job and thank you! it was a pleasure.
