jonathan ramirez
studio arts

at compton college, ramirez (class of 2022) found a supportive campus staffed with
                                       people who wanted to see him succeed. he liked the free meal-per-day program on campus
                                       and the other resources offered to students, while smaller classes enabled him to
                                       interact with classmates and access personal attention from professors. “compton college
                                       is a great starting place for someone who has been out of school for a few years.
                                       the classes in a welcoming environment made the transition into college easier. i
                                       tell all my family and friends – especially those with younger kids – that compton
                                       college is a great place to start."
