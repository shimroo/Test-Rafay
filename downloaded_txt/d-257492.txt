our history 



in 1959, pleasant valley country club was carved out of an expansive three hundred fifty acre apple orchard and in 1961 the club opened its doors. today, pleasant valley country club is owned by michael o’brien of galaxy development, llc and jay kunkel, a longtime member of pleasant valley country club. professional golf came to sutton, massachusetts beginning with the 1962 lpga lady carling open. the pga tour began its annual retreat to sutton in 1965 with the carling world open, which has welcomed international golfers from eleven countries and offered a record purse of $200,000. since then, pleasant valley has hosted forty-seven national championships on both the lpga and pga tours.
