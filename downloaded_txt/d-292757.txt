life insurance with a conscience since 1890.®



lcba, founded in 1890, is a unique type of organization that provides the financial protection our members need, with the added benefit of helping those in need. we put our earnings back into communities and causes, not pockets. members get life or other insurance products, and in doing so, help support scholarships, charitable events and more. it’s different because it makes a difference. the kind of protection you can be proud of. choose planning ahead and giving back, not between the two.
