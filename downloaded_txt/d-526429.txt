now boardingthe flying yankee association (fya) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the restoration and operation of boston & maine railroad streamliner #6000, the flying yankee. the historic trainset brought awe to new england in the depths of the great depression, and our all-volunteer team seeks to revive that same feeling in the 21st century. the flying yankee is a unique time machine that serves as a tangible link to a bygone era.

now that ownership of the flying yankee has been transferred from the state of new hampshire to the flying yankee association (fya), the trainset’s restoration will rely entirely on donations. our organization has no employees and is run entirely by volunteers.
