"this was probably one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  it was totally worth the money and would definitely do it again.  the guides were awesome, very knowledgeable and helpful.  the people in france, switzerland and italy were all so nice and hospitable. and the hikes were the perfect amount of hard but exhilarating at the same time and the scenery just could not be described appropriately.  you have to see it yourself. and what better way can you knock 3 different countries off your bucket list. great, great trip. oh and don't get me started on the amazing food. so good!

new zealand walking adventure


don k

"this trip provided a variety of hikes through beautiful rain forests, beaches and mountains. we were always given a choice between an easier hike and a more strenuous hike. i would highly recommend the heli-hike on franz josef glacier. it was a unique and very memorable experience. mel and kayla were excellent guides for this trip. most of the meals were prepared and cooked by mel and kayla and they provided a variety of delicious meals. they also made accommodations for those with dietary restrictions. mel provided a sarcastic wit and was very knowledgeable with answering questions. she was also an amazing driver through some very windy roads with a bus and attached trailer to navigate. mel and kayla provided a fun, safe, delicious and adventurous trip. i highly recommend this trip for anyone looking to hike, kayak and wine taste in an absolutely beautiful country.
