fall for anything-jeremy fisher


apr. 17th, 2008 at 11:15 pm



 


weemenis the world so big, it makes you feel smallis the hole you dig, deep enough at allthe graveyard is full my grandma used to sayif you don't stand for something you will fall for anythingis time worth saving in paper dollar bills'cause we always just done it don't mean we always willis it worth singing along if you have a song to singif you don't stand for something, you will fall for anythingcan one single person make a change if they tryit's true all the martyrs that ever lived already diedis the road so long we're gonna have to driveif you don't stand for something, you will fall too far behindis there meaning in all these words that we sayis there reason for living life anywayis confusion a state like iowa or maineif you don't stand for something, you will fall for anythingare the waters so rough 'cause we tried to scrub them cleando we mean the things we do, do we do the things we meanwhen a child is born, is it because she has sinnedif she tries to stand for something, will she take the fall for everythingwhen the day has come your shadow lost it's lightwill you see in the darkness who was wrong and who was rightwill the devil pay your tab and take you home with him'cause you either stand for something or you fall for anything

i'm just laying here losing time.


apr. 8th, 2008 at 10:46 pm



 


weementhe past three nights, i have three hours of sleep each.if you totally that up, i have had one night's sleep.you'd think i would be hard at work, that i don't need to sleep.this is not the case. my body literally doesn't sleep. if this keeps up i am sure i will crash. and it will probably happen during finals week. i cannot wait to be done with this semester. i am ready for summer and books, books i will read for pure pleasure. i will finally be able to relax. and who knows, what else. any questions, comments or concerns. i will most likely be awake until three am. (sorry, no matchbox twenty references tonight my friends.)


current music:pendulums

weemenhi. 1. spring break is over.2. gibran is dating super smash bros. brawl now.3. school is controlling my every body part. 4. i really want to sleep past eight a.m. sometime.5. on a happy note, i have less than two months left of school. i was thinking about dedicating entries again, maybe then i will actually set aside five minutes every day to write, so if you have any requests, that would be great.

it's 3 am, i must be lonely...


feb. 25th, 2008 at 3:02 am



 


weemenmidterms week...1. things are not looking that bad. sure i have to study, and math will probably be a tragic experience, but i mean i am hopeful.2. going to see alanis morissette and matchbox 20 this week. hopefully that does not reflect poorly on my midterm grades. silly boyfriend, why would he get me tickets to a concert during such a stressful week. oh well, he is sacrificing his spring break to come to wisconsin so i guess its okay. 3. i really hate that i am awake right now. this totally sucks. plus i have to wake up at seven so i can look professional because i am teaching (kind of) tomorrow for about an hour in the morning. 4. i really do not have a four. 5. nor a five.all right, must try to sleep again. ps. the oscars kind of sucked other than jon stewart and once winning! woohoo! peace out.

unconsciously answering phones...


feb. 20th, 2008 at 6:59 pm



 


weemenso i woke up from my nap today and i got a phone call. first of all, it was a 414 area code which everyone knows is wisconsinsecond, i answer and i am not really quite awake yet, but almost. at first i was nervous because i was who is this? obama already won wisconsin, what would they need me for now. i also thought it was someone i probably did not want to talk to but whatever.okay so third, the guy goes, "hi, this is lee." but really i thought he said his name was "wii." then i was like, what the heck jay, you are letting your employees call me now pretending they are video game systems. yesterday i had spent the day on and off the phone with my brother at gamestop so i was like, another day of talking like this, he must really miss me.okay so finally i wake up and realize his name is lee and he is from the school newspaper. my suitemate gave him my number so he could ask questions about the recycling program my roommate and i started for our floor. publicity will be great for this, but i just thought it was funny that i actually thought he said "wii."okay i'm done. school owns my life yet again.
