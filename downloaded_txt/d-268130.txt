brief statement on taaom lawsuit settlement
january 17, 2024
austin, tx â the texas association of acupuncture and oriental medicine (taaom) has chosen not to appeal the recent austin district court decision upholding the texas board of chiropractic examiners' (board) rule governing the practice of acupuncture by texas chiropractors. the courtâs judgement was rendered on october 3, 2023. in exchange for taaomâs waiver of their right to appeal, the board and the state have waived taaomâs court costs in the litigation.
this settlement avoids further legal uncertainties and allows both parties to focus on their important roles in serving the texas healthcare community. the board will continue to fulfill its duty of regulating chiropractors in the state, which includes regulating the use of acupuncture by chiropractors within the chiropractic scope of practice.
