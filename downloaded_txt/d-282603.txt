alternative energy systems repairsalternative choices is now repairing and upgrading solar customers in our local area. we also sell kolher generators, sunmar composting toilets, staber washers, premier ranges and water pumps.beth hart continues to work with solar customers on their solar needs. beth has been in the solar business since 1999. she loves to hike with her corgis, bbq with friends and take photographs.beth will also be building the new digital marketing advertising for solar businesses. beth is in the process of creating solar e-books and link to this site. check back for more details!what our customers say"first class installation! the ground-mount rack they installed is very rigid and strong to hold up to the high winds at our house, and it is perfectly square and true. the workers were friendly and respectful of our property and once they finished you couldn't even tell they had been here. it was also nice to receive advice about energy saving ideas. the shipping service dropped the pallet holding the panels and one got bent on the metal edge, which ac has promised to replace even though it still works. we will update this review to 5 stars once sunpower gets the monitoring dashboard working (it's reporting production accurately, but usage doesn't track with the black hills utility amounts). bottom line, we highly recommend ac solar." - lori chivington"we had a ground-mounted solar array that had already been installed on our property when we bought our home. the array was blocking part of our view. we called one solar company to check it out to see if the system was working and if it was worth moving. they told us that the panelswere in terrible shape, and that the inverter could cause a fire! that sounded strange so i wanted a second opinion.i called ac solar and they came out soon after. ac solar checked the system and said the solar panels were in fine shape. theycalculated how much the system should have produced and checked the inverter. it was almost the exact same number! they found that they were the ones that had actually installed the system years ago and it was still working just fine.because of their honesty, integrity, and expertise, we went with ac solar for a new system. we are very pleased with pole-mounted system we have today."- jim webb
