we are an independent publishing house dedicated to bringing the most relevant and profound spiritual, self-help and wellness information to our readers. 





















































































































































































our publishing mission is to make available healing and transformational publications that acknowledge, celebrate, and encourage our readers to live from their true essence and thereby come to remember who they truly are.namaste publishing’s first book, the power of now, introduced eckhart tolle to the world. since 1997, namaste has gone on to publish more groundbreaking, inspirational books by such authors as dr. shefali tsabary, michael brown, and dr. david berceli. these books and many others have changed the worldwide dialogue around meditation, parenting, spirituality, conscious business practices, and trauma healing.we believe that all true change comes first from within. as such, we hope to contribute to the development of better societies, relationships, workplaces, and families through publishing books that help to improve our collective quality of consciousness. 
















namasténamasté is a sanskrit word that acknowledges the inestimable value of each individual. it is often used to greet others.i honor the place in you in which the entire universe dwells.i honor the place in you which is of love, of truth, of light, and of peace.when you are in that place in you, and i am in that place in me, we are one.
