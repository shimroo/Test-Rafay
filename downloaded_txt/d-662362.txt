dean bought me bill bailey cosmic jam for christmas. i've not watched it yet. has anyone else seen it? good old bill, just looking at his little face makes me laugh.  i saw a bloke on the subway in new york who was the spitting image of bill bailey. it was quite terrifying but highly amusing. perhaps it was him in fact.

	 notice
	 
    


um, annoyingly my wanadoo email account has run out due to me not using my 'wanadoo dial up' within 90 days, due to me not actually having a wanadoo dial up because i signed up just to get the free account. anyway, none of this matters at all because i don't use the account for anything,  except it was the email address i set up for the forwarding of comments on this blog to everyone, so annoyingly there won't be any comments being forwarded anymore unless i can find a new free acount that works in outlook express or something. just in case anyone was wondering where their comments were. it's gone 1.00 o'clock and i've started drinking coffee, a bad idea.
