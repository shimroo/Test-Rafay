winter weather safety:
winter can bring dangerously cold temperatures and create hazardous weather conditions. check out the national weather service winter safety page, and be prepared by brushing up on these additional winter safety tips from the nys division of homeland security and emergency services.


winter fire safety:
you can help put a freeze on winter fires. did you know home fires occur more in winter than in any other season? as you stay cozy and warm this winter, be fire smart!


cooking safety:
cooking is the leading cause of home fires and home fire injuries.

keep an eye on food when cooking.  unattended cooking is the leading factor in home cooking fires. 
move things that can burn away from the stove.  this includes dishtowels, bags, boxes, paper, and curtains.
turn pot handles toward the back of the stove so no one can bump them or pull them over.
in case of an oven fire, turn off the oven and keep the door closed until it’s cool.
if you have a fire in your oven and the flames escape it, leave your home and call 911.

what3words:

what3words is a geocode system for the communication of locations with a resolution of three meters. what3words encodes geographic coordinates into three dictionary words; the encoding is permanently fixed. if help is needed (whether you're snowmobiling or hiking this winter), providing a what3words address on a 9-1-1 call can pinpoint your location quickly. learn more and download the what3words app here.
