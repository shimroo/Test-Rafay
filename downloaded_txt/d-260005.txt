prescription tips
when it comes to prescription, we've been there, done that, now serving 54 tips in 12 categories ranging from basic calculations to protecting yourself from medication errors.











											should i own a reference book?
									 	

books
everyone should own a simple drug reference book. many are available in layman's terms and have pictures. never assume that your doctor or pharmacist are perfect. they are human and therefore make mistakes like everyone else.

											what should i ask my pharmacist?
									 	

cover the bases
ask your pharmacist: 1. what is the name of my medication? 2. how do i take it? 3. what side effects does it  have? 4. does it interact with my other medications?always ask for a medication leaflet with each new prescription. don't assume anything--educate yourself!

											what should i ask my doctor about my medication?
									 	

the four w's
every time your doctor prescribes a new medication for you ask: 1. why am i taking this medication? 2. when do i take it? 3. where do i put it? (do i swallow it or  apply it?) 4. what am i taking? (name of medication)

											how do i instill ear drops?
									 	

how to instill
to apply ear drops in your child, have him or her sit with the affected ear pointing up. pull the ear lobe down and back (up and out for adults) and instill the drop. try to keep the ear up for 2 to 3 minutes.

											should i purchase a medication device?
									 	

teaspoons and syringes
it is important to have special dosing devices for your child. never use a household teaspoon or tablespoon. these are not accurate. infants typically do the best with the syringe type, while older kids can use the medicine spoons or cups.

											can my medication be specially flavored?
									 	

special flavorings
some pharmacies can specially flavor your child's medication. this usually costs a nominal fee, but can make even the pickiest child want to take their medicine.
