transformation andrew came to northkey through homeless case management after experiencing extended homelessness and violence. initially inconsistent with using services, he eventually engaged with

challenges, including heart disease, arthritis, and hearing loss, along with a diagnosis of depression. referred to the therapeutic rehabilitation group, claire was initially hesitant but eventually

behavioral health access specialist and referred to a crisis therapist. facing family history of mental illness, substance use, cancer treatment, and relationship challenges, allen formed a trusting bond with the therapist. after an emergency therapy session, the therapist conducted a follow-up call during which allen initially hid his intentions but eventually revealed his plan to hang himself. the therapist guided him to safety by ensuring he contacted loved ones and was transported to the hospital. his wife later expressed deep gratitude, sharing that the therapist’s call arrived just as allen was heading to the tree to end his life, saving him in that critical moment.   sara and tim’s path to recovery: overcoming challenges in parenting and sobriety sara and tim were referred to the sobriety treatment and recovery team (start) after sara tested positive for illicit substances following the birth of their child. this led to joint custody with tim’s mother and family court involvement. sara began the 3-day intensive outpatient program (iop) and individual therapy, later recommended for the nurturing parenting program. despite initial progress, sara relapsed near the end of the iop and left a 28-day inpatient program against advice. after re-engaging with northkey and dcbs, she agreed to attend long-term inpatient treatment at renew in ashland, ky. tim was also engaged in recovery services, including attending a/a meetings and submitting to drug screens.   john’s journey: overcoming anxiety and depression to secure employment john, a 30-year-old male diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, had been receiving services at northkey for years. in need of extra income to maintain housing, he was referred to supported employment, where he was paired with a specialist and an ovr counselor. through a detailed career profile, his specialist helped john explore his strengths and interests, narrowing his job search to library positions. after months of setbacks, john successfully secured a job at a library in greater cincinnati. his supported employment specialist continued to support him with resume building, interview prep, and regular check-ins, empowering john to gain confidence, new skills, and maintain his housing.   ashley’s growth: overcoming anxiety and finding success at five below when ashley first met her employment specialist, she was struggling with high levels of anxiety and had limited job experience. after completing her career profile, ashley initially thought pet care would be the right fit but ultimately decided to apply for a position at five below, one of the job leads provided by her specialist. ashley and her mother were familiar with the store, which helped ease her transition. though initially unsure about working the cash register, ashley has since gained confidence, with less anxiety at work. after four months of employment, she has received positive feedback from her employer and has strong natural supports at her job. ashley is also working on her driver’s license and considering college classes in the future.get the support you deservemake an
