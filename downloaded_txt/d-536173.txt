aarc news




“patient safety is the main reason respiratory therapists refrain from providing unattended therapy services without conducting a thorough patient assessment.  indiscriminate use of unattended therapy services may lead to declines in quality and may jeopardize patient safety.  aerosolized medications administered during treatments have potential adverse reactions.  recognition of these reactions is impossible if the patient is left unattended, and thus a safety hazard exists.  ”
