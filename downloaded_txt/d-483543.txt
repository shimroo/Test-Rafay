please subscribe to newseagles on youtube








please follow this link, sign in to youtube (or create an account) and hit subscribe at www.youtube.com/newseagles

i hate to beg for subscribers, but youtube forced me. my youtube channel must get 1,000 subscribers by feb. 20, or my channel is placed into video creator limbo.

i’m also required to create an extreme amount of high-quality, unique content each year to keep the status. since i have a surprise project happening shortly, it won’t be as high of a hurdle as it has been in the past. 

thanks and stay tuned!
