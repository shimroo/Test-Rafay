welcome to

  blue talon bistro
  


we opened our doors to the williamsburg community in 2004 and have been excited to present our vision of relaxed “bistro” dining ever since.  whether you are looking for a spot to have a coffee and read the paper, a casual lunch with friends or dinner with a special guest, we think a bistro is the perfect destination.  our serious attention to the consistency and quality of our menu items, our wine list and cocktails combines with our casual atmosphere to transform every visit into an experience of relaxation and fun.in our efforts to adapt to a challenging dining environment over the last year, we are excited to have added 70 covered, outdoor seats.  we are thrilled with the increased popularity of outdoor dining and hope that you enjoy our addition!  to accommodate the interests of as many diners as possible, our “all day” menu offers lighter fare, sandwiches, salads and complete dinner entrees from 11:30 until closing daily.  we hope that you enjoy our “bistro” experience and that we will be able to welcome you back soon!
