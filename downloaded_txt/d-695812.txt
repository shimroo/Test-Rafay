convenient local pickup!


in addition to shipping nationally and internationally, ddm offers local pickup for springs and parts. customers in illinois and neighboring states are welcome to stop by our warehouse and pick up parts instead of having them shipped. customers outside of illinois can pick up parts from our suppliers in several states. this saves on shipping costs and allows for same-day do-it-yourself repairs. we do advise calling in advance to ensure the parts are in stock.
