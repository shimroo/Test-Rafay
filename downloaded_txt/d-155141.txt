they make some of the best fire trucks and emergency response vehicles around with the quickest sale to customer rate in the business.




fred w. 









 



as a firefighter, hme is an industry frontrunner in durability and safety. the staff are very knowledgeable and accommodating to visitors.




james m. 









 



life saving equipment is made here. without them fire and rescue wouldn’t be able to do their job.




todd p. 









 



the custom tanker has been a great addition for the johnsonville (ny) fire department. i hope to be able to work with erin maxon (hme dealer) and the rest of the guys from hme again. it was a pleasure.




chief morrissey 









 



we ran our hme at my station for years, with no issues. cal-oes even uses them as reserve engines throughout california. cal-fire has run hme for years. it says something about hme. cal oes is an organization that can have the pick of the litter of any apparatus they choose.
one of my good friends who who was a division chief for cal fire before he retired, swore by them too.




bryan w. waagner 









 



cal fire, the largest fire department in the country runs hme type 1 and type 3 apparatus. i think that speaks volumes about the quality of hme. my former department also ran hme cal oes spec. engine and it was a workhorse of a unit.

engines
hme offers the full spectrum on cummins engines. pushing the boundaries of how power is made, cummins delivers the right technology for fire service applications at the right time. with horsepower ratings of 330 to 605 and torque ratings of 1000 to 1850, we have the cummins power options to get you to and from the fire ground and perform while there.





high air intake
sitting 56” (on average†) above ground, hme’s air in-take is not only easy to access and service but is located high enough to successfully ford water when others won’t. 
† heights vary by chassis and component specifications. 





front suspension
multiple steer axles solutions are available. pictured here, the independent front suspension from reyco granning is a complete assembly that offers less unsprung mass, dynmic camber and easy access to service points. the steertek nxt from hendrickson is a more economical option as a  fabricated axle offering torsional stiffness to accommodate higher brake torque requirements and a softer spring rate enabling greater travel and comfort. 





rear suspension
multiple rear axle solutions are available. the hendrickson firemaxx ex has a cast structural beam and large volume air springs with a dual height control valve configuration to maintain consistent ride height even with unevenly loaded apparatus. available in single and tandem axle configurations, and quick alignment features, the firemaxx is uniquely configured for the fire service.





serviceability
fire apparatus work nearly as hard as firefighters. whether it is preventative maintenance or repairs, managing your hme fleet is made easier with color coded, organized and smartly placed air lines and harnesses. 




























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































the foundational reality 



hme™ fire trucks: built from a stable foundation 



									pump, body, lighting, and other configuration choices are important for sure, but you’ve got to set the right foundation first. with over four decades of cab/chassis building under our belts, hme™ has what you need.

the hme™ team builds a chassis built to last — a core foundation providing the stability to match a firefighter’s resolve. hme™ fire trucks are built for the fight — built to last.
