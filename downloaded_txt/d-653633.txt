after introducing the incompleteness theorem (die vollständigkeit der axiome des logischen funktionenkalküls), gödel turned his attention to einstein’s theory of relativity (zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper). he found new cosmological solutions to einstein’s equations, showing time to behave in unexpected ways. these solutions, known as gödel universes, describe a warped spacetime where it is possible for a spacecraft, traveling at a specific speed with sufficient fuel, to navigate to the past, present, or future.
if in closed time-like curves (gödel-metrik) one would be caught up in the rotation of the universe (including space and time), and could perhaps follow a path through the rotation arriving in the past … granted it’s purportedly a path on the order of n * 10¹² light years. essentially the rotation of the universal immensity would bend potential paths forward into the past.
gödel demonstrated time travel was theoretically possible, and not just a philosophical idea. his findings suggest if time travel were achievable, the concept of time as something passing would be invalid. einstein acknowledged gödel’s contribution but recognized the disturbing implication: if gödel’s results were correct, time itself might be an illusion. this deeply unsettled einstein, despite his praise for gödel’s work.

“but, god, you taught me to love and to help everybody regardless of race and color. and it was you, lord, who directed me to go everywhere i was needed. you sent me to the northside to lay my healing hands on a poor white spinster sick in mind and body. and some black lying snake in this church is trying to show my good works as evil. and about the church’s money, you know how i sacrifice many of my comforts to save church money. i would never steal the church’s money for—”
at the end of our first week in chicago a snowstorm hid the grimy bleakness beneath three feet of glamorous whiteness. cousin bunny made papa smile for the first time in chicago. she gave him a pile of winter work clothes that her dead husband had worn to work sewers and to collect city garbage for twenty years. then she had soldier boy, an acquaintance of hers who was a snow scuffler, pick up papa to help shovel snow from the sidewalks of commercial businesses for a fee.

posted on 2024-03-282024-03-30star of the unborn, this soft but sharp, feeble but shrilly screeching eruption of human rage rising from the extensive turnip field made me forget everything else 

the ancestress asked permission to touch my hand. i respectfully surrendered it to her icy smooth fingers which, no matter how impeccable they looked, felt horrible.

at this point gr³ threw in a remark with her sonorous but suggestive contralto. “i remember those petrified cakes distinctly. i liked them better than the sympaians of today.”
but suddenly he broke off and sagged down in his armchair, and his face seemed to shrivel up as he said to me with gloomy foreboding, “he only promises it, but the others will bring it to pass.”
under the screen of my numbing need of sleep i felt a radiant happiness. “it’s true then,” i mused. “the great naturalistic stupidity and its consequences were finally conquered?” the grand bishop refilled my glass with great deliberation. the crystal hummed like a bell under the impact of the golden wine. i had longed for another drink but had not dared to ask for it.
