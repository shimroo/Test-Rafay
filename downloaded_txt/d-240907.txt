benefits of electric drive


 
economic competition

the global market trend is electrification - the u.s. must win this tech race.


 
energy independence

oil dependence keeps the nation vulnerable to volatile markets - electricity is domestically produced.


 
save drivers money

driving an ev means lower fuel and maintenance costs compared to a traditional gas vehicle.


 
combat climate change

electric drive is a prerequisite to achieving net-zero emissions and makes communities more livable.

frequently asked questions




what is an ev?the suite of electric drive vehicles includes hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles. here is a brief description of the vehicles in the electric drive family:hybrid electric vehicle (hev) - a hybrid electric vehicle uses both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine (ice) to propel the vehicle.plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (phev) - a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle uses electricity obtained by plugging its on-board battery into the grid to power an electric motor. like a pure hybrid, phevs also utilize an ice.battery electric vehicle (bev) - a battery electric vehicle is powered exclusively by electricity from the on-board battery, charged by plugging into the grid.fuel cell electric vehicle (fcev) - a fuel cell electric vehicle converts chemical energy from a fuel, such as hydrogen, into electricity.


how much cleaner are evs than internal combustion engine (ice) vehicles?  evs are the cleaner choice, no matter where you charge your plug-in vehicle in the united states. 93 percent of the country lives where the average ev is better than the most efficient gasoline vehicle (57 mpg) (union of concerned scientists). over their lifetimes, evs on u.s. roads today are projected to emit 60 to 68 percent less climate pollution than comparable ice vehicles (argonne national laboratory).


how is the electric drive market doing?the ev market is growing, with over 5 million evs sold in the united states since 2010. over 1.4 million plug-in evs were sold last year, representing a 51% jump over 2023. over 130 ev models are available today, and over 100 more are set to arrive by 2027. these models offer a variety of prices, capacities, and ranges, ensuring an ev to meet diverse driving needs.unprecedented investments are expanding u.s. manufacturing, charging infrastructure, grid capacity and jobs. private investment in the u.s. electric drive value chain, from companies around the world, has grown to $265 billion since 2021. these investments will add economic benefits and jobs at over 450 new and existing sites (atlas ev hub).employment supported by battery electric vehicles represents the fastest growth of any energy technology – almost 17 times faster than the increase in gasoline and diesel vehicle employment (useer). the electrified vehicle segment – hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery evs and fuel cell evs – supports 373,605 american jobs according to the most recent united states energy employment report (useer). and critical segments in the ev ecosystem, including energy storage, grid technologies and modernization, support 146,811 american jobs, while electricity transmission and distribution support more than 703,000 jobs (useer).
