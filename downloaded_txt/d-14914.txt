welcome to the school of social work



















the school of social work at california state university, san bernardino serves the region’s social work education needs with accredited (cswe) master of social work (msw) and bachelor of arts in social work (basw) degrees.  social work degree programs are offered at both the palm desert campus (pdc) and san bernardino campus (sbc). 
through coursework, practicum education, and extra-curricular activities, our diverse student body gains the knowledge, skills and ethical foundation they need to become effective agents of positive change.
we offer many unique opportunities to students, including:
a generalist perspective in both our msw and basw programs with equal emphasis placed on micro and macro practice.
our distance education msw program in which all coursework is online and all practicums are in the communities where students live.
our title iv-e training program, offered in partnership with the california title iv-e education program, for msw and basw students dedicated to public child welfare practice.
a concurrent master of social work / master of public administration (msw / mpa) degrees program to prepare students for advanced administrative positions in social services.
practicums that fulfill the pupil personnel services (pps) credential hour requirement. students can then choose to finish the credential requirements post-msw at a qualified university and be credentialed to work in public school settings.
the csusb school of social work has active student clubs (swsa, stamp, and phi alpha), highly qualified faculty, and many excellent practicums in settings from health care to public schools.
our alumni now number in the thousands and are leaders in the social work community.
