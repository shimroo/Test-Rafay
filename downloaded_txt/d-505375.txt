arrr, ye all be welcome, mateys!retired commodore stavro arrgolus, editor of the site here.  this is the repository of all comedy music, where you can hear, see and experience mad music, streaming audio shows and videos to your heart's content - all for free. joining our crew costs ye not a farthing. you don't get an offer like that everywhere...looking for an old & funny song you haven't heard in forever? your search may very well be over for it's likely to be here. what if you  just want to hear full streaming comedy shows full of the best music of the dementia genre? we've been cranking them out for more than a dozen years. complete shows made by our djs are here, free to be heard and available immediately with just a click or 3.what's not free? there's always a catch, isn't there? downloading copyrighted songs, that's what. this site is a member of ascap, bmi & sesac in good standing and the copyrighted songs you hear are all legal to stream & be heard. but you can't download them. what you can download are all the creative commons affiliated songs we have. and we have a lot of them.we also have thousands of videos to be seen. so does youtube. but all of ours are of one genre and all in one place. no searching for them; they're all right here.this is another one of those sites you can easily get lost in for hours on end finding songs & videos of years past that you've been missing...it can all be rather addicting, actually. be sure to watch the time so you don't find yourself late for something.so with all that in mind, be ye at ease, pull up a chair, have a flagon of grog & be listenin' to all yer favorite music, old & new.
mad music show still afloat after 19 yearsit's alive! and assuming different forms! right now there are four: the mad music show, the mad music hour, the mad music podcast (here
 and on itunes) and the especially rare mad music special (consisting of
 3 hours or more). old retired commodore stavro arrgolus takes you on a 
twisted trip through the land of dementia when he feels up to making one
 of these shows and you can always request songs for them whenever you
 feel up to it. the shows' strange & off the wall themes usually 
aren't what you'd expect, so every show is crispy fresh. and sometimes 
crunchy. be sure to give the shows a listen...or get keelhauled, matey! arrr!sunday funnies with wacky ben join wacky ben for a half hour adventure into the wonderful world of wackiness every sunday. check out his newly revamped show format for 2025. he's still playing the newest comedy and novelty songs along with all the old classics every week. so kick off your shoes, put your feet up and get ready to laugh with sunday funnies. fiogf49gjkf0dmore than 4000 demented videos to viewsometimes, the listening just isn't enough and you get an unhealthy craving to sit back and fry your brain cells with hours of comedy music videos. captain wayne has the deep-fryer at the ready, so sit back and let those brain cells slowly sizzle while binge watching your favorite comedy music artists doing silly things on video. our improved 'pagination' function gives you more immediate access to every video added to the site. better get to seeing them now while they're still mind meltingly amusing.
