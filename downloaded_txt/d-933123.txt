muscle testing for you, your family, and your pet



the must-have book for every pet lover!
get valuable biofeedback from your fur baby!



muscle testing is a form of biofeedback that reflects subtle changes in the body’s energy systems. it’s a “detector” of sorts—one that costs nothing, is noninvasive, and can give us valuable information to help us and our pets live healthier, happier lives. one of the most exciting things about muscle testing is that a person with little or no training can effectively use these techniques to obtain feedback from the body or the subconscious mind.
