each year, the school of music enrolls more than 200 undergraduate and graduate students. our innovative curriculum in fundamental music skills offers a solid foundation in theory, history and analysis. students can put this knowledge to use while still in school, as part of on-campus and community performing groups.


we are committed to fostering a collaborative environment where students can explore a variety of opportunities in musical performance and education. the school of music is a fully accredited member of the national association of schools of music (nasm), as well as part of the college of communication, fine arts, and media (cfam). 




cfam offers more than $300,000 in scholarships each year.
