 we acknowledge that we are on the unceded lands of kickapoo, kaskaskia, osage, shawnee, myaamia, muskogee, and many other indigenous communities.
while we know this is not enough, we recognize the ground we are on is the traditional territory of these native nations, who were forcibly removed, and that these lands and their living relatives continue to carry the stories of these nations.
