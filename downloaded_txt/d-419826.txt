william messinger, jd & adc (ret)



no one is immune to the powerful grasp of alcohol and drug addiction. wealth, success, educational achievement, social rank and celebrity are no protection from this dangerous disease. while i am no longer accepting clients, my hope is that this website may provide helpful resources for addicts and their loved ones seeking treatment and a path forward. if you are in need of services, i recommend the following resources to find a provider who is well-versed in ongoing recovery management:
