about ivs

 backgroundover 40 years ago, dave snider, who was then the director of recreation at the peoria park district, invited local running enthusiasts to a meeting to start a central illinois running club. ed mcgraw, an aspiring east peoria cross country coach, and steve shostrom, a novice marathoner and energetic labor attorney, were the only two to accept this invitation. this trio founded the illinois valley striders in 1973. during the next year, the illinois valley striders put on two races, a fun run series, and had a membership of nineteen.  
since it's founding, ivs has grown to become one of the premiere membership groups in downstate illinois. ivs hosts events such as the ivs grand prix series, the ivs kids series, the ivs beginner series, the spring stampede10k, and the bridge to bridge run 4 mile., and is widely known as the founding club of the steamboat classic race.  ivs members pride themselves on community involvement through participation in many area wide causes.  as an organization, the striders are committed to the ongoing development of peoria's riverfront. working in alliance with the peoria park district, peoria police and other local government bodies, ivs hosts training runs, group runs and run/ walk races on or near the riverfront.
