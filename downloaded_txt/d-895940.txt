bitches! we here at the asshole factory have taken way too long to get these to you. here are hot pics from brutal honesty's "worst birthday ever" show in february. in the first series of shots we see miss thing herself, brandy barber recant a tale about how her ex man-friend forgot her birthday. they we out to dinner and he made not a mention. fuckwit. howevers, he happened to be in the audience and was pretty angry that brandy would publicly berate him. watch as he shows hostess cupcakes down her throat as she weeps into the mic. he shouted, "you happy now barber? happy fucking birthday." ahhh. relationships like theses are built to last.

 to all that came out tonight, becky, giulia and lianne thank you. it was a packed house.  devito rocks! his tale about his boss farting in a meeting is legendary. baron vaughn worked with a dude that he believes is still in a coma. the good new is that his spirit came back to a co-worker and said not to take his office. like arnold, he'll be back.  the lovely lang had her lighter stolen by courtney love at a temp job. she became a teacher after that.

 i use these when temping.  i also file my nails and chew gum and talk with a whiny secretarial voice.  my hair is always up in a bun and i wear cat eye rhinestone rimmed glasses, because that is who i am.  i am temp.
