additional infothe old pogue distillery is located on the same grounds where the historic h.e. pogue distillery was located and drew its water. the pogue family owns the distillery today and proudly produce small batch rye and bourbon whisky using the same ingredient combinations and methods found in the recipes of their ancestors. the distillers, paul pogue and john pogue, are fifth and sixth generation pogues, respectively. the old pogue property includes the historic home of the pogue family and an artisan distillery, complete with tasting room, grain holding, and barrel storage. the venue sits on the southern bluff of the ohio river valley with eastwardly views of the simon kenton bridge and ohio river.we are a short drive from charming maysville, ky, known as the “birthplace of bourbon.” indeed, today we still enjoy this area’s unique supply of local grains that has served the family’s operations since the beginning of the original distillery in 1876. we invite you to schedule an appointment to tour the distillery and sample our spirits, as well as purchase spirits and merchandise.
