why choose personalized pens and promotional pens as your marketing tools?
whether we are at work or at home, we all use pens everyday. this is the reason
why using promotional pens for advertising and marketing your business is the
best choice. personalized pens can be imprinted with your own message,
company name, website, logo, slogan or event. personalized pens offer the
small business owner a high return on investment. custom pens cost only
pennies each and can remain in use for weeks, months, and even years.
promo pens can be given out at conferences, trade shows or events, left
lying around on counters or in reception areas for visitors to pick up,
or used as part of a direct mail campaign or package insert. personalized
pens are a tangible – and semi-permanent – way to remind customers of your
company, while attracting new customers who see the pens.
promotional pens aren't just for advertising! large corporations, schools,
and other organizations can benefit from low pricing on personalized pens.
add a logo, mascot, or message to imprinted pens or distribute them
throughout your company or event. other uses include weddings, showers,
home parties, church functions, religious quotes, reunions, birth
announcements and teacher to student awards to name a few.
advertising pens give you a lot of punch for a little money!
