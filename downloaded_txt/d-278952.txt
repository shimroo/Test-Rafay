haerat
"i am proud to be a trevor student because i completely agree with the school’s mission and i love this community. even though i cannot be deeply close with everyone, there is a sense of compassion coursing throughout the school. i find it in the simple act of a senior saying hello while holding the door open for me. the community we have built together is what makes trevor, trevor."meet haerat, who joined trevor in the 9th grade and will graduate with the class of 2024. she works on the yearbook and is a part of model un. haerat’s involvement with the yearbook has made her appreciate the creativity and months of hard work that go into creating a publication that will preserve so many memories. 















andrew
"i am proud to be a trevor student because trevor's environment has allowed me to pursue interests that i never thought i would enjoy. the freedom to choose my classes, arts, and clubs has enabled me to develop skills and interests in fields that i never considered my strong suit. these skills have served me not only in the context in which i have learned them, but also in everyday life."meet andrew, who came to trevor in the 4th grade and graduated with the class of 2023. he was an athlete on both the varsity soccer and varsity golf teams, a peer leader, admissions ambassador, writing advisor, science advisor, and a member of the miow (multiple identities one world) club.  at trevor, andrew discovered his love for chemistry. currently taking his fourth chemistry class, andrew has learned to think on a different level, recognizing that, “there is much more to it than putting two liquids in a beaker and seeing what happens. thinking molecularly, rather than on a human scale, has been an eye-opening experience. at times, there is comfort in the chaos; things that you assume would go in one direction go in the other direction. being able to analyze  the principles behind these seemingly illogical actions and conducting our own experiments make chemistry hugely enjoyable.”   















emily
"i am proud to be a trevor student because each and every day, i am supported by a passionate community of educators and peers. trevor has allowed me to pursue all of my interests and has pushed me to be a whole person, not just a student."meet emily, who joined trevor in the 9th grade, and graduated with the class of 2023. emily is the co-founder of the body banter club, which provides a conversation community for body image and mental health, and aims to create a safe space for those who might otherwise suffer in silence. she was also on the student council, a writing advisor, a peer leader, a member of miow (multiple identities, one world), and participates in trevor’s performing arts’ productions. outside of trevor, emily is a camp counselor where she teaches archery.emily’s favorite trevor classes are math and history. her advanced math classes have stretched her to her fullest potential and allowed her to collaborate with her peers. emily has built a strong relationship with her math teachers in and out of the classroom, and appreciates their constant support.















brandon
"i am proud to be a trevor student because i know i’m learning from the best. it feels like family here. what makes trevor unique are the people who work here and the feeling you get when you’re in the building. everyone is down to earth and really cares that you succeed. the teachers want you to learn and are there to help you all the time."meet brandon, who came to trevor in the 5th grade, and graduated with the class of 2023. he was part of the best buddies club, and the life in sports club. brandon was also a star trevor athlete as a member of the varsity baseball team, the varsity basketball team, and, most recently, the varsity soccer team. during the 2021–22 season, brandon helped to lead the varsity basketball team to a nycal championship title, and a very close second-place finish in the state tournament.















karolina
"through my years here, trevor has helped me develop the skills of communication, dedication, and perseverance to tackle life’s challenges. i am proud to be a trevor student because i know that i am in a place that not only values the concept of community, but also the diverse people who actually inhabit a community. the faculty, staff, and students make every student feel special and people are always encouraged to share their opinions and beliefs. everyone has a place in the trevor community."meet karolina, who joined trevor in the 6th grade, and graduated with the class of 2023.karolina is an avid reader, and has always enjoyed her english classes. time and time again, no matter the story, she finds herself engulfed in its lore. she feels that books can teach the reader many things about the world and people around them. karolina has amassed a diverse library of novels and plays, all of which have broadened her horizons and developed her critical thinking.















mikail
"i love the inclusivity of trevor and the amount of opportunities given. i always find myself doing something new and i really appreciate that."meet mikail, who is what is known as a trevor “lifer,” meaning that he first joined the school in kindergarten. he will graduate with the class of 2024.mikail’s favorite subject is math, which he finds both interesting and challenging. he feels “it’s a good way to train your mind.” he enjoys knowing that there is only one right answer, and is excited to discover or develop the process to find it. he also enjoys science exploration, particularly in chemistry. similar to his passion for math, he enjoys critical thinking, specifically as it is needed in experiments. he enjoys hands-on class activities that require him to think critically, form hypotheses, and test them in a lab setting, so that he can verify and report his findings.  















kalina
"i am proud to be a trevor student because of our community: it’s a close-knit group of people from diverse backgrounds with all sorts of different ideas that come together in one place. "meet kalina, who joined trevor in the 9th grade, and will graduate with the class of 2024. her favorite class is mandarin. she decided to pursue mandarin because she wanted to try something altogether new, and a new language was the perfect place to start. she enjoys learning to write new characters and understanding chinese culture. taking mandarin even inspired her to join the chinese culture club.
