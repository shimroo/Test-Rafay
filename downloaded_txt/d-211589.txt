"internet's number one science page!"as seen on mtv, the discovery channel, usa today, fortune magazine and more!thank you for visiting! please be sure to bookmark this page as new content is added almost daily.contactsam barros' powerlabs!

chemlabspowerlabs' chemistry divisionchemlabs' main purpose is to supply the means of carrying out all of powerlabs' chemical procedure needs.

high voltagetesla coils, drivers, & plasma globesthere are different ways to define high voltage. explore powerlabs' research of high voltage devices.

em weaponscoilguns, rail guns, and lasersmy research on electromagnetic weapons does not have as its goal to produce actual weapons but rather to explore some of the very interesting possibilities that this field can have for the benefit of mankind.

general labscryogenics, fuel research, & morehere you will find some of my work and research that does not fit directly under any of the other categories on this page

aboutsam barros & powerlabs' journeyon this page you can find out more about the goals, ambitions, and purpose of powerlabs: why it was created, what it stands for.please donate to powerlabs so i can continue to fund more experiments!welcome!my name is sam barros and this is my webpage, a 20 year effort at documenting some of the various experiments and research i have worked on in different fields of science and technology.here you will find detailed reports including descriptions, pictures, videos, diagrams, schematics and technical data on experiments and devices designed and built by myself over the years, including tesla coils and other various types of high voltage generators, plasma globes, electromagnetic experiments, coil guns, rail guns, lasers, rockets, turbines, electromagnetic propulsion, emp, herf, cryogenics, chemistry and much more! feel free to browse around.

sam@power-labs.comjune: 140kv ac high voltage transformer:powerlabs is equipped to support rigorous quality standards and testing.
january 2012: ee web interview with sam barrosi did an interview for ee web last year; it is a site i enjoy visiting from time to time. here is the interview:

february: railgun 3.0 videoanother spectacular railgun 3.0 video, this one using a plasma armature to propel a polymer projectile.
powerlabs railgun 3.0 fires! i just got back from a 4 day trip to north carolina where, in just 4 days, i was able to completely machine and assemble my 3rd railgun design. testing was made possible by aron kosho, who provided the lab space at his company, resonant power systems, and took it upon himself to design and assemble the switch and power supply. the results were nothing short of spectacular: the gun fired at up to 105kilojoules, and put armatures through an inch of plywood from across the room with no pre-injection of any sort.
don’t take my word for it though! see it here:
more updates to the powerlabs youtube channel ; https://www.youtube.com/powerlabs
stay tuned for an all-new railgun page detailing this exciting new project 🙂
200kv powerlabs voltage multiplier:all new! a 4 stage cockroft-walton cascade fed by a car ignition coil, outputting 200 thousand volts. pictures, description and video now at the page. more to come.
powerlabs' new capacitor bank!i have been enormously lucky to have come across ten units of the very best, highest energy density pulse discharge capacitors i have ever come across. it wasn’t cheap, but these capacitors will mark a whole new era of pulse discharge research at powerlabs! highlights will include a new, railgun 3.0, which will have more stored energy than most research guns found at university labs.
each individual capacitor is rated as 12kv, 266uf, and stored as much energy as the entire capacitor bank on the previous powerlabs railgun. even more impressive; they only weight 36lbs (16kg) each!
electro thermal gun 2.0this is my current project; it will utilize one of the 20kj units pictured above and be switched by a thyratron. the drawings are now done and renderings are posted on the etc gun site.
i need $800 for materials, so it’ll be a little while until it gets built.
october 2008: sam barros on tv again!you may probably be wondering what happened with the railgun 2.0… did it work? did it fire?
and what have i been up to?
well… we filmed this episode with workoholic productions over the summer, and it features my first railgun firings, as well as an all-new lightning gun produced by kva effects which just needs to be seen to be believed!
older updatesjuly: prepare to be amazed!(photo by kelly drews photography)
what happens if you discharge 9000 joules through a watermelon in the form of a 9 thousand volt, half million ampere discharge? the picture above is a preview. more to come!
june: directed energy research!thanks to a generous donation from robert brown, i now have laser optics! here is a picture of what the output of the laser does to polycarbonate when focused into a spot less than 1mm in diameter: the plasma that forms is so bright i have to wear brazing goggles! check out the powerlabs laser page for pictures. videos coming soon!
january: more electromagnetic acceleration research...the microwave gun is back: by popular demand… since this was such a popular project, i hereby present you the new microwave gun: 30degree beam dispersion, 2kw power input… the page will be up soon!
powerlabs electro-thermal gunwork continues on the powerlabs electro-thermal gun, the only one of its kind online!
railgun2: i have decided to hold off on the first firing videos until the discovery channel episode about it airs.
valveless pulsejet powered boatvalveless pulsejet powered boat coming soon (project completed, waiting for test videos)
what am i working on now?this webpage is currently being redesigned to an easier to navigate format.
powerlabs rail gun (2.0) done, powerlabs railgun 3.0 has been fired!
electrothermalgun 2: being machined
supercharged corvette: because life is too short to drive a slow car.
high efficiency, igbt-switched coilgun: being designed.
if you’ve e-mailed me recently and i haven’t gotten back to you, your e-mail has probably been lost. i switched computers and was away from my e-mail for several weeks so now i have over one thousand e-mail messages, a lot of which are spam. if i haven’t replied to you please write again.
what's next?the future:–the rail gun is done, it works, it could be better. i want to build a 3rd railgun incorporating all new techniques that i couldn’t afford to before; a pulse shaping network, more stored energy, external field augmentation… this will of course take money… why not donate?
– i am working on a new type of coilgun that has never been tried before.
– all parts have been gathered for a 450kv marx generator and the 1mw nitrogen pulsed laser, these projects are on queue after the rail gun research.
– future topics should include electrostatic propulsion (lifters), more rocket engines and others, as time and money permits. as always, suggestions, money and sponsorships are very welcome 🙂
