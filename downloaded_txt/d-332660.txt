how to submit your book for review:
due to ridiculously high review-copy volume, the site is currently closed to small press and self-publisher submissions. my apologies.

latest additions 



 
after 15 years, sfreviews.net is becoming sff180.com!
over the remainder of 2016 (and for however long it takes), the entire review archive of the original site will be moved over to the new domain. as this will take time, the original site will remain up and running until it's all been transferred.
the original site will no longer be updated with new written reviews. all new material will appear at the new domain henceforth.
thank you all for going on this 15-year journey with me, and i invite you  cordially to the next phase of its evolution!


"in the arts, the critic is the only independent source of information. the rest is advertising." —pauline kael
"if you are in difficulties with a book, try the element of surprise: attack it at an hour when it isn't expecting it." —h.g. wells
