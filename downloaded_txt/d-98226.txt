rusty acres ranch is a working
  farm located in the heart of the sacramento
  valley just north of woodland. wheat, processing tomatoes, and
  sunflowers are grown in rotation on our farm. i collect
  and restore old tractors. most of my collection are john deere's
  from the 1930's through the 1950's, but i also have some oliver
  tractors from the same era, as well as one lunger engines and
  a 1924 fageol.
