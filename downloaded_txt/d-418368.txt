sandusky personal injury lawyersohio expertise, national excellence.at murray & murray, we know that you need both legal guidance and moral support after being in an accident and suffering a serious injury. ever since our law firm first opened its doors in 1931, we have been proudly delivering just that and so much more for the people of sandusky, ohio. from car accidents and truck accidents to wrongful death and class actions, we are the law firm you can trust to effectively handle your claim while giving you the time and space needed to rest and recuperate as best you can.when we accept a new case, we ask ourselves two things first and foremost: “what do we need to do to best help our new client and friend?” and “will this case likely go to trial?” whereas many other law firms in ohio shy away from the courtroom, we roll up our sleeves and dig in when a trial becomes necessary. it’s all part of the murray & murray difference that has kept us as a local favorite for close to a century.

dennis e. murray jr.

			"placing that final piece to reveal the entire picture is what drew me to this profession. when a client trusts me to tell their story and bring them justice, that gives me the same satisfaction."
		












charles m. murray

			"no different than most kids, i dreamt of being a hero as a child—and there was no bigger hero in my life than my father. he often told us stories about the people who were relying on him to resolve their tragedies; i always knew that was the kind of person i wanted to be."
		












margaret m. murray

			"i work to be an advocate for my clients and help them in the best and most meaningful way possible. presenting a case to the court and having the clients understand just how much we care about their very personal and individual claims is very important to me."
		












james l. murray

			"the relationships with my clients are built through hours of listening and working together. that is what makes my job worthwhile. it is a great thrill when i get to tell clients that we’ve won a case and that they will be able to rebuild or improve their lives as a result of our hard work together."
		












florence a. murray

			"fairness has always been my driving force—knowing that no one ever deserves or wants to be in a situation where they need an attorney. i believe that one of the greatest joys in life is interacting with and helping other people, and it’s this knowledge that i take with me to my practice every day."
		












nolan e. murray

			"i treat each case and client as unique and strive zealously to advocate for the very real and personal issues facing them. at murray & murray, providing first-rate counsel is not an ambition, it is an expectation."
		












kelly e. murray

			"my focus is on providing steadfast support to our clients by leveraging the strength of nearly 100 years of success to ensure that justice is not just an aspiration, but a tangible reality for those we represent."
		












dennis e. murray sr.

			"after over 50 years of practicing law, i still remember my first class-action lawsuit for the civil rights of women and persons of color. that’s my dedication—to give 100% effort to every moment that i work on each case."
		












william h. bartle

			"working with my clients to prepare for trial and seeing them through the entire process from beginning to the very end gives me as much satisfaction today as it did when i began my career."
		












donna jean a. evans

			"i’ve been involved in many complex litigations for both class action and individual suits, giving my all to each case. it’s why i love my job; it allows me to fight for the victim."
