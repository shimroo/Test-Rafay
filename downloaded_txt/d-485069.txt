link'd in: notes from the superintendent











special weather edition 2/18/2025

at the moment, i’m sure everyone is aware that mother nature controls our weather patterns. without a doubt, this winter (since january) has been brutal, with both precipitation and historic low temperatures. punxsutawney phil was definitely not messing around when he saw his shadow on groundhog day earlier this month. needless to say, the weather has impacted our school schedule.

notes from the superintendent, 2/7/2025

how is it already the month of february? last saturday was groundhog day, and punxsutawney phil did indeed see his shadow, which has been translated to mean at least six more weeks of winter. i’m hoping that proves incorrect.
