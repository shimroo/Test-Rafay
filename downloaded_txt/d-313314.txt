 history:
forest
                  conservancy district boards, referred to as
                forestry boards, function in all 23 maryland countries
                and baltimore city. the county boards were established
                by law in 1943 by the maryland department of natural
                resources (dnr). the baltimore city forestry board held
                its first meeting in june 1987.

the baltimore city board is
                composed of individuals who serve voluntarily to promote
                and nurture the expansion of the urban canopy so as to
                improve the health and welfare of baltimore's
                residents. 

                all members of the board are unpaid volunteers who work
                closely with state foresters. members are formally
                appointed by the director of the maryland dnr-forest
                service on the recommendation of the chairman and
                members of the board in consultation with our local dnr
