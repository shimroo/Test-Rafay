about us – welcome 

campus travel management was founded in annapolis, md in 1994.  our extensive experience in the industry began at a time of practices and technology that seem primitive by today’s standards. watching the industry evolve has greatly informed our  perspective and refocused our interests.
chief among them has been the needs of colleges and universities – public and private, large and small. initially we provided assistance to  institutions in their role as purchasers of travel services. over time our focus has shifted to a greater appreciation for the value of colleges and universities as destinations – drawing parents, students,  alumni, academics and many others to their campuses.  we are proud to be at the forefront of efforts to facilitate the needs and interests of both of these groups by offering our current services – connecting a curated listing of hotel properties at these campus destinations to the public they serve.
