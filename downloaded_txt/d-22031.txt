our story





















































partners 





 









we are proud to have been chosen as the air partner for over 250 tour operators, trip advisers, destination management companies, tourism boards and industry associations that share our passion for adventure, exploration and discovery. we deftly manage their travelers’ flights while seamlessly integrating our booking and communications into our partners’ planning process. 





















































agencies 





 









we provide tools and product access to travel agents who want to develop and grow their businesses and offer additional services and competitive fares to their customers. our commitment to sharing knowledge and providing training opportunities to the agents we work with is an investment that strengthens the respect travelers have for our profession. 











































































groups 





 









							planning a trip for yourself may seem challenging, but those with experience know that those challenges are completely different for a group.  there are deadlines, rules and negotiations that are specific to people traveling together that are not present for regular flight reservations.						





















































travelers 





 









imagine having your own airfare guru: an expert and advocate there for you at every stage of the journey. researching a competitive fare is just the start. we tailor flights to your personal preferences — from favorite airline and class of service, to routing that minimizes carbon footprint; from shortest total travel time, to lie flat seats or extended legroom.
