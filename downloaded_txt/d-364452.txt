let’s go!
first news item
standing up for truth by stepping down:  
the top federal prosecutor in manhattan stepped down thursday — days after president trump’s department of justice ordered her office to drop its corruption case against mayor eric adams, sources said.
danielle sassoon’s sudden resignation as acting us attorney for the southern district of new york came days after the doj’s no. 2, emil bove, directed the veteran prosecutor to move to dismiss the bribery and wire fraud case against adams.

here is a portion of sassoon’s letter to attorney general pam bondi:  
 because the law does not support a dismissal, and because i am confident that adams committed the crimes with which he is charged, i cannot agree to seek a dismissal driven by improper considerations. as justice robert jackson explained, “the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent forces in our society, when he acts from malice or other base motives, he is one of the worst.” the federal prosecutor, 24 j. am. jud. soc’y 18 (“this authority has beengranted by people who really wanted the right thing done—wanted crime eliminated—but also wanted the best in our american traditions preserved.”). i understand my duty as a prosecutor to mean enforcing the law impartially, and that includes prosecuting a validly returned indictment regardless whether its dismissal would be politically advantageous, to the defendant or to those who appointed me. a federal prosecutor “is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.” berger v. united states, 295 u.s. 78, 88 (1935).
for the reasons explained above, i do not believe there are reasonable arguments in supportof a rule 48(a) motion to dismiss a case that is well supported by the evidence and the law. i understand that mr. bove disagrees, and i am mindful of your recent order reiterating prosecutors’duty to make good-faith arguments in support of the executive branch’s positions. see feb. 5,2025 mem. “general policy regarding zealous advocacy on behalf of the united states.” but because i do not see any good-faith basis for the proposed position, i cannot make such arguments consistent with my duty of candor. n.y.r.p.c. 3.3; id. cmt. 2 (“a lawyer acting as an advocate in an adjudicative proceeding has an obligation to present the client’s case with persuasive force.performance of that duty while maintaining confidences of the client, however, is qualified by the advocate’s duty of candor to the tribunal.”).

a little quid-pro-quo, eh?  iow, business as usual for trump and company.  what to do, what to do…
with that, it’s pretty incredible that sassoon has so meticulously outlined her position.  there really can’t be any doubt of her rightness in this matter.  so convinced is she, that she’d rather resign than participate in this foul soup of lies and i’ll-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine plan.  i am curious as to how pam bondi is going to react to sassoon’s well-cited resources and arguments.  will she just be angry that she has been forced into a tight spot between behaving honorably or satisfying trump or will she meet with sassoon?  it seems clear where bove and adam’s loyalties reside.
yet another serious resignation letter from a line prosecutor:

eric adams line prosecutor hagan scotten, submitting his resignation rather than filing "dismissal-with-leverage" motion:
"i expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. but it was never going to be me."

they never skip an opportunity to make money.  ethics is never part of the equation:  
“we licensed the upcoming melania trump documentary film and series for one reason and one reason only—because we think customers are going to love it,” said an amazon spokesman. 
the first lady’s cut is more than 70% of the $40 million, according to people familiar with the matter. and they’re still looking for more: melania’s agent has been trying to sell “sponsorships” for the film—starting at $10 million—to prominent ceos and billionaires who were at the inauguration, according to people familiar with the matter. buyers would get thanked at the end of the credits and be invited to the premiere.

third news item
conflicting statements from trump and vance re ukraine and nato:  
speaking to the wall street journal on thursday, vance said the option of sending us troops to ukraine was “on the table,” as well as economic punishment if a peace deal doesn’t guarantee kyiv’s long-term independence.
“there are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” vance told the newspaper.
on arrival in munich vance said nato remains an important alliance for the united states.
“europe is of course a very important ally to the united states, nato is a very important military alliance … but we want to make sure nato is actually built for the future, and part of that is ensuring that nato does a little bit more burden-sharing in europe so the united states can focus on some of our challenges in east asia,” vance said, speaking to reporters beside nato secretary general mark rutte.
good to see this from vance.   i suspect trump will publicly humiliate the vice-president for this breach, sooner rather than later.
p.s.  his actual speech before european leaders hit differently.  apparently, russia or china are *not* the biggest threat around . . . 
 “the threat i worry most about vis-à-vis europe isn’t russia, not china, it’s not any external actor. what i worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of europe from some of its most fundamental values”
fourth news item
judge tells trump “no”:
 the trump administration must temporarily allow the disbursement of foreign aid, a judge ruled thursday, dealing the latest blow to the administration’s sweeping efforts to halt international aid.
the court order came in response to a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups that work on international aid projects, as well as other organizations.
. . . 
the judge said in his ruling that the administration has not yet “meaningfully contested detailed and credible evidence of harm to countless american businesses, ranging from shutting down programs, to furloughing and laying off employees, to shuttering altogether.”
fifth news item
incredible.  deport *real* criminal aliens. . . and make sure they don’t sneak back in:  
ice officers in houston deported humberto romero avila, a 45-year-old paisas gang member and foreign fugitive who entered the us illegally ten!!! times, back to mexico.
romero is wanted in mexico for allegedly murdering geovany uriel prado morales, a 22-year-old mexican national, dec. 2, 2007, in celaya, guanajuato, mexico.
entries 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5: he entered the us illegally march 22, 2002; june 14, 2002; june 16, 2002; june 20, 2002; and march 3, 2005. each time, he was kicked back to mexico the same day he entered.
6. romero was able to sneak across as a gotaway his sixth time entering the us. then, ice found him in 2012 nacogdoches county jail after his dui arrest. 
ice lodged a detainer, took him into custody and deported him days later.
7. however, that didn’t stop him. and again he crossed the border illegally again as a gotaway. ice found him in aug. 2013 at the shelby county jail following a larceny and dwi arrest.

but of course:   
the senate voted on thursday to confirm robert f. kennedy jr. health and human services secretary, a victory for president donald trump after kennedy faced intense scrutiny over his controversial views on vaccines and public health policy.
the 52-48 vote was largely along party lines, though republican sen. mitch mcconnell of kentucky once again joined with democrats to oppose the nomination. mcconnell has now voted against three of trump’s cabinet nominees, more than any other republican senator.
(polio survivor) mitch mcconnell’s statement on the vote:  
 “this administration – led by the same president who delivered a medical miracle with project warp speed – deserves a leader who is willing to acknowledge without qualification the efficacy of life-saving vaccines and who can demonstrate an understanding of basic elements of the u.s. healthcare system,” mcconnell said. “mr. kennedy failed to prove he is the best possible person to lead america’s largest health agency.”
what is there left to say about another catastrophe in the making?  not much, other than between kennedy, gabbard, and hegseth, one can be assured that we are not in the best of hands.

[guest post by dana]
one thing we can say with certainty concerning russia’s illegal invasion of ukraine and the subsequent war,  is that the very thing that vladimir putin is definitely not interested in, is peace.  especially not with president zelensky and the ukrainian people.  the reason we know this is that russian troops have not been ordered out of ukraine and the illegally occupied territories are not under ukraine’s authority. moreover, when putin is aggressively continuing the advance on ukraine every single day and with another attack on kyiv tonight, what makes anyone think he wants peace?  what a childishly dangerous notion.
additionally, while there has certainly been “totally unnecessary, death and destruction,” it’s vital to name the one who caused it in the first place.  and in this case, without a doubt,  all of the responsibility and guilt lay solely with vladimir putin. full stop.  to not make this unequivocally clear at every opportunity is to intentionally insinuate that president zelensky also caused “totally unnecessary, death and destruction,” which is not accurate.
thus, president trump’s comments about the situation, while unsurprising, are troubling. some might excuse him, saying that he is just trying to be even-handed before peace talks happen, or perhaps he is making sure he doesn’t irk his pal vlad, with whom he chatted with for 90 minutes on the phone.   regardless, i can’t give him the benefit of the doubt.  he doesn’t deserve it:  his history gives proof of that.  especially, especially  when he equates president putin with president zelensky:
i just spoke to president volodymyr zelenskyy of ukraine. the conversation went very well. he, like president putin, wants to make peace. we discussed a variety of topics having to do with the war, but mostly, the meeting that is being set up on friday in munich, where vice president jd vance and secretary of state marco rubio will lead the delegation. i am hopeful that the results of that meeting will be positive. it is time to stop this ridiculous war, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, death and destruction. god bless the people of russia and ukraine!
plus:

reporter: do you view ukraine as an equal member of this peace process?

dumb ukraine, choosing to go to war with russia!! what a bunch of chumps! 
with each passing day, i fear more and more for ukraine’s future.  watching the president of the united states make an absolutely insane statement like the one above, and being too afraid (or too complicit with putin) to put the blame for the war where it belongs, is utterly demoralizing.  this, especially when coupled with u.s. defense secretary pete hegseth’s comments yesterday that the u.s. does not believe that ukraine becoming a member of nato is  a “realistic outcome” of any  negotiated peace settlement and that russia should be allowed to keep some of ukraine’s territories. 
there is only one way for this war to end with ukraine not being subsumed by russia and europe not having to prepare for war.

confirmed:  
the senate has voted, 52-48, to confirm tulsi gabbard as trump’s director of national intelligence. sen. mitch mcconnell, r-ky., was the only republican to vote no on her nomination. every democrat voted no.

from mcconnell:  
 “tulsi gabbard failed to demonstrate that she is prepared to assume this tremendous national trust. the nation should not have to worry that the intelligence assessments the president receives are tainted by a dni with a history of alarming lapses in judgment.”
too bad there wasn’t anything mcconnell could’ve done a few years back to prevent tulsi from ever becoming even a nominee for the director of national intelligence…
anyway, no word on whether she received a congratulatory call from pal, bashar al-assad, but i hear that her confirmation is a dream come true for putin.

associated press reporter blocked by white house

this has to be a first:
the associated press says the white house blocked it from covering an official event on tuesday because it did not refer to the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america.
ap executive editor julie pace said that the white house informed the news agency that its journalists would be barred from attending president trump’s signing of a new executive order because it had not aligned its language with trump’s preferred name for the body of water.
here is a statement released by the ap concerning the matter: 
. . .today we were informed by the white house that if ap did not align its editorial standards with president donald trump’s executive order renaming the gulf of mexico as the gulf of america, ap would be barred from accessing an event in the oval office. this afternoon ap’s reporter was blocked from attending an executive order signing.
it is alarming that the trump administration would punish ap for its independent journalism. limiting our access to the oval office based on the content of ap’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the first amendment. 
fire released a statement on behalf of the ap:
punishing journalists for not adopting state-mandated terminology is an alarming attack on press freedom. that’s viewpoint discrimination, and it’s unconstitutional.
president trump has the authority to change how the u.s. government refers to the gulf. but he cannot punish a news organization for using another term. the role of our free press is to hold those in power accountable, not to act as their mouthpiece. any government efforts to erode this fundamental freedom deserve condemnation.

what,  we still can’t say merry christmas??!!:
 president donald trump said thursday that he wants to root out “anti-christian bias” in the u.s., announcing that he was forming a task force led by attorney general pam bondi to investigate the “targeting” of christians.
speaking at a pair of events in washington surrounding the the national prayer breakfast, trump said the task force would be directed to “immediately halt all forms of anti-christian targeting and discrimination within the federal government, including at the doj, which was absolutely terrible, the irs, the fbi — terrible — and other agencies.”
trump said bondi would also work to “fully prosecute anti-christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of christians and religious believers nationwide.”
second news item 
tucker carlson outs himself, yet again, as a putin cheerleader:  
“the first trait of a dictator is that he is not elected,” carlson exclaimed while mocking morgan’s support of the ukraine leader. “zelensky is not elected. he has also banned a religious denomination, killed his political opponents, and banned a language group. to me, these all seem like traits of a dictatorship. the governments of the usa and the uk support this dictator.”
to which president zelensky responded:
ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky tore into tucker carlson for calling him a “dictator” who has banned free elections, telling piers morgan on tuesday that the former fox news star should “stop licking” vladimir putin’s “a**” and “stop working” for the russian leader.
p.s.  tucker carlson was seen entering the white house today. . .
third news item
usaid personnel cuts:
usaid will cut nearly all staff, reducing its workforce from over 10,000 employees to 290.
trump and musk have criticized usaid for being wasteful and supporting liberal causes.
usaid spent $32.5 billion in 2024, focusing on health and humanitarian aid.
federal workers are suing to stop the dismantling of the us agency for international development, which faces cuts to nearly all of its over 10,000 staff by friday.
the cuts would reduce employment numbers to 294, randy chester, vice president of the american foreign service association at usaid, said in a press conference on thursday announcing a lawsuit against president donald trump and members of his administration that seeks injunctive relief to halt the cuts.
sadly and frustratingly, “the stop-work order on u.s.a.i.d.-funded research has left thousands of people with experimental drugs and devices in their bodies, with no access to monitoring or care.” 
p.s.  and for godsake, republicans, get your usaid stories straight if you’re going to try and sell this to the american people because we’re all just rolling our eyes at the lunatic claims:  usaid spent $15 million for condoms for the taliban!! usaid spent $50 million for condoms in gaza!! or maybe it was $100 million like president trump allegedly said!!
fourth news item
trump nominee invested in chinese company accused of using slave labor, won’t divest: 
trump nominee kash patel disclosed he’s receiving $1 million-$5 million in shares of a cayman islands holding company directly tied to a chinese corporation the senate & a pro-trump nonprofit accuse of “slave labor.” patel says he won’t divest. 
patel’s disclosure says that his shares in the company—elite depot ltd—would begin vesting feb. 1, two days after his senate confirmation hearing, will continue to vest through november, and that he won’t back out.
but patel appears to have lied about or misrepresented the company on his disclosure, claiming under penalty of perjury it was a “fashion management company.” but it filed as an “equity holding company” in the cayman islands. equity in what, you ask?
fifth news item
if not for the courts:  
a federal judge on thursday paused the trump administration’s “buyout” offer for federal employees hours before it was set to expire.
multiple judges have now ordered freezes on president trump’s plan to end birthright citizenship.
lawsuits involving elon musk’s takeover of federal agencies are just getting started, but they’re already resulting in some limits on the doge team.
the big picture: the courts are one of the only real threats to slow or stop substantial parts of trump’s agenda — and they’re doing it.
sixth news item
raise your hand if you’re surprised:  
at least 12 people pardoned by president donald trump in his first and second terms—including two last week—have since been apprehended by the police.
. . .
trump pardoned 238 people in his first term and has already pardoned more than 1,500 capitol rioters following his reelection, as well as seven people involved in blockading a michigan abortion clinic in 2020.
at least 10 people pardoned between 2016 to 2021, and two people pardoned last week, were charged again on new crimes after their presidential release from prison. a third capitol rioter remains on the run from police due to a prior warrant.
seventh news item
so essentially helping putin:  
since moscow began to systematically demolish ukraine’s energy system with missiles and drones around october 2022, the us agency for international development (usaid) has played a critical role in supporting kyiv to rebuild its grid. it has committed at least $800 million to procure and deliver transformers, power cables, gas generators, and other hardware, nearly matching the $1 billion raised by europe’s ukrainian energy support fund. that work is now in jeopardy after us president donald trump abruptly froze aid payments, put thousands of usaid employees globally on leave, and is considering shutting the agency altogether.
as temperatures drop and massive attacks triggering blackouts persist, emergency energy-equipment deliveries are stuck in poland, western officials told semafor — and hundreds of expats tasked with putting it to use are leaving ukraine because they can’t function without usaid funding and oversight.
eighth news item
another anti-putin russian “accidentally” falls out window to his death:   
a russian singer who called vladimir putin an “idiot” and allegedly donated to the ukrainian military has died after falling from the window of his 10th-floor apartment, according to reports.
vadim stroykin fell to his death during police searches over his alleged links to ukraine, russian media outlets said on thursday.
he was facing up to 20 years in prison if charged and convicted of supporting a terrorist organisation for his alleged backing of the ukrainian army, they said.
mr stroykin is said to have stepped into his kitchen for a glass of water before being found dead on the ground outside.

interesting observations regarding last year’s supreme court immunity ruling:  
in her first public remarks since president trump took office about two weeks ago, sotomayor said she worried that the supreme court has departed too far from public sentiment, when asked about dwindling public confidence in the court.
“if we as a court go so much further ahead of people, our legitimacy is going to be questioned,” sotomayor told an audience in kentucky wednesday evening.
“i think the immunity case is one of those situations,” she continued. “i don’t think that americans have accepted that anyone should be above the law in america. our equality as people was the foundation of our society and of our constitution. i think my court would probably gather more public support if it went a little more slowly in undoing precedent,” she said.
“our constitution itself has provisions not exempting the president from criminal activity after an impeachment,” sotomayor said. “so, i had a hard time with the immunity case. and if we continue going in directions that the public is going to find hard to understand, we’re placing the court at risk.”
sotomayor said wednesday she worried that frequent court reversals of long-established legal precedent “creates instability” and contributes to the public questioning “of whether we’re doing things because of legal analysis or because of partisan views.”

this, which is now being reported, will make russia very happy:  
the champagne corks are popping in penthouses from moscow to caracas tonight. oligarchs maybe can finally get their yachts back, and kleptocrats worldwide are updating their zillow searches for miami beachfront property.
why? our sources say that just after 7:30 p.m. in washington, d.c., yesterday, trump’s newly appointed attorney general pam bondi sent out an email announcing the immediate closure of the department of justice’s kleptocracy initiative and its associated task force – the very unit responsible for making life difficult for the world’s most creative accountants and their politically-connected clients.
below the radar, however, is an even more alarming development. sources say one of the key objectives behind this sudden move is to gain control of what’s believed to be a multi-billion dollar forfeiture fund under doj control. this fund, historically used to return stolen assets to victim countries, will now reportedly be redirected to what bondi’s memo cryptically describes as “other” law enforcement purposes.
multiple sources familiar with the matter say this is code for funding new detention facilities in guantanamo bay and texas. nothing says “america first” quite like using money recovered from foreign corruption to build domestic detention centers.
anne applebaum responds to the news:  
and there it is:  doors are open for kleptocracy in america.
russia will be very, very please with president trump. and isn’t that what it’s all about.

“they’re gonna have peace,” trump said of the palestinians he wants to displace from palestine. “they’re not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilization of wonderful people has had to endure. the only reason the palestinians wanna go back to gaza is they have no alternative. it’s right now a demolition site. this is just a demolition site. virtually every building is down. they’re living under fallen concrete that’s very dangerous and very precarious.”
the u.s. will take over the gaza strip and we will do a job with it too. we’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings. level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. do a real job. do something different. just can’t go back. if you go back, it’s gonna end up the same way it has for 100 years.
moreover, the president echoed jared kushner’s comments made last year that gaza could be a luxury resort:  
“we’re going to take over that piece that we’re going to develop it.  we have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. and i don’t want to be cute, i don’t want to be a wise guy, but the riviera of the middle east, this could be something that could be so — this could be so magnificent.”
just the president popping off with another hare-brained scheme that his supporters are going to try and convince us that he is playing 4-dimensional chess and we just don’t understand?  or just more political theater?
at the second link above you can read how neighboring nations, political leaders, palestinians and israelis are reacting to the president’s developer’s pie-in-the-sky dreams.
and just for fun:
