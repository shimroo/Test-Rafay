speculative light, edited by amy j. elias
“[a] vibrant, timely, and vital collection of essays that illuminate how we can read james baldwin through beauford delaney’s paintings and see delaney’s paintings through baldwin’s writing. placing the lives and works of these two close friends side by side tells us much about kinship, intimacy, and craft, not only in relation to delaney and baldwin but in african american culture more broadly.”—douglas field

sounds of black switzerland
jessie cox


                                    “interspersing interstitial events of detailed listening with theoretical formulations derived from that listening, jessie cox teaches us about the specificities and varieties of black life in switzerland. he notes the fateful and fatal commonalities, particularly those that concern not just the problematic of identity but also the various forms of resistant survival that are given as refusals to identity. an extraordinary provocation and inspiration, sounds of black switzerland prompts ecstatic responses and overwhelming questions.”

                                        - fred moten, author of black and blur








prosthetic memories
hyaesin yoon


                                    “in this cutting-edge book, hyaesin yoon presents decisively new material, analyses, and theoretical contributions to the field of feminist science and technology studies, postcolonial studies, and posthuman studies in outstanding ways. she investigates multilayered aspects of the ways in which bodies and body parts of colonized subjects and animals are instrumentalized as part of transnational capitalist and biopolitical exchange circuits, thereby outlining how bodies can work as mnemonics for new feminist, antiracist, and decolonial politics.”

                                        - nina lykke, author of vibrant death: a posthuman phenomenology of mourning








ne me quitte pas
maya angela smith


                                    “maya angela smith makes a persuasive case for ‘ne me quitte pas’ as a cultural artifact that survives, travels, perpetuates itself across versions, languages, and audiences—one that is regularly translated and in turn translates its performers and audiences, so that each version has its own autonomy in difference. this insightful book is for anyone who has needed music as a source for transformation.”

                                        - joshua clover, author of 1989: bob dylan didn’t have this to sing about








under pressure
max brzezinski


                                    “in this provocative, cutting-edge, and gorgeously written book, max brzezinski complicates the conventional understanding of the duet by making sense of david bowie’s and freddie mercury’s distinct contributions while arguing that the subject of the song is people. brzezinski’s interpretations are simultaneously clever and historically grounded, leaving no stone unturned. under pressure sets the bar for popular music writing.”

                                        - richard t. rodríguez, author of a kiss across the ocean: transatlantic intimacies of british post-punk and us latinidad








the time beneath the concrete
abourahme, nasser


                                    “nasser abourahme’s brilliant and unique study provides a vital political grammar to understand the making of palestinian refugee camps and to contend with the most pressing aspects of dispossession and displacement in contemporary capitalism’s racial colonial order. in this thematically wide-ranging and impeccably researched book, abourahme urges us to think beyond the sovereign and propertied logics of the plot, border, and settlement, and instead to consider a politics of ‘inhabitation’ as a counterpolitical force—so evident in palestinians’ cultures of resistance—and as a concept and praxis for the global dispossessed.”

                                        - brenna bhandar, author of colonial lives of property: law, land, and racial regimes of ownership








feminism and the cinema of experience
lori jo marso


                                    “camerawork is motherwork: beyond any opposition between activity and passivity, care and creation, singularity and commonality. lori jo marso’s new book exhorts us to join in nothing less than the feminist project of transforming the world. in the meantime, it holds us, like the films it discusses, in a space where we can bear and explore our anxiety, ambivalence, even dread. a must-read for anybody who has access to a camera.”

                                        - domietta torlasco, author of the rhythm of images: cinema beyond measure








nuyorican and diasporican visual art


                                    “an indispensable volume that traces the formation of nuyorican identity through the intersections of visual and performance art with urban activist politics. the art of all marginalized people is inherently political, and these cogent and impactful essays by an array of quintessential contributors are a loving tribute to puerto rico’s rapidly expanding diasporic arts community. from the nuyorican poets café to taller boricua to barrio aesthetics in philadelphia, chicago, and beyond, nuyorican and diasporican visual art finally brings a long-ignored story to light.”

                                        - ed morales, author of fantasy island: colonialism, exploitation, and the betrayal of puerto rico








marx for cats
leigh claire la berge


                                    “marx for cats is an undomesticated and indefinable meow de coeur. you can open this book anywhere---it's a marxist choose your own adventure---and come away as unsettled, possessed, and reflective as any transportative encounter with a cat might leave you.”

                                        - jordy rosenberg, author of confessions of the fox








in the wake
christina sharpe


                                    "christina sharpe brings everything she has to bear on her consideration of the violation and commodification of black life and the aesthetic responses to this ongoing state of emergency. through her curatorial practice, sharpe marshals the collective intellectual heft and aesthetic inheritance of the african diaspora to show us the world as it appears from her distinctive line of sight. a searing and brilliant work."

                                        - saidiya hartman, author of  lose your mother: a journey along the atlantic slave route








black disability politics
sami schalk


                                    “black disabled genius is crucial to the work of creating a free present and future. in black disability politics, sami schalk does so much absolutely brilliant black queer disabled femme labor of surfacing buried black disabled activist histories and organizing lessons. her book is a black queer disabled love offering, and reading it made me shout for joy and learn so much. i’m so grateful this book is in the world. read it and give thanks that we get to share the world with the brilliance of schalk and the organizers she writes about—then get to work putting into practice the lessons you’ve learned, so we can win.”

                                        - leah lakshmi piepzna-samarasinha, author of care work: dreaming disability justice








raving
mckenzie wark


                                    “passionately exploring queer rave culture, raving is the fantasy and the moment. there are drugs and sex, tangled love affairs, rejection, the highs and lows of the dance floors, and all the messiness that makes up a rave evening. a potent book.”

                                        - madison moore, author of fabulous: the rise of the beautiful eccentric








living a feminist life
sara ahmed


                                    “from the moment i received sara ahmed’s new work, living a feminist life, i couldn’t put it down. it’s such a brilliant, witty, visionary new way to think about feminist theory. everyone should read this book. it offers amazing new ways of knowing and talking about feminist theory and practice. and, it is also delightful, funny, and as the song says, ‘your love has lifted me higher.’ ahmed lifts us higher.”

                                        - bell hooks
