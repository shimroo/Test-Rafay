lcmc health is committed to providing individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from lcmc health programs and services. we offer reasonable accommodations, including access to service animals, to ensure our programs and services are accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
service animals are welcome throughout all of our clinics and hospitals. we apply the americans with disabilities act (ada) requirements, which define a service animal as “one that is trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability.” persons with service animals will be accommodated unless lcmc health formally determines such service animal constitutes a "direct threat" or requires a "fundamental alteration" of its facilities or services.
