the six dog studio was my original website i developed in 1999. it featured many of my paintings and photos. since then, i have written a large number of poems about animals, cats, dogs, friends, love, life and nature. so i developed a poet’s corner to feature all my work.â  i became an artist when i was fifty years old and painted about 450 paintings.â  each painting seemed to be telling me a story, so i started to write poetry about the paintings. read more about my life’s journey here:about patricia walter 











i played accordion most of my life. in 2020, i decided to buy a lighter accordion and have started to play again. i am sharing my piano and accordion videos on my youtube channel:â  https://www.youtube.com/@pianoandaccordionplayerpat
