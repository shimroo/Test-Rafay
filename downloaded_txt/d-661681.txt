 cristiano soares

in recent years, miami has seen a notable increase in the number of companies, especially from high-tech, finance, and creative industries, choosing the city as their new home base. this trend has been fueled by miami’s strategic location, offering access to latin american markets, a favorable tax structure, and a supportive business environment. the state of florida’s lack of personal income tax also makes it an attractive destination for businesses looking to optimize their financial performance.
with over 25 years of experience in luxury miami real estate, my team and i bring a unique blend of expertise to guide you through the complexities of the miami market. with a background in law, coupled with fluency in english, spanish, and portuguese, positions me as your ideal real estate professional. let’s navigate together the exciting opportunities miami has to offer!
