we have recently been made aware that someone falsely representing themselves as victoria sanders has contacted self-published authors, and attempted to induce them to pay fees for marketing and authorize an option of manuscripts for film.

if you are contacted in this manner, please contact us as soon as possible.  we have filed a police report and— as we continue to pursue this matter — any information you can give us will help. please note the telephone number this person called you from and send us any emails or other communications from them.


we do not ask clients or potential clients to pay us money to read their work or provide other services.  we offer representation based on our review (at our cost) of  submissions received (a/k/a queries), and pursuant to our written agreements with clients, we are compensated solely on a commission percentage basis upon sale or other license of a client’s manuscript.
