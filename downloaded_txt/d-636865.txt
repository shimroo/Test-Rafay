sadly, we are still closed for in-store browsing.
we are doing our curb-side and back yard customer service and can show any number of items to you if you call us from our parking lot. we’ve got tables set up out back but if the weather is bad we can bring things right to you so you can browse in your car to your heart’s content. it’s sort of fun, actually.
we are eager to serve and grateful for your patience.
we are very happy to help, so if you are in the area, do stop by. we love to see friends and customers.
we will keep you posted about our future plans… we are eager to reopen. pray for us.
we are happy to ship books anywhere.
we are here 10:00 – 6:00 est / monday – saturday. closed on sunday.

welcome to our website! we are always adding to and updating our resources; we hope you enjoy browsing around.
welcome to a bookstore which attempts to create a new space for serious, reflective readers. unabashedly christian, we are often told that we are different than most religious bookstores. our name, we trust, gives a good first clue to what we are about.
what distinguishes us most is our enthusiasm for the development of a uniquely christian worldview where christ’s lordship is honored and lived out in relevant ways in the midst of our highly secularized, post-modern culture. we offer quality books for the sake of faithful christian living. we serve business folk, scientists, artists, college students, moms, dads (and kids!), pastors, poets and politicos. we believe biblical faith leads to “thinking christianly” about every area of life.
