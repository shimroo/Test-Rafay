     excellent       based on 513 reviews                       jamie guignon  09/03/2024    enjoyed taking my 16 month old for a pair of shoes.. didn’t know they have a play area for kids which was nice while we waited for a salesperson. the sales people were so knowledgeable. i wasn’t sure what size my son was but they measured his feet and then made recommendations for which brands would offer the best support for him as a new walker.             matt rodden  06/03/2024    sales personnel are so friendly and attentive. we took our 2 year old. he got 2 pair of shoes, however we bought 2 pair for ourselves, to the tune of an extra   $340. didn't expect to spend more than a hundred, however , happy wife, happy life             amy nariskin  03/03/2024    michelle is a fabulous fitter. this crew @ laurie’s has been caring for our family for 25 years. our feet are always happy with their advice!!             abnarishkin  02/03/2024    been going here for 20 years. hasn’t changed one bit and i love that. great staff.             steve k  14/02/2024                 denise jackson  13/02/2024    courteous and helpful staff             derinda taylor  11/02/2024    very i
empress  with their  customer service everything from yhe time i walked in to the time i left             richard cook  06/02/2024    great service from the time i walked into the door .explained everything made sure i got the right fitting shoes that i needed for work.             tom kaletta  05/02/2024    my first time at laurie's shoes i was there to see about getting shoes that would not make my feet uncomfortable. anthony gonzalez put me into a tennis shoe from brooks that turned out to be the "best feeling" shoe i can remember ever wearing. anthony is knowledgeable, conscientious. and very friendly. a first class representative for the laurie's team. i was there today to see about getting a second pair of brooks tennis shoes and a set of ecco golf shoes. again, anthony was right here to assist me.  keep up the good work laurie's. your customer service is a+ indeed.
