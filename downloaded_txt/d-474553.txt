						"we were pleasantly surprised by how many animals this zoo had given the price and the location. we‚Äôve gone to petting zoos that were more expensive and much less impressive. this zoo was much better than both the franklin park zoo and the stone zoo at a fraction of the cost. our kids loved getting to see lions and zebras (in particular) so close. we would absolutely go back again."					





miko stearnsgoogle reviews 






						"such an incredible zoo considering the size of utica! great natural habitats and very active and happy animals."					





mark hoxiegoogle reviews 






						"new otter exhibit is fun !! have loved the zoo since childhood. get a membership & visit year-round !!"					





laura vincentgoogle reviews 






						"this is a jewel since it is a very modern zoo. not overcrowded with cluttered environment. the animals were very well taken care of compared to a lot of zoos that neglect the animals. i could not control myself, and i started churning a few of my native songs to the animals. it was very refreshing at this zoo. felt clear headed after leaving. can be compared to verona state park in the way it is design and how it makes me feel."					





thy cheagoogle reviews 






						"my husband and i love animals, so we booked an "animal encounter" and had the best time! there were two very knowledgeable and friendly zoo educators who showed us three of the "animal ambassadors." you could tell that the animals were well taken care of and were super friendly. we got the "photography package" and it was well worth it! after the encounter, we walked to all of the exhibits. this zoo is a nice size - not so big that you're walking all day and not too small. some animals were taking a break (it was a hot day and they are animals! not the zoo's fault if all the animals aren't visible all of the time!). there were a few new exhibits (emus and river otters!) and some under construction, showing that the zoo is continually improving. all in all, it was a great day trip and we will definitely be back!"

						"the utica zoo is a local treasure. we love making several trips a year to check out the goings on. recent improvements have made it even nicer and accessible."

						"we had a birthday party for my 8 year old. it was a friend party, and the experience was excellent. staff were friendly and accommodating. she picked 2 ambassador animals for the presentation, a tortoise and porcupine, and everyone loved it. very nice playground on site that the kids loved."

jacob ntripadvisor 






						"our family visited the utica zoo on a beautiful fall saturday in september. the grounds were clean and well managed. the animals were mostly visible and active. staff was friendly and engaging. although during covid-19, our visit was very enjoyable and felt safe. not a huge zoo, but family friendly and fun. highly recommended."					





shark mangoogle reviews 






						"great little zoo to visit. took me about 2.5hrs to see everything. food smelled good but i ate before i came unfortunately. some very unique and cool animals including but not limited to bald eagles, leaf tailed geckos, and a big beaver. would recommend."

						"we went here a little while ago and had a great time. we spent about 3 hours looking at everything, all the animals looked well taken care of with plenty of space."					





leah schmidgoogle reviews 






						"the zoo was great for the kids. they loved the goats. it was a bit chilly the day we went, but it was pretty good. due to us going in mid-march, we weren't able to see all the animals they had, but we still saw quite a few. overall, it was a pretty good family day trip."					





crystal bakergoogle reviews 






						"a wonderful experience, way more than i expected, you will not be disappointed. well presented and enjoyable."					





william j mtripadvisor

						"currently under heavy construction, but having come here once a year or so for decades, i am very excited to see the progress they're making. kind staff as well!"					





lily corathersgoogle reviews 






						"such a nice zoo.  very family friendly.  visited october 2020, they adhered to safety measures as did other visitors.  red pandas,  zebras, lions, foxes, warthog, and so much more.  easy to navigate and pretty landscaping."					





maggie careygoogle reviews 






						"a nice local zoo with a number of exhibits. we followed the path through the main part of the zoo and then visited the children's zoo. at a leisurely pace and with minimal reading of the provided information it should take an hour and a half give or take. some of the primates were very vocal during our visit. a fun experience."					





bbbob84tripadvisor 






						"place looks great! expanded pavilion, playground. clean and well landscaped. new pathways and exhibits."					





lisa c moroscofacebook reviews 






						"i've always loved going to the zoo, and utica zoo is a great place to spend a couple of hours outdoors with the animals!"					





noel johnsongoogle reviews 






						"it was a beautiful day to take a walk and view the animals. it was very well kept and we loved the camels. it is a little on the hilly side but there are plenty of benches to take a break if you need it."					





sharonv6451tripadvisor 






						"we are very fortunate to have such a beautiful zoo in our city‚ù§
the grounds are gorgeous & well kept, the animals are well taken care of...still one of my favorite places to visit, since i was a childüêíü¶ìüê´"					





jojo guidera-suppafacebook reviews 






						"not the bronx zoo but we should all consider ourselves fortunate that this is in our own "backyard"..... love the utica zoo!"					





mitchell hextgoogle reviews 






						"this place is a breathe of fresh air. on a hot day in june, we navigated the whole mountainous route through all the exhibits. worthy of our time and inexpensive for the attraction . . . the exhibits are well marked and the occupants seemed healthy and well cared for. "					





john itripadvisor 






						"held a birthday party in the pavilion by the lion exhibit, kal and matt helped get us setup and discussed what animals we wanted to have presented and at what time and they did a great job of doing so, 3 animals presented was right around a half an hour presentation and kept 12 5‚Äì7-year-olds entertained fully with questions and interaction. will definitely consider doing this again in the future if our son wants to do it again. highly recommend"					





wayne wordenfacebook reviews 






						"it's a zoo! how could any zoo be less than 5 stars?  cool animals, fun activities and awesome environment"					





matt campbellgoogle reviews 






						"a good place to exercise the kids in a safe environment. we wore our masks and kept our distance from other families. there is plenty of space, so safety was not a concern. it takes us about 1.5 hours to make the complete loop. each visit we learn something new. kids are always keen to visit. and, with our membership we also get reduced price tickets at other zoos.
utica is very fortunate to have this well maintained zoo!"					





judy and hoppytripadvisor 






						"what an amazing trip my daughter and i just had to the utica zoo!! first of all the zoo was clean, very well marked and very safe . . . exhibits were clean and animals all seemed very happy and you could see the animals and get great pictures . . . i would highly recommend the utica zoo."					





bonnie jason kellfacebook reviews 






						"really fun place to go even during covid. went on a beautiful day and saw most of the animals. highly recommended if you're in the area."					





steve savogoogle reviews 






						"like the ark, they have at least 2 of each. not over done, just well done - go! . . . the zoo itself was well cared for, clean facilities, good handicap accessible pathways. it is smaller than many big city zoos, but they haven't let this interfere with a quality experience for patron and animal alike. i give this 5 stars, and when we return next, i plan to be a member."					





chasd999tripadvisor 






						"you did something awesome for one of the members of a group i am a part of. it is a parent group for children with asd and even though i do not know this family personally i want to thank you for what you did for them. the acceptance warmed my heart. they posted about their visit and the kindness and understanding shown to them by your establishment. i am in a different state but i wanted to share this so others in your area that do, will and should visit will see. thank you!
