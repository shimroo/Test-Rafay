perhaps it's happened to you. someone
          recounts a string of events that took place ten or maybe even twenty
          years ago, and you listen intently to every word. they finish with "you
          were there, don't you remember?" and the truth is you don't recall
          any of it. so you visit the old places again, seemingly for the first
          time. and you meet friends you made there before, and it's as if you
          meet for the first time. you might feel odd when this happens, but
          it's just the mind's way of coping with the flood of data brought on
          by the information age. after awhile, you look forward to forgetting,
      and returning to all those places again for the first time. 
if the information age is the cause
          of this modern reverse deja vu syndrome, it can also be the cure. the
          personal side of this site is intended as a memory augmentation device
          in hopes that when the wetware fails, the software will take up the
          slack. as an added benefit, you all can share the experience, perhaps
          again for the first time...
