happy tlc customers






i've purchased several plants from here and they've all been healthy and happy. employees are knowledgeable and helpful. i live quite a bit away but this place is worth the drive.

great people, great plants, great prices. thought i found a better price, when delivered the quality was sickly. i'll go to tlc first from now on.
anonymous via google








we were just going to look at trees and came across a couple that were a good deal. we were asked multiple times whether we needed any assistance and when we did they were right there and answered all our questions. awesome place! love it!
marj via google








such a beautiful place and the best employees. probably the most professional and caring people i‚Äôve encountered in years; they made my day!
emily via google








huge greenhouse for outdoor shrubbery and indoor plants, to cacti and succulents. they have so much variety. a true gem.
m via google








this place is amazing. the selection is great, but what i was really impressed with was the customer service by all their employees. especially in the post-pandemic world of terrible service.
