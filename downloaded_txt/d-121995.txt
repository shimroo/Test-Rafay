coming this lent: ten reasons for hope



jan 20, 2025




amid what many have referred to as an “epidemic of hopelessness” and an “epidemic of despair,” our need for hope feels greater than ever. hope is not just optimism about the future. it is divine power from god that keeps us going even when life is difficult, painful, and arduous. but where do we get that power? what reasons do we have for this hope? and how can i be filled with it? join us this lent as we enter into the hope promised to us by god.
