recycling; not the final solution.





recycling; not the final solution.originally uploaded by quantum physicsi care deeply about the environment. every light bulb in my house is a compact fluorescent. i turn off lights and other appliances when not in use. i avoid buying foods in plastic containers. i think before i buy. i drive a hybrid car. i try to buy local foods whenever possible and available. i try to live a sustainable life but have far to go. i've been recycling everything i possibly can for the past 20+ years; i try to do my part. this past summer while on a photographic journey to the smoky mountains i decided to take a detour through a town that i had never visited before, sylva north carolina. as i approached the mountain town i was greeted by the unmistakable smell of a paper mill. i was both saddened and disappointed as a thick pillar of smoke filled the otherwise pristine mountain sky. at first i was angered thinking i was approaching another paper mill exploiting the western north carolina forest like the paper mill located in canton ( farm3.static.flickr.com/2386/2275651095_bbba08e3cb.jpg ). however the mill i was about to photograph was the jackson paper company ( www.jacksonpaper-nc.com/ ) a paper recycling facility. located along a tributary of the tuckaseegee river i found that the jackson paper is a recycle paper mill, turning used paper and cardboard into new paper products. while i'm sure operations like this reduce the amount of trees used in the production of their products they are certainly not without their environmental impact. this encounter with the realities of recycling has imprinted on me the need to follow the "three r's" (reduce, reuse, recycle) more effectively placing priority on them with emphasis on reduce and reuse.

going green in 2008!





the southern video blog is going green in 2008. i have several new videos planned for 2008 and beyond all with a green theme and directed toward the environment and global warming. i'll take a look at hybrid vehicles and alternative means of transportation. i'll visit an organic farm and see how buying local produce can help to reduce your carbon footprint. i'll search out people that have choosen green lifestyles and show you ways that you can live a more environmentally friendly life. stay tuned to the southern video blog and go green! photo: toyota prius in the great smoky mountains national park

atlanta pollution





known as the connector in atlanta. interstates 75 and 85 run together through downtown atlanta with as many as 16 lanes of traffic making it one of the widest motorways in the world. the traffic flow is never less than 250,000 vehicles per day and on heavy traffic days carries more that 320,000. much of this excessive traffic is due to the lack of a substantial mass transit system. atlanta does have marta (metro atlanta rapid transit authority) which includes buses and a rail system but it does not reach far enough into the suburbs to make it a reasonable alternative way to commute for most people. on more than 40 days between may and september in metro atlanta, particularly during hot, dry summers, air pollution in the region may build to levels that the u.s. environmental protection agency deems unsafe for humans. one recent study predicted that 1 out of every 1500 cases of lung cancer in the area is due to these poor conditions . this photo was taken around 9pm one friday evening.
