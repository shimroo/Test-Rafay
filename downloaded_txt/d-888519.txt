“






lovely stay!
“we spent 2 days at a white house in williamsburg, va, with our daughter’s in-laws. john and debbie are excellent hosts; the accommodations were cozy and spotless; the breakfast was delicious; recommendations for local restaurants were spot-on. we had a very pleasant visit, and we can assure others that they will have a similar experience.”
fred l.








comfortable, fun and interesting

“we stayed in the lincoln suite a couple of days ago and had a wonderful experience. the room was spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. the historic nature of the house and the presidential touches are both enjoyable and fun for anyone with a sense of humor. breakfast was excellent and served in the beautiful dining room. we enjoyed a fascinating conversation with our host john and the other guests. unfortunately we only stayed for one night but will definitely return. highly recommend.”
deborah b.








great stay
“what a perfect weekend in a lovely home with outstanding breakfast every morning and inviting conversation with the hosts and guests. our hosts were welcoming and we especially appreciated their sense of humor. we stayed in the washington room and loved the setup. we were also able to walk to the colonial area with ease.”

fabulous location
“spotlessly clean and well maintained, superb breakfast. debbie snd john are friendly and helpful. would highly recommend. situated a short walk from the main areas and restaurants. johns map is very helpful.”
gary tootell








delightful
“we had a wonderful time at a williamsburg white house. five nights, a different yummy breakfast each morning. john and debbie are excellent hosts, and went out of their way to make our stay pleasant. they happily accommodated my wife’s gluten-free dietary requirement. we stayed in the washington suite, which provided a comfortable bed and a spacious sitting area. downstairs was a nice place to connect with other guests. john was very helpful with suggestions on what to do in the area. we will visit again.”
