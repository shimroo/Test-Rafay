welcome to the 74th annual greene county fair in greeneville, tn
the greene county fair is recognized statewide as one of the best of its size. our 2023 fair was recognized by the tennessee association of fairs, as the champion fair in the aaa fair division.
there has been a fair in some form in greene county since 1870 when the farmers and mechanics association held its first exposition. the present greene county fair association was incorporated in 1949. the fair you visit this year represents the love and hard work of countless volunteers, board members and officers since 1949.
