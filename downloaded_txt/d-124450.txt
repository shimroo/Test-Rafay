carboxyl group (−cooh), and an organic r group (or side chain) that is unique to each amino acid. the term amino acid is short for α-amino [alpha-amino] carboxylic acid. a very essential component in building muscles, and favorite of any powerlifter, check out protein recommendations.growth hormone molecular structurethe major isoform of the human growth hormone is a protein of 191 amino acids and a molecular weight of 22,124 daltons. the structure includes four helices necessary for functional interaction with the gh receptor. read more about hgh and hgh supplements. peptidespeptide molecules are composed of two or more amino acids joined through amide formation involving the carboxyl group of each amino acid and the amino group of the next. the chemical bond between the carbon and nitrogen atoms of each amide group is called a peptide bond. peptides are short polymers of amino acid monomers linked by peptide bonds. they are distinguished from proteins on the basis of size, typically containing less than 50 monomer units. a peptide is formed by joining two or more amino acids. when the number of amino acids is less than about 50 these molecules are named peptides while larger sequences are referred to as proteins. the amino acids are coupled by a peptide bond, a special linkage in which the nitrogen atom of one amino acid binds to the carboxyl carbon atom of another. read what’s the difference between peptides & protein and how peptides help in bodybuilding. structure of amino acids, peptides and proteinsinformation on hgh & amino acids supplementshgh
