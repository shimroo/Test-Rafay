mike, the fish for danny and james just arrived. i don't know if you remember us with 3000 fish in your place at any given time. but, they are the cow dolphin fish and the silky shark. they are spectacular!!!! beyond my wildest dreams and well worth waiting for. the boys will be "blown away" when they get home from school today. thank you sooooo, sooooo much. please tell all your pepole how great their work is and that they have made 2 teenage boys exceedingly happy. they will keep these fish their entire lives and will always remember now the trip we had together. and, it is all thanks to you, the great captain and crew and your people.
 thank you very much, stu carter

robert mccue, atlanta 


i donât expect you to remember, but thank you for the engraved plaque of my 89 in. sailfish.  it looks great and iâm so glad to have it instead of the large fish mount.   also, i secretly ordered a 27 in. brown trout mount for my husbandâs birthday and gave it to him a few days and.  he is thrilled with it and the quality work you did!   thank you for everything!
laura



i just wanted to thank you and the team @ gray taxidermy. i received the dorado and sailfish last week.					    they are both magnificent and breathtaking.                      it was worth the anticipation and the wait..
jill demaroc,



thank you so much for the beautiful, lifelike work you've done on my bull dorado caught this spring. this is the third fish mount you've done for me and i can't stop looking at each of them. i enjoy them every day. 
				      best regards,
jane mcdoe, yet another one
