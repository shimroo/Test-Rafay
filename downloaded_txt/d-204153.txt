          non-photographic content ©1998-2006 sean breazeal, salt lake city,

          all photographs are assumed to be copyrighted by their photographer 
          and no commercial use of them can be allowed on any website. no photo 
          may be used in a printed paper form for any publication whatsoever.

these photos are not mine! i did not take them 
          and they may not be used by any company, magazine, commercial website, 
          or any other use other than personal enjoyment on a private computer.

 
          i do not own the images, i am not a stock photo company, and i cannot 
          give permission to commercially use them. you'll have to ask the original 
          photographer. read the faq on how to find and contact them. if you simply 
          want to download some for desktop wallpaper, a school report, or another 
          completely personal use, be my guest!
if 
          you, webshots users and city forum posters especially, find a personal 
          photo of yours on this site that i downloaded and you do not want it 
          also displayed here, e-mail me at the address below and it will be deleted 
          asap. i have tried to be as diligent as possible in asking permission 
          but i also, in my zeal and excitement at finding great photos, no doubt 
          have forgotten to ask a number of people.







even more web urls for 
          more city photos! 
          list consolidated and ordered, giving over 1180 urls to photo sites 
          i've gathered from.
looking 
          for some fantastic views of english towns and cities?

mr. webb has placed many thousands of oblique aerial 
          photos over dozens of english towns and cities on his site for free 
          viewing at a generous size and the opportunity to buy much larger originals. 
          much of middle and northern england is represented along with a bit 
          of wales and some scattered german cities. it's definitely worth your 
          visit. the page on manchester has far and away the largest representation 
          and coverage of that city than any page on the internet. 
          .

site stats and records 



most hits in a day: 7,005 (november 23, 2004)

most hits in a month: 86,619 (march 2004)

most commonly referring search engines: 
            google (68%)
            yahoo (16%)
            msn (6%)
            aol (2%)
            all others (8%), including altavista, dogpile, metacrawler, excite, 
            webcrawler, lycos

most common query terms: 
            "photos" (this is unbelievable...just the word 'photos' 
            puts me that far up in google!)
            "worldcityphotos"
            "world city"
            "city skylines"
            "city photos", "city photo", "city skyline"
            "world cities"
            "photographs of cities"

search engines supply only 24% of referrals to the site, the vast 
            majority of other referrers are bloggers and bulletin boards. this 
            is in part why i have had to initiate a ban on direct image links.

57% of visitors are on the site for two minutes or less, and 96% 
            are here less than 5 minutes.

the average visitor views just one page (the photo they clicked 
            a link for), 30% of souls hang around to view a couple more pages, 
            then leave. 7% of visitors love the site so much they view at least 
            10 pages. a few naughty, evil bandwidth abusers, and likely photo 
            pirates, download the entire f'ing site, which is rude beyond mere 
            words.

the average day sees 80% of the site's traffic from new visitors, 
            only 20% are returnees.

heaviest traffic times are by far during work and school hours, 
            you naughty slackers ;-). most people visit from 8-9 am and 1-4 pm 
            local time. insomniacs also visit as there is a distinct spike from 
            3-5 am local time.

countries most often visiting are (in order): usa, brazil, uk, france, 
            canada, netherlands, germany, australia, spain, switzerland, mexico, 
            belgium, sweden, japan, poland, turkey, portugal, china, finland, 
            denmark, austria, greece...on a typical day visitors from at least 
            90 countries visit.

rarest countries to visit the site in 2004 were: armenia, cambodia, 
            chad, fiji, gibraltar, guinea, guinea-bissau, guyana, montserrat(!), 
            papua new guinea, swaziland, uganda, and zimbabwe...just one visit 
            each.

not counting unknowns, 93% of site visitors run windows, including 
            some poor desperate people still running windows 3.1! macs account 
            for 5%, linux just 1%, everyone else combined make up the final 1%.
