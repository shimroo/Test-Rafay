one hope is committed to supportinglovingservingcelebratingpraying for our gig harbor community


one hope church is a multi-denominational christian church committed to the ministry and mission of jesus. we serve and support various local, national, and international christian efforts. we don't own our own building but rather we rent sunday morning worship space at the ocean5 social gathering place. this enables us to release additional funds toward our mission and ministry efforts as well as supports our vision to take the church to where the community gathers.

our  core gatherings 





                            community worship service
                        




gatherings happen each sunday at 9:30am for large group worship at ocean5.








                            life together groups
                        




these home-based groups meet regularly for fellowship, worship, prayer, bible exploration, outreach and fun.








                            discipleship groups
                        




these are groups where we go deeper in god’s word, have more discussion and where more intentional discipleship happens.


















god's heart is for the whole world.  so is ours...


we actively support these mission efforts. 
one third of our congregation has gone on a mission trip to one of seven different countries
