february update 


				at long last, another update has finally been posted! i’m still open for aircheck trades, but with limited free time i’ll have to be somewhat selective with them. trades are still limited to two airchecks per trade. please let me know if you have any questions. 145 new airchecks have been added to my list. look for new additions in az, ca, dc, fl, il, in, ky, ma, mo, ne, nj, ny, nc, oh, pa, ri, tn, tx, canada, and satellite radio.

				after a long wait, i’ve opened up trading again on a limited basis. i will be limiting trades to two (2) airchecks per trade. a total of 161 new airchecks have been added to the list today. look for new additions in ca, ct, dc, fl, il, in, mo, nj, ny, nc, oh, ri, tn, tx, wa, wi, canada, united kingdom, satellite radio, and syndicated shows. i’ll try to get another update posted next month as i still have more to add to the list. i just need to find time to catalog them. in the meantime, happy thanksgiving to you and yours!

may update 


				as we all know, life can be very unpredictable, and it seems i’m going to have to put this hobby on the backburner again. aircheck trading will be suspended until further notice. i’m still going to try to work through cataloging my backlog as i can. so keep an eye out for occasional new list updates and trading status updates.

april update 


				well i’ve reached my goal (just barely) of getting in a new update this month! my airchecks list has been updated. 106 new airchecks have been added. look for new additions in al, az, ca, fl, ga, il, ky, md, ma, ny, nc, nd, oh, va, wa, and canada. the next couple of months shouldn’t be too busy for me, so i should be able to get in the rest of my backlog hopefully soon.

march update 


				happy spring! hopefully everything is in bloom in your life! although i’m still trading on a limited basis (no more than two airchecks per trade), i have a large backlog of airchecks i’ve acquired over the last few years that i haven’t had a chance to catalog yet. well, i’ve begun working through those and the first update has been posted. it’s a big project so it will take me a few months to get through them all. 238 new airchecks have been added to the list today. look for updates in ca, dc, fl, il, md, nv, nj, nm, ny, oh, pa, tn, tx, va, wa, canada, mexico, and other stuff (sirius xm). i hope to have another update next month.

february update 


				another list update is here! trades are still open, though still on a limited basis as noted on my previous update. i’m still restricting trades to two airchecks per trade, as my free time is limited. 70 new airchecks have been added today. look for new additions in ar, co, de, dc, fl, ga, il, ma, mn, ny, ny, tn, tx, and wa.

october update 


				happy fall! while i’m still busier than i used to be, i’m going to try opening up trades again on a limited quantity basis. at this time i will be limiting trades to two (2) airchecks per trade. keep in mind that turnaround times may be longer than they used to be with me. also, i will only be able to trade mp3 airchecks (meaning no physical media). meanwhile, i’ve just updated my list with airchecks that i’ve received from older trades as well as some that i recorded myself. my list has been updated today. 231 airchecks have been added. look for new additions in az, ca, ct, co, fl, ga, hi, il, in, ky, la, me, ma, mo, nv, nj, ny, oh, or, pa, tn, tx, va, wa, wi, canada, and mexico.

may update 


				i’m still on a trading sabbatical at the present time. however, i have been able to post another aircheck list update. the new additions consist mainly of some previous small trades that i’ve been able to wrap up, as well as some older airchecks that i hadn’t previously catalogued. look for 81 new airchecks listed in al, ca, fl, ga, il, md, ma, mi, ms, ny, oh, tn, tx, wv, wa and xm radio (in the “other stuff” section). i’ll keep everyone up to date here regarding my future trading status. have a wonderful summer!

december update 


				season’s greetings! although i am still not trading airchecks at this time, i have published an update to my aircheck list. these are airchecks i’ve acquired from older trades and some i recorded myself while travelling. 107 new airchecks have been added from al, ca, de, dc, fl, ga, hi, il, ma, mi, ny, nd, oh, pa, tn, tx, wa, and wi. happy holidays and happy new year!

september update 


				just a quick update to let you know that my trading will be suspended until further notice. i simply just don’t have the time currently to devote to this hobby. the website will continue to exist, as there is still plenty of content here to enjoy. at some point, i will update my airchecks list again as i’m still recording local radio when i’m travelling, and i also have some older trades that still need to be listed. i’ll post another update whenever i have time to update that list. no promises on when that might be, but it is on my list of things to do.
