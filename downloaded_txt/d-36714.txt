                  workshop
                

                  clowning and physical comedy
                

                  by chris leask
                


“my teaching methods emphasise truthfulness, openness, and explorational exercises, creating a safe space for participants to make mistakes and learn from them. through my 12 years of acting on stage and screen, i have discovered that mistakes and ‘getting it wrong’ are hidden gems that can provide new insights for the performer and the character. i focus primarily on ensemble work, improvisation, clowning, and devising—skills invaluable not just for comedic performances, but for dramas, tragedies, and epics as well.

confidence and commitment are crucial in acting, and i believe these are best developed by teaching participants to embrace the fear of failure. because of this, i foster a supportive and playful environment where students can take risks, discover their unique voices, and feel confident in doing so. in the class i’ll firstly focus on group exercises where people can discover their natural clown. once we have done that we’ll do a variety of exercises that help the clowns find the comedic ‘game’ within scenes and hopefully show the participants how easy it can be to be entertaining while keeping it simple and being truthful.”

                  the importance of being earnest
                




                by oscar wilde, directed by gary andrews
              

is there such a thing as too many muffins?

who needs to go to the national theatre, when oscar wilde’s witty comedy of manners is brought to sparkling life on our own lovely stage, bringing a smile to the cold, dark days of early 2025? who exactly is earnest? is there such a thing as too many muffins? what on earth is bunbury-ing and what, oh what is the significance of the handbag?

full of fabulous characters, witty dialogue, hilarious farce and a smouldering, restrained sexiness, this will be a production not to be missed.

                  what you will
                

                  (twelfth night)
                


                by william shakespeare, directed by lisa last & jo ord
              

jo and lisa are delighted to be collaborating again and will be bringing 'what you will' their own spin on shakespeare's 12th night to the stage in march/april of next year. somewhat surprisingly, it will have an 80s rock vibe, pretty much picking up from where binderella left them.

will orsino the lead singer of a rock band, manage to woo the supermodel olivia, or will his curious new roadie divert his attention instead!?... this will be a high energy comedy and lisa and jo are committed to making it a whole lot of (likely camp, irreverent) fun for the cast, crew and the audience.
