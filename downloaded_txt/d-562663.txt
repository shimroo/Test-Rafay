            the iha was a registered charitable
            non-profit organization established with the purpose of educating the public in the care and betterment of hedgehogs and to facilitate the rescue, welfare, promotion and care of hedgehogs everywhere. 
            we had a membership representing 3 continents and encouraged our members to be active participants in the iha.  members became actively involved with the iha through committees. 
            we encouraged and supported rescue through our rescue licensing program, ensuring quality care and placement of rescues throughout north america and europe.  as well, iha sponsored funding campaigns helped to keep hedgehog rescues running.
             
             
            the iha's research activities have included studies on diet, nutrition and appropriate medication.
