welcome
we are a catholic faith community located just north of the city of chicago.
the word catholic implies inclusiveness. despite our differences,  we are united in faith, hope and love. our parish is essentially a group of  modern day followers of jesus, gathered in local community to love god and to  serve others with skill, creativity and compassion. as catholic christians we  are part of a tradition which has endured in good times and bad for twenty  centuries.
