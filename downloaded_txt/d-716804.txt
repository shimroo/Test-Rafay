discover fiji’s finest diving
 








the south pacific's premier liveaboard



 from manta rays to mantis shrimp, dolphins to dartfish, voracious sharks to vibrant soft corals, nai’a delivers sights to satisfy the most saturated scuba diver. 
 of the few truly magical places left in the world, fiji is the most accessible:  an easy non-stop flight from the major pacific rim capitals. since intrepid divers first discovered the pacific’s phenomenal coral reefs, fiji has been famous for the best scuba diving in the world. and since nai’a began voyages to the country’s furthest and richest regions, guests from all over the world have enjoyed the privilege of experiencing spectacular soft coral, diverse reef fish, bizarre critters, schooling pelagics and genuine fijian hospitality - all in a single scuba diving holiday.
three things set fiji apart from other world-class dive destinations


1. fiji is fun
it’s no secret that fijians are the friendliest people on earth. a diver who visits these shores is treated as an honored guest and friend, not just another tourist.


2. fiji is safe
there is no malaria here. no irukandji. fiji's reefs and rainforests are lush but tame: no box jellyfish, crocs, or deadly spiders and snakes.


3. fiji is easy
direct international flights from most pacific rim hubs make getting here a snap. adventure without compromise: pure pleasure.
