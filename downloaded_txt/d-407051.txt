what type of paper would you like this to be printed on?
all papers are a high quality choice that will produce a great print! learn more





photo paper


our photo paper is a semi-matte, bright white paper with a slight gloss/luster to it. it has a smooth surface and subtle sheen that will bring a brightness and richness to prints. perfect for photographs and text-heavy images, as well as most general, all-purpose uses.







art paper


our art paper is a cotton, natural white paper that is matte — it has no gloss or luster to it. it has the slightest warmth and a semi-smooth surface that will bring elegance and nuance to prints. best for artwork reproductions and/or digital graphics and art.







giclée paper


our giclée paper is a cotton, heavyweight fine art paper that is fully matte and has a slight texture to it. it has a gentle warmth and a semi-smooth texture that enhances the intricacy and richness of giclée prints. great for fine art reproductions that are of conservation & museum quality. (recommended dpi: 300+)




*note that any paper type chosen here will be mounted to foamcore backing so that it never warps or bubbles. if you prefer an unmounted print, please order a separate print instead.

very happy with frames
julia p — indianapolis, in

this was by far the easiest ordering process for something so specific i have ever encountered! so easy to view your print in different frame styles and measuring instructions were very clear. shipping updates were great, protective packaging was amazing, and helpful instructions were clear and helpful for putting the print in the frame. all at a reasonable price. i highly recommend this company for your framing needs!
nancy — springfield, or

it looks great and was packed so carefully for shipment.   thank you.

i am wondering if i mistakenly ordered a vertical mounting, or if frames always come with no choice of horizontal or vertical mounting ?

thank you for this order, i am pleased with your product.
sincerely, mrs. chamberlain

content policy



we built our website to provide the simplest and best framing experience possible. you upload an image, we print and frame it, and you receive a high-quality ready-to-hang frame in the mail at an unbeatable price. in order to keep providing this great service, we have a few rules for what kind of content we accept to print and frame.
in the simplest words possible: you need to have the rights to reproduce every single image you upload into our website (or otherwise share with us for the purpose of printing) in order for us to be able to print it.

by uploading an image into our website (or otherwise sharing it with us for the purpose of printing), you certify that:

you have all of the necessary rights required to use the image without infringing upon or violating the rights of any third party. these rights include but are not limited to trademarks, copyrights, patents, rights of privacy, rights of publicity, and moral rights.
the image is not unlawful in any way and does not violate any applicable rule, regulation, or another person's privacy.
                    the image is not obscene, hateful, libelous, threatening, or slanderous.


by uploading an image into our website (or otherwise sharing it with us for the purpose of printing), you further agree that that:

you will indemnify and release frame it easy from all liability (including attorney's fees and legal costs) for any claims related to the infringement of any third party's rights by the reproduction by frame it easy of the image you upload into our website or share with us for the purpose of printing (whether said claims are alleged or actual).


by uploading an image into our website (or otherwise sharing it with us for the purpose of printing), you certify that you understand:

frame it easy reserves the right to review the image, but receives many such images and cannot always review each one individually.
frame it easy takes no ownership of the content you upload or share with us for the purpose of printing.
frame it easy reserves the right to delete any uploaded or shared file which falls into one or more of the categories forbidden above, and refuse to fulfill any associated order.
if your image is not blurry and was taken in average lighting conditions with a relatively modern camera, your print is very likely to come out beautiful. if your image is taken with an older camera, or is blurry, or is taken in dark lighting conditions, it may look differently printed than it does on your screen. this is because all screens (unless professionally calibrated) will display images differently. frame it easy stays as true as possible to your photo by printing it exactly as we receive it: we do not edit it, nor do we apply any of our own color profiles to it. if your photo was taken in unusual conditions or with unusual equipment and you are concerned about the print quality, please reach out to us and we would be happy to answer all of your questions and help you to get the best print possible.


by uploading an image into our website (or otherwise sharing it with us for the purpose of printing), you also accept and agree to our other policies, links to which are available in the footer of our website.

to the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, neither frame it easy or its directors, officers, members, shareholders, employees, contractors, agents, representatives, or affiliates (the “frame it easy parties”) shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, even if the frame it easy parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages, arising out of or relating in any way to our provision (or failure to provide) products or services.

how many dots per inch do i need?

detailed description:
dots per inch (or "dpi" for short) refers to the number of dots a printer puts down in a one-inch line. the greater this number, the more detail we can see in a printed photo.
when you take a photo, your camera saves it at a certain level of detail which depends on the quality of the camera. it is not possible to add detail to a photo after it is taken - for example, there is nothing that can be done to a photo taken by an older cell phone camera to make it look like a picture taken by professional photography equipment.
when you upload this photo to our website, we will always print it at the highest possible dots per inch for the size that you select. however, because it is not possible to add detail to a photo after it is taken, the larger you choose to print your photo the blurrier it will look up close. think about stretching a standard 4" by 6" photo to fit a billboard - it will look great from a couple hundred feet away but will look very blurry up close.
if you have any questions about dots per inch or framing in general, please do not hesitate to contact us using the phone number, email address, or instant chat box in the footer of our website.
if you found your photo online:
usually, photos found online are not nearly as detailed as photos that are intended to be printed on paper. that's because most screens cannot display more than 72 dots per inch. however, when you print a photo out and hold it at arm's length, your eyes can discern up to 300 dots per inch. you may notice that our website won't let you print a photo larger than a certain size - this is to avoid printing something of very low quality.

of course, framing your artwork or photo is very personal and you should use our frame preview to build the frame that looks perfect to you, even if the matting options don't agree with what is typically used above.

made in america



we offer one of the few products (and even fewer frames!) available on the market that is made in america. the materials for our frames are sourced domestically, and a skilled team of american frame artisans carefully cuts and assembles each frame by hand. we are enormously proud to provide such precise, high-quality, carefully crafted frames at an unbelievable price to our customers while providing livelihoods for dozens of american workers.
for active members of our military stationed overseas, we can ship most of our frames to us military (apo/fpo/dpo) addresses.
