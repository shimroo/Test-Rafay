chris' web
a personal chronicle of pride, trauma,
struggle, and inspiration.


welcome




hi everyone! i'm
chris, also known as "troop". welcome to my website
and thank you for taking the time to visit and read my story. 



written as a personal biography, each page of my story tells you a
little bit
about my life. it starts with when i first went into in the
army and
what i have been through since suffering a life altering injury on july
13th, 2000. 



if nothing else, i hope sharing my story will create a little more
understanding towards people like myself who have suffered a
catastrophic injury or illness, and just maybe you'll also
find yourself being thankful for the little things in life.......
