what can i say? sebastian is a miracle worker! his restoration of some very damaged photos, pre wwii, is nothing short of remarkable. his meticulous work has helped bring back to life my relatives who perished in the holocaust. his work will be featured in the cd booklet for my humble project to remember my uncle norbert.

"motherâs savior: a revelation"




 i wanted to restore old, damaged, but precious photos with great sentimental value.

i went to sebastian, told him what i wanted -- he did exactly what i wanted & more.

many of the photos were small, so he was able to enlarge & really pay attention to every detail, is also very gentle, mindful of fragile original photos.

sebastian is very easy to work with, flexible & kind. his quality of work in restoration is: impeccable, faultless, more than amazing -- flawless.
