t.g.i.f.....and other cool prints. 
i've been creating what i'm calling religious horror icons. i'm basically painting famous characters from horror movies and dropping them into religious style painting backgrounds. i'm calling it saints and sinners. shown at left are the 3 that started it all....more are always in the works! personally i'm quite fond of the t.g.i.f. jason voorhees print. but that's probably cuz i'm oh so metal. 
snarf them up in my store for only $12 usd with free shipping!.
