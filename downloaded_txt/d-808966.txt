featured at christchurch baptist fellowship
 


god’s love is not earned or given in exchange for something else – it’s offered freely.

we believe that god has saved and called us with a unique purpose in life.

we truly believe that people are looking for something more…something real. 
 
 
 




the gospel is central
"for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received, how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures."   

what is the gospel? read our statement of faith
