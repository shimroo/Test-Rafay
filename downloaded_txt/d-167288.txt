typing testtyping test
below you’ll find our free typing test, it’s easy and results are instant. competition is fierce, especially in a market where so many people are trying to get the same job you are. you need an edge and that is exactly what you’ll find on this site!
 companies are experiencing incredible turnout for the simplest of job postings and need a way to narrow down the selection; the best way to screen a potential employees is by giving applicants a typing test. you can have little or no education and still beat out others applying for the same job by simply being better at typing!


java not detected! sorry, but it looks as though you have java disabled. please enable java to run this typing test.


i have seen it happen time and time again – a highly educated applicant with all the right qualifications failed to get a job simply because they took their typing speed for granted!
be the person that blows away the competition by using our free typing tests; they are completely anonymous, extremely easy to use and straight forward without any surprises.
online typing tests and common tricks
one of the most disturbing tricks i have found are sites offering a free typing test only to hold back the results until you pay a fee! worse yet are sites that offer test results only by email and then sell your contact information to mass mailers.
results of our typing test are instantaneous and appear on the screen at completion. we never require your personal information, email address or other identifying information, so you can rest assured that your test is private.
if you are a business, you can use our typing test to help screen applicants or help employees improve their typing speed. again, everything is free and we don’t charge you just because you have a business. you’ll also enjoy the built in security features to prevent applicants from falsifying the results of their typing test.
some organizations require test results to be verified. you’ll find our built in verification system works great and helps insure the accuracy of every test.
how to take our free online typing test
below you’ll find a number of options for this online typing test. most options include text from popular authors unless you are using custom text. this online typing test also includes the ability to set a time limit ranging from 1 to 10 minutes.
as you start the test, two boxes will appear. the top box is the actual text used for the typing test while the bottom box displays the text you are typing.
once you start, you’ll notice a small pause as the system prepares the test and then the first word will appear in blue. as soon as you start typing, the system begins recording your keystrokes and highlights any typing errors you may make in red.
once a typing error has been marked red, you can not change it. errors are marked in red only after you press the space bar, so you can correct a letter, but not a word. true typing tests account for accuracy by not allowing words to be corrected, and this online typing test is held to the same standard.
you’ll also notice a timer located to the right that counts up to the time you have allotted for the typing test.
results are displayed immediately after the test is completed. you’ll notice the option to enter email and contact information, many organizations use this free online typing test as a way to screen applicants and in such cases, verified results are sent to the personnel department.
if you would like your score to be entered into our online typing test hall of fame, but don’t want to enter your email address or name, simply enter a space in each field and click on send results.
we welcome you to test my typing.com and hope your experience here is a positive one. if ever you have a suggestion, please leave a comment, we constantly strive to enhance the site!

drd says 


68wpm and 98%…
why is it considered moderate speed?
how can i improve it?







kassss says 


my average is around 80-85 wpm and 315-340 cpm with 95%+ accuracy on both  and it still says my typing speed is ‘average’. something is wrong!







moon says 


i type approximately 80-90 wpm with few errors. i use this testing to polish up my skills and be 100% accurate. i have only seen two reply messages on this board that are error free. i think even more important than being a fast typist, a person should focus on making minimal errors.

giggity says 


hi,
i’m from prince william county schools in class right now, and i’ve decided to test my typing by entering inappropriate vulgar messages.
my goal is to keep doing this and have the website owner contact the school with records, such as internal ip address, post times and match that to the computer and student in class.
i’m really not smart and looking forward to getting some time off from school – my parents will be so proud of me!
here i go 🙂

nathan says 


some of you are not telling the truth i know or maybe the people who sucked on this test are just afraid to tell the truth. there is no way that most of you got over 70 wpm. 70 wpm is about the speed of a professional typist and there is no way that most of you here are professional typists.

i really like this activity!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i just wish that i could get my typing speed up a little bit though……… the highest that i can ever get is 32 and that is really bad and it stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!

anuran says 


test type- 10 minutes
speed – cpm-187 , accuracy -98%
               wpm-39 , accuracy-95%

aim —breaking the 100 wpm mark ,
method i will adopt — kick the ass out the keyboard and burn my fingers

sheri says 


if some one types a mistake from the beginning, it does not allow you to go forward with corrected typing.  the typing by the applicant stays in red and it does not correct …
also, what is the average time to give the test?







eleanor says 


three choices are not enough!   need various texts to choose from so we can have more of a change to test ourselves with.   you should also add some tests for numbers.   would be helpful to improve and test ourselves with numbers as well.   thank you!

skye says 


i got 51wmp on here, but i don’t like this test very much because it highlights the words for you, if you go to a job, then it will not do this. it is much better practice if you find a test that just has a paragraph on top, the words you type on the bottom, and nothing more…

plooker says 


“your typing speed is slow, try to pay more attention”!!!
