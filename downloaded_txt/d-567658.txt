california's future is at risk. unless we build now, our state will suffer for generations. members urge our state lawmakers to support policies that increase housing supply by signing c.a.r.’s petition.  let's get serious about housing supply - our future depends on it!  

the shasta association of realtors® is a proud supporter of the shasta youth alliance (“sya”).  sya was established to the serve the victims of the wildfires in our community through the collection and distribution of clothing, household goods, furniture, and other personal necessities.  although a number of organizations initially formed to help fire victims are no longer operational, sya continues to receive donations with a goal to continue to provide services to the community beyond the specific fire-related need, including partnering with local schools and foster agencies to provide no-cost clothing to displaced children and families.  interested in donating, volunteering or just learning more about sya?  visit their website at www.shastayouthalliance.org.
