i hope they croak of boredom!   i hope they don't have their noses shoved up so many wrong butts that they totally miss the big thing, say like 9/11, when it happens next.

i refuse to be terrorized by my government.

where's my country?



when i voted for obama, and when he won, i was hopeful and encouraged on many fronts.  there have been disappointments along side of victories, but that's another story for another day.


what's extremely wrong and has me wrought with rage and bewilderment is the fact that when we elected obama, what we got is boner running the entire country, making the decisions we knew he would make for this country, which is why we did not elect thuglicans to run the place.  and here he is, big as shit, running the whole damned country.

i woke up to a crisp october morning one day last week and lo!  my country was gone.  stolen by the washdc mafia.  pleasing a miniscule minority of shithead crazies, to the outrage of us all.

president obama!!  where are you?  we could use a real leader here and now!!!
