from our customers: 











						“jx metals usa needed a solution that could meet the needs of our fast moving manufacturing environment. we reviewed the combined accounting and manufacturing software from alere along with several other competing software products. we decided that alere accounting and alere manufacturing were the best fit for us. the parts of alere software that we like most are: the traceability between transactions, product costing and the ability to integrate alere with other software we use. the implementation team was very responsive to our needs and provided us with software customizations and customized reports. these customizations allowed us to continue to do the things that make our organization great without having to change our processes to match the software. we have been using alere for over 3 years and have been extremely satisfied with our software choice.”					






brett r.it department manager | jx metals usa 






						“the reason we chose tiw back in the early 90's was that we needed a package that suited our needs based on a low volume-high mix manufacturing environment. what is so appealing about their product is the mrp engine they use. it allows us to do forecast sharing with our suppliers. we have a wholly integrated single tiw solution.”					






frank w.vice president | bitronics 






						kokatat upgraded a legacy business system 15 years ago and chose alere. the product has matured over the years and development has kept pace with the changing and growing needs of our business. key modules have been added over time making the product extremely feature rich, able to adapt to business processes, while retaining the flexibility that is the hallmark of the alere product.

the pricing has always been fair. the level of technical support that customers receive is unparalleled in the industry – everything from email/phone support, to assisting on how to implement a new business process into the alere system, to actually looking at live data to help troubleshoot an issue. working with a valued added reseller (var), alere can be customized and tailored to fit business needs. i value the development tools and the ability to customize reports, menus, screens and code.

tiw has been a valued partner over the past 15 years and the alere product has been an integral part of our business success.					






aaron m.information technology lead | kokatat 






						“i believe the software should work for us. not us working for the software. really happy with alere because it is really stable, really reliable, and they are constantly upgrading the capabilities. and they are extremely responsive.”
