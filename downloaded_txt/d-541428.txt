west end girls





the west end girls met again on february 
10th. 



see details here.




in 2002, when kay forrester planned the first west end girls lunch bunch, she couldn't have imagined that it would still be going strong 
20+ years later. 


if 
you haven't attended 
a lunch bunch meeting, you're missing a real treat. 

to be 

 added to 
kay's notification list for 
upcoming 
lunches, visit




lunch bunch 
for her contact information.



class events



since 2001, we held a total of 4 class reunions and 5 
class picnics (the last was in 2019). our planned 2021 picnic was 
canceled due to covid. there are no plans for further events, but what we had 
was special and the memories will stay with us.

* weo went live in february 2001 to promote our 40th class 
reunion.  


in 2004, the marketing director of classmates.com informed me that west end 
online was the largest dedicated high school reunion website they had seen, so 
it was likely the largest on the internet. the site has since more than doubled 
in size, so this is likely still true today. 

 
for the history of west end online, see 
for your info.
