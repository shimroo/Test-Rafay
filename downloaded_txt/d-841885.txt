freevlog: tutorial














 





 














welcome
                  to freevlog 2.5
a step-by-step guide to setting up a videoblog for free.
why is this cool?
                ---> it's free! what else do you want? 
wait a minute!
                ---> what's a "vlog" and why do
                  i want  one? 
a vlog is
                a videoblog and
                you want one because, let's face it, they're not going to put
                you on tv. besides, not playing that game is what makes this
                so much fun. you can do whatever you want.

                the  video
download
                  the video
watch
                  this video and we'll say "hi" and show you how to
                  use this tutorial. it's not done yet but you can give it a
                  shot anyway (things keep changing so it may never get finished).
                  or you can skip the video and do it your own way. either way,
                  if you run into problems, send us an
                    email.



step 0.5:
		  	  before you start, make a video and load it on to your computer! 
disclaimer:
this tutorial assumes you have access to a computer, a camera and that you can
    make a video. that part of the whole videoblogging chain isn't free (we wish!).
  depending on what kind of stuff you have, there
  are a zillion ways that whole process can go. maybe after we get some sleep
  we'll think about doing some of those tutorials. 
remember, without a video, step 2 where we make a
		  	    screen shot of your video and step 4 where we publish your video
		  	    are not going to make much sense. 
here are some links to get you started in the video
		  	    department:
using
		  	      imovie (mac)
using movie maker (pc)
now once you've made your 
                    masterpiece, you have to compress it. 
---> check out our compression 
                    tutorials

as we make more tutorials we'll post 
                    them on the freevlog 
                    vlog. you can subscribe 
                    to our new tutorials here.

windows 
                    movie maker.pdf



using
imovie
final cut pro
windows movie maker
now a lot of windows users email us asking
			    how they can create quicktime movies with windows movie maker.
			    what are you crazy? do you think microsoft would let you do that?
			    (to be fair you can't make a .wmv with imovie.) so here's a tip.
			    if you have the free
			    quicktime player for windows			    installed on your system
			    you can use avid
			    free dv ($0) to edit
			    and compress quicktime movies. plus you get some editing software
			    with more features than movie maker. don't worry mac users. avid
			    didn't forget you. avid
			    free dv is also available for mac. tutorial
			    coming soon(ish). 


step 1:
      set up a free blogger blog
why is this cool?
---> free customizable blogs! come
                on, everyone's doing it! even steve's
                mom has a blog. 
this tutorial will walk you through getting
                  yourself a free blogger blog. go to blogger.com, create an
                  account, set up your blog and you're ready to turn the blogosphere
                  on it's rear. 
here's our completed example.

step 2:
                  make a screen capture on a mac
why
                    is this cool?
---> geeky computer tricks.
next you want to take a little picture of your
                video when it's displayed in you video player so people who are
                looking at your blog will know right away that there is video
                on the blog! "hey martha, take a look at this! there's some
                of that there video on this blog! i can tell because there's
                a picture of a little tv on here!"

step 2 (this time for pc users):
  make a screen capture on a pc 
why
                    is this cool?
---> it's a geeky computer trick in another
                language. 
let's do it one more time for all of the pc
                users in the room! how's this for a trick? no pcs we're used
                in the making of this video. also, no pc users were
                used so if the info is wrong, that would be the cause.

step 3:
              sign up for internet
                  archive & ourmedia accounts 
why
                    is this cool?
---> free media
                    hosting; huge community for trading original media. did i
                mention that people usually pay for this hosting stuff? 
your blogger blog doesn't actually store and
                host your media. you could pay for storage from a hosting
                company (roughly $80us a year, more if you get a lot of hits
                and use a bunch of bandwidth, which you will if you're
                hosting videos), but this is all about doing it for free. the
                partnership between the internet archive and ourmedia makes it
                easy as pie to upload and host your media for free, forever.
                how cool is that?
internet
                  archive
the internet archive is a public nonprofit that was founded to build an "internet
library," with the purpose of offering permanent access for researchers,
historians, and scholars to historical collections that exist in digital format.
ourmedia
  a branch of the internet archive.we provide free storage and free bandwidth
    for your videos, audio files, photos, text or software. forever. no catches.

step 4:
              publish your video
why
                    is this cool?
---> do you have to ask?  
get your videos on the internet so you can
                share them with the entire world. it's about time to let yourself
                shine. be your own star, be your own news anchor, heck, just
                be yourself.
note:
                    usually this all works as described but once in a while it 
                    doesn't. it's been getting better over time but you're doing 
                    this for free and it's in alpha so cut them some slack. 

having endless ourmedia trouble? try 
                    blip.tv as a reliable alternative. they're free and they'll 
                    even post to your blog for you. tutorial coming soon!
also uploading video from the ourmedia website
                works for files up to 20mb (we know it says 10mb but we generally
                have success with larger files). so what do you do if your video
                comes out bigger than 20mb? well, if you're using our compression
                settings this should give you about 4 - 5 minutes to tell your
                story. if you can't get it done in that amount of time, we suggest
                you quit your rambling and make that video shorter. really. shorter
                is almost always better. if you really must go on and on and
                on - then lower that bit-rate. this will also lower the quality
                of your video but by this time only your mom will be watching
                you so it won't be too much of a problem.

step
                5:
                post video & images on your blog
why is this cool?
---> this is the moment you've been waiting for! it's time for
                  your 15 minutes of fame.
use these simple steps to post your video and your photo  to
                your blog. warning: some html required! don't
                worry, it's easy but you can go ahead and tell everyone it was
                really complicated. 
wow, this is now so easy, even you can do it!

step
                6:
                  get an rss 2.0 feed w/ enclosures 
why is this cool?
---> people can subscribe and download
                your videos automatically.
this is the trickiest part (and the longest video) but it's
                so worth it. just set this up one time and people can automatically
                find out about your new stuff. this is much better than spaming
                all of your friends every time you make a new post! 
what is rss?

step 7:
              join the community
why is this cool?
--->
                because videobloggers are cool people! 
okay, really, we're not that cool but we are pretty smart and
                can probably help answer most any question about videoblogging
                you can come up with. 

first email
                  us              with the link to your videoblog and we'll feature you on the freevlog
                  vlog. 
next, join the videoblogging
                    yahoo group and
                  introduce yourself.  also, go to vlogmap.org and click on "submit
                    vlog" to claim your spot. we'll use this info to list you
                    in our videoblogging directories at vlogdir.com and videoblogging.info. 
don't forget to subscribe to all of your favorite
                videoblogs with ant and mefeedia.
don't forget to take  the
                  videobloggers' oath:
                i _________
                do solemnly promise to post video regularly. i promise to post
                video even if i don't really have time to or even if i really
                need to get some sleep. also, i promise to teach others to videoblog
                or at the very least, point them over here when they get inspired
                from watching my videos.


step
                8:
              link love
why is this cool?
---> you'll be sporting this hot little badge in your sidebar
                  and helping us out at the same time.
see this is how the internet works - if you like something you
                link to it. the more people  link to something, the higher
                it shows up in search engines like google. so if you link to
                us you'll be helping us get the word out. plus it'll only take
                you like 5 freakin' seconds so what's to lose?
