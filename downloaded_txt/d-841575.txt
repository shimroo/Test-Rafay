what is peaklist?

this website has lists of over 10,000 mountains worldwide.  the
website is designed to provide definitive lists of summits organized
around the concept of topographic prominence.  peaklist does
not attempt to list every mountain in the world; rather it introduces
original and complete research in specific geographical regions,
contributed by a wide number of researchers. 

to get started, you should browse the main lists
page with lists and maps from around the world.  in
particular, peaklist.org holds four large bodies of original
prominence data; the ultras project, which
catalogs all 1524 worldwide summits with 1500 meters of prominence; the
us p2000 project, which developed
the first ever dataset of 1234 summits in the lower 48 with 2000'
prominence; the california mountain atlas,
with all 4106 summits of
500' prominence; and the spire
measure section which develops a rigorous methodology to describe
the
impressiveness of a mountain.  peaklist also extensively links to
other prominence-derived research being conducted around the world.

what is prominence?


mountain summits have long been known by their elevation above mean sea
level.  now a growing community of climbers, mountain enthusiasts
and mathematicians recognize that summits can also be measured by
their elevation relative to the surrounding terrain.  prominence
is the elevation of a summit relative to the
highest point to which one must descend before reascending to
a higher summit.  all summits have a specific, non-arbitrary
prominence.  prominence
has generated considerable discussion and theory, and may be a central
concept to a better understanding of the mathematical
properties of the earth's surface.  you can read about the
underlying theory in the section titled prominence
theory.

but this site is not
primarily about math and earth science.  here you will find a
different kind of appreciation
of the
natural highpoints of the world.  in addition to the original
lists and maps of
mountains you can hopefully learn more about the growing peakbagging
subculture
dedicated to prominence.  this website is full of new information
- covering both the well-known and the completely unknown. 
hopefully
peaklist will leave you with a
greater appreciation for the wonderous diversity of montane landforms
worldwide.
