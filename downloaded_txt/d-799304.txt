and now . . . this - jan. 3/25






according to a news release from the hamilton police service, on dec. 18, a man entered a bmo branch over the lunch hour. having cycled to the bank in hamilton’s westcliffe east neighbourhood, the modern-day jesse james left his wheeled steed outside, and proceeded indoors.…
upon exiting the bank, and looking for his bike, the thief was reportedly “dazed and confused” upon realizing that some other enterprising bandito had made off with his bicycle.
[full story]

like the man said: instant karma's gonna get you. i'm sure police are looking for the bike thief, too—though hopefully not too hard

2024 reading review





it's the year 2525! (well…2025, but you can't begrudge me a little
bit of enthusiasm.) time to review my year with books (this is not a
book blog, i keep reminding myself).
as usual, my annual goal is to read 50 books of any kind. last year,
my final count was in the 70s. this year, it was…120. (my "official"
count at goodreads
is 105, but several of those are actually omnibus volumes.) the average
page count per book is still around 300, too. i wonder where i found the
extra freet time. maybe i didn't fall asleep as often.
the first book of the year was emily's
quest by l. m. montgomery, the final book in her emily
trilogy. maybe it's juvenile, maybe it's girly, and maybe i started
reading montgomery in my teens to impress a girl. nonetheless, over the
years, montgomery has become my favourite canadian author.
the last novel of the year was cyteen by c.
j. cherryh, which i finished on the weekend before christmas. this is an
sf novel from 1988 (which won the hugo in 1989) about the implications
of mass human cloning and designing human beings for specific functions.
(a little bit like blade runner in that respect, i guess.) it's
long, and i found it slow starting, but i got into it after a while. a
good comeback, considering i didn't really enjoy reading downbelow
station last year.
my newest book was in too deep by lee and
andrew child. as i said last year, as long as the jack reacher books
keep coming out in october, and i keep reading them as soon as possible,
this is going to be a recurring theme every year.
the oldest was journey to the west by wu
cheng'en, one of the great chinese novels. i also finished reading the
plays of aphra behn, the restoration dramatist. but journey to the
west was published c. 1592, beating her by almost a century. this
was another book that was hard to get into, and (though i'm not quite
finished) might also be the longest book i've ever read.
when you've read double your intended goal for the year, it's twice
as hard to pick a favourite. i suppose mine for 2023 was
holly by stephen king, his most recent novel,
featuring his neurotic lady detective from the bill hodges trilogy
(mr. mercedes, etc.). my runner-up, collectively, was the
toradora! series of light novels by yuyuko takemiya. i saw the
anime last year, and was so affected by it, i watched it again. the
novels didn't disappoint, either—surprising since i'm hardly a romance
reader.
it's a little easier to pick a least favourite when you devote an
entire month to reading something other than genre fiction, which
inevitably leads to some rather bleak and depressing literature. this
year's "winner" was the cellist of sarajevo by
steven galloway, a fictionalized telling of the story of a bosnian
cellist who risked his life to play an adagio every day for each of the
victims of a bombing. the problem with the book is that it wasn't really
about the cellist. he was a backdrop to his own story, and it
kind of left me cold. the runner-up was its immediate predecessor on my
list, rabbit, run by john updike. (is there a proper literary
word for a novel's main character who is just unpleasant in every
possible way? "anti-protagonist"?)
my best new discovery of the year was, a confederacy of
dunces, the pulitzer-winning novel by john kennedy toole.
again, this was one of my selections for september. its (anti?)
protagonist, ignatius j. reilly, is an overweight, unemployed,
pretentious pseudo-intellectual who lives with his mother. if toole had
written this novel in the 2020s instead of the 1960s, he'd probably be a
terminally-online redditor.
i met my goal of reading five nonfiction books this year, though no
more. the topics were literary criticism, theology, and poetry. the
last, in particular (anglican poet malcolm guite's two books waiting
on the word and the word in the wilderness) have sort of
sparked my interest in poetry, and i plan to read more this year. (i
didn't like poetry when i was in university, leading one of my english
profs to remark once—tongue-in-cheek, hopefully—what i didn't deserve an
english degree. better late than never.)
there were two goals that i didn't meet: first, finishing the works
of stephen king. i have one book left, you like it darker,
which i am about 2/3 of the way through. second, completing journey
to the west. i read three of the four volumes of anthony yu's
translation, but just ran out of time. since my christmas vacation is
usually a good time to blitz through a few books, i would have
accomplished both. how was i to know that a medical problem would keep
me in the emergency room for so much of my free time? i'll finish with
stephen king soon, though, and then clear the monkey king off my list a
little later, after i've gone through my outstanding library books (why
do long-time reserves always come in at once?).
finally, my reading goals for 2024 include:

doing a new readthrough. i really enjoyed the experience of blogging
my way through roger zelazny's chronicles of amber, and i plan
to do a few books regularly. my plan is to start with the final two
books in c. s. lewis's space trilogy (having already read
and reviewed the first, albeit 20 years ago) and if time permits, a
nonfiction book to be determined
with my stephen king reading project coming to an end, moving on to
another author: specifically, patrick o'brian, author of the
aubrey-maturing series of historical fiction
continuing my habit of reading drama on saturdays over breakfast,
but instead of focusing on a particular author (i.e. shakespeare and
behn), choose instead from a wide variety of classic plays from the
renaissance to the modern era
finish up some of the series i've started, but left hanging

happy 2025, everyone.

and now ... this - nov. 20/24





it's a few weeks old, but it's a goodie:

a russian court has fined google two undecillion roubles—a two followed by 36 zeroes—for restricting russian state media channels on youtube.
in dollar terms that means the tech giant has been told to pay $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
[full story]

in comparison terms, that means that if google paid the fine in cash, the mass of the us dollar bills would be 3.3 million times the mass of the entire earth.
obviously, google would pay in the largest denomination in circulation, and the stack of $100 bills would merely be 33,000 times as massive as the planet, which is far less ridiculous.

the chronicles of amber, chapter 14: the conclusion





this is it. the final chapter of the courts of chaos and of the chronicles of amber. it's been a fun trip.
spoiler alert: this post is part of an in-depth discussion of the courts of chaos by roger zelazny, which will inevitably reveal key plot points. you  may well have a lot of reading ahead of you.

this last chapter is more of an epilogue. random, appointed the king of amber by the unicorn and attuned to the jewel of judgment by corwin, successfully turns away the chaos storm. he, too, is now gone, and only corwin and his son merlin remain on the field of battle where amber conquered chaos.

the chronicles of amber, chapter 13





spoiler alert: this post is part of an in-depth discussion of the courts of chaos by roger zelazny, which will inevitably reveal key plot points. you  may well have a lot of reading ahead of you.

with the defeat of the chaosians and the death of brand, the amberites won the day. but they lost their father oberon, as well as their sister dierdre and the jewel of judgment. corwin collapsed and rested by the black road after oberon's funeral procession passed. when he came to, dara was riding past and berated him for killing her swordmaster, borel, then left him to return to her own people. corwin's son merlin met him briefly, and they began to talk, but they were suddenly interrupted by the appearance of the unicorn of amber.
the unicorn has the jewel of judgment around her neck. she gives it to random, indicating that he has been chosen as the heir to the amber throne. though surprised, he accepts, and the other amberites lay their swords at his feet.

science fiction-free september '24 wrap-up





last week i wrapped up the 2024 installment of my annual science fiction-free september. i'm happy to proclaim this year's moratorium on sf novels (and, more broadly, commercial fiction) a success.
i planned for five novels, plus two extras if time remained. i completed six, plus a handful of plays by aphra behn and a few japanese light novels (in english). so overall, i read 14 individual titles this september, with a number of them being short and light reading. but the main selections were anything but light! i noted last year that i'd chosen some heavy-hitting fiction, and the same is true this year.

the courts of chaos, chapter 12





spoiler alert: this post is part of an in-depth discussion of the courts of chaos by roger zelazny, which will inevitably reveal key plot points. you  may well have a lot of reading ahead of you.

using the  new primal pattern he had created before brand stole the jewel of judgment, corwin teleported himself to the battleground at the courts of chaos. there, brand took dierdre hostage as a bargaining chip to force corwin to help him with his own plans. however, he was shot by a mysterious green-clad archer, causing him, dierdre, and the jewel fell into the chaosian abyss. the archer revealed himself as caine, who had faked his own murder to get to the bottom of the intrigue in amber secretly. as they spoke, they were interrupted by three trumpeters on horseback emerging from the black road.

rip auto-posting





sometime after sunday, i realized that my posts weren't automatically publishing to twitter. after a bit of investigation, i learned that dlvr.it ended their free tier. oddly enough, i was informed that my "trial" had ended, though i've been using the service for years.
well, that's annoying. it's their business, of course, but one of my pet peeves is when long-established free services on the internet start demanding money out of the blue.
and then i thought, "wait a minute, i'm a programmer." why can't i roll my own auto-poster? polling the site and grabbing the title and url for new posts is easy, so the only thing i really need to learn is how to access the x api. (and in so doing, i realized i'd inadvertently been "spamming" for several months, by posting substantially identical tweets to both my accounts. i'll be a bit more creative with the second cross-post, i promise!)
not that the faithful readers will necessarily notice, but automatic posting will resume shortly. that is all.

the courts of chaos, chapter 11





spoiler alert: this post is part of an in-depth discussion of the courts of chaos by roger zelazny, which will inevitably reveal key plot points. you  may well have a lot of reading ahead of you.

corwin was riding from amber to the courts of chaos, to bring the jewel of judgment to benedict's battle there and give them an advantage against the chaosians. however, he was overtaken by the oncoming chaos storm of shadow being torn apart after oberon's possibly failed attempt to repair the primal pattern at amber. to protect himself from the storm, corwin used the jewel to create a new pattern where he was. he was successful, but when he was finished, brand appeared and stole the jewel from him.
corwin then used the new pattern to transport himself to the battlefield in chaos. he found brand at a vantage point overlooking the scene, using his partial attunement with the jewel to fight the amberite forces with lightning. as the amberites reached brand, he took dierdre hostage.

happy birthday, jimmy carter





on december 12, 1952, the first meltdown of a nuclear reactor occurred in the national research experimental (nrx) reactor in chalk river, ontario. there were no fatalities or injuries, but radioactive material was leaked into the environment and vented into the atmosphere.
the cleanup took months and involved hundreds, including 150 american military personnel, led by a 28-year-old u.s. navy submarine lieutenant named jimmy carter who was part of the fledgling nuclear submarine program. disassembling the reactor involved donning protective gear and being lowered into it for only a few minutes at a time to avoid overexposure to radioactivity.
supposedly, carter's exposure to radiation was 1000 times what would be considered safe today: it's said that he peed radioactive urine for six months, and his ability to have children in the future was in question.
as it turned out, he had four children, became the governor of georgia, and then was elected the 39th president of the united states. following his presidency, he won the nobel peace prize for his humanitarian work. and today, jimmy carter turned 100. not only is he the longest-lived ex-president and the former president with the longest post-presidency, but he's the first president to become a centenarian. carter has outlived all his predecessors in the oval office, and two of his successors. it would appear that the comic books are right: exposure to radioactivity endows you with superpowers.
