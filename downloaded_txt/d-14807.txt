pbs kids programs show values of enduring relationships, fair play, knowing and practicing ‘the right thing to do’, acknowledgment of how hard it is to be a kid sometimes… pbs kids is a safe place to play in an increasingly scary world.

many times i discover the only programs worth watching are on pbs wisconsin. my two young daughters enjoy many of the kids’ shows you have to offer; in fact, i enjoy watching most of them myself. your history programming is excellent and always inspiring, to see how past generations have struggled and thrived at the same time.

commercial-free, high-quality, carefully constructed educational programming, free and available to all, is so important to have as a resource for our kids. i appreciate the stem emphasis of shows and we love the reading and vocabulary-building shows too!

my radio dial (of both car and home radios) stays set on wpr because of the regular hours of classical music which i don’t find on other stations. public television provides for me concerts which i rarely go out to attend. i also appreciate the in-depth reporting of the pbs newshour which i watch regularly.

pbs wisconsin education’s resources are about wisconsin and focus on many of the great things in our very own state. the materials are reliable and credible. they are easy to access and appropriate for students at a variety of grade levels.

pbs wisconsin education is a wonderful resource for our elementary students. without “into the book”, “bill nye”, and “wisconsin biographies” our curriculum for english/language arts, science, and social studies would be greatly diminished.
