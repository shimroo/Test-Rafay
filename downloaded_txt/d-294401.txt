the
                                 san luis valley is a large area in southern colorado, generally considered to be somewhat flat, but surrounded by high mountains
                                 on several sides, including 14,000 and 13,000 foot peaks.  the average elevation of the "valley" is 7,664 feet
                                 in altitude.  although 6 counties make up the valley, our land is only in costilla county and alamosa county.   the
                                 united states received this land from mexico and spain and it was primarily settled after the mexican-american war in 1848.
                                 the government also made a treaty with the ute indians after they established fort garland in the area and that was crucial
                                 before the area could be populated.  our land is mostly in the area south and east of fort garland
                                 but we also have land to the north and south of hwy 160 around blanca and to the west of blanca.
