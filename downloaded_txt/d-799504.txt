soweto.co.za gives back… 




the ekukhanyeni creche & siyakhuliswa educare & preschoolpioneered by our founder and philanthropist – denis creighton – and through income earned from our tours as well as monthly donations from our generous regular doners (forest town methodist church, the mike creighton fund, the hudson fund, uj and many other ad-hoc supporters) we have been able to help support the ekukhanyeni creche located in the diepkloof hostel in soweto as well as the siyakhuliswa creche in lehae, for the past at least 25 years.both facilities provide much-needed pre-school education, feeding schemes and safe child care for the nearby impoverished communities that they serve. the ekukhanyeni creche is a much-enjoyed stop on our tours and interaction with the kids and syvlia and her team of dedicated staff is a heart-warming and fun experience for our guests and the kids. any donations to enhance these essential facilities is always appreciated, should you wish to become involved please email: ken@soweto.co.za

about 




the establishment of soweto is, like johannesburg, linked directly to the discovery of gold in 1885. thousands of people from around the world and south africa flocked to the new town to seek their fortunes or to offer their labour.
