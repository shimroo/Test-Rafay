total pet care is permanently closed












it is with great sadness that we inform you of the permanent closure of total pet care on 8.18.23. due to the nationwide shortage of veterinarians, we’ve been unable to recruit doctors to our practice and can no longer provide the quality veterinary care you’ve come to expect from our team. after many years of service to our community, this has been a very difficult decision to make.
please email info@tpcmaumee.com to request a copy of your pet’s medical records by august 31st, 2023. after this date, your pet’s medical records will no longer be available.
we’d like to thank you for trusting us with the care of your beloved pets over the years and wish you and your family the best for years to come.
