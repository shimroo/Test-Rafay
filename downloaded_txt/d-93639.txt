february 20, 2019 linda spencer 



if you have children you probably know toys are important for them. one thing that is important too is their knowledge. educating children about various subjects will help them in school and steps as they become an adult. one of the ways to do this is to include educational toys for your child. it doesn’t need to be a program that they sit down and learn about, it can be dinosaur toys for kids that simply show them about the history of the planet. keep reading for our recommendations for fun and educational toys for kids. 
 
dinosaur toys
as we stated in the last paragraph, dinosaur toys are very helpful to teach children about the history of the earth. you can even talk to them as they are playing with the dinosaurs about why they are important and what makes them unique in this world. you can also get a dinosaur toy that shares a bit about the history or you can pair it will a dinosaur book that evening so when they go to pick up their dinosaur toy the next day they know what they are playing with and why it’s important and part of history. 
 
rocks
are you on a budget? don’t worry, walk around and show your child about rocks. although you don’t want to teach your child to throw them, you can pick them up and talk to them about the different types of rocks. you can also tell them about how they were formed, what makes them different colors, where you can find different colors or rocks, the list goes on and on. if you are unsure of all these questions, don’t worry, that’s perfectly normal. grab a video from your local library and you both can watch it together. once you are finished you can go for a walk and try and find the same rocks you just learned about in your video. it’s a fun bonding experience and it will teach you lots. 
 
science kit
there are some amazing science kits out there that will teach your child about science, about different substances and materials, and will help them to understand the world a little bit. the best part about it, when you get one that is for a child, it will be fun for them. let them dig in a small sand kit and try and find some undiscovered bones. you can try and find a science kit that is specific to what your child is interested in. if they show a large interest in science, this is a great toy and activity they can do that is both educational and will keep them engaged for hours. 
 
lego
lego may seem like an obvious choice to add to this list, but people don’t realize how beneficial it really is.

 lego teaches children a lot of hand-eye coordination. building dinosaurs legos are similar to being an engineer in training. does that sound beneficial to you? it most definitely is. it teaches children why something can go in a specific place and why, it teaches children to have a sturdy base of a building, and it teaches kids what will fit in different spots. although you want to avoid stepping on the lego with your bare feet as much as possible, having lego for children to play with it a wonderful toy that will help educate and build their brain and is fun for them. 
 
magic kit
what kid doesn’t like magic? most love magic. this is even truer if they can do the magic themselves. magic includes a lot of chemistry. a substance can mix with another substance to create something. or their hand-eye coordination should be improved in order to be sneaky with certain cards during a magic trick. there may be some magic tricks that may be a little too advanced for your child, but it gives them something to work towards and they understand if they keep working at this they will be able to achieve a new magic trick. it is similar to having a goal and working hard towards it, you get better until you reach the goal. 
 
diary
a diary is a great way for a child to practice their writing. it will also help them express their emotions and thoughts. a great way to entice your child to do this is to either let them pick out a nice diary they want to write in or you can get them one as a gift. there are great ones for children that have princesses on them that even lock so they have their own key and it helps them to feel in charge and important. writing will also help their writing skills to improve. reading and writing are a very important skill to have at any age, starting a child young is important and will help them throughout all grade school and also when they become an adult. when they are old and they need to write a letter to their boss or write a memo out, they will be so happy they wrote in their diary so much and learned such an important skill.
