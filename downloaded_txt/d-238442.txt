the rtsa platform facilitates real-time reporting crucial to decision making and progression of a make-safe or related repairs in a timely manner. 
site reporting is further enforced with the ability to mark-up several photos with the inclusion of labels, arrows and other features drawing the reader’s attention to areas of interest.
specialists’ reports are to be submitted directly from site with your unique branding including trading name, logo and licence number once registered on our database.
specialist reporting is often the bottleneck in site assessments, especially after a sizeable event and frequently delay the submission of the property assessment reports with supporting evidence and the related estimate or quote.

these delays often impact kpi’s.
extend the repair lifecycle.
lack consistent reporting or quality of data.

following a major or catastrophic event we require our supporting trades to function at the highest efficiencies reaching maximum throughput to manage the enormous workload to overcome the massive backlogs.
our basic set of reporting includes:

make-safe reporting 
make-safe cost report
dilapidation reporting
tade specialist reporting
           
electrical 
plumbing
roofing
