            eeoc seeks to drop a gender discrimination case, signaling a big shift in civil rights enforcement

the federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws has moved to dismiss its own lawsuit on behalf of a worker allegedly fired for his sexual orientation and gender identity, arguing that the case now conflicts with president donald trump’s recent executive order. the equal employment opportunity commission on thursday filed a joint motion to dismiss its case against harmony hospitality llc just eight months after the agency sued the company over its firing of an employee who identifies as nonbinary male and gay. the eeoc’s request marks a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law after the trump administration declared that the government would recognize only two sexes: male and female. read moreeeoc seeks to drop a gender discrimination case, signaling a big shift in civil rights enforcement

the trump administration blocked the associated press from traveling with president trump on air force one and also from covering an oval office event. it's part of an ongoing terminology dispute over the gulf of mexico. the administration criticized ap's “commitment to misinformation” in not adopting trump's name change to “gulf of america” in all of its copy. ap says the administration is flouting the first amendment in punishing the news outlet for not saying what it wants. ap has advised the thousands of news outlets that use its service that it would continue to use gulf of mexico as its style but would note trump's change of name as well. read moreap reporter and photographer barred from air force one over 'gulf of mexico' terminology dispute
