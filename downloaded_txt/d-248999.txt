every project starts with a dream, and at northwest playground equipment it's our calling to make that dream a reality.
give us a call and let our expert parks consultants help be a resource to guide your project wherever you are in the process.
 





site visits - the first step of almost any project is arranging a site visit with our local parks consultants. during our first meeting we'll discuss the project goals, understand any site specific conditions, and develop a scope of work to get us started on putting together designs and budget estimates.
cad + renderings - after our initial site visit we'll take our understanding of your site and work with our in-house designer to develop detailed cad drawings and 3d renderings of initial concepts.
fundraising support - are you looking to raise money for a project? at northwest playground equipment we keep up to date on the pulse of national and local funding opportunities to help supplement your project project budgets.
and it's all free! - being a resource for park planning is a service we take pride in so much so that all of our front end planning efforts are a no-cost service that we provide to help make your project a success. it's as easy as giving us a call or e-mail to get started!

on-site supervision - it's always great to get the community involved in a project, and if that's your goal we can help provide an experienced on-site supervisor for the duration of a weekend volunteer build.
