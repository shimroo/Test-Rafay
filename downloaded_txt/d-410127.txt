honoring "students’ right to their own language" in a new era: pwr and the power of cultural rhetorics 
the most enduring policy document of our leading intellectual and professional organization, the conference on college composition and communication was ratified nearly 50 years ago, in april 1974. that document, “students’ right to their own language,” identifies students’ “patterns and varieties of language” as a fundamental right that writing instructors must honor—and must have the “experiences and training” that will enable them to do so.

the writing and rhetoric requirement at stanford
pwr 1 and pwr 2 courses are carefully designed to offer richly diverse intellectual experiences based on shared assignments, goals, and learning outcomes. the basic structure of required pwr courses—in particular, the assignment sequence—does not vary from section to section, but each instructor builds on this shared core, designing class materials and activities and choosing readings to develop a unique course.

pwr 1 courses

pwr 2 courses
