kind words from our clients







             excellent  based on 875 reviews                 rachael johnson  may 9, 2022.    my piercer dylan was fantastic! i absolutely love my daith and cartilage. very professional ! highly recommend!!            cheryl ritz  may 3, 2022.    my 14 yr old was allowed and able to get her septum pierced and she loves it!! the piercer explained everything to her the dos the donuts etc, i highly recommend going to piercology for all your piercing needs and wants!            valenda lengade  april 29, 2022.    i went in a few days early to scope out the place, staff and jewelry for a nose piercing appointment i made. i was pleasantly surprised at the staff and how sweet they were. totally cool with all my questions. very informative staff. cute little shop!  i was excited to come back. went in today and had a great experience with the staff. helpful and very patient. christine did as wonderful job explaining all the steps and made me feel super comfortable! love, love, love my nose piercing! another bucket list item checked off!            josie darr  april 22, 2022.    amazing experience,  wonderful staff            alisha carroll  april 19, 2022.    i had my tragus pierced, and a recovery piercing done by dylan about a year ago. i originally had an appointment with christine, but she was not there when i got there. but my experience with dylan was pretty good, he was cool, and i didn't have any issues after. my only issue was with not being informed of christine not being there when i stated i was there for an appointment with christine; i didn't know until another guy piercer was taking me back to do my piercing. the guy was cool about it though, and went and got dylan since i was a little uncomfortable about that, i almost didn't want to do it. i had read reviews, and liked the reviews for christine that's why i made an appointment with her. but anyway i do feel like the pricing on the jewelry per stud is kinda high; i paid like $80 for 1 small 14k gold stud for my tragus, and like $35 for 1 small titanium stud for the recovery piercing. although, i never went back to get the stud switched out i do recommend it, because i kept getting a nasty looking irritation bump on the inside of my tragus piercing. but i never had an infection, and i don't get the bump anymore :). i would go back for another piercing with dylan!            will s.  april 16, 2022.    they're always friendly, respectful, and they make you feel at ease about your piercings. i've recommended friends, and they've also had really good experiences.

update: i continue to go there because they continue to be amazing at their craft. i have multiple piercings, hazel and dylan really are beautiful humans, and the experience is so above par and professional. even other customers are nice. i recommend coming here for all piercings regardless of age, size, color, race, gender (as they are inclusive), etc.
