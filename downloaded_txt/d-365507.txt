mission statement of the georgetown university jesuits
the georgetown university jesuits are an apostolic religious community grounded in love for jesus christ and animated by the ignatian spiritual vision of helping others and seeking god in all things. as members of a worldwide society within the catholic church, we are committed to the service of faith and the promotion of justice.
we serve god’s people at the nation’s oldest catholic and jesuit university, established in the religiously inclusive and international spirit of georgetown’s founder, john carroll. we witness to the compatibility of faith and reason, work to extend knowledge and cultivate a university community that reflects the conviction that the good life is a life lived generously in the service of others. we are privileged to labor along with our colleagues through scholarship and teaching, pastoral work and spiritual formation, administration and hospitality.
as friends in the lord, we support one another in our ministries through a common life of worship and prayers, simplicity, spiritual conversation, encouragement, respect and affection. we reflect and plan together with discerning love so that all our present and future endeavors at georgetown might be done for the greater glory of god.
