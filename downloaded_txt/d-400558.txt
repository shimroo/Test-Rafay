camp olympia is a rockville, md sports camp, nursery school & child care center that also offers horseback riding to children and adults from all across maryland. our summer sports camp was established over 66 years ago and has been catering to the needs of the community since the late 1950's. the camp facility is located very close to washington, dc and the surrounding communities, placing it in a perfect location for rockville, bethesda and city parents. the suburban area and proximity to the city create a unique environment at camp olympia, unmatched by any other sports camp in the area!






66 years of fun!









"thank you all for the great care that my daughter shauna has received at camp olympia. before we came to camp olympia i was quite skeptical about day care centers due to past experiences. in the two months we have been with you my confidence has been restored.

"thank you for the wonderful summer camp experience you provided for our 8 year old sophia. we are so impressed with the quality of your horse riding program! unlike other schools you focused on riding basics in a small class setting with an observant instructor who was very familiar with all the kids- their names their skills their personalities. as parents we appreciated that you patiently ran drills on posture and position rather that rush into moves for which sophia was unprepared. we never worried for sophia's safety on horseback. sophia can now dive swim across the pool underwater climb a rope and vault. your curriculum and counselors have given so much to sophia.
