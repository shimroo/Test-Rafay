the big question?

"why should i buy an auto switch from faxswitch.com rather than a cheaper one?"

short answer: good question! the reasons are quality and reliability. the old adage "you get what you pay for" is especially true in this business. your phone system has to work day in and day out for the life of your business. our business quality call processors are they type you can depend on. if your phone system is down one day, that's one day to many. you easily pay for the small difference in cost with the monthly savings from your phone bills. 

long answer: one of the main problems with this type of device (and all computers) is system failure. you may have experienced it on your pc when it "locks up" and you have to "reboot" your computer to get it going again. faxswitches are basically small computers and the same thing happens, only it sounds like you are not home (or not answering your phone anyway) in other words the phone sounds like it's ringing to the caller but you hear nothing. to the calling party it just rings and rings. on your end, you hear nothing. someone has to come by or call you on another line and say "hey why aren't you answering your phone?" and you say, "oh! it's that cheap faxswitch again. let me go turn it off and back on." it will work for a while but eventually it will happen again. very frustrating and not very good for business. 



  rest assured that this will never happen with any of our equipment. we invented "watchdog®" circuitry and other features so this would never happen. what "watchdog®" circuitry does, is constantly monitor your phone line. if there is ever a system failure (and eventually there always is) the box is smart enough to know it and reboots itself. it takes less than a second and your phones always work. 
this is only one example of some of the many "extra features" we include to make our products truly "business quality." we have excellent toll free factory trained tech support and installation help. our factory warranties are the longest and most comprehensive in the telecommunications industry. we know your business is worth it and it shows in our products and service.
