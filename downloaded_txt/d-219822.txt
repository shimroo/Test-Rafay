how it's made: treo ct










what reviewers are saying...


" ... the ideal speaker for both the non-audiophile music lover who wants superior sound (without having to devote his or her living space, retirement fund, or life to the quest), and the budding audiophile in search of an entry-level speaker."
 
this review is about the preceeding model 1ci.

'i purchased vandersteen quatro wood ct speakers after auditioning dozens of others,  including wilson, magico, focal, harbeth, klipsch, sonos faber, etc.,--the vandersteen's didn't stun me, they didn't knock me over the head, or attempt to color my world with a particular 'brand sound,' they simply captivated me and sucked me into the profundity of great music if well recorded regardless of genre. they activate my imagination and produce the experience of what it might have been like to be there in the studio, arena, theater, etc. i couldn't be happier with my choice. and thanks to john rutan and the gang at audio connection for being such helpful  audio sherpas.'
regarding audio connection--i'm so lucky and grateful to have that great gang of misfits living nearby in verona, new jersey. big thanks in particular to nick and samir for providing set up expertise.
i'm only one month in with this new system but already i can tell you the music flowing out of the quatros has brought so much joy and pleasure to me and my family. 
i also think it's super cool how directly involved richard vandersteen is with his customers and fans, not only on this forum, but via email, telephone, in person, etc. i have a sense this isn't common among other high profile speaker designers.
