the ice queen!











































i live by:

my candle burns at both ends;
it will not last the night;
but ah, my foes, and oh, my friends--
it gives a lovely light!

  -- edna st. vincent millay

ode to monika
[?]
"riding astride a rugged pony,
children adored she's never lonely.
steady wind blows flaxen tresses,
in lover's arms she offers caresses.
bubbling sulpher springs beneath,
it has been decided and bequeathed.
in snowy climate and harsh terrain,
that overall an ice queen reigns."

it's all coming together...

three exams down, two to go. lost luggage has been returned to owner *pheu*. computer is still broken, but i am thinking about buying a new one. maybe an apple, gwyneth paltrow named her child that... and if it is good enough for gwyneth it's good enough for me! generous donations will certainly speed the process along ;)i miss blogging, i miss you guys and things will be set in motion once this darn exam period is behind us.also, kermit is cute!labels: this and that

a quick update...

life is wonderful. i have had my first practical experience at a hospital and it was wonderful, albeit very messy at times. spring is in the air, my heart and at the soles of my feet.i had the pleasure of meeting terry and her other half and would like to seize the opportunity and send out my regards and thanks for a wonderful time.the only thing bugging me right now is my non-compliant brother who has no time to fix and even more non-compliant computer.rest assured i will be back!labels: miss you guys

guys,

due to reasons beyond my technologically challenged mind, i have problems accessing any blogspot-sites these days. my brother had the clever idea of switching servers and with it: switched my access. he has promised to fix this problem in the near future and he better...if he expects to have one :)i miss you lot. this too shall pass. if i end in jail...please do send letters!
