featured productpt12 precision thermometerthe rh systems pt12 is a highly precise and stable platinum resistance thermometer (prt) based multi-channel temperature measurement system. using a custom designed high-quality measurement circuit with full current reversal and multiplexed sampling, the pt12 provides 12 channels of low uncertainty temperature data for validation and calibration engineers.read morecgs-240 humidity generatorthe rh systems cgs-240 humidity generator is a system capable of continuous, high-accuracy humidity generation over a wide range of humidity, temperature, and flow rates. the cgs-240 design is an rhs hybrid two-pressure two-temperature design based on fundamental nist developed principlesread morefeatured productg3 frost point generatorthe rh systems g3 is a low humidity generator that encapsulates essential tubing, pressure regulator, flow regulator, and saturator within a sealed vacuum chamber. use of the vacuum chamber eliminates atmospheric water vapor permeation and the need for thermal insulation materials in and around thermally
controlled components. additionally, stirling cryo-coolers (more accurately free-piston stirling coolers) are used to cool the saturator.read morefeatured product973-sf6 analyzerthe rh systems model 973-sf6 analyzer was specifically designed for measurement of humidity and sf6 purity in gas insulated switchgear systems. humidity measurement data is displayed in ppmv, ppmw and dew/frost point at either system pressure or standard pressure. purity measurement is displayed directly in % volume sf6. both the humidity and purity measurements utilize accurate and reliable condensation techniques.read more

rh systems is a recognized world leader in humidity measurement and generation, which is why this same equipment is in our own lab and is the foundation of our iso/iec 17025 nvlap accreditation (nvlap lab code 600161-0).

humidity measurement
preferred by calibration laboratories and national metrology institutes worldwide, our precision chilled mirror technology is the choice for humidity measurement references and transfer standards where extreme accuracy, stability, and repeatability are critical. outside the laboratory, our industrial chilled mirror instruments provide laboratory precision in a rugged design.
humidity generation
patented and well established, our two-pressure two-temperature generators are precise, stable, and respond rapidly to setpoint changes. creating an environment of known temperature and humidity, these generators are the standard for calibration of humidity sensors, chart recorders, and other hygrometers.
