who am i

present life of human












who am i


human is an animal who can think.

when we consider the whole earth life of a single human begin is equal to the life of an earthworm.

it make no change in the world if you or i die.

when one die ten is born.so no one cares what happen to you.

when on dies other just remember him for a few days and all things come back to normal.

you should never be pride as you are nothing.

you are just a small insect in the earth who lives in a small place not even knowing what is actually happening.

                  now the                     question comes

                                                                whoam i
