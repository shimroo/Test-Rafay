dr. 
                    a. richard goldman: delivering proven solutions 
                    for head and neck pain caused by tmj.





when you’re in the grip of severe, chronic 
                    pain, everything suffers…including your health, your 
                    work and your relationships. if you’ve been plagued 
                    by headaches and/or neck pain for years, chances are you’ve 
                    seen a number of specialists and undergone many different 
                    types of treatment without finding real relief.
while most experts agree that the most frequent 
                    cause of head and neck pain is muscle spasm, there is limited 
                    awareness of the severe pain that these spasms can create. 
                    since muscle spasms do not show up on x-rays, mris, or create 
                    changes in the laboratory tests that are typically ordered, 
                    the diagnosis of migraine is often mistakenly made.
 dr. goldman has the specialized expertise and 
                    proven track record to help you break the debilitating pain 
                    cycle caused by tmj for good. over nearly 40 years, he has 
                    built a reputation as one of the nation's leading providers 
                    of treatment for temporomandibular joint (tmj) dysfunction 
                    syndrome. he is not content with simply treating your symptoms. 
                    instead, he delves deeper – combining powerful diagnostic 
                    techniques with unique treatments that target and resolve 
                    the cause of your pain at its source. 
dr. goldman has achieved significant, lasting 
                    pain reduction for his patients, which include people from 
                    across the u.s. and other countries, and those who have undergone 
                    many other treatments without success. with his help, you 
                    can experience the lasting relief you’ve been searching

                    pain. read more.
