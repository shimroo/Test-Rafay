reviews 



what our clients
are saying 











“working with dynamic closures, specifically greg trimboli, over the past few years, on several projects, has been a tremendous asset to ewingcole.
dynamic’s assistance with early, schematic stage planning and layout helps to ensure that adequate space for door pockets and ceiling tracks are accounted for in the design and gives us confidence moving forward that there will not be any dimensional surprises further into the project. the team at dynamic understands our needs as designers and always suggests the right door and pocket to use that match the requirements and desired look of the project.” 


kevin r. nowak, aia, leed bd+cewingcole, philadelphia 







“dynamic closures has been our preferred vendor for side folding grilles for over 30 years. they are the leader in the industry. their product and engineering innovation has been a key factor in their continued success.
whether an application requires a standard product or custom design, we rely on dynamic’s expertise to provide the best solution for our customer’s long term needs. the customer service team is experienced and always takes care of our requests promptly. we select vendors who will help us maintain our reputation as a leader in our market. dynamic has done this for many years and we look forward to continuing our partnership well into the future.” 


justin witter, vice president, salesmid-atlantic door group, inc. 







“it was a pleasure working with greg and the staff at dynamic closures last summer! we used the sl prestige security gate on a handful of projects and have been really pleased thus far.
the staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and went above and beyond expectations. greg was very responsive to all our questions and reviewed our plans thoroughly to ensure we were specifying all the right components. he guided us through the entire process with ease!”
