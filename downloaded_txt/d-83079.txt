welcome to basset hound rescue of georgia, inc.

 
basset hound rescue of georgia, inc. is a non-profit, volunteer effort to save abandoned and mistreated basset hounds for the love of the breed. our rescue effort began in 1991, and we have rescued over 3,000 bassets since then. initially, only two volunteers privately funded basset hound rescue. today, bhrg is a 501(c)3, non-profit organization, which exists solely on donations.
bhrg is not a kennel, nor do we have a facility. our basset hounds are located in foster homes and at bhrg veterinary & boarding partners in the metro-atlanta area. we do not have a paid staff. all of our workers are volunteers who give their time because they love the breed.

basset bash picnic
each fall, we gather with our hounds at fowler park in cumming for fellowhship, games, basset merch shopping, the best raffle, lots of adoptions, and a food truck lunch.  this event is commemorated with a collectible t-shirt!
