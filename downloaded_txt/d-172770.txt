cedar point resort guests love our location! we're located on the north end of cedar lake, in times square, where the east and west arms of cedar lake meet the cedar river.  we are situated in a secluded bay, more than 5 miles from the nearest camp.  this location provides easy access to the entire cedar lake watershed.  with over 61 miles of shoreline, cedar lake offers 6,500 acres of excellent fishing.  the cedar river runs to perrault lake which gives you access to 9 lakes with a total of 20,000 acres of water to fish.  the variety of waters and topography will allow you to successfully fish for walleye, jumbo perch, crappie, smallmouth bass, northern pike and muskie (cedar lake is a class a muskie lake).  some of the best fishing in northwest ontario can be done from cedar point resort.
