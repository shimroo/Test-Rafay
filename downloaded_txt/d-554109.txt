of high-tech, 
family-oriented agriculture at kirby peak ranch.











located at kirby peak ranch is a state-of-the-art greenhouse
structure
encompassing nearly 1/2 acre and housing fascinating plant and fish culture
systems.  our introductory guided tour allows visitors to wander among
the lush plants while learning about the technologies of soilless plant culture,
aquaculture and the combination of these methods, aquaponics.  specialized 2-3 day workshops and conferences
provide a structured classroom and a hands-on learning experience and the
intensive training program offers enthusiastic students a unique opportunity to learn all facets of
this 21st century means of growing food while living on the park-like agri-campus for a 3
month session.  in the hydroponic and aquaponic plant production
systems you'll find juicy beefsteak tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, fancy lettuces,
strawberries, fresh culinary herbs, edible flowers, cucumbers, peppers and
nearly any other garden crop, all grown without soil.  the
fish tanks are home to hybrid carp, largemouth bass, sturgeon and koi.
join us for lunch with the llamas!
