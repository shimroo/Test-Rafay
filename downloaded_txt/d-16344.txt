who is lawrence d. elliott
i learned i was a writer while in special education at the age of thirteen. i had a severe reading disorder and my teacher used writing to reach me. weird, huh? but it was the greatest gift she could have given me. it was the first time i felt any self-worth. from that moment on, writing became my anchor in stormy seas, even before i was ever published. today, i’m a bestselling author and contributor to the bestselling chicken soup for the soul book series. i’ve also contributed to huffpost and a number of other top-selling books and periodicals.
before i had an amazon #1 bestseller, i was proud of my writing, because i love telling stories. it’s all about the stories…
   here's a taste of lawrence
