honor & integrity
saints strive to be honest, kind, and compassionate, choosing the hard right over the easy wrong. we care most about developing young men who possess honor and integrity. 













pursuit of excellence
saints strive to do their best in every endeavor. we value hard work and perseverance both inside and outside the classroom, focusing on process more than outcome. 













community & brotherhood
saints strive to understand and act upon the notion that we are part of something larger than ourselves. we value leadership, service, and the lifelong relationships that are formed in our community.

the st. christopher’s experience is distinctive because of three foundational elements.

		we possess a set of core values known as community pillars. these pillars guide and inform our curriculum and institutional priorities in educating our boys and creating an inclusive and welcoming community.
