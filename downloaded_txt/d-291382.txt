hey
              folks! it's me! who, you say? well, i don't blame you one bit for
              forgetting who the heck i am, but let's git right into catching
              up, anyhow, 'cause i haven't forgotten you! not quite sure how
              to update you.should i go clean back to june and come forward or
              start here tonight with a fresh memory and put 'er in reverse.
              oh, what the heck! i'm gonna head on back to the dog days of last
              summer
              and spur you right on up to today. let's get 'er done! (borrowed
          that from larry the cable guy!)



                little joe
              
new
                    hoss, little joe the wrangler and i got acquainted on a warm
                    spring day moving
                    cow/calf pairs to summer pasture. you gotta keep your mind
                    centered on what he's up to as he's a little on the goosey
                    side, but i
                    think
    he'll end up fittin' our needs okay. 




                calf
              
this
                  calf's gonna be givin' the dogs something to do any second
                  now.



                dogs go to work
              
see
              what i mean!



                ball of worms
                

we
                  sort of like this early june time of the year, as things slow
                  down just a
                  bit from the hectic pace of calving and pushing cows to summer
                  pasture and dragging meadows and critical fencing and other
                  things
                  that                you've already heard me complain about
                  in the past. i was fixing lunch (we call                lunch
                  dinner, as you know, and dinner is supper) one warm sunny day
                  in mid-june, when rudy and the dogs dropped by
                  for a bite to eat between cleaning out                irrigating
                  ditches. "a little while ago, i saw the darndest
                thing in the west                ditch out in the meadow," he
                said, as he turned on kpin and settled down at the kitchen table
                to listen
                to cow radio. "it was this huge
                basketball-sized                pile of night crawlers just layin'
                in the bottom of the ditch in about six                inches
                of water." well, i told him to finish frying the
                hamburgers, and i                grabbed my camera and headed
                like a shot to snap a picture of 'em. pretty danged cool!




                listening to cow radio
              
mealtime,
                  bo dog, irrigating boots, and the clear out west (cow)
              radio show!




                loading croanie cows
              
                now, i'll be quiet and let a series of photos
                do the talkin'!
                you'll be seeing summer 2004 from removing foxtails from dog
                ears to loading                croanie cows and calves to fishing
                fun after fencing (bo dog loves to fish!)                to hauling
                hay to old lacy dog's last haying (she turns 15 on march 10 and
                is              still hanging in there!) to visiting ferret friends.

                little sweetheart

  a sweet, little 2-year old (daughter of a friend)
                has been
                keepin' time-from time to time-with "aunt" cris and "uncle" rudy.
                though az                lives in town, she is a cowgirl-in-progress
                through and through. and she keeps a              whole herd
                of adults busy, busy, and worn out at day's end!




                rescued kitten
rudy doesn't really like cats...yeah, right!
                this little fella
                was rescued from the gentle, slobbery mouth of the big bo dog...
                friends up                country were "talked" into
                rescuing him from his "tough" life
                here on the              ranch!

rudy,
                  robert ray, bob beard, and gene pearson sort through a corral
                  load of heifers and steers and
                brand inspector bob beard completes the proper paperwork for
                pearson angus ranch calves to be trucked out of sublette county...
                these two pictures were taken courtesy of nita miller, our very
                nice interim postmaster. our dear florence, brand inspector bob
                beard’s wife, who spoiled us all royally, retired in october
                after nearly 30 years of tending to our mail… we shall
                miss her great efforts on our behalf! now, we have to saddle
                up a horse to catch up with her and bob for a good visit! i must
                also correct my oversight from last time. all the great branding
                pictures were taken by a way cool cowgal from down colorado way,
                judy walker. thanks, ladies, for sharing your awesome talents!
              



happy
                  valentine’s day from the "heartland" of
              sublette county!! 



hay,
                  hay, hay! seems like ranch life centers around hay...growin'
                  it, puttin' it up, haulin' it, feedin'
              it, draggin' it, and then back to growin' it again... 




"down in the valley, the valley
                  so low, hang your head over, hear the wind blow…" 
as
                    winter silently crept across the valley of the green and
                    the beautiful horse creek tributary, we take stock in what
                    was and
                    what is to be... may these magnificent, proud "ladies" stay
                forever free. 
i
                    oft times wonder, which lonesome road to travel, which hill
              to climb? perchance the road less traveled, yes…? 



 

lady
                    spring was dressed in drab, gray attire to usher in the lamb
                    of morning march 1…but, soon,
                  as if by magic, two beautiful trumpeter swans, bound for somewhere,
                  landed on a narrow slit of open river to cheer us all… and
                  lady spring began to sing immediately…blackbirds, canadian
                  honkers, sandhill cranes, and we, tired feed hands smiled slyly
                  and gave a high-five salute to all things blessed and beautiful… 
‘tis
                    a new season dawning and we must keep on keeping on… now,
                    calving time 2005 starts anew, so until we meet again, like
                    my grandpa always told me...i'll be seein' you in the funny
                    papers
                  on the front page!
