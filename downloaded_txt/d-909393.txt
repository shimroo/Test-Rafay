            why palram’s polycarbonate?
          

the tough & transparent polymer:
polycarbonate stands for a group of thermoplastic polymers containing carbonate groups in their chemical structures. it earned its “transparent steel” nickname from its unique combination of properties. polycarbonate’s very high impact resistance renders it
virtually unbreakable. it is lightweight and can have a glass-like appearance, without its associated dangers. these characteristics allow polycarbonate to be widely used in applications such as bullet resistant glazing and jet fighter canopies. they also make polycarbonate an excellent material for greenhouse glazing due to its high light transmission and weather resistance, even at a low thickness.

long term durability depends on quality & production:
polycarbonate blocks up to 100% of harmful uv radiation, making it an extremely
effective shield for people as well as for plants. this characteristic depends upon the
material’s adequate production in order to maintain its integrity for long service.
panels with too thin or no co-extruded protective layer may look perfect to the naked
eye, but will discolor, deteriorate and become brittle over a relatively short period of time.

palram has been manufacturing quality panels since 1967, and polycarbonate panels
specifically since 1986. palram’s polycarbonate panels portray the material’s advantages
to their fullest, withstanding harsh weather conditions and offering many years of
maintenance free use.

symptoms of poor uv protection:
without sufficient protection from uv radiation, polycarbonate panels will become yellow and brittle, making them unable to withstand hail or even lighter impact.
the photos below show 2 twin-wall polycarbonate panels following an accelerated weathering test – 2 year’s worth of uv exposure. the palram panel shows no sign of yellowing, whereas the other has considerable yellowing and haze.
