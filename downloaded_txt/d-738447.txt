david p.
i joined gscu when rochester opened because the building looked incredible and it's a different credit union compared to all the same in the area. i can actually get the one-on-one help i need without waiting forever and it's in-and-out every time. service is so fast and the employees are so ready and willing to help. thank you guys so much for everything you do.





tess k.
i've never been with any other bank. doing research as a 15-year-old, i saw the benefits of credit unions and landed on gscu as the best option for me.





theresa d.
i decided to join gscu when i got married and was living in manchester. i stayed with gscu, even after moving out of the city, because of the exceptional service i have received over the years. everyone i have ever worked with at gscu has been friendly, knowledgeable, and always willing to go above and beyond for their members. thank you gscu!





michelle t.
i joined gscu because they had the best rates and products for our needs. i've stayed because gscu has good customer service.

i have family members who said nothing but good things about granite state credit union and now i love it just as much as them.
