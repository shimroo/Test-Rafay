          if you want to understand why meta pivoted back to politics, it's because that's where voters are getting their news and information. in the 2024 post-election survey i did with the center for campaign innovation, more voters now get their news from social media than from their local tv news. between facebook and instagram, meta has 2 of the top 3 social media platforms that voters use on a daily basis (along with youtube). while meta and other social media companies may have tried to downplay politics the past few years, it's clear that their users are still wanting to get news about politics and government through social media.

          why strategic communications is a must for every business 

recently, many corporations have found themselves in the headlines, but not in the way they wanted. these situations underscore the essential role a seasoned communications leader plays in shaping a company’s public perception. whether in-house or outsourced, having someone oversee the communications function is crucial. a strategic communicator supports your business plan, navigates challenging situations, and amplifies your story with priority stakeholders.

whether you're an early-stage startup, a well-established private business, or a publicly traded giant, each stage in your company’s journey requires a unique communications approach. here's why prioritizing communications is a must for every business:

1.  strategic counsel and advocacy 🤝
communications leaders are trusted advisors, providing insights on public perception and aligning strategies with company values and goals. they evaluate how actions impact stakeholders, crafting messages for each audience. integrating communication strategies into your core business plan prepares you to adapt to changing dynamics.
 
2.  crisis and reputation management 🔥
every business faces potential crises, threatening reputation and stability. a seasoned communications advisor is crucial for proactive crisis planning, working with leadership to swiftly address issues. they help preserve brand integrity by delivering transparent, honest, and timely information. as recent news cycles show, maintaining trust during a crisis demands experience and situational awareness.
 
3.  brand awareness and storytelling 📣
communications professionals build credibility with the news media to tell compelling brand stories through earned coverage or a combo of paid + earned. marketing and comms teams must work in lockstep, ensuring a consistent, authentic, and cohesive brand message across all channels.
 
4.   internal and external message alignment ✳️
consistency in messaging across all organizational levels is vital. a great external  strategy starts with an internal focus. ensure employees understand business goals and their roles in supporting them. aligning internal and external messaging maintains a cohesive culture and delivers a consistent brand narrative.
 
5.  business growth 📈
strategic communication fuels business growth and transformation by crafting compelling content and narratives that highlight products, services, and initiatives. a communications advisor ensures an ongoing dialogue with priority stakeholders. their awareness of current trends and media strategies enables you to seize opportunities and tell your story.

investing in a skilled communications leader or advisor is investing in the long-term success and resilience of your business. it's not just a nice-to-have but a critical component of a successful business strategy.

          prweek's great 2024 business report highlights the key challenge facing our industry.

communications is more important than ever. comms and policy leaders are being asked to play far larger roles as business partners supporting ever more stakeholders. 

so why did the industry suffer so much in 2023 after many years of growth?

as an sector, we are not adapting fast enough to the needs. organizations are desperate for help but also under tremendous financial strain. they now need both senior level counsel and advisory support as well as deep domain expertise to actually produce. by and large, our industry is still split by this chasm - between strategic and tactical. 

clients cannot afford to separate these, either in time or money. at bully pulpit international our goal is to bridge this divide, building a team that can both 'think and do' at the highest levels.

it's not always easy. last year was a challenge. but if you share this vision for the future, please check out some of our open roles:

          why do we do pr?  well, i would answer it's because trust and confidence among all audiences is at historic lows—an avg of 28%. with low/no trust, there is no commerce, there are no deals and business grinds to a halt.  so, that is why we do pr.  https://lnkd.in/g9m-_jq4 #publicrelations, #pr, #trust, #credibility

          "but npr’s troubles extend far beyond concerns about its journalism. internal documents reviewed by the times and interviews with more than two dozen current and former public radio executives show how profoundly the nonprofit is struggling to succeed in the fast-changing media industry. it is grappling with a declining audience and falling revenue — and internal conflict about how to fix it."

this article sheds good light on the disruption facing the media industry.

          if you work in the communications/media, you need to be reading semafor. this piece by ben smith and maxwell tani captures the fundamental changes in our industry centered around how mainstream news outlets aren’t the only ones influencing public opinion. 

"the biggest shift in contemporary politics and pr may be that the cost of an error has dropped, while the value of ubiquity has risen...conversely, a fragmented media landscape means that you need to go on ten podcasts to reach the scale of audience a cable television show used to command. and so a new wave of public figures, and their advisers, will need to navigate in a looser and more forgiving media landscape."

          worth reading from niemanlab: readers prefer to click on a clear, simple headline — like this one 

by david markowitz, hillary shulman and todd rogers

in an era when people trust news less than ever, how can journalists break through and attract the attention of average people to provide information about their communities, the nation and the world?

by not complicating things.

our research, published in science advances, shows that simple headlines significantly increase article engagement and clicks compared with headlines that use complex language.

in our research, typical news readers preferred simple headlines over complex ones. but importantly, we found that those who actually write headlines — journalists themselves — did not.

we first used data from the washington post and upworthy to see how language features, such as word length and how common a word is, changed how many people clicked on an article’s headline. these datasets included over 31,000 randomized experiments — also known as a/b tests — that compared two or more headline versions of the same underlying article to determine which one generated the most clicks.

headlines with more common words — simple words like “job” instead of “occupation” — shorter headlines, and those communicated in a narrative style, with more pronouns compared with prepositions, received more clicks. for example, the washington post headline, “meghan and harry are talking to oprah. here’s why they shouldn’t say too much” outperformed the alternative headline, “are meghan and harry spilling royal tea to oprah? don’t bet on it.” this example illustrates how sometimes a more straightforward headline can generate more interest.

in follow-up laboratory experiments, we found that typical news readers focused more on simple rather than complex headlines because the writing was easier to understand. when journalists participated in the same experiments, they didn’t show any preference for simple headlines over complex ones. put differently: those who write the news appear to be less responsive to simple writing than regular audiences.

generations of communication consultants have advised that communicators follow the rather crass acronym kiss: keep it simple, stupid. we suggest a modified version applied for journalists. since kisj isn’t all that simple, we propose: keep it simple, staffers. simplicity increases the number of people who click on a news story headline and improves reader recall of the material in the article. most importantly, simplicity boosts reader engagement, such as how much attention they pay to the information.

          this article from columbia journalism review is fascinating, and an argument for the importance of a reputation management communication plan. there are volumes authored by pr pros advising against ignoring reporters inquiries, yet this article documents how frequently it happens. 

throughout my career, i can count on one hand the number of times i have made a calculated decision not to respond to a media request, and 99.9% of the time it was after multiple engagements with a reporter who repeatedly misrepresented or distorted information (even if not intentionally). 

i suspect, more often than not, reporters get ghosted because the brand is caught off guard. they haven't planned how they will respond in a reputation crisis. or haven't socialized the planned response with stakeholders. if the pr team is haggling with executives and lawyers on what to say or how to say it when the reporters' questions start rolling in, the opportunity to frame the narrative is quickly lost. 

thanks for sharing the article jennifer johnson avril!

          thank you to prnews for publishing my piece on lessons brands and communications leaders can learn from the recent fallout at nbc news and the pitfalls of binary thinking. "this debacle is one of many scenarios that remind us of why deliberate, well-coordinated and consistent internal communications are even more important in today’s climate where sensitive information leaks are becoming commonplace."

          a new survey from pr measurement platform memo is a feel-good story for chief communications officers and their teams, but there is a catch.

the survey highlights a 34% increase in communications teams reporting directly to the ceo versus last year and a 26% decrease in comms reporting to marketing.

in today’s complex, politicized, multi-stakeholder world, getting communications pitch perfect is mission critical for every organization. that’s more likely to happen when comms teams have the ceo’s ear.

but: the more separation there is between comms and marketing functions, the greater the risk of strategic dissonance between earned and paid media. blending them creates powerful synergy. 

here are 8 ways to do it, starting today:

1. align your messaging across earned and paid channels for cohesive brand storytelling.

2. amplify earned media coverage using paid to reach audiences who don’t consume through traditional channels.

3. boost press coverage with paid media to enhance credibility and trust.

4. extend the lifespan of strategically relevant earned media using engaging paid formats that keep the story alive.

5. ensure a well-rounded narrative by promoting owned content that fills gaps in your brand story not sufficiently covered by the media.

6. redirect key earned media storylines to specific audience segments (e.g., investors, future talent) by leveraging niche paid targeting.

7. transform earned media outcomes into compelling multimedia formats — animations, videos, or carousels — to enhance your storytelling.  

8. report results holistically by showing exec teams how earned and paid media can work together to create greater impact.

a well-rounded, cohesive media strategy is essential for breaking through the clutter. separate reporting lines and bifurcated budgets shouldn't stand in the way.

          spoiler alert 🚨🚨🚨

i don't think tiktok is going anywhere.

but, the debate happening among policymakers makes for pretty good conversation. 

in my latest thought piece for h/advisors abernathy, i examined the newscycle to see how a potential #tiktok ban could play a big role in the 2024 election cycle, rankle #bigtech data collection and lay the groundwork for more #dataprivacy advocacy.

          my latest in prnews: how to manage a negative article. not all coverage is going to be positive, and every organization out there will eventually find itself on the receiving end of a negative piece. 

it can be frustrating and stressful, but there are several steps you can take to improve the situation, especially if you get a heads up an article is coming and have an opportunity to engage in advance. read on for 6 tips as well as some comments on the infamous “no comment.”
