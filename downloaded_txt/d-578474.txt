at vermont academy, learning by doing inspires the independent thinker. we believe that high school isn’t just a time to learn how to launch a business, create a masterpiece, and save the planet, but to actually do it. vermont academy doesn’t just educate its students. we teach students to be the authors of their own education, for life.

we are

		we are a small new england private coed boarding school and day school in the majestic green mountains renowned for handcrafting an extraordinarily unique education for each student. we teach our students—grades nine through post-graduate (pg)—how to rely on their inner compass and head toward their true north. we encourage adventurous ideas, natural interests, free thinking, and lifelong growth. our college preparatory programs offer insight and guidance to help you advance and find a higher educational opportunity that aligns with your interests, and abilities. 
	







education for life
we are explorers.we focus on process learning, which prioritizes learning to ask theright questions from the information we gather, rather than focusingonly on getting the right answer. 




experiencing va
spend any amount of time in our community and you will quickly learn that while we may be a small school, we have an incredibly large spirit. connections are at the center of everything we do, and it’s what makes this school a place like no other. 




vermont academy at mount snow
vermont academy at mount snow offers a unique opportunity for student-athletes to cultivate their passion for on-snow sports while maintaining a consistent college preparatory academic program. 






we are moving mountains



		here, students are free to unfurl and be their true selves while they discover their best selves: puck-shooting painters, shy math whizzes turned- thespians, esl rowing captains, fashion designing equestrian chemists, dyslexic point-guard entrepreneurs, all-ap snowboarding cellists.  we create a safe space, rich in endless opportunity, where students are known, heard, and happy to learn. because we’re small, we can focus on developing the whole student into a confident, inspired, ambitious learner bound for college.  vermont academy students know they are valued for who they are as much as who we believe they can become—and who they become is limitless.

next steps 
discover what moves you
vermont academy is always in motion. our students love to explore the world around them, discover new things, and connect what they’ve learned to life beyond the classroom. our faculty uncover this energy and ambition—their dedication and passion help students strive, soar, and move mountains. vermont academy is a place where students invent themselves, discover their dreams, and realize their goals. in addition to using our 450 acre campus for outdoor activities, our proximity to mount snow ski resort in southern vermont allows us to give our student athletes a winter sports boarding school experience unlike anything available in the greater new england region with vermont academy at mount snow. if you are interested in becoming a wildcat, we welcome you to begin the application process with an initial inquiry. we'd be happy to provide you with information regarding our academic curriculum, athletic programs, campus life, and more.
