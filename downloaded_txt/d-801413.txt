about me





carl futia


i write two financial blogs. the first is carl futia.on this blog i post daily "guestimates" of the current trends and trend potential in important markets.  
my second blog, carl futia real time, is subscription based. it is a real time trading seminar in which members receive my real time analysis of the e-mini s&p futures and can watch me trade them. in this seminar i explain how i calculate support and resistance levels and how i recognize market "rejections" of support or resistance which then determine the current trend directions.
