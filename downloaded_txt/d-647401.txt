elevate your gear with formotion timepieces & instrumentsalways a great product at a fair price - since 2000

































































why there’s nothing quite like formotion gaugesfor over 25 years, formotion’s unique patented universal-fit instruments are the only vehicle time and temperature gauges fully certified by independent testing laboratories for accuracy, iso material grade tolerances, vibration endurance standards, corrosion, uv resistance and water resistance.  all our gauges and wristwatches are designed and tested to stand up to the harshest environments from weather, temperature, vibration, and g-force shock using materials and components such as 304 & 316 marine grade stainless steel cases and mounts, special uv resistant brass ip face dials and - only formotion offers this - full thermometer coil oil encapsulation (specific models only) - for years of accurate and maintenance-free service.  why set such high standards?  well, it's why more race teams, custom builders, manufactures like harley davidson, triumph, polaris, ural and other aftermarket providers are using and selling formotion branded or formotion custom manufactured timepieces and thermometers in their own products, on their teams and in their shops than any other.  original formotion gauges and formotion wrist watches are available only through our web store and are not sold or available anywhere else but right here.  be careful of cheap reproductions and copy-cats.  when style, performance, and dependability count … choose formotion. #formotiontough
