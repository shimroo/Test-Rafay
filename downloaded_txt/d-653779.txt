visitors to tuscany come for many reasons. many come in search of fine art, others to explore the extraordinary countryside. gourmets and wine buffs descend on tuscany to enjoy the simple yet wonderful cuisine and wine. walkers enjoy the mountain paths, cyclists the rolling hills, summer vacationers the sea coast and islands. students come to learn the beautiful italian language and culture.
there is a lot to see and do in tuscany, the difficulty is really where to start. certainly most should start with florence, then continue on to siena and pisa. the roll call of città di arte, cities of art, is daunting: arezzo, cortona, san gimignano and lucca are all striking. the more you come to know the region, the more extraordinary tuscany appears. enjoy your visit!
