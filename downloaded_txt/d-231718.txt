so long 


just another thank you from jake and dan to all who helped, followed, enjoyed and posed for the web cams over the years. it’s been an amazing experience for one and all.
thanks to martin for posing one last time with a sign in front of the cameras. one sign for the webcam faithful, and another for jake.
