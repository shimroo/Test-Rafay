current sermon series










during 2025, we will be studying the 2nd half of romans (8-16), paul’s most thorough theological masterpiece. we will discover how the ‘new way of the spirit' connects us to the righteousness of god revealed by faith. small group material can be found here. 





welcome 



worship



   god chooses to work with us to achieve his plans for creation. to do this, he transforms those who love him into the image of his son, jesus. and what is that image? jesus loved god and pursued him with all his heart.  in pursuit of that love, jesus loved others—a love so great that he was willing to give all he had and all he was to bring healing and peace to their lives.we are made in that image - to pursue god passionately and to give selflessly to others. in christ’s image, we are more than conquerors!“for i am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord.” romans 8:38-39online servicesour facebook live broadcasts sunday services. find our online service here. sermon podcasts are now available on multiple platforms.
