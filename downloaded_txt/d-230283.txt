american sign language asl access














go to the links for many asl resources! asl access is a volunteer-based nonprofit organization. scroll down for a poem about asl.
























deaf people originated american sign language and hold it in their hands! 
american sign language has a place in history. developed by deaf people, daring to speak for themselves in the silence of the long struggle for dignity. carried forward over centuries of conflict in educational circles. strong and free in the air of secret opposition. passed hand to hand and eye to eye across the land. a hidden vision. deaf people have brought asl into the light of truths that prove its value. quiet signs speak out. asl sliced through foggy philosophies, sculpting a dream. once hidden behind dorm doors and under desks, asl has come into its own.(poem by chris wixtrom Â© 2021)
