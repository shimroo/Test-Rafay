we accept checks and money orders.  make checks or money orders payable 
to bill's inc., isuzuperformance, or quaife usa.
orders paid by money orders process most quickly and require no time to clear.  checks 
can take up to 14 days to clear and orders paid by check can not be processed 
until the check clears.
concerning checks and money orders written from canadian and overseas banks:  
please make absolutely sure that they are made payable in us dollars.  all checks 
and money orders must be drawn from a bank with offices in the us.  we can not 
accept checks drawn from banks that do not have us offices.  checks and money orders 
must have routing numbers so that they can be processed through the us office of 
the bank.  there is a $25.00 collection fee for each check and money order that 
are drawn from banks which do not have us offices or that do not have routing 
numbers to allow for processing through us offices.

we do not accept credit cards.  
credit card companies charge retailers 5% of each purchase to pay for the 
use of that card, in addition to the fact that they do not make 
payments with each card use, but rather in large lump sums.  if isuzuperformance
were to accept credit cards, we would have to raise our prices 
significantly, and this would adversly affect your dollar's purchasing 
power.
never send cash through the mail.
make orders payable only in us funds.  for current exchange rates, 
check yahoo finance currency 
exchange and kurt's 
currency exchange
orders can not be cancelled.
it would be a good idea if you would email us to let us know that
you are sending in and order to let us know what items we should be ready 
to ship for you.  we will email you if there is any problem with filling 
your order.
in order to keep prices down, in most cases, we order the product from 
the manufacturer or distributor after we recieve your order.  this 
way, we do not have money tied up in costly inventory and the storage of 
that inventory, and we can pass those savings on to you.
