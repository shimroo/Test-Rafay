a few words about mcdaniel gauges:
 
we have the largest and finest
    selection available. the many "first of its kind" were manufactured
    with only one thought in mind: "purposeful construction".
      economical and dependable operation with cost as only a secondary consideration.
      engineered to withstand 300% full scale pressure without rupture of the bourdon
    tube and 130% full scale pressure(for all instruments larger than 2 1/2") without loss of 
	accuracy makes
    mcdaniel pressure gauges the exception in the marketplace today.  
 
after all - it costs more to replace a
    defective pressure gauge than the original purchase price - it really doesn't cost more to
    use mcdaniel gauges. it's economical!
