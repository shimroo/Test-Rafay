as part of my research into jack the ripper, the 1891 london census was extremely valuable.â  it provided vital clues as to the residents of the streets of whitechapel in 1888.
we’ve also utilised this data to map the east end of london to create a highly detailed series of maps covering jack the ripper’s killing fields. you can see the results of that mapping here: the brand-new ‘jack the ripper map of spitalfields & whitechapel 1888’
since many other people are also continually searching for information from the 1891 london census, i though i’d publish what i have transcribed so far.
i’ve now started transcribing the names and full details of the people living in london in 1891.â  i’m listing them by street, and it will eventually be fully searchable.
