sapphire beach club consists of three towers along the road and thirteen villas along the shore of cupecoy beach. in between is a beautiful garden, this lovely freshwater pool, and a lively restaurant and bar. below that is an underground parking garage. the marble lobby has a concierge/activities desk        . the lower level has a suprette, a mini-gym, a hairdresser, and a spa/massage center. most of the villas are in whole ownership and about 15% of the towers are also. the rest of the property is timeshare. many owners (and some timeshare owners) rent their units at attractive rates.

want to sell or rent your timeshare week at sapphire? for $25 per year, your unit can be listed here. you get 25 words plus phone and email information. if you are is in whole ownership, you can have a logo ad (like the caribbean view condo below) for $150 per year to sell or rent your unit. send an email with your words and contact info, attach a logo/photo if you want a logo ad, and we'll send a paypal link for payment. if you use this email for anything else, we ignore it.
  





the villas were the first units to be constructed, followed by tower number one, in the center. tower two, to the east or left when viewed from the road, was finished in 1995 and tower three was completed around the turn of the century. the villas are typically numbered 0xx, with xx indicating the unit number 1 through 14. the towers are numbered xyz, where x is the tower (1, 2, or 3), y is the floor in the european style where 0 is the ground floor and 1 is the floor above that, etc, and z is the unit number on the floor, again starting at 0 on the left and proceeding along the caribbean side of the building, ending with the units along the road, called lagoon view units, as they have a view only of the lagoon, not the caribbean. moreover, they do not have hot tubs on the deck, as all other units do. in total, there are 180 units with many floor plans, but basically all units have a kitchen with granite countertops, a sleeping area with a kingsize bed, a living room with a sleep sofa, and a dining area. the floor plans vary from building to building, but here are some samples:

timeshares for sale by owner

note: never accept any sale, rental, or exchange offer from anyone who sends you a check, even a cashier's check or money order, for an amount in excess of what you're charging, then demands you pay them the difference in a hurry. these internet scam artists use stolen or counterfeit checks and get refunds from you for their supposed
overpayments. do not assume that "collected cash" in your account means a check is actually good. many checks can take one to two weeks after funds go in your account to bounce. that's why they ask for their overpayment quickly.
