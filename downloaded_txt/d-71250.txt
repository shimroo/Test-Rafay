mike tomlin has seen his steelers develop from a defense first team what else would they have in the home of the steel curtain? to an explosive, offense oriented club. extremely popular with his players, he's taken pittsburgh to the playoffs in seven of his 10 seasons in charge and is 1 1 in super bowls.

but gase also knows his running game, led by rugged running back jay ajayi, has also been inadequate. that's a problem because it's the base of the offense yet ajayi, who had 28 carries for 122 yards in the season opening victory against the los angeles chargers has 23 carries for only 36 yards in the two games since.

another reason to cut the weeknight games was the exorbitant costs of temporary support infrastructure. the floodlights at the central broward regional park are not approved to international standard and organisers had to pay for extra temporary floodlight fixtures to be brought in solely for the first two matches. last year's twin cheap nhl jerseys weekend double headers also ended after sunset, with the first game starting at noon and the second at 4pm.

richard sherman, seattle's three time all cheap nfl jerseys pro cornerback, missed practice on wednesday and thursday and was a limited participant in friday's workout because of a hamstring problem. sherman has never failed to answer the bell in his 97 game nfl career, but he's listed as questionable on the seahawks' injury report.
