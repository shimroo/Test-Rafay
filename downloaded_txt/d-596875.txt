the 120 minutes archive 








welcome to the 120 minutes archive, the independent, critically acclaimed, definitive library of music video nostalgia.

press





since 2003, we’ve been traveling through time to rediscover and share the legacy of mtv’s 120 minutes, the classic u.s. tv series that exposed a vast collection of alternative music videos, artist interviews, and live performances to a diverse range of music enthusiasts across several generations.
this project captures and revisits the memories of 27 years of music television—this is the soundtrack of our lives.
with hundreds of volunteer contributors like you, we assembled this incredible archive from scratch, rebuilding nearly the entire history of 120 minutes. inside, you’ll find the playlists and music videos for 1,005 episodes, spanning across the various iterations of 120 minutes on both mtv and mtv2 from 1986 to 2013, as well as subterranean, its successor from 2003 to 2011.
what’s new
feb.2025
we are deeply saddened to hear that matt pinfield suffered a massive stroke in january. matt is a legend and has always been kind to us, and we hope with our whole hearts that he will make a full recovery.
our curator and assistant editor are still working through a backlog of contributions to the archive. if you sent us an email and it’s logged in this document, we’ve got it and we’ll be updating the archive with it.
