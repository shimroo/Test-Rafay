before you buy…

no crosscut saw ever made was “fully conditioned,” if you mean working at it’s optimum performance. basically, trial cuts are required in the wood you’ll be cutting and the amount of “set” needs to be adjusted accordingly. (due to the moisture content of the particular wood you’re cutting)
the raker height also needs to be adjusted according to the type of wood you’re cutting. (hardwood or softwood)
we feel that crosscut saws are a “labor of love,” and the real lesson is in the patience required to repeatedly test the saw on the wood you’re cutting, then take it back to the saw vise and use the crosscut saw tools to tune the saw ’til it’s right. we sell all the saw maintenance tools described in the crosscut saw manual. ($4)
we strongly suggest you purchase the manual and read it to understand the philosophy of the traditional use of the crosscut saw. it is indeed something requiring time, trial, and error.
tip: did you know the bark must be removed around the log where the cut will be made so the teeth won’t dull? that is what a bark spud is used for.
