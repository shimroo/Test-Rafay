 howdy,

thank you, thank you, thank you for a wonderful year of dancing.

since i cannot possibly name everyone without taking pages and pages, i will list many of the wonderful things those who love our square dance world and sport have done.

thank you everyone who attended the hsrdc quarterly meetings and helped grow square dancing.  it fills my heart to see so many get involved, have discussions and enjoy fellowship and dancing afterwards.  how wonderful to see some bigger dances again, and dancers enjoying squares and rounds together.

thank you to all the callers and cuers who have made the dances wonderful.

thank you to all the volunteers who saw a need and made things happen.  many hands make light work.

thank you to those who helped with the used square dance clothing, those who collected donated clothes, set up racks, helped enthusiastic new dancers find the perfect outfit.  starting a new wardrobe can add to the excitement of their new activity.

thank you for the graphic artist who create the flyers we find in print, social media and the where'n'when, reaching all our generations of dancers heralding the wonderful events.

thank you to the sound engineers, who have to be flexible to adjust the setup to the type of hall, for both meetings and dances.

thank you to all whom have brought snacks to events.

thank you to all the creative decorators who make the events festive.

thank you for the photographers, who share so many moments. a picture is truly worth a thousand words.

thank you to the dancers who lead us in pledge and prayer to start our dances, and to the dancers who have served our country.

thank you to the fundraisers, our dancers who help our charity events, this year's miracle farms, christmas toy drives, scholarships.

thank you to the people raise money to support those in our dance world who have fallen on hard times or illness.

thank you for the news team, the editor of the where'n'when, the social media editors, the email creators and forwarders, so dancers can know what is happening and when, as well as what was cancelled.

thank you to the new callers who are learning, the callers who are helping them grow, and the dancers who get out on the floor with patience, sometimes a lot, to let them practice. a blessing to all.

thank you to the ticket sellers and ticket buyers, both of whom help to makes ends meet at dances, and all those who volunteer to sit at the door for a dance tip or two.

thank you to the exhibition teams who share a bit of square dance with the world at various events.

thank you for all the faithful, who pray for and with our dancers in times of joy and in times of sadness.  the support of our dance family is a wonderful thing.

most of all, thank you for your friendship and love.

may i be blest to see you in a square or round dance for many years to come, 

yellow rocks, michele
