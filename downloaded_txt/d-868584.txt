								pie in the sky farm inn,
								retreat, & apartment welcomes you to visit us and to stay for
								a while in our quiet, comfortable civil war-era greek revival
								18-room farmhouse on a traditional vermont hill farm. you will
								experience a well-run small inn. guest bedrooms, living rooms,
								kitchen, sunroom and entrances separate from the owners' quarters
								-- yet we are quite accessible whenever you need us.
							









												location
											







							     pie-in-the-sky
							is located in the middle of the rich environmental and cultural
							zone of north central vermont and perched just on the edge of
							vermont's wild and beautiful 
							northeast kingdom 
							. off the road just enough to experience real quiet
							and to hear the birds sing and the frogs croak, we're actually an
							easy-find -- only a mile and a third off northern new england's
							major east-west u.s. route 2. we're 13 miles from the granite
							city of 
							barre
							, 14 miles from vermont's capital, 
							montpelier
							, and about 20 miles from 
							st. johnsbury 
							we are one of only two places to stay close to
							cabot 
							with its famous
							cheese creamery and near to the groton state forest with its
							numerous lakes and trails. 
							goddard college 
							is just over the hill 10 minutes away. 
						



							as is the marshfield school of weaving
						








												facilities
											







							     all
							our 
							rooms
							overlook the fields and gardens. come stay by the week or for
							a few weeks. use our facilities for a restful get-away or as a
							quiet retreat to work on your current project. you will have as
							your own space: full upstairs and downstairs six-room suite with
							separate entrance which includes three bedrooms, greatroom with
							woodstove, kitchen, two baths, plus a well-stocked library, &
							hot tub in greenhouse/sunroom. 
						



							upon arrival, you will find your kitchen set up with
							starter breakfast items, and with a few snacks, and tea and
							coffee-making supplies for your own use at any time.   
						








												what
												to do at pie 
											





							     enjoy
							our spa and greenhouse while gazing out on beautiful views and
							many gardens. take a short walk down our front hill to visit a
							large beaver meadow and bird sanctuary (where moose occasionally
							appear in the spring). take walks back on the land to some of the
							secret corners: the old pond, the maple sugar bush, the mushroom
							woods, the blueberry patch, the open water of the beaver meadow.
							depending on the season, help us out in the vegetable garden or
							orchard. feed the sheep and ducks. or, feel free to do absolutely
							nothing but read a book, enjoy the views and the quiet. 
						



							in winter season, you can go sledding, snow-shoeing or
							cross-country skiing on our 100-plus acres. a groomed snowmobile
							trail runs across part of our land. or forge a trail off the
							beaten track in the woods or fields completely by yourself, in
							quiet so deep you can almost hear a snowflake drop. 
						




								massage therapy 
							

							we can assist you in arranging
							ahead of your visit for a massage with one of the four highly
							qualified massage therapists in our neighborhood either here or
							at their studios. 
						




								wireless access 
							

							and if you feel you must work,
							bring your laptop: we have good wifi throughout the inn 
						








												meetings
												and retreats 
											





							     inquiries
							about booking the use of our various spaces for small to
							medium-sized meetings are welcome. pie in the sky has hosted
							academic groups, funding foundations, massage therapists working
							retreats, and numerous individual retreats for rest, solitude,
							and focused creative work. we can arrange luncheon catering for
							your events. 
						



							we also do weddings! 
						



							we have been working with 
							windcall institute 
							and 
							common council foundation 
							to provide retreats for long-time social
							change activists.
