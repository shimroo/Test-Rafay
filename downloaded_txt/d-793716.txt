"most definitely a winner! my husband is not a fearful flyer. we watched it together, enjoyed it thoroughly and he was surprised at what he learned from it. i would highly recommend this dvd to anyone who feels nervous about flying. great job captain!"

"i found the dvd to be excellent. it impressed me as to just how well it was made. the dvd is filmed in many locations with a wide variety of airline staff and even some passengers. there has been a lot of work put into it - far beyond what i expected and it's very detailed. i'd recommend it to anyone who was considering it - it's not just the course information in another format. i watched it before both of my last two flights and it really helped."
