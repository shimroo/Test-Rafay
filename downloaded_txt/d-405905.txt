mike doyle (in memoriam) 




good friends, patrick o'neill (o'neill wetsuits) and surf legend mike doyle sharing a moment at 7 seas restaurant in cabo surf hotel (july 2013).
mike doyle, a legend in the surfing world, left an indelible mark on the sport. voted "best surfer" by surfer magazine in 1965 and 1966, he was known as the "ironman" for his incredible endurance and skill across various competitions. his victories included the prestigious duke kahanamoku contest at sunset beach, hawaii in 1968 and the world surfing title in peru.
mike was an innovator, credited with inventing the first snowboard and the soft surfboard. the popular "doyle model" surfboard, created by robert august, stands as a testament to his impact on the sport. mike split his time between san diego and cabo san lucas, living the surfer's dream and pursuing his passion for painting ocean scenes and baja's vibrant life.




from a skinny kid from inglewood (california) to a world surfing champion and a 'legend', mike's journey was fueled by his relentless passion for surfing. "i dreamed surf - ate surf, and thought about it every day all day long - 'possessed yes', and that's what makes a champion," he once said.
he encouraged everyone to stay committed, work hard, and work smart, emphasizing that surfing is a lifestyle to be lived fully. his book, "morning glass ," delves into what it takes to live like a champion, beyond winning trophies.




mike’s philosophy was to build a lifestyle compatible with one's loves and ambitions, ensuring a lasting legacy. "the best surfer in the water is the one having the most fun," he would say, reminding us all to embrace the joy in our pursuits.
now residing in spirit at the tip of baja, mike's passion for surfing and painting lives on, inspiring us to work hard, love what we do, and ride the waves of life with gusto. "life is like a wave, so why not take a big one and get a long ride all the way to the beach!" he would say, leaving us with a timeless message of perseverance, passion, and the power of living life to the fullest.

miguel surfing with mike parsons




mike parsons is a pro surfer sponsored by billabong. famous for riding the cortez bank huge waves and winning a prize for it. here we see him at jaws in maui, hawaii.


miguel with pat o'connell
pat o'connell is generally considered the happiest surfer alive. take away the foam checks, the contest jerseys and the fame, and this endless summer ii star would still spend the majority of his waking hours in the water. one of the most gregarious and well-liked pro surfers ever, it's hard to imagine he spent the first 12 years of his life without seeing the ocean.




kelly slater hanging with the boys at cabo surf hotel
kelly slater by winning the 2010 world championship became the 10 - t e n!!! times world champion in surfing. here with miguel and enrique.
