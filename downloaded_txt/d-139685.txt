staging conversations

respect is a not-for-profit organization formed of professional actor-educators, led by a child psychologist, advised by community organizations, and we function as a data-driven organization. we visit schools and communities – in person or virtually – to present educational plays and stage conversations to prevent violence, bullying, and child abuse. our programs and theatrical content are flexible and changing – and flow directly from the input we receive from students, parents, educators, and community partners. we strive to be meaningful to students and supportive to those who invite us to present for their students at all times.

what our participants are saying…




“i was very impressed with the level of engagement each of our classrooms had, even though the plays and talking session were presented virtually.  our students learned helpful strategies to deal with their big emotions and difficulties with peers.  several teachers shared with me their appreciation of how “current” the plays were.”
