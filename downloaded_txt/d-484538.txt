	 little jerry dog and his bal
	 
    



this appears to me a homemade robot that slingshots a tennis ball when jerry the dog places it in the barrel.  hat is fantastic. imagine nobody home and instead of the dog chewing up the sofa's or shoes he's entertaining himself with that thing. hell we have automatic baseball throwers and tennis ball pitchers, why can't he have that thing.

	 amazing tree houses
	 
    

monday, january 14, 2008


tree houses, treehouses, or tree forts, are buildings constructed among the branches or next to the trunk of one or more mature trees, and are raised above the ground. tree houses can be built for recreation or permanent habitation. generally, the term "tree fort" is used only for recreational structures and not permanent homes. a lot of kids dream to have a tree house where they can play, but this dream is not always possible especially for those who live in big cities. anyway for those who want a collection of amazing tree houses like the one in the picture bellow you can see a great tree houses on freshome.

	 how 315 billion dollars look like
	 
    

tuesday, january 01, 2008


this amounts of money are an impossible for anyone to visualize. let's have a look, starting with the one dollar ... it's roughly 6 inches long, and 2Â½ inches wide. it's roughly as thick as a regular piece of paper. now we will continue to make imagine larger and larger pictures, with more and more money, and at the end i'm sure that you will be amazed by these "mountains" of money, millions, billions. so if you are going to earn so much money you'll need some big deposits if you would like to keep them.

	 solitude in the world of animals
	 
    

tuesday, october 23, 2007


this is what i call a great picture, just in the right place at the right time, and the best part ... with a camera. you can't get a picture like this everyday. if that moose would be everyday in that spot practicing his sexual technique i'm sure that tourists would be very happy. finally i hope the buffalo statue will resist, because the moose is pretty big, and very horny.

	 this parrot has some moves
	 
    

thursday, october 18, 2007


take a look at this talented parrot. he really knows how to dance, on back street boys  song "everybody." the 11-year-old medium sulfur-crested cockatoo lifts his legs, squawks and bobs his head, flashing his bright yellow crest to the beat of the boy band's "everybody (backstreet's back)." he even takes a bow with a vigorous bob of his head at the end of the 1997 pop tune. enjoy !
