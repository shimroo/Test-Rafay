classroom cantatascantata singers has valued underrepresented music since its inception—be it performing works by lesser-known composers, commissioning new music, or bringing vitally-needed music education to boston’s school children through the classroom cantatas program. classroom cantatas is unique in its commitment to creation over imitation. instead of teaching children to reproduce the music and styles of another time and tradition, classroom cantatas gives students the tools to create and express themselves using their own musical voices.
