active@ undelete testimonials





 active@ undelete
                    enterprise/corporate is able to access drives both windows and linux can't see without some major
                    tinkering. it was able to recover files from a very messed up partition. 






 it recovered all the files i
                    wanted from a damaged sd card, and was the cheapest i could find that worked so well. really
                    impressed with it!
                    






 great software! just saved
                    me an evening of exchange server rebuilding. for the record, it works on iscsi san volumes in a
                    hyper-v cluster, too! very cool.
