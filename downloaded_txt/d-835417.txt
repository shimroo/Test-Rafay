deena larsennew media and hypertext fiction author




who am i?

i have been an electronic literature writer (aka a hypertext addict) for well over three decades now. now
            that
            i have retired from a 30+ year stink (i mean stint, silly slips) of government writing about decisionmaking under deep uncertainty, climate change,
            water
            management in the western u.s., and other simple topics, i am dedicating my free time to getting others
            hooked
            on elit as well. 



what the hell is elit?

what the hell am i talking about? what is complex and deeply intertwingled writing, anyway? well, like any
            drug, this has a long and complicated history, bearing many names: new media writing, digital storytelling,
            electronic literature. and a lot of controversy about what this substance actually is. in short, this stuff
            is
            any literature that uses another element as an integral part of the story. these elements (like games,
            video,
            vr, xr, ar, images, sound, navigation, structure, links, social media, etc.) can't be printed out. so if you
            can
            print it (like that ebook), it ain't my drug of choice.



what have i done?

my first experimentation into the deeply intertwingled complexities of this intoxicating brew was marble springs (now in 3.0), where i had strung out poem
            cards
            on
            a railway bed, connecting stories of women who might have (but probably hadn't) lived in a colorado marble
            quarry town from the early 1800s on to about 1950. this obsessive work was in the late 1980s, and my logic
            professor introduced me to hypercard, which is the absolute best program bar none ever written. i still
            think
            this. i got my masters at the university of colorado based on this wor and interviewed the gang centered
            around
            eastgate systems. but marble springs got badly out of control (it still is, you can go write in it right
            this
            very moment if you want to). and so i started in on a long series of structured works, starting with samplers at eastgate and continuing to this day
            with
            entanglements (with bill bly 2023) and on and on and on. i now have over 50 works that you can have fun with.
          



why come join in?

why should you join in and take a stride on the tangled, wild side of writing? mostly because its fun.
            other
            than that, there are things you can say in complex ways you can not reduce down to ink and dead trees. there
            are
            experiences to be had here. and the world needs this kind of writing to convey the increasingly complexity
            and
            multiplicity and duplicity of today's world. so, as i say in the first line of my online mystery novel, disappearing rain, come on in, the water's fine. 
so, join the fun (we have monthly meetings and then there are conferences and
            projects
            galore), explore my works, and give me a
              holler if you want to collaborate.
