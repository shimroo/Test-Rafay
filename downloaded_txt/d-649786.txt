     greetings cfa members, officers, friends, and colleagues —the board of trustees was made aware of the goings on within our assembly over the past few weeks, but the time has now come to bring everyone up to date on what exactly is happening within the circus fans association of america.on december 4th, jack dean abruptly and with little explanation handed in his resignation as president of our organization, five months prior to fulfilling his two-year term. waiting in the wings as president elect, it was my responsibility to move up one rung on the ladder and immediately take over as cfa’s next president. i do so at this time with great honor. jack’s untimely notification arrived on the very same morning that the fourth-quarter issue of our beloved white tops was to be printed. fortunately, our editorial staff was able to hold the presses and, in a mad scramble, make several necessary changes to its content as quickly as possible before resuming production. unfortunately, it was this unexpected monkey wrench tossed into the works that has caused the delay in your hard copy magazine showing up in mailboxes before christmas, for which we apologize.in an attempt to share the joy of the season in as timely a manner as can be, we are pleased to attach a digital copy of this exciting forthcoming issue to our readers here and now.
merry christmas one and all!timothy noel tegge, presidentcircus fans association of america
