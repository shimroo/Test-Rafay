spotted lanternfly in davidson county
the tennessee department of agriculture confirmed the presence of spotted lanternfly in davidson county in september 2023, issuing an advisory for tennesseans to be on the lookout for this non-native insect, which is harmful to a range of crops and natural resources in our state. wood products businesses and fruit growers may be especially vulnerable.
slf are invasive insects that can spread long distances when people and vehicles move infested material or items containing egg masses. adults emerge in late summer and early fall and are about one inch long and one-half inch wide with visually striking wings. its favored host is tree of heaven, and it shows preference for grape vines and fruit trees. it may also appear in other trees such as black walnut, maple, and yellow-poplar. infested trees may exhibit wilting, defoliation, dieback, yield loss, and in severe cases, death. slf adults and nymphs typically gather in large numbers on host plants feeding on nutrients and water. slf lay eggs on trunks of host plants and other flat surfaces.
anyone seeing spotted lanternflies or an egg mass should take photos to complete the form on protect tennessee forests website, click report a pest. next, stomp the insect and destroy egg masses by smashing or dousing with rubbing alcohol. check vehicles, boats, or campers to make sure they aren’t carrying any insects or eggs.
tennessee wildlife managers removing bradford pear trees
“all trees are not equal” is the tennessee wildlife resources agency’s message about bradford pear trees in tennessee. wildlife managers have been removing the trees, which are invasive, from the state. “these fast growing trees are non-native to tennessee and considered invasive. when they are overgrown, they slow the growth of other plant species that are more beneficial for wildlife species,” twra said. removing them creates a healthier landscape for the state’s plant and animal life, according to the twra.  see the video clip on wvlt-tv’s website.

yale article documents correlation of insect decline and non-native plants
the displacement of native plants by non-native species affects ecological relationships with insects and by extension birds, resulting in a negative impact on populations.  an article in yale environment 360, published at the yale school of the environment, presents recent research on these food web effects.
homeowners invasive plant primer
this new step-by-step guide from tn-ipc carefully walks homeowners through the process of identifying invasive plants in the residential landscape and helps them select the best solution for effective and lasting control.  paired with our landscaping brochures, “invasive plant primer for the home landscape: identify, control, replant” outlines the best way to move from a lifeless yard choked with invasive plants to an ecologically functional landscape of diverse native plants supporting area wildlife. printed copies of the guide are available thanks to the tennessee division of forestry and a grant from the u.s. forest service.  local television show, tennessee’s wild side, recently featured tn-ipc’s homeowners primer.  view the segment here.
