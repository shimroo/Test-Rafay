we started working with debbie to schedule our first trip to mexico - and due to her knowledge, experience, and ability to connect our wants with how to best meet them, she has scheduled our trips to mexico, alaska, the caribbean, australia, and fiji - and we have had far more fun and enjoyment than we expected, or would have been able to do as amateurs.  we have not had a single problem, issue, or disappointment, and owe that to the professionalism debbie has brought to our vacation requests.  we couldn't be happier, and would not hesitate to recommend debbie to anyone who is looking for their "vacation(s) of their lifetimes".
