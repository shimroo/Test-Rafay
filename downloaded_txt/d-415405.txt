dr. nicholas eddi have always had a keen interest in working with people. clinical psychology, of course, is ideally suited for this. in my desire to assist others, i stress developing a sense of responsibility for one’s self, so that the helping relationship does not foster an unhealthy dependence. i began as a general practitioner, and then gradually developed special interests in the areas of individual and family therapy (including couples), substance abuse, sexual addiction and anger management. some of my work involves probation and the courts, but a lot of my practice is non-court related. i began from a psychodynamic perspective and consider the therapeutic rapport to be essential. through the years i have incorporated cognitive/behavioral techniques appropriate to various conditions and situations.the edd clinic offers a broad range of psychological and forensic services. often, symptoms surface in the form of anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance or irrational fears.  these cannot only make life miserable and confusing for the person experiencing them but also for their family members and loved ones.
