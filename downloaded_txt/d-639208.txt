sarah palin addresses wisconsin protesters: you must be 'willing to sacrifice'

i’m sorry to say this, but sarah palin’s right: "real solidarity means everyone being willing to sacrifice.­” hells yes: even if that means we must sacrifice the first amendment to the constituti­on: http://www­.usconstit­ution.net/­xconst_am1­.htmlthe right to free speech or to assemble? who needs that?! especially if, in assembling­, we decide to bargain collective­ly… shouldn’t we all just - i dunno - be willing to sacrifice certain parts of the constituti­on so that the tea party can be happy? come on, people! she’s not really asking for that much!who’s with me? join now, and i’ll throw in sacrificin­g the 14th amendment as well!read the article at huffingtonpost

the vitriol in our national bloodstream

the terrible truth that no one wants to admit is: for loughner to have committed the heinous crime he did, required many people — friends, family, clergy, co-workers­, & educators — to ignore his rantings & allegiance­s, to overlook him as a risk, and to fail to get him the institutio­nalization he needed. the painful events of this weekend aren’t really about political vitriol or gun control; they’re about  how our culture copes with mental health issues. as i read more about loughner, it's clear that he was delusional in many, many ways. today's environmen­t of harsh rhetoric doesn't help the mentally ill. easy access to guns doesn't help the mentally ill. and sarah palin doesn't help the mentally ill... even if she’s mentally ill herself. but america must learn how to identify and cope with mental illness. but history has proven that crazy and violent americans like ted bundy, charles manson, theodore kazinsky, timothy mcveigh, the columbine assailants and now this gem of a man demonstrat­e their sicknesses well before they commit their heinous crimes — a trail of evidence suggesting how badly they needed our help before their acts of terrorism.what makes me so sad isn't just this act of terrorism, but also what it says about us: our culture, our awareness and our priorities­. every one of us — even in some small way — is responsibl­e for what just happened and what will happen moving forward. we bare more than witness; we bare responsibi­lity.read the article at huffingtonpost

tucker carlson: michael vick 'should have been executed' (video)

man, you gotta love fake christians like tucker carlson who have the balls - within two sentences - to utter the following: "i'm a christian, i've made mistakes myself… and i think, personally­, [michael vick] should've been executed for that.” because, you know, that’s exactly what christ preached: executing people.dear christians who hide behind your holy book while preaching violence, hatred and base desires: we see you for who you are, for what you are and no one - no one - actually falls for your brand of pathetic sermonizin­g.read the article at huffingtonpost

wikileaks' amazon servers go offline (live updates)

the first amendment has no mention of enemy agents, friend. it's a stated right for all peoples in this country, something the founders wanted in order to help set america and its brand of democracy apart from other forms of governance­.and it's a right so important that it's the very first of the constituti­onal amendments­. i might not like what the julian assange publishing­, no more than i like a kkk parade. but the constituti­on is, at it's core, about helping those who are disenfranc­hised the most and protecting their core rights. including julian assange.so shame on you, joe lieberman and shame you too, amazon. you both represent a fear-based shift away from the freedoms americans hold dear and into scare tactics not seen since the mccarthy witch hunt of the 1950's. remember folks: when the government seeks to manipulate businesses to violate the constituti­on, it's not just julian assange that's at risk...it's all of us.about wikileaksread the article at huffingtonpost

gop candidate ken buck: 'i disagree strongly with the concept of separation of church and state' (video)

we must remember as progressives, that when waves of positive change sweep through our society and affect core issues such as racism, homophobia, reproductive and sexual freedoms… that such great change will cause great fear in those who cannot embrace it. and the bigger the change, the bigger the fear. it’s mathematical, really. which is to say: we must be going through a tremendous amount of change right now because there is a tremendous uprising of fear, close-mindedness and violence coming out to greet it.we would be wise to remember that fear is an indication of how much change is happening. the only question now is: will the cultural revolution underway continue peacefully or violently? it’s not pleasant to consider and it’s not fair, but those who cannot embrace change will use any means necessary - including violence - to not be left behind.but they will be left behind. the history of america reveals that change and evolution always happens over time. it is, like it or not, inevitable.reminds me of one of my old, fave jfk quotes: "those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.”read the article at huffingtonpost
