steve condarcure's new england genealogy

these web pages contain525,722 individuals169,915 families6,827 surnames
 the purpose of these pages is to help beginners gather raw data for their
genealogy project. i do not have any sources on most of the names here. i would
guess that 98% of the information here is accurate, but there is some that i have
put here with the idea that questionable data is better than nothing. i would
urge that everything you get from here be verified elsewhere.

 if you would like me to send you a copy of this site on a cd, see below for instructions.

i can send a cd with a copy of this site that can be browsed without an internet connection (obviously).

since these pages are so large, using the cd will be much faster. 
also included on the cd is:
a genealogical dictionary of the first settlers of new england 
 by james savage - volumes 1 through 4
