pro bono publico - for the public goodthe pro bono project’s mission is to provide free, quality civil legal services to the under-served members of our community.  by engaging volunteer attorneys, paralegals, law students, and private citizens to render pro bono services, the pro bono project serves clients who otherwise might not have access to the civil legal help they need.  our work today is as important as any time in our thirty-four year history.the pro bono project is appalled by the killings of ahmaud arbery, breonna taylor, george floyd, and rayshard brooks.  these terrible losses along with other victims of prejudice, brutality, and hate are unacceptable in this country.  we grieve these losses, the violence against peaceful protesters, and the inequities experienced day after day.  the pro bono project reaffirms its commitment to provide civil legal justice through volunteer assistance.  through our work, we can effect change and bring about social justice and equitable legal representation.  we demand that we do better and strongly encourage the legal community to join us in ensuring equal justice.
