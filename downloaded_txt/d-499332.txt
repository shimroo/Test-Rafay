the roots




jaffa printing had itâs humble beginnings in the garage of a home on the avenues. charlie jaffa started off printing business cards and flyers.  during world war ii, charlie closed his doors to serve in the merchant marine.  after the war ended, he returned to his business, married and
supported his wife and three sons by printing commercial and social stationery.  eighty-nine years after he first opened the doors of his business you can still hear the sound of the printing presses and smell the thick aroma of ink as you walk through the door.  the process has changed with technology but charlieâs legacy lives on as we provide quality printing at affordable prices.
