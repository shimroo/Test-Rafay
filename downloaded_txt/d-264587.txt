mary "first lady of the flute" 
two-time grammy winner and emmy nominee mary youngblood, is the first native american woman to have received a grammy award for "best native american music album" and the first native american person to have won two grammy's which makes mary one of the premiere native american musicians in the country. winner of numerous awards, mary garnered the 2002 grammy for beneath the raven moon and the 2006 grammy for dance with the wind. when mary performs, it takes only a moment to acknowledge the profound spirituality of the sacred native american flute and its historical courtship and wooing attributes. her haunting music is much more than a song... it's liquid poetry, a prayer. mary takes little credit for the intense emotions people feel when they listen to her music.

 mary's fifth album “dance with the wind” won the 2007 grammy award for st native american music album”.  in an interview after accepting her award, mary told the media that "'dance with the wind' was created during the 2006 winter storms in northern california.  the storms brought extremely high winds; a tall oak lost a few good sized limbs and the maples took a thrashing.  having an incredible affinity to trees, mary looked at them in her backyard, and thought it would be hard to be a tree right then.  but as she watched them, she noticed how the trees were almost moving with purposeful rhythm, and with something that resembled... joy.  mary related her own personal stormy times to the dancing trees and realized she could be like they were.  she was not going to give in to the elements either; she was going to learn to be more like the trees ... and "dance with the wind".

   now years later with five unique and accomplished albums under her belt, mary owns over 250 hand carved native american style flutes in her collection and uses a wide variety of them throughout every one of her albums. each of her flutes is masterfully crafted from different types of wood, bringing a unique sound and texture to each song. 
when mary performs, it takes only a moment to acknowledge the profound spirituality of the sacred native american flute and its historical courtship and wooing attributes. her haunting music is much more than a song ... it's liquid poetry, a prayer.

mary youngblood takes little credit for the intense emotions people feel when they listen to her music. "i am only a vessel between creator and this instrument. as a sculptor would tell you, the clay has a spirit of its own and decides what it will become; so it is with the flute. these songs came from those who walked before me."

mary and her family currently reside in northern california.
