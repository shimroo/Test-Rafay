service line inspection notificationsservice line inspections and notifications are being performed between the hours of 8 am and 7 pm.in august, 2022 the environmental protection agency (epa) released revised guidance to water systems to help them develop inventories of service line installations in order for systems and customers to comply with the epa's 2021 lead and copper rule.the water authority of wester nassau county maintains over 28,000 customer accounts and each customer maintains their own service line connecting its home plumbing to the public water system.each connection also has a service line and components maintained by the water system connecting to the water main.every single one of these lines must be added to a lead service line inventory required to be compiled by water systems across the country.this year the water authority began performing service line inspections to both complete this inventory and to help provide customers with information on service lines that need to be replaced due to the presence of lead.every customer service line will be inspected and inventoried during this process. you may receive a door hanger with information on an upcoming inspection and you may receive a call from our customer service representatives to schedule an appointment if our field representatives have been unable to inspect your service.for more information on the sources and presence of lead in drinking water, please visit the epa's page basic information about lead in drinking water. 







proposed new environmental protection agency standards regarding pfa'swe applaud the environmental protection agency's commitment to protect public health with this strong proposal.  as key stakeholders in this process, we will study the proposal closely and plan to provide direct feedback as requested by the epa.  once the standard is finalized, we are committed to meeting it.  and, we will continue our efforts in court to hold the polluters responsible for the presence of these pfa's in our groundwater and for the high costs of removing them.
