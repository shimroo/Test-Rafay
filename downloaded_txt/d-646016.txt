find out why softball players, parents, and coaches are calling morgan stuart's defense club




"the ultimate resource for softball players of every age..."































































































































































not just defense club but everything that you provide from zoom to instagram videos have helped me spread the knowledge you share. see i coach rec, travel and this year will be doing high school...also i am a 48 going on 49 year old and the way my generation was taught compared to now is night and day...and to not make it to long my 2 daughters and many others here in pittsburgh are learning under morgan....thanks for making me a better coach...thomas













joined the club last night and all i can say is why haven’t i done this earlier. it’s great i’m a high school coach and it helps take some of the guess work out. we are starting indoor winter workouts and there’s a ton of drills and good stuff that will make my life easier. i was up late just looking at all the different things. but these resources are amazing randy













as parents and former athletes, we’ve emphasized the importance of purposeful practice to our children - no matter the activity. defense club provides a framework for improving her skills that is far superior to taking endless ground balls without working on mechanics. the additional access to mental preparedness and guest instructors has been invaluable to her continued growth and improvement. if your athlete has the commitment, discipline and drive to succeed this is the tool for her.”tim














as someone who lives too far away for in-person lessons, i love defense club because it provides me with the resources i need to take my playing to the next level. defense club emphasizes purposeful practice and quality reps, instead of hours of practice without a goal. i also appreciate the access to mental preparation, especially for coming back after failure. my in-game mental and physical adjustments have improved significantly.”gracie













as a relatively new softball coach, defence club has been the best investment i’ve made to improve not only my team, but also myself. having played baseball into my teenage years, as a dad i’ve nw had to dust off my glove, relearn the basics and adapt them to coaching softball for my daughters teams for the last four years. with the girls becoming more advanced in their skills, i realized i needed more guidance to become the best coach i can be for them. defence club has provided that mentorship in spades, helping give structure to our off season practices with solid foundational drills that are explained in depth with key teaching points for coaches. getting to take part in zoom sessions with morgan, and have questions answered directly, has been a huge bonus i didn’t expect when i signed up. despite only scratching the surface of the content that is available, i can wholeheartedly recommend defence club as a worthwhile investment for players and coaches looking to improve themselves in this sport.greg














i’m loving defense club so far! the lessons are great and very helpful!thank you, zara













keeyani is in love with defense club only because when she has those days that she does not want to work (especially alone) she can find more simple drills to work on her own. now lets talk about morganai. keeyani has mentioned that the ai part of the club has got to be the best part. as her father i can only answer so many defense related questions. then she can turn to the pro. for example questions about arm care, what the purpose of circle foot work is, why wall ball on your own benefits the athlete, etc.. lastly, she can not stress over how much confidence she has gained with the club alongside in-person lessons. keeyani is not afraid to make mistakes anymore especially on the field. her resilience shows after mishaps. and it truly makes me smile seeing her bounce back. p.s. she dreams to play for team philippines or mexico in the future. lew
