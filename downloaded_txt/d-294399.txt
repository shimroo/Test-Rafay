the keeper's log
a thread that binds the society

a subscription to the keeper's log journal, a 48-page, glossy quarterly is included with our keeper level, beacon level, prism level & illumination level of memberships. each issue is historical in nature, usually featuring a famous american lighthouse as the cover story, followed by a human-interest article and, often, a foreign lighthouse story.

uslhs passport program
track your lighthouse visits

the lighthouse passport program provides enthusiasts the opportunity to help preserve lighthouses as well as a wonderful way to keep a pictorial history of their lighthouse adventures. small donations made by passport holders generate thousands of dollars for lighthouse restoration and preservation projects.
