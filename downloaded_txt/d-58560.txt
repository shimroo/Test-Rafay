what are thermal management materials?





thermal management materials are a range of different product types designed to effectively dissipate heat in electronic applications. they are composite systems that enable efficient heat transfer within components.
these solutions perform various functions within components. this includes carrying heat away from the components that generate it (also known as dissipating heat), offering stress relief from thermal cycling, providing electrical insulation, filling air gaps (voids), and offering long-term stability within components.









































why use henkel thermal management solutions?





henkel’s loctite® bergquist® brand thermal solutions dissipate heat within multiple applications, enabling optimal performance and extending device lifetime across a range of industries and types of product.
multi-award-winning formulations in various mediums allow henkel to provide thermal management materials that offer essential heat dissipation for applications within numerous markets. these include automotive, consumer, telecom/datacom, power and industrial automation, computing, and communication, among others.


































































as electronic systems integrate more capability into increasingly challenging, complex designs and compact footprints, efficient heat control is necessary. doing so effectively allows you to maximize performance and limit heat-related failures within devices.
henkel’s loctite® bergquist® thermal management materials, including gap pad® materials, sil pad® materials, phase change materials, microtims, liqui-form® products, and thermal adhesives, tackle today’s toughest thermal management challenges. manage heat more effectively every step of the way with a thermal management material suitable for any and every application.

thermal management for thicker gap interfaces and complex architectures





for thicker gap interfaces and complex architectures, soft materials fill uneven surfaces, conform to challenging shapes, and reduce stress ensuring the heat moves, component function is optimized, reliability is raised, and system life is maximized.

thermal management for thin bond lines





when the distance between the component and heat sink is minimal, thin bond line and low thermal resistance materials are required to fill voids and efficiently dissipate component heat.

choosing a thermal management material





thermal management materials from henkel are designed to fit a wide range of applications. but depending on what you’re manufacturing, the type of interface material you need will differ. selecting the right thermal management solution is key to:
optimizing heat dissipationextending the life of componentsupholding performance of deviceseliminating the risk of failure and performance drops


































































selecting the right thermal management material for your application depends on several factors, including: 
heat dissipation requirementsadhesive qualities needed in assemblywhether a solid or liquid is more applicablethe size of the gap that needs to be filledgap topography and surfacecomponent stress level requirementsphysics, including application temperature and structure








































knowing the requirements in your application for each of the above can help you decide whether you need a resin, liquid, or solid-state thermal management solution and whether pads, liquids, adhesives, tapes, or films are the right thermal product for use in your assembly. check out our e-catalog to select the right thermal material for your needs.

thicker gap and simplified application - thermal gap pad® solutions





devices with thicker gaps between heat sinks and electronic components, uneven surface topography, and rough surface textures need an interface material with greater conformability, higher thermal performance, and simplified application.
gap pad® materials reduce thermal resistance and achieve specific thermal and conformability characteristics in components with uneven and rough surfaces. manual or automated application, there is no dispensing equipment required and material is easily reworkable. help reduce vibration stress for shock dampening in a range of applications.

benefits of thermal gap pad® solutions include:
soft and conformablelow stress on components during assembly while providing shock-dampening abilitieseasier material handling and simplified applicationpuncture, shear, and tear resistance for added device resiliencecustomizable to the specific dimensions of the application














































complex designs and high throughput - thermal liquid solutions





devices with more complex electronic designs, highly intricate topographies, and multi-level surfaces need an interface material to enhance thermal performance and enable easier dispensing application for high-volume manufacturing operations.
thermal liquid gap filler materials can be used on many platforms, providing better wet-out for optimized thermal resistance, generally lower than more solid pad-based mediums. application volume and pattern are completely adaptable to suit a wide range of applications.
benefits of thermal liquid solutions include:
minimal stress during assemblyexcellent conformability to intricate geometriessingle solution for multiple applicationsefficient material usagecustomizable flow characteristics fast and flexible processing for high volume manufacturing and high throughput automated application process eliminates operator-induced errors and defects














































thinner bondline - thermal sil pad® solutions





devices with thinner gaps between heat sinks and electronic components need a solution that can minimize thermal resistance from the external package of a power semiconductor to the heat sink, electrically isolate the semiconductor from the heat sink, and provide sufficient dielectric strength to withstand high voltage.
sil pad® materials are solutions for a cleaner and more efficient thermal interface and save time and money while maximizing an assembly’s performance and reliability.
compared to mica, ceramic, and grease, sil pad® materials:
eliminates the mess of greaseare more durable than micacost less than ceramicapply easier and cleanerperform better for today’s high-heat compacted assembliesautomate assembly process fully














































alternative to mechanical fasteners - thermal adhesives





high-power electronic components generate heat, and some designs incorporate discrete packages, making traditional mechanical attachment processes inefficient.
conventional adhesives as a mechanical replacement cannot deliver the thermal performance necessary. to most efficiently transfer heat out of the assembly, thermal adhesives should be used.
creating a strong bond between components and heat sinks to reduce the need for screws and clips, henkel thermally conductive adhesives in pad, liquid, and laminate mediums also allow reliable, long-lasting connection and effective heat dissipation in devices.


























































ultra-thin bondline - phase change material solutions





high power density components require a reliable, efficient mechanism to remove operational heat and stabilize thermal performance over the lifetime.
due to inherent material migration (also known as "pump out"), a conventional grease thermal interface does not deliver the reliability and performance required.
phase change materials flow and displace under high pressure and temperatures, reducing bondline thickness. under elevated temperatures, the material does not turn to a liquid. it softens and flows under pressure without a risk of pump out – unlike thermal grease. it also does not dry over time.
phase change material products replace grease as the interface between power devices and heat sinks to provide effective thermal performance in components. these products can be integrated into a fully automated process, giving customers fast and flexible processing for mass production and high throughput.
