welcome to the world of sulerin
a very warm welcome to what is perhaps the oldest fantasy roleplaying website in the world. since 1994 the world of sulerin has continued to expand and become one 
    of the largest resources of dungeons & dragons roleplaying material available on the web. we hope that you, like many millions of other visitors, find this site to 
    be an invaluable resource.
now in its third version, sulerin is striving to become not merely a text warehouse of d&d fantasy material, but a community for d&d role-players who use the 
    world of sulerin as their own campaign setting and for fantasy enthusiasts alike. visit our forums or join our irregular 
    newsletter to take part in our growing community. if you are curious for what's new, check out the updates page.

please, take a look about and leave us a note in the development forum with your thoughts, wishes, and 
    opinions about our home. i hope you enjoy what you find here and i look forward to hearing from you.
