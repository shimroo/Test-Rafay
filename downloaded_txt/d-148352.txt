		opening liturgy | this week we officially welcomed our new year 7 students to st leo's at the 2025 opening liturgy. in st leo's tradition, they each rang the bell of discipleship as they were clapped in by the whole college and their proud families, which they will experience again as they graduate in 2030. they were also presented with their personal bibles.mr gleeson and new youth ministry co-ordinator, ms jaimi-lea andrews both encouraged all present to 'embrace opportunity with faith' in line with our college theme for this year. all our new staff and year 11 vinnies conference team were also presented to the college as part of the memorable ceremony.
