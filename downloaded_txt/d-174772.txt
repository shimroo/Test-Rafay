help! i want to understand solar energy and power. how solar panels work and why they're a great source of energy








 







 


 
 

improving the world through passive solar homes, plans, and solar 
    energy


 
 




are you tired...
    of paying your power company too much money every month?

are you aware...
that the future of energy generation is not coal and fossil fuels, 
    but more renewable sources of energy?

are you looking...
    for a place where you and your family can create a more promising tomorrow 
    by using natural, renewable, sources of energy today?


solar panels, solar power, fuel cells, hydrogen, and wind generation are 
    our future!

    want to know answers to questions like:




    how do solar panels 
    work?




    does my state offer tax benefits for 
    people with solar equipment in or on their homes?


how can i 

    make my own solar panels?


can 

    my existing home be modified to include solar energy?


are there any 

    projects (like models or kits) that i 
    can do with my children to help them learn about renewable energy?

    solar energy and solar power concepts have been around for thousands of 
    years...perhaps originating as early as ancient china!

    today, nearly 6,000 years later, more population is creating more demand for 
    electrical power and oil consumption, and with energy costs rising, solar power makes a lot of 
    sense.  with everything from solar panels to solar-powered 
    transportation, modern technology makes the use of our sun's energy a 
    greater reality than it has ever been before.
