25 things  


my 25 things. some fo you know most if not all 25.1. i have never eaten from a thattukada, have always wanted to.2. i'm an atheist, have been since early teens. i don't publicly talk about this, and i never broach the topic with a believer.3. i like sneezing.4. my parents were liberal compared to the parents of my friends at school/college. but once in a while it used to occur to them to be more like other parents they know and enforce random stupid rules that drove me crazy. i have rebelled constantly against everything until i left home at the age of 21. i have learned some patience since then and try to understand or turn a deaf ear since, i'm somewhat successful in it.5. i have very vivid memories of certain things from my early childhood-  being fed on the hill palace terrace when i was about 2, learning how to tie shoelaces at the age of 3, going to see my new born baby brother (age 4), the peacocks in pushpagiri hospital, being shown big bright yellow kolambi flowers, eating chiclets. i know these memories may actually be memories of memories, from remembering them since. i still find them cool.6. i'm very bad at grammar, spelling and structure and form.. well writing. i can never find the right proposition or punctuation. though this does not make me take an effort in spell checking or proof reading, it does make me hesitate before writing.7. i once spent about 21 hours with roger federer.8. when i read broca's brain when i was 17, i felt validated.9. as a child i assumed i'll be famous. i did not think about what i will be or how, it just came naturally to me that i'm going to be famous. i even used to remind myself not to do things that i don't want my parents to know when they read my biography.10. i dream every night. well everyone does, but i remember them in the morning. i kind of know the insecurities and unexpressed thoughts, feelings and judgments that trigger my dreams and though sometimes it's really weird and depressing to face the facts dreams throw at me, i think it keeps me honest. to myself.11. i have the job that i thought of as my dream job a few years back. but i have become more of a cynic since then.12. i made a few new year resolutions this year, for the first time in my life, i think.13. i don't have the same enthusiasm for learning new languages any more. i blame information overload.14. i love falafels.15. hyderabad is my favorite city. cochin would be, when it's safe for women.16. i secretly believe that most north keralites are in general better people (compared to south) - more honest, more down to earth. i know i have not met that diverse an array of people to say this, and that in any case is too general and too unfair a statement to make, so i try not to say it aloud.17. there is a song that touches me deeply. it's the trawlerman's song. i like how knopfler says 'scars on her belly' in there. i did not know this song when i went for the knopfler concert in india around that time, so i do not know if i ever heard this song live.18. i'll return to india next year if everything goes as planned.19. like many people who leave india for a developed country for a few years, my perception of india has changed very much in a very positive way. not really because i miss those things here (though i sometimes do). it's just that i needed to be an outsider at least in one way to take an objective look. for instance, i really appreciate diversity and what it really means in the indian context and how rare that is in this world and how fast disappearing. i'm not terrible proud of this new look i took, because it should not take this long. my plan to return to india is definitely not based on this changed perception though it definitely helps in transitioning mentally.20. i used to dream about running and losing control of my speed and being unable to stop.. ever. it's scary.21. i have lost many friends recently. distance due to other preoccupations, priorities and lack of accessibility. it's very tempting to think that the only real friends are the ones that stay. but i know this is not true, people keep coming together and moving away and that there is no pattern in this flow.22. there is someone who has deeply influenced the way i am. i met her when we were both 10. i learned the immense appeal of being yourself from her. the irony.23. i can see in the dark better than most people i know.24. i don't like having "principles" - i like doing what is best for the situation - clichéd as it sounds.25. i like deep ravines, huge mountains, skyscrapers, large bodies of water - because how small they make everything else look.
