	 why creative commons?
	 
    



created by pierson clair


in this era of digital technology increasing at a rapid pace, it is important to think about the licenses that restrict digital innovation. while copyright may be good for some works, it is important to realize that this is not the only option. lawrence lessig has created the creative commons license to allow people to release content into the "public domain" without any legal ramifications. 

watch this vidcast to learn more about the advances that the creative commons license is making in internet content production.

	 introduction to "creative commons remix videos"
	 
    




the next tenfour series, premiering april 17th-20th, will see the team producing remix videos using raw materials culled entirely from creative commons and the public domain. 


for this promo, sammy g revisited our old friend schlockmaster for the soundtrack, creating a remix that sampled the following sources:

"kuenstlerfunk" by schlockmaster
partners in rhyme
“now get busy” by the beastie boys, “what you sittin’ on?” by dj danger mouse & jemini, “oslodum” by gilberto gil, “action at a distance” by matmo, and “wadidyusay” by zap mama from the wired cd: rip. sample. mash. share.
andrew created the visual track by cutting up and animating a bunch of photos from the flickr creative commons pool. here are links to the originals:

today's sentiments by malingering (april 1, 2006)
america by ¥§•ªˆ¨ˇ©love©ˇ¨ˆª•§¥ (july 16, 2005)
capital city neon by todd klassy (december 30, 2005)
pumps 3 & 4 by todd klassy (february 9, 2006)
flickr love 3 by special (july 17, 2004)

	 defend online creativity!
	 
    



created by seth gullion


my ‘walking tour’ podcast will lead you on a minor internet exodus. web 2.0 culture is characterized by active social participation, and this is true in the realm of online artists.  remixes, tributes, collaborations, nonprofit free hosting: the 
opportunities for creative exploration are many and great. unfortunately, intellectual property rights and copyright law on the web are far from ideal at the moment. if there are too many restrictions, much of the freedom web 2.0 offers will 
disappear, but if there is not enough regulation exploitation could run rampant. to make matters worse, there exist offenders that fail to aid either side of the argument, and add fuel to the fire. websites such as ebaum’s world steal content 
from media authors and make money off of their work. public awareness of these crimes, and the repercussions they have on our culture as a whole, must be increased.  hopefully this podcast will clearly display this threat to the web 2.0 creative 
community and outline a simple way that you can help.  
background music to this podcast:
"opening theme" by ben charest

	 girl technology
	 
    



created by jessica janner


my unique experience with technology at an early age has shaped the way i view and participate with media. as a young girl, i was involved in typical "girl" activities but also taught computer skills.  most girls today are still not exposed to technology in the same way as boys. technology still seems to be gendered.



this project was done using after effects and final cut pro.

	 we like live...
	 
    



created by pierson clair



why do we like live television? is it because we feel like we are there? is it because we know that anything can happen? is it because we know that what we are seeing is actually what is happening, not an edited version? this vidcast explores this in 60 seconds. 

technical: created in after effects. the audio was captured using audacity.
