	 dave logan, american patriot, 1956 - 2012
    


updated below



dave logan

american patriot

 1956 - 2012

 

william david logan, longtime crusader for the rights of others, died august 7, 2012 in sacramento, ca. following a lengthy battle with leukemia.




the son of the late edward logan and the late beverly parbs logan, dave was born feb. 4, 1956 in urbana, illinois. he spent his later childhood in kankakee, illinois.  he was the grandson of the late fred and edna seiling, and the late lula and william ray logan with whom he spent many boyhood summers on their farm near armstrong, illinois.




dave served our country in the u.s. army at ft. ord, ca. while there, he became a proficient sky diver and eventually a jumpmaster with the ft. ord sport parachute club in monterey, ca. dave made 200 jumps, the highest from 12,500 feet.




following his military service, dave remained in california where he made his home in the folsom area and worked in the gaming industry until 2005. he later produced the andrea shea king radio program from 2007 until his death.




an accomplished writer and astute observer of current events, dave wrote thousands of opinion posts at his popular website "thirdwavedave" beginning in 2005, sharing his perspectives on contemporary culture, patriotism and politics. staunchly patriotic, dave regularly and frequently wrote of great americans and historic american milestones in the belief that knowledge of history was essential to understanding and placing current events in context.




diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2007, dave opted to participate in a clinical trial that included a stem cell transplant administered through the stem cell transplant program at the uc davis cancer center in sacramento. it was his hope that other leukemia patients might benefit from the knowledge gained from his disease.




friends described dave as disciplined, cool under pressure, focused, thorough, determined, pragmatic, logical, subtle, quick witted, soft spoken, discreet and analytical.  when he played a critical role in bringing forward two successful workplace harassment lawsuits, dave was described by the plaintiffs' attorney as "a crusader of those who were preyed upon by employers."




dave admired and emulated the courage and determination of such men as gen. george patton jr.and exhibited those qualities throughout his battle with cml. dave never shirked or folded. he moved forward, never holding ground.  in the face of sometimes seemingly insurmountable odds, he persevered without complaint. dave was defined by his heroes which included america's astronauts. his fascination with the nation's space program began as a youngster with nasa's moon missions, and he treasured the moment he witnessed from the banks of the indian river in titusville, fl, the launch of apollo 17, america's final mission to the moon.




dave is survived by three brothers and two sisters: fred "skip" voeste of forrest, il; phil logan of urbana, il; ed logan of champaign, il; rose logan of carterville, il; barbara logan snyder of ringgold, ga; the late susan marie logan; and several nieces and nephews. he also leaves numerous friends, including his army buddies and fellow parachute jumpers on the both the east and west coasts; dave's caregiver rhonda johnson of rocklin, ca.; and radio show host andrea shea king of cape canaveral, fl.




a celebration of dave's life will be held veteran's day weekend with a ceremony on the beach in cape canaveral, his ashes to be scattered where america's astronauts broke the surly bonds of earth.

 update: nov. 11, 2012 - on this date, veteran's day, we laid dave to rest, scattering his ashes on the beach at cape canaveral as he requested. a bugler from bugles across america sounded taps, fulfilling dave's wish. you are invited to view photos of the beachside memorial and lunch that followed in celebration of dave's life.

	 a patriot's final journey
    


dave logan 1956 - 2012"the only greater sorrow would have been not to know him, right?"  -- dymphna of gates of vienna"thirdwavedave" dave logan has entered into the beauty of god's kingdom.  he left us shortly after the medical team removed him from the life sustaining measures yesterday morning. blessedly, he did not linger long.we will be planning a celebration of dave's life in the weeks ahead.  dave was not one to call a lot of attention to himself as many of you know.  a private man, his final wishes were simple -- dave asked me to spread his ashes on the beach here in cape canaveral. it will be my honor and privilege. details are yet to be determined, but once plans are made, i'll keep you apprised.several of you have indicated that you want to be present when that happens. i would like that very much and i'll let you know when the date is set to take place, giving you ample time to make whatever travel arrangements are necessary.i want to take this moment to thank each of you who have been so kind to send me caring notes following this morning's email about dave.  your words have been a source of comfort to me on this very sad day.  i truly appreciate your sympathy and wonderful remembrances of dave.  i don't think he had any idea the impact he had on so many of you, especially those of you in our extensive blogging community. as you will understand, i won't be doing my radio show tonight. but it is my intention to dedicate a show in dave's honor in the near future, and i hope you'll join me when i do.once again, my heartfelt thank you for your kindnesses.  and for your friendship for both dave and me.blessings to you all,andreamany of dave's friends have posted remembrances at their facebook pages. others at their websites.  they include:mr. rightmarathon punditdoug gibbsi own the worldradio patriot - dave's final journeyradio patriot - our patriot dave fighting to livelabels: chronic myeloid leukemia, cml, dave logan, uc davis cancer center

	 prayers for dave
    


it's been a week since i last came here to dave's site to update you on his condition.unfortunately it hasn't gotten any better.  in fact, it has worsened, and he is now on life support while his doctors try to identify the bacteria that is coursing through his body so they can eradicate it with the proper antibiotic. pray they isolate it soon.those of us who are close to him  -- his family and friends -- are asking for your prayers.please keep a good thought for dave, and pray that god's will be done mercifully.  if he is to take dave, let it be swift and painless.  if he wills it that dave remain with us, let his recovery be also swift and pain free.i will keep you posted as i learn more.  but for now, please pray.we have faith that his ways, thought they be mysterious, are perfect.thanks so much,andrea***labels: bone marrow transplant, dave logan, uc davis cancer center

	 one year ago sunday...
    


hi everyone,andrea here, writing on behalf of thirdwavedave who's in the hospital getting treatment for another "bump in the road" following his bone marrow transplant on may 10th.our mutual friend john ruberry -- the marathon pundit -- has posted something that i felt should be here on dave's page.  as john wrote, "this is something dave would have posted if he was feeling better."he's right -- dave has made it a practice to remind us of our history and never misses an opportunity to post of the milestones that have made us a country.so i'm reprinting marathon pundit's post here, because i'm certain that dave would want us to.***sunday, july 08, 2012one year ago: dark day in history, last us manned space flight launcheswhile the launch--and the successful return--of a manned-spacecraft on is not bad news on the surface, today is the first anniversary of a dark day in american history. the final launch of the space shuttle atlantisoccurred on this date in 2011--and not only do we have no plans to launch astronauts into space from cape canaveral--but for the first time in over 50 years we have no spacecrafts for such missions.president obama's choice to run nasa, charles bolden, had this to say about the agency a year prior to the final atlantis launch:when i became the nasa administrator — before i became the nasa administrator — [obama] charged me with three things: one was he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math, he wanted me to expand our international relationships, and third, and perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the muslim world and engage much more with dominantly muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math, and engineering.anything missing?space exploration.nasa has gone from putting men on the moon to being an esteem coach. tragic.russia now has a monopoly on manned space-flight. when we need to send astronauts into space, we have to get in touch with obama's pal vladimir putin.

	 what did obama know and when did he know it?
    


drudge did a good job mixing obama/nixon on his front page. andrea shea king dropped this masterpiece onto my facebook page because she was sure i'd want to post it here.  she'd be right.i wonder, though, if we aren't getting too far ahead of ourselves on this issue, making more of it than is really there.  you have to be careful with these fast moving, highly politicized dc battles.  but i must say, no matter how you look this thing over, it does appear someone's hiding something, unless this is one of those complex, inside-the-beltway tactics that's way above my head.earlier today i heard a congressman use the famous phrase born of the nixon/watergate days: "what did he know and when did he know it."  could we be in this deep, i thought?  good chance we are.  time will tell on this score.  first we have to get a full house vote and see where it goes from there.  personally, i don't think it makes it to the full house--a deal is in the works--this is a town of deals.either way, the truth of what happened, who was in charge, and who knew, must become part of the public record before any justice is arrived at.  the law demands it, and the families of the dead deserve nothing less.be a man, mr. president. labels: border security, operation "fast and furious, politics, washington dc

	 fnc's cavuto makes move to interview "the won"
    


cavuto and fox news lost me long ago.  friday i found myself here in this hospital bed trapped into watching "mr pastry's" show ending tribute for father's day. nice touch, i thought.  then i listened.it's obvious that neil has read bill o'reilly's playbook, but i doubt it'll work for him like it did for bill.  what's with these guys wanting to be near obama, or wanting obama to like them?  this piece, short as it might be, is enough to make you wretch.sickening.*and you might as well read this one too: obama as the world's biggest spender in the history of spending. labels: boot lick, father's day, fox news, neil cavuto, obama

	 d-day + 68 years--"the story to end all stories was d-day"
    


 all things worth having come at a price. freedom is certainly worth having and the allied nations paid dearly for it sixty-eight years ago.take a moment to consider the scene pictured above.many of the gis you see wading through the water didn't live but a few moments after that picture was taken. all of them had to be sick with fear; their minds racing with thoughts of loved ones back home and of the job ahead of them.everything we have and hold dear today was bought and paid for by the brave gis in that picture. think about it. the radio patriot remembers d-day and the sacrifice of the bedford boys.remembering the 40th anniversary of d-day--ronald reagan:map of normandy invasion headlines back home--chicago, illinois wounded soldiers--omaha beach the dead--omaha beach cemetery labels: allied invasion, american gi, d-day, normandy, operation overlord, ronald reagan, wwii
