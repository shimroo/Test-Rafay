		no rules riders mission
	




 no rules riders is not a motorcycle club.
		it is a group of people who like to ride for the freedom of riding.


		the mission of no rules riders is to have a motorcycle riding group that people can be
		part of without dealing with the politics and infrastructure of traditional riding groups
		or clubs. to have a group of riders that will ride free wherever and whenever they may choose.
		no rules riders will be respectful of those who are respectful to them. no rules riders will
		never be part of any rule dominated organization. this group is not for the timid or weak and
		not for the bad ass or somebody with something to prove. it is for people who want to ride free.
		

		no rules riders will provide an opportunity for like-minded riders to co-exist within the
		riding community without the structure of rules, meetings, hierarchy, or dues. there are no
		officers or rank of any kind. there are no presidents, vice presidents, secretary or other
		given authority. chapters exist solely on the idea that individuals have the right to
		ride and assemble. no rules riders chapters claim no territory.
		

		through the no rules riders website you will be able to connect with people in your
		area who like to ride, and with other no rules riders around the world. through the
		website, members will be able to join or create a chapter in their area. this will
		enable you and others to socialize locally and to meet up with other no rules riders
		from around the world at bike rallies and events in other cities, states, and countries.
		

		remember there are no rules, so you can be a part of no rules riders by simply saying that you are a no rules rider.

		standards of no rules riders
	





					this should help to further explain no rules ridersï¿½ place in the motorcycle world and who we are.
                    


                    no rules riders is an independent riding club. 
                    no rules riders does not claim any territory.
                    no rules riders does not have any alliances.
                    we are neutral.
                    if you donï¿½t like freedom, you wonï¿½t like us.



                    no rules riders will play a positive role in the motorcycle world. no rules riders and its members will be
                    respectful of all clubs in their area. under no circumstance will no rules riders be a support club to
                    any motorcycle club. any chapter that misrepresents no rules riders by displaying other clubs
                    paraphernalia will be removed from no rules riders.
                    
                    no rules riders is composed of strong minded, independent people who like to ride with freedom.
                    there is no probationary period, no prospect periods, just riders. we, no rules riders, welcome
                    other riders who are of the same mind set to join our group and help no rules riders grow.
                    
                    no rules riders does not condone illegal activity within its membership. we are, for the most
                    part, law abiding people. the work of people in no rules riders has earned us the
                    presidential award for community service.  we are truly a melting pot of riders. we come
                    from all walks of life and from all over the world. we have preachers and swingers, public
                    safety (police, fire and military), future and ex-convicts, young and old, rich and poor.
                    some of our members have been in mcï¿½s in the past and some even in the 1% world, but now have
                    chosen no rules riders as their way of life.
                    
                    the members who choose to show their pride in no rules riders by wearing t-shirts or the back
                    patch must remember that they are representing all of no rules riders worldwide, thus their
                    actions will be held accountable by all other no rules riders members. members must realize
                    that when wearing the no rules riders back patch other clubs will hold you to a higher
                    standard too. (in other words, donï¿½t be an ass when you are wearing the nrr back patch because you make us all look bad)
                    
                    it is up to all no rules riders members to hold all other no rules riders to these standards.
                    
                    yes, we are our brotherï¿½s keeper. we are no rules riders!
				





		the structure of the no rules riders website
	





					no rules riders is made up of many different chapters. any member can start a new
					chapter at anytime. naming of chapters must be done with respect to established
					riding groups. this is not a rule, this is respect. all chapter names are reviewed by the no rules riders advisors.
                    
                    "chapter creator" is the person who creates a chapter. they are responsible
                    for all actions of their chapter. the chapter creator has the ability to change
                    all aspects of their chapter, excluding renaming their chapter. this will be
                    done only by the founder. the chapter creator also has the ability to edit or
                    delete any postings of its chapter's members and receives email notices of any
                    members' postings. they also have the ability to email all members in their
                    chapter, regardless of the individual members' email settings. the chapter
                    creator can establish a chapter administrator to help with these responsibilities.
                    all chapter creators must have a listed active email for contact reasons.
                    
                    "chapter administrators" are persons who help the chapter creator with the
                    responsibilities of the chapter. these chapter administrators also have the
                    ability to edit or delete any postings of members.
                    
                    "chapter members" are individuals who belong to a specific chapter.
                    any chapter member can post events, photos, and send email in their chapter.
                    at any time they can edit their own posting by clicking on the pencil.

		back patches
	





                    guideline for wearing the no rules riders back patch.
                    
                    no rules riders is a riding club with a single piece back patch. this
                    single piece back patch is worn with a rc patch to show that we (nrr)
                    are a riding club and not a motorcycle club.  at no time shall other
                    patches be added to the no rules riders back patch to have it resemble
                    a multi- piece patch, i.e. rockers. some riders have numerous small
                    patches spread out along ones vest on the front and back. there is no
                    problem with this. patches with chapter names must not be worn on the
                    back of the vest or jacket. if a chapter wishes to have chapter patches,
                    this is fine, but they must be worn on the front side of a vest or jacket.
                    
                    any member while wearing a no rules riders back patch that also wears a ï¿½supportï¿½ patch,
                    pins or other, will be removed from no rules riders. (when not wearing the no rules riders back
                    patch, this would not apply) the reasoning behind this is that doing such would cause problems
                    for others no rules riders members in other states and counties. with all this being said, there
                    is the importance of getting along with the local motorcycle clubs. if one chooses, go to their
                    parties, ride in their charity events and have a good time. wear your no rules riders back patch
                    and be proud.
                    
                    the reason no rules riders must follow these guidelines is that we (nrr)
                    set ourselves aside from the multi- piece patch wearing riders. this is
                    what makes us who we are. if one wish to have a multi- piece patch there
                    are many groups to join that wear these. no rules riders is not one of them.
                    
                    it is up to all no rules riders to hold the other no rules riders
                    to these guidelines.
