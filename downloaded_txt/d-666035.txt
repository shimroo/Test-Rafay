cultivating interest to secure foundation engagement

leap prepared and submitted a proposal for a client in march 2023. while the foundation passed on the proposal at the time, we helped our client maintain communication with the foundation and continued to educate them about the client's work. by january 2023, the foundation proactively asked the organization to resubmit the proposal as they learned more and became more interested in their work.
