brent vondross - benicia, ca sept 2014 - warrick grill designed entry
i just wanted to thank you for your excellent service. we have just completed a five month major remodel on our house and your company stood out from the rest as being the most efficient, prompt, and following through on doing what you said you would do. if only all my suppliers and contractors were half as good as you my job would have been much easier. again, thank you for doing your part and preforming at a professional level.
										respectfully, brent vondross

mike and cj creal guttenberg, ia - june 2011
received our beautiful alder doors a week ago. we put a natural varnish and they are by far the best doors we own. thank you so very much.


jay garner kerrville, tx - july 2011
the entry i bought from y'all is done! the fit and finish were good, requiring a minimum of sanding before staining. i had the old sliding glass door out, the new entry framed in , anchored, caulked, stained, and one coat of urethane on in one day. it looks great! thanks for a quality product.

										hi katy!
could you see your beautiful doors peeking thru by the kitchen?!!! we love the doors! our project is way way behind .. but, we are getting there. we will keep you posted and will send more pictures of the doors ... eventually. we want to promote your doors and tell everyone to call you. many people have commented on how gorgeous the doors are ... we still can't live in the house .... so, we have not been able to really "show" them the way we want to. someday ... we want you to come visit us in cape cod ... and we will cook you up a great meal ... stay well ... we will keep in touch ...

										we ordered the "washington" door with the side panels and put it in our new home in louisiana. it is just beautiful and reflects prisms of light in our foyer in the evening as the sun sets. we have received many compliments on this door. the workmanship, the professionally done mahogany stain and quality are superb and the sales team in beaumont were very very helpful when it came to ordering the hardware for the door. we are very happy with the workmanship, service and quality in this door. thanks again!

										just wanted to drop you a quick note on the door that we ordered . my wife and i are just thrilled with the way it turned out. the quality of the door and the finish that you applied really came out beyond our expectations. just this weekend, we had it installed by a person who used to install for another door manufacturer, and he was very much complementary on the quality which the door displayed. again, very pleased with your product, as well as the service that you provided, and please use us as a reference if you ever need one.

we received our door early this afternoon. i have to say that dealing with you and texas custom doors was truly a pleasure. it was a bright spot in a greuling room addition process. first, it came as fast or faster than expected. we really appreciate you helping us with this. everyone (especially us) has been raving about the quality of the door. it is every bit as beautiful as it looked on your website. the freight delivery driver and the framers working onsite were particularly impressed with the quality of the crating and the shipping as well. the shipping fee was even less than you estimated, which was another pleasant surprise. everything about this transaction was quality. i would highly recommend you and your company to anyone!!!

just wanted to drop you a line to say "thank you" for all your help with our gorgeous front door. must admit, sure don't want to transport another glass paned door again. goodness, what a stressful experience. for future reference, you can use our testimony to warn other customers that patience is more valuable than stress, and there are professionals with special equipment to handle the transport of their "custom" cargo. we arrived home with our door intact, but not without some effort. anyways, as my husband says: we have a special story behind that beautiful door. and i was able to put a friendly face with the friendly voice i grew to appreciate for several weeks over the phone. the precious cargo is to be installed first thing monday morning. once our house is complete, i will send pictures.thank you so much for your beautiful work, your attention to detail, and your extraordinary gift of customer satisfaction.
										take care! a very happy customer
