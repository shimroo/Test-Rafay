officially, freemasonry was born in 1717, when 4 craft lodges gathered at the apple tree tavern in london, and set up a constitution for free and accepted masons, written by anderson... but they claim their roots can be traced to egypt, syria, babylon... and the stonecutters of the solomon temple, specially "hiram abiff" (1r.7, 2cr.2,4), a celebrated figure because of his death-defying refusal to reveal trade secrets to intruders... the "jesus christ" for many masons... though it is "an irony", because the temple of solomon was not built with stones, but with wood, brought by another "hiram", the king of tyre (1r.5,9). - source: www.religion-cults.com

1. why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?



2. the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the lord and against his anointed, saying,



3. let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.



4. he who sits in the heavens laughs; the lord holds them in derision.



5. then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying,



6. as for me, i have set my king on zion, my holy hill.



7. i will tell of the decree: the lord said to me, you are my son; today i have begotten you.



8. ask of me, and i will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.



9. you shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.



10. now therefore, o kings, be wise; be warned, o rulers of the earth.



11. serve the lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.



12. kiss the son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. blessed are all who take refuge in him.

 2 then came the word of the lord unto me, saying, 



 3 son of man, speak unto the elders of israel, and say unto them, thus saith the lord god; are ye come to enquire of me? as i live, saith the lord god, i will not be enquired of by you. 



 4 wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers: 



 5 and say unto them, thus saith the lord god; in the day when i chose israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt, when i lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, i am the lord your god; 



 6 in the day that i lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of egypt into a land that i had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands: 



 7 then said i unto them, cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt: i am the lord your god. 



 8 but they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of egypt: then i said, i will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of egypt. 



 9 but i wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight i made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt.



 10 wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 



 11 and i gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them. 



 12 moreover also i gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them. 



 13 but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then i said, i would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. 



 14 but i wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight i brought them out. 



 15 yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands; 



 16 because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.

militaryphotos.net: cyprus - 40 years before from today







the book of jeremiah is the second of the latter prophets in the hebrew bible, and the second of the prophets in the christian old testament. the superscription at chapter 1:13 identifies it as "the words of jeremiah son of hilkiah," and places the prophet historically from the reforms of king josiah in 627 bc through the subjugation of judah by the babylonians in 605, the deportation of king jehoiachin in 597, the destruction of the city in 587/586, and the assassination of the babylonian-appointed governor of judah in 582. of all the prophets, jeremiah comes through most clearly as a person, ruminating to his scribe baruch about his role as a servant of god with little good news for his audience.



jeremiah is written in a very complex and poetic hebrew (apart from verse 10:12, curiously written in biblical aramaic). it has come down in two distinct though related versions, one in hebrew, the other known from a greek translation. both versions are heavily edited and reflect the perspectives of later ages; both portray jeremiah as a "second moses" but in reverse, presiding over israel's banishment from the promised land. the book is a representation of the message and significance of the prophet substantially intended for the jews in babylonian exile: its purpose is to explain the disaster as god's response to israel's pagan worship: the people, says jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children: their infidelity and rebelliousness make judgement inevitable, although restoration and a new covenant are foreshadowed.

 11 moreover the word of the lord came unto me, saying, 



 12 son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus, and say unto him, thus saith the lord god; thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 



 13 thou hast been in eden the garden of god; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 



 14 thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and i have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of god; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 



 15 thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. 



 16 by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god: and i will destroy thee, o covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 



 17 thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: i will cast thee to the ground, i will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. 



 18 thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.

1. god blesses those people who refuse evil advice and wont follow sinners or join in sneering at god.



2. instead, the law of the lord makes them happy, and they think about it day and night.



3. they are like trees growing beside a stream, trees that produce fruit in season and always have leaves. those people succeed in everything they do.



4. that isnt true of those who are evil, because they are like straw blown by the wind.



5. sinners wont have an excuse on the day of judgment, and they wont have a place with the people of god.



6. the lord protects everyone who follows him, but the wicked follow a road that leads to ruin.

kennedy's investigative odyssey ---

which began with a frantic zeal

immediately after his brother's assassination, 

and then secretly continued in fitful bursts

until his own murder five years later ---

 did not succeed in bringing the case to court.



[talbot's] book opens with a statement by bobby kennedy:



'i found out something i never knew. 

i found out that my world

was not the real world.'



- robert f. kennedy, 1968."

18 and all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 



 19 and they said unto moses, speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not god speak with us, lest we die. 



 20 and moses said unto the people, fear not: for god is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 



 21 and the people stood afar off, and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was. 



 22 and the lord said unto moses, thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel, ye have seen that i have talked with you from heaven. 



 23 ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. 



 24 an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee, and i will bless thee. 



 25 and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.

>1 then jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil.


>2 for forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry.


>3 during that time the devil came and said to him, if you are the son of god, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.


>4 but jesus told him, no! the scriptures say, people do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of god.


>5 then the devil took him to the holy city, jerusalem, to the highest point of the temple, 


>6 and said, if you are the son of god, jump off! for the scriptures say, he will order his angels to protect you. and they will hold you up with their hands so you wont even hurt your foot on a stone."


>7 jesus responded, the scriptures also say, you must not test the lord your god.


>8 next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. 


>9 i will give it all to you, he said, if you will kneel down and worship me.


>10 get out of here, satan, jesus told him. for the scriptures say, you must worship the lord your god and serve only him."


>11 then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of jesus.

>1 then the high priest asked him, are these charges true? 

 
>2 to this he replied: brothers and fathers, listen to me! the god of glory appeared to our father abraham while he was still in mesopotamia, before he lived in haran. 3 leave your country and your people, god said, and go to the land i will show you.


>4 so he left the land of the chaldeans and settled in haran. after the death of his father, god sent him to this land where you are now living. 5 he gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. but god promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time abraham had no child. 6 god spoke to him in this way: your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. 7 but i will punish the nation they serve as slaves, god said, and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place. 8 then he gave abraham the covenant of circumcision. and abraham became the father of isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. later isaac became the father of jacob, and jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs. 


>9 because the patriarchs were jealous of joseph, they sold him as a slave into egypt. but god was with him 10 and rescued him from all his troubles. he gave joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of pharaoh king of egypt; so he made him ruler over egypt and all his palace. 


>11 then a famine struck all egypt and canaan, bringing great suffering, and our fathers could not find food. 12 when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit. 13 on their second visit, joseph told his brothers who he was, and pharaoh learned about josephs family. 14 after this, joseph sent for his father jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. 15 then jacob went down to egypt, where he and our fathers died. 16 their bodies were brought back to shechem and placed in the tomb that abraham had bought from the sons of hamor at shechem for a certain sum of money. 


>17 as the time drew near for god to fulfill his promise to abraham, the number of our people in egypt greatly increased. 18 then another king, who knew nothing about joseph, became ruler of egypt. 19 he dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die. 


>20 at that time moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. for three months he was cared for in his fathers house. 21 when he was placed outside, pharaohs daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. 22 moses was educated in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was powerful in speech and action. 


>23 when moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow israelites. 24 he saw one of them being mistreated by an egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the egyptian. 25 moses thought that his own people would realize that god was using him to rescue them, but they did not. 26 the next day moses came upon two israelites who were fighting. he tried to reconcile them by saying, men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other? 


>27 but the man who was mistreating the other pushed moses aside and said, who made you ruler and judge over us? 28 do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday? 29 when moses heard this, he fled to midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons. 


>30 after forty years had passed, an angel appeared to moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near mount sinai. 31 when he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. as he went over to look more closely, he heard the lords voice: 32 i am the god of your fathers, the god of abraham, isaac and jacob. moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look. 


>33 then the lord said to him, take off your sandals; the place where you are standing is holy ground. 34 i have indeed seen the oppression of my people in egypt. i have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. now come, i will send you back to egypt.


>35 this is the same moses whom they had rejected with the words, who made you ruler and judge? he was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by god himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. 36 he led them out of egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in egypt, at the red sea and for forty years in the desert. 


>37 this is that moses who told the israelites, god will send you a prophet like me from your own people. 38 he was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on mount sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us. 


>39 but our fathers refused to obey him. instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to egypt. 40 they told aaron, make us gods who will go before us. as for this fellow moses who led us out of egyptwe dont know what has happened to him! 41 that was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. they brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honor of what their hands had made. 42 but god turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. this agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: 


>did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert, o house of israel? 43 you have lifted up the shrine of molech and the star of your god rephan, the idols you made to worship. therefore i will send you into exile beyond babylon. 


>>44 our forefathers had the tabernacle of the testimony with them in the desert. it had been made as god directed moses, according to the pattern he had seen. 45 having received the tabernacle, our fathers under joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations god drove out before them. it remained in the land until the time of david, 46 who enjoyed gods favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the god of jacob. 47 but it was solomon who built the house for him. 


>>48 however, the most high does not live in houses made by men. as the prophet says: 


>>49 heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. what kind of house will you build for me? says the lord. or where will my resting place be? 50 has not my hand made all these things?


>>51 you stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! you are just like your fathers: you always resist the holy spirit! 52 was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? they even killed those who predicted the coming of the righteous one. and now you have betrayed and murdered him 53 you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it. 


>54 when they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. 55 but stephen, full of the holy spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of god, and jesus standing at the right hand of god. 56 look, he said, i see heaven open and the son of man standing at the right hand of god. 

 
>57 at this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, 58 dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. meanwhile, the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named saul. 


>59 while they were stoning him, stephen prayed, lord jesus, receive my spirit. 60 then he fell on his knees and cried out, lord, do not hold this sin against them. when he had said this, he fell asleep.
