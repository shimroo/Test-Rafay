powerless portland police?





apparently, the mayor of portland, or plans to introduce to city council next week a proposal to disarm the local police department.  not the whole force, mind you, but those responding to non-emergency calls.  to pay for this new program, the city cut their mounted patrol.  the police union is saying something different.
portland police association president daryl turner says the ps3s will not respond to calls for service without a sworn officer, but they may provide support by manning the front desks at precincts or waiting for tow trucks at car accidents. that's a much smaller, less public role than what portland mayors have pledged—and some observers say keeping the officers off the streets is a bait-and-switch.as a matter of public policy, this proposal might actually have merit.  sending unarmed officers on emergency calls is not smart, but the lower priority calls?  i am open to hearing why every officer on every call must be armed to a level that they could take on a banana republic, but it's going to have to be a really good reason.  law enforcement, like many other government sponsored entities, suffers from mission creep.  dialing back what they respond to might be a solution, but certainly reducing the number of situations in which the officer arrives for armed conflict might impact how law enforcement is perceived in their communities.

it was just a tv show and mayberry is hardly what america looks like today, but sheriff taylor didn't need a weapon to enforce the law in his town.  we should be asking ourselves what we can do to make our communities safe without subjecting ourselves to a police state (see what i did there?).  it's something to think about...

release: state representative john becker announces six right-to-work constitutional amendments





columbus—state representative john becker (r-union township) today announced six right-to-work related constitutional amendments as follows:



• private-sector right-to-work – no worker should be required to subsidize a union as a condition of employment. additionally, this amendment will tell the world that ohio is “open for business.”



• public-sector right-to-work – this legislation is about freedom of association. the same as the private sector, no worker should be required to subsidize a union as a condition of employment.



• public-sector prevailing wage – repeals the requirement for taxpayers to pay artificially inflated wages, rather than those that are market-based.



• public-sector paycheck protection – this amendment prohibits state and local government employers from withholding union dues or fees from workers’ wages. additionally, unions will be prohibited from spending workers’ money on political activities without workers’ consent.



• public-sector project labor agreements – this legislation is the michigan model approved by the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit. state and local government entities will be prohibited from minimizing competition for construction projects by requiring that only union or non-union labor can be considered. a level playing field will be required.



• public-sector union recertification – requires annual reconsideration and recertification of workers’ bargaining units. this amendment will open up competition for new bargaining units, will give workers a chance to have their voices heard, and will make union leadership accountable to their membership.



with these proposals, becker asks ohio’s general assembly to put all of them on the ballot for the people to vote on individually.



“now that 28 states, and four out of five of ohio’s neighboring states, have enacted right-to-work laws, the nation’s future is for all workers to have the right to work free of the burden of mandated union payments as a condition of employment,” said becker. “ohio is being left behind, and it is time for the people to decide ohio’s future.”

let boys be boys so they can become men





i've let this news about the boy scouts letting girls join their ranks next year stew a bit because i didn't want to treat the subject without appropriate consideration.

boys are under attack by a culture that doesn't like masculinity.  at least, that's how i see it.  if boys aren't left alone to be boys they will never grow up to be respectable men.  manly skills are being lost.  our schools and institutions have forgotten that every child is different.

i'm not talking about bad behavior.  discipline is essential to a boys upbringing.

and really, all of that aside, why aren't the girl scouts providing programming that attracts those girls that want more experiences like the boy scouts provide?

i read online that there are reasons why girls join the girl scouts and one of them is that it is a place for girls to discuss things they wouldn't want to share in the presence of boys.  here's a newsflash, the boys have those same issues.

nobody is served by destroying traditional programs except those who seek to blur the line of appropriate behavior. 

should there be more interaction between the scouting organizations?  i think there would be some benefit to such an arrangement.  should there be a scouting organization the isn't gender based?  there have been such programs and they haven't flourished, at least not in my lifetime.  

parents of girls who want in the boy scouts ought to be more involved in the girl scouts programming.  there is no reason why the girl scouts can't adapt to fit the needs of the modern girl.

release: bill providing oversight to every student succeeds act education plan passes ohio house





columbus—state representative theresa gavarone (r-bowling green) today announced that the ohio house has passed legislation that would give the legislature additional oversight regarding the state’s education plan under the federal every student succeeds act of 2015 (essa).

house bill 235, sponsored by rep. gavarone, requires the ohio department of education (ode) to submit a written copy of the state plan required by essa to each member of the house and senate education committees. this plan must be submitted no later than 30 days before it is implemented.

“giving the legislature more oversight over something as important as the state’s education plan is one of the best things we can do for our constituents,” gavarone said.  “this will allow the people of wood county and the rest of ohio to play an even bigger role in the state’s education policy and i applaud my colleagues for passing this legislation out of the house.”

the bill also includes a measure that would prohibit ode from putting the plan into effect should the legislature disapprove the plan through a concurrent resolution.

house bill 235 now awaits consideration by the ohio senate.

release: rep. retherford announces passage of legislation eliminating tax on prescription eyewear





columbus—state representative wes retherford (r-hamilton) announced passage of house bill 116, sponsored by state representative derek merrin (r-monclova township), which eliminates the sales and use tax on prescription lenses, frames, contacts or other devices that aid an individual’s vision.

countless ohioans rely on prescription eyewear on a daily basis in order to perform tasks such as driving or reading, as well as basic job duties. eliminating the tax will alleviate burdensome and unnecessary expenses for ohio families, and will save taxpayers an estimated $29 million annually.

“prescription glasses allow those who need them to be able to function in school, life and work,” said retherford. “providing them with an exemption on sales tax, as we do with other necessities, is just common sense. the basic necessity of prescription glasses is important for thousands of ohioans.”

other pharmaceutical and prosthetic equipment are not currently taxed in ohio, making prescription eyewear the only medically necessary equipment sold in traditional retail stores that is taxed.

“i was pleased to support house bill 116 as it passed the ohio house today,” retherford stated.   “providing citizens with tax relief on this basic necessity is another step that we are taking to ensure that ohio is the best place to live, work and raise a family.”

this tax also puts ohio retailers at a disadvantage considering pennsylvania, indiana and west virginia have all eliminated the sales tax on prescription eyewear. this leads many consumers to cross state lines to purchase their glasses. ohio is one of only 14 states that taxes the optical aids.

house bill 116 now goes to the ohio senate where it awaits further consideration.

release: ohio house approves bill repealing tax on prescription eyewear





columbus—the ohio house today passed house bill 116, sponsored by state representative derek merrin (r-monclova township), which eliminates the sales and use tax on eyeglasses, frames and contacts.

eyeglasses and corrective contacts significantly improve ohio lives—enabling many to maintain employment, learn, live safely, and have mobility. house bill 116 would save taxpayers an estimated $29 million annually, but more importantly it would benefit families struggling to pay for a basic medical necessity that helps the youngest of ohioans.

“it’s a big win to reduce ohio’s tax burden and make prescription eyewear more affordable for ohioans,” merrin said.

it is important to eliminate the financial tax burden on prescribed, life-enhancing products. corrective vision products are pivotal to many children’s educational experience. poor vision can lead to academic struggles that can have life-long consequences.

prescription eyewear is the only prescribed medical product sold in traditional retail stores that is taxed in ohio. almost all prescription goods in ohio are exempt from the sales and use tax. the exceptions are dental prostheses, the sale of medical oxygen-dispensing equipment, and hospital beds unless purchased by a hospital, nursing home, or other medical facility.

house bill 116 will save taxpayer dollars while creating a simpler and fair taxation structure on prescriptions. including ohio, only 14 states impose a tax on prescription eyewear. pennsylvania, indiana and west virginia have all eliminated the tax, putting ohio retailers at a significant disadvantage.

house bill 116 passed in a vote of 93-1 with bipartisan support and awaits further consideration from the ohio senate.columbus—the ohio house today passed house bill 116, sponsored by state representative derek merrin (r-monclova township), which eliminates the sales and use tax on eyeglasses, frames and contacts.

release: legislative leaders announce creation of redistricting working group





columbus—ohio house speaker clifford a. rosenberger (r-clarksville) and ohio senate president larry obhof (r-medina) today announced the creation of a working group to review and reform ohio’s congressional redistricting process.

state representative kirk schuring (r-canton) and state senator matt huffman (r-lima) will co-chair the working group. leaders of the house and senate democratic caucuses have been invited to participate, but at this point have yet to select a member for the panel. 

the working group will review current law, explore possible reforms, gather public input and make recommendations to the legislative leaders by early december. the general assembly would then consider whether to proceed with a redistricting reform resolution to place before ohio voters. the deadline for considering such a proposal on the 2018 primary election ballot is february 7, however the general assembly has the authority to put a proposal on the ballot at any date of its choosing.

“redistricting has been an issue that several states, including ohio, have been giving a closer look at in recent years,” said speaker rosenberger. “with the responsibility of redrawing congressional districts quickly approaching, we feel the issue deserves thorough review and consideration, with the goal of finding common-sense reforms that will lead to a redistricting process that all interested parties can agree on. i believe the creation of this panel, which i hope will be bipartisan, will yield an open exchange of ideas and input from varying perspectives.”

“i'm confident we can have a meaningful, bipartisan conversation about redistricting that can potentially show us a path forward to reform,” said senate president obhof. “i know that because we've been here before, particularly in the senate, where we've been able to pass bipartisan congressional redistricting reforms twice in the last decade.  i'm hopeful this dialogue will lead us again to a fair, constitutional process that we can take to ohioans for consideration.”

the working group is expected to begin holding meetings as soon as this month. specific details on times and locations will be forthcoming.

election results demonstrate butler county gop has lost influence with voters





the results are in and it appears that the butler county republican party has lost some influence over the voters based on how some of their endorsed candidates fared.

warren davidson winning the oh-08 congressional hit is probably the highest profile seat.  tim derickson won the endorsement * [received the blessing of bcgop after the endorsement] and there was no shortage of candidates to chose from on the ballot, but the butler county gop's choice came in third.

wes retherford's win over corky combs is surprising because combs is old guard and wes was just finishing up his first term.  combs got the endorsement and then ran a vicious smear campaign that appears to have turned off the electorate.

candace keller's win over joe mulligan is another case of establishment power being crushed.  keller has been a frequent candidate for office before, but finally wins to take derickson's state house seat (he was term limited).

for me, the biggest victory of the night was ann becker winning the state central committee seat from the establishment's choice.  ann has been a strong tea party leader and has frequently been a vocal critic of the way things are going with the state party and local issues.

four races that clearly demonstrate that the central and executive committee endorsement means a whole lot less than it used to in butler county.  it's a good thing.  new blood is seriously needed as it can now be argued that the current batch are out of touch with the communities they are supposed to represent.

sidebar: sheriff spotlight gets dinged too.  particularly in the retherford race.  he's usually a behind-the-scenes player in these things, but his fingerprints are hard to miss.

* correction: a facebook friend reminded me that nobody got the endorsement.  roger reynolds received the most votes, but not enough to capture the prize.  he subsequently dropped out and support rallied around derickson after that.

release: larose seeks to update ohio's drug abuse laws







columbus — state senator frank larose
 (r-copley) yesterday introduced legislation to ensure that ohio's drug 
abuse laws appropriately reflect the potency of fentanyl and address 
its growing prevalence in overdose deaths.

"the alarming number of recent fentanyl related deaths is a serious 
concern," said larose. "this legislation has the potential to save lives
 by getting these highly potent drugs off our streets."

fentanyl, a drug typically prescribed in clinical settings, is used as a
 powerful synthetic opiate to treat or manage pain after surgery. in 
some instances, the drug is prescribed to treat patients with chronic 
pain who are tolerant of other opiates.

in 2014, fentanyl overdoses resulted in 502 deaths, according to preliminary data from the ohio department of health. this number is nearly 6 times higher than the previous year.

the legislation would change what constitutes a “bulk amount” in order 
to adequately recognize the seriousness of the illegal use and 
trafficking of fentanyl. the bill establishes that five milligrams or 
more of fentanyl or an amount equal to or exceeding one gram of a 
compound, mixture, preparation, or substance that contains any amount of
 fentanyl and that is not in a final dosage form manufactured by an 
authorized manufacturer constitutes a bulk amount for the purposes of 
drug offense laws.

the bill also harmonizes state law with federal law by 
adding lisdexamfetamine to the ohio schedule of controlled 
substances. lisdexamfetamine is used to treat adhd and hyperactivity and
 is at a high risk of being abused, especially in juveniles.

advisory: senator hite tours state to hear from ohioans about fees for co-curricular school activities







columbus — state senator cliff hite (r-findlay)
 will be holding informal public hearings across ohio on co-curricular 
school activities as it relates to pay-to-participate fees, student 
athlete health concerns and school start dates. the
 hearings will be held in columbus, findlay, cleveland and dayton 
during the month of november, and hite will be joined by other members 
of the legislature.

"co-curricular activities
 are important to the educational and social development of our young 
people and often give them a pathway to thrive and succeed at school," 
said hite, a former educator and coach. "requiring outrageous fees to 
participate limits students who might not be afforded those 
opportunities otherwise." 

in
 addition to discussing the costs of co-curricular school activities, 
senator hite will hear from interested parties and experts on the topics
 of youth concussions and sudden cardiac arrest, as well as yearly 
school start dates.

dates
 and locations for each hearing are below, and additional details will 
be forthcoming. for more information, please contact senator hite's

release: derickson opposes budget deal







oxford, ohio- 
conservative state representative and candidate for congress in ohio's 
8th district, today announced his opposition to the two-year budget deal
 between the white house and gop congressional leaders. "sometimes you 
have to stand strong even if it means standing up against leaders in 
your own party," said rep. derickson. "i oppose this bad deal because it
 was made in the cover of darkness, busts previous budget caps, 
increases the debt limit, raises spending by $80 billion dollars and 
does nothing to reduce our growing $18 trillion dollar national debt. the new york times called the deal a 'victory for obama,' but i call it a defeat for our hardworking taxpayers."

rep. derickson said the budget deal also fails to defund planned 
parenthood. "the budget deal is a victory for planned parenthood and the
 culture of death because it fails to eliminate their funding. as state 
representative, i voted to eliminate planned parenthoods funding in ohio
 and we won that fight. in congress i will promote a culture of life and
 vote to defund planned parenthood once and for all because life is a 
gift from god that must be protected," derickson said.

derickson called on his opponents in the race for congress to take a 
stand on the obama budget deal. "the voters of ohio's 8th district know 
where i stand on this bad budget deal, but it's time for my opponents to
 make their stand known today. the voters are waiting."

tim derickson is a committed husband and father, small business owner, 
farmer and award-winning conservative leader in the ohio house of 
representatives.

today in the ohio senate








the senate will consider the following legislation for concurrence during today’s session (2:30 p.m.): 

support for small businesses: senate bill 208, sponsored by senator bill beagle (r-tipp
 city) clarifies language adopted in the state's main operating budget 
earlier this year that lowers the tax burden for small businesses, 
which are the backbone of ohio's economy. the senate continues to
 refine a flat tax structure so that small businesses pay no taxes on 
the first $250,000 of revenue and then can take the benefit of a 
three percent flat tax on any amount over that. this gives ohio's small 
business owners the opportunity to reinvest back into their companies, 
add additional employees, expand their operations and grow ohio's 
economy.

release: ohio house passes bill to preserve small business tax cuts, address tpp reimbursements for schools








columbus—the
 ohio house of representatives passed legislation that corrects language
 in the state budget bill dealing with tax cuts for small business 
owners and funding
 for schools in relation to phase-outs of the tangible personal property
 tax.

  

“while
 senate bill 208 allows us to make certain that taxpayers keep more of 
their dollars, it also gives the legislature the ability to better 
support many of ohio’s schools in a substantial
 way,” said rep. jeff mcclain, chairman of the house ways & means 
committee.

  

the
 state operating budget (am. sub. hb 64), which was signed by governor 
kasich in june, included a provision that provided a 75-percent income 
tax cut for small businesses
 on the first $250,000 of income, with a flat 3-percent income tax rate 
on income above that level.


  

however,
 the way in which the bill was drafted could have resulted in 
unanticipated and unintended tax hikes for some small businesses. for 
example, a business earning
 less than $40,000 after the 75-percent deduction would see its taxes 
increase. that is because, under ohio’s progressive income tax system, 
rates up to about $40,000 are less than 3 percent.

  

senate
 bill 208 applies a progressive tax rate structure for ty’15 up to 
$40,000 of income. it then levies a flat 3-percent rate on income above 
that level. this ensures
 that no taxpayer will pay a higher rate than in 2014, and it reduces 
taxes on ohio’s small businesses by $84 million over the next two years.

  

in
 addition, sb 208 addresses language in hb 64 regarding supplemental 
funding to protect school districts from the tangible personal property 
tax reimbursement phase-outs.
 the state budget bill allowed the tpp phase-outs to continue, but 
provided a temporary back-fill of funding to protect schools from the 
phase-outs. for fy’17, senate bill 208 provides a supplement of 96 
percent of what a school district would have received.

  

specifically,
 sb 208 ensures that no school district receives less than 96 percent of
 what they received in fy’15 in foundation formula aid and tpp 
reimbursement payment.

  

the legislation now returns to the senate for further consideration.

kasich hates your republican values -- he wants to "redfine" them for you





...but don't take my word for it, he said it: 

republican presidential contender john kasich has split from other 
conservatives in his party on issues like immigration and same-sex 
marriage, but he's not denouncing the gop's values just yet. 

"i 
think i have right to define what the party is, charlie," kasich told 
"cbs this morning" host charlie rose early thursday. "look, if i win, i 
have a right to define what the party is, and along the way i'm defining
 what it is."
how gracious of the governor not to denounce our values...just yet.


he's for illegal immigration with absolutely no consequences. (i've seen no statement or policy from him or attributed to him that would lead me to believe otherwise.)


he's for allowing isis to operate in syria (his policy is a no-fly zone that russia is currently "violating" by crushing isis in syria.)


he's pro-common core


he's pro obamacare (even though he claims he wants repeal, his actions tell a different story/  see: medicaid expansion) 


he's opposed to cheap oil (see: fracking taxes)


he's a tyrant.  when he doesn't get his way, he goes around the legislature and takes "executive" action (sound familiar?)

 there are reasons why people like joy behar and rachel maddow like him.  he's not one of us.  he is one of them.

my favorite bit is about the trans-pacific partnership:


kasich said that he believes "it's good for the u.s. not only in 
terms of economics but in terms of foreign policy. trade can make a 
difference in strengthening us around the world." 


he added that while he hasn't read the full details of the trade bill, he does support it. 
he doesn't need to read the bill to know that he likes it.  obama likes it and that's good enough for him.

lastly, there's this:


when questioned about his differing stance on same-sex marriage, kasich 
said, "look, i believe in traditional marriage, but the court has 
ruled."
the court ruled on slavery, segregation and women's suffrage too.....  kasich doesn't really believe in traditional marriage or he'd recognize that the decision doesn't hold up to the values of his party and would insist that the party continue to fight.

instead, he wants to "redefine" republican values just as he has "redefined" conservatism in ohio.  how'd that work out for us?

jacobs: kasich may want to re-read his bible on medicaid expansion

faber out for oh-08







good news for roger reynolds as another big name drops out of the race to replace boehner in oh-08.

senate president keith faber will not run.  he's got his eye on a statewide race.  probably attorney general (if he can derino dave yost -- it worked once.....) or auditor (if he can't).

he didn't live in the district anyway.

sidebar: from that article linked above: "dewine may seek the governor’s office."  oh, hell no...  if there is one thing we can count on, it's jon husted's ambition.  there is no way jonny misses his chance again.  also hearing that mary taylor might want to run for governor assuming she's learned how to campaign...  anyway...

release: st. rep. pelanda’s bill strengthens ohio’s record sealing law








columbus—state
 representative dorothy pelanda (r-marysville) today announced that the 
ohio house has passed house bill 164, legislation that strengthens 
ohio’s conviction
 record sealing law. rep. pelanda was a joint sponsor of the bill.

  

house
 bill 164 alters the conviction record sealing law to allow a person who
 is convicted of an offense to apply to have the conviction sealed if 
the penalty for the
 offense has been changed so that convictions for that offense can now 
be sealed since the date of conviction.

  

by
 making this change, the law coincides with other recent actions taken 
by the general assembly to make the state’s justice system more 
rehabilitative. oftentimes,
 the sealing of a record can provide assistance with employment and can 
allow those who may not have previously been eligible for such 
opportunities because of their records to be fairly considered.

  

“for
 many, the sealing of a record or its expungement can provide assistance
 with employment opportunities and enhance the likelihood of personal 
success which might
 otherwise be denied,” rep. pelanda stated.

  

the bipartisan legislation passed with a vote of 93-1 and will now be under consideration by the ohio senate.

release: roger reynolds announces candidacy for ohio’s 8th district







liberty township, oh 10/7/15 – conservative republican roger reynolds announced this morning that he will run for the open seat in the 8th district of ohio for the u.s. house of representatives.

reynolds, a cpa, is currently serving his third term as butler county 
auditor. he has decided to run for congress because he recognizes an 
out-of-control washington that needs to be held accountable.

“the tax and spend culture of washington d.c. has led us to a 
national debt of more than $19 trillion, which serves as a great burden 
for my children, your children, and generations to come.”

reynolds said that his top priority in washington d.c. will be to 
promote sound fiscal policy and advocate for conservative solutions to 
address our fiscal crisis.

“the fact of the matter is the people of the 8th
 district deserve a representative in congress with proven financial and
 private sector experience, a track record of making tough decisions, 
and most importantly a blueprint for success.”

the reynolds for congress announcement occurred outside his campaign 
headquarters in liberty township, oh surrounded by family, friends and 
supporters. reynolds said he is committed to working hard over the 
coming months to meet the citizens of the 8th district, listen to their concerns, and earn their trust. 

“i commit to you and the people of the 8th district that i will work tirelessly to earn your support.”  

the 8th district seat is currently held by john boehner and will be vacated on october 30th, 2015.  the district encompasses butler, preble, darke, miami, and clarke counties, and a portion of mercer county.

ohio senate debates fate of ride sharing







if this article is right, today in the ohio senate there is a hearing about a bill that would regulate ride sharing companies like uber and lyft.

the gist of the bill is to set up the policies under which these companies would operate in ohio for the foreseeable future.  requiring these outfits to be permitted by the public utilities commission of ohio is really the only way to make sure that there are some standards being met by the companies.

for the most part, this blog advocates an open market.  the more the merrier.  competition is good for business and consumers alike.  it may seem odd that we advocate any regulation at all of this industry, but there have been a number of incidents with these enterprises that have made the need for a watchdog present.

the bill has already passed the ohio house, so if it gets through the senate it will be off to the governor for signature.  uber has been planning a large expansion in ohio, so the issue is a hot one.

st. rep. wes retherford announces candidacy for re-election to ohio house








promo for retherford appearance on tib all stars show a few years ago.

columbus-today, state representative wes retherford (r-hamilton) 
announced that he is running for re-election to the ohio house of 
representatives in the 51st district.


 "after many 
conversations with friends and family, and considerate prayer, i have 
decided that it is in the best interest of both my family and my 
constituents that i do not seek the open congressional seat," retherford
 said. "therefore, i am formally announcing my candidacy for re-election
 to the ohio house of representatives. i have been able to accomplish 
quite a bit in the statehouse and believe that i can do more good there 
than in washington."


 "representative retherford has been
 a committed servant to the people of the 51st district," said speaker 
of the ohio house clifford a. rosenberger (r-clarksville). "during his 
nearly four years in the house, he has been steadfast in sponsoring and 
supporting policies to support ohio's veterans, seniors and taxpayers. i
 look forward to supporting him over the next several months and doing 
what i can to help him return to the ohio house."


 retherford is seeking his third term in the ohio house, after first being elected in 2012

the butler county seat in congress







auditor and great american roger reynolds

as you all know, with john boehner's coming retirement there is a huge opportunity for somebody to step onto a much larger stage.  with that in mind, the butler county republican party has some big shoes to fill and as the county with the largest population in the district, they also have greater responsibility to choose wisely.  it is great to hear that the party leadership has chosen to not endorse any particular candidate and allow the membership to make that decision without undue command influence.

why is it important for butler county to represented by one of their own?  should their congressman be from somewhere else, it becomes possible that the area gets split during redistricting and the county could lose a lot.  butler county has always been a strong, mostly conservative turnout.  other areas could try to chip off that support in order to strengthen their own positions.

since i no longer live in butler county, the preceding paragraph really doesn't hold much weight with me as an argument.  what does, is making sure that the eighth congressional district gets the very best representative that it possibly can and in my opinion, that means roger reynolds. 

roger has integrity.  he's intelligent and has the courage to do what needs to be done.  he's a fighter for conservative principles.  he believes government should be small and efficient.  there are maybe five politicians in this whole state whom i would quit my job and go work for if asked, roger is one of them.  he's that good.

butler county republicans, i urge you to unite behind roger reynolds and make congress better.

forkin the road report on boehner, orp, and the tea party





this is a must read.

most interesting tidbit:



when
the tea party first arrived on the scene in 2009, i was given the un-glorious task
of identifying exactly what the tea party was, who they were, what they wanted
and then devising a recommended plan of action on the best way to handle the
new group.  



i
was told, and rightly so, that political leaders in other states and in d.c.
were watching ohio in particular to see how the gop was handling this new
group.  



i
put together a nice report outlining who the group was, what they wanted and
then made recommendations on the best way to handle the tea party.  



many
party leaders, and consequently then members of the media, wanted to
incorrectly label the movement as just born-again members of the john birch
society, or a vast uprising of only social conservatives, or the born-again
version of the know-nothings, or paid puppets of dick armey.  



i
tried to explain that there was no reference point in history that could be
used to define the tea party – it was a unique mix of solidly principled people
that consisted of not just republicans, but democrats and independents as
well.  



my
advice was to make them feel as though they had a seat at the table, make them
feel welcomed and that they had a voice that was not only listened to, but considered
and sometimes acted upon.  



i
advised against the eventual tactic, which was to not only defeat the republican
tea partiers, but utterly destroy any future hopes of political success by absolutely
crushing them in the 2010 primaries.  


the
term used by people on the inside to describe the eventual plan was
‘scorched-earth tactics’

the last sentence was emphasized by me because it is just that important.

read the whole thing to find out what happened next because this guy called it...just as i did.
