“the hour and a half drive was well worth the time. i went to a few other consults and i picked dr. aric eckhardt. i would highly recommend him. my results from my breast lift were better than i ever could have imagined. my only regret is that i waited so long and didn’t have this done 10-15 years ago. i am so happy with my results that i no longer avoid looking in the mirrors while dressing and i am just pretty amazed at what i see.”
