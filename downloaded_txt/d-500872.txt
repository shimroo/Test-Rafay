unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-123 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-123. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 269: "pit recalls the third uprising":"pit? are you okay?""i've...been getting memory fragments of...something that happened a couple years back.""memory...fragments?"pit had a seat at the fountain and invited asriel to join him."you know that the times that i'm not around, sometimes i have to go backhome to my realm and report in to the elder gods, right?""yes.""well...every time i come back here to this realm...i feel...incomplete. like...i've left something behind.""huh?""i can't explain it. but..."what pit was trying to explain was a preventative measure the gods of hisrealm put in place to prevent mortals from learning too much about angelland--as we called it. sometimes these measures were put in place forpit's own good. honestly...we don't know the specifics, but we couldguess that a portion of his memories were sealed away.in truth that was exactly the case. but sometimes things would leak thathe wasn't supposed to know. or things that he was supposed to growinto.a while back, before the emergence of the collossus,during nalaar's final "hail mary play" for world domination, pit'scousin, ambrosia visited, taking with her the lightning chariot--norelation to the thunder chariot cloud-copter machines on mega man'sworld.a vehicle pulled by unicorns of legend, and far fasterand more powerful than anything mortals should be exposed to, ambrosiabrought with her an arsenal from dintos, the god of the forge; where allholy weapons on pit's world were conceived. his greatest of course,were the three sacred treasures, which had only recently been repaired.but by mistake, ambrosia committed a terrible blunder and accidentallyscattered all of the weapon crystals all over our world, and now theylay buried for pit to find. of course i worried they'd find their wayin the wrong hands or innocent hands that didn't know any better."...i feel like i'm...not my complete self when i'm on this world...yet thefact that i can fly...i feel like more than my complete self at the sametime.""you mean like you traded part of yourself for the power of flight?""something like that, asriel."pit had found a couple of them so far; the first blade, the guardianorbitaurs, the palutena bow, the upper dash, the farsight staff, and thewolf claws. with each one he regained a memory of something...thathappened on one of his returns to his home."what can you remember?""bits...and pieces...fragments of a long and winding battle.....like.........like......"pit closed his eyes for a moment...then snapped them open immediately!"...like a third uprising!"  he said, as if he suddenly came to a realization that hadn't been obvious to him before now."there was another war?""there had to have been..." pit pondered. "i remember battling enemies...creatures that i had defeated in the pastbut..they had been revived...twinbellows the hound of tartarus......hewdraw the three-headed sky dragon......pandora, formergoddess of chaos......thanatos the god of death.""maybe they're just memories of the past--""no...there were new enemies as well...the dark lord gaol......the greatreaper...the galactic fiend kraken...cragalanche the almighty...andmore.""oh...""there are...details i can't quite remember...but i know the underworld army was there.""the underworld army? goddess medusa's forces?""the same." pit confirmed."but it sounds like there was more than them involved.""yes...i remember...the forces of nature were against us.""...forces of nature?"  asriel seemed confused by that."palutena is goddess of light and ruler of the sky, right? well, goddess viridiis the goddess of nature; she believes it's her duty to return heavenand earth to their pure states. what...little i remember......shedoesn't like humans much."the truth pit spoke of was greatly understated. unbeknownst to us, viridi attempted theextermination of humans. i don't want to compare her to chara,but...one goal, two different souls."there were others, too. invaders from another realm called the aurum...therewere space pirates...and.....a clash with the chaos realm...and forsome reason i remember fighting pyrrhon the god of the sun.""this...sounds a lot bigger than your other two uprisings.""i...think maybe it was. maybe...that's why i can't remember a lot of it. just names and images...pieces of events."pit didn't realizes it but it wasn't because he couldn't remember. it'sbecause the gods wouldn't let him remember. in their wisdom theydecided this war had to be...for lack of ancientterminology...classified."pit...i didn't want to say anything, but...there have been moments where youwere asleep at the fountain and...you'd wake up with a start and...you'dcheck your wings...like you almost expected them to be gone."or burned off. i'd learned far, far down the road what the gods didn'twant pit or the rest of us to know. an angel without wings was as goodas dead. didn't matter if their wings worked or not. they had to havetheir wings."that's...the thing i'm having the most trouble remembering.""there was this other time when...you were really afraid when miss hestia was cooking eggplant--"pit immediately curled into a little ball and wrapped his wings around himself."...why...are you afraid of them? they can't hurt you........can they?""if it's all the same...i...i'd rather not think about it. it's a memory that crosses into all three uprisings.""oh. well. it's nothing to be ashamed of. miss ivy was afraid of turnipsin her childhood. she told me that one day she pulled out a mandragorafrom the palace garden by mistake."that explained much about ivy's fear. if you knew anything about mandragora's, then myexplanation was moot. all you really needed to know is...you would'tsleep for nights...and it might be a while before your hearing cameback."it runs as deep as that. maybe deeper.""pit, you can talk to me about anything. i'm here for you." asriel's eyes turned green."thank you, my friend. but...right now i just need time. and...maybe i needto find more of the weapon crystals ambrosia lost.""she was...punished harshly, wasn't she?" "there's no description for the pain of being struck by one of zeus'sthunderbolts. if you're a mortal, your life is forfeit. if you're agod or an angel...you'll wish your life was forfeit.""ouch.""ouch is not nearly an adequate exclamation."asriel nodded."hey. why don't we get some angel food cake from mitzi's to cheer you up.she added it to the menu after asking hestia for advice on desserts.""i...think i'd like that." pit unfurled his wings and folded them up behind himself."come on. my treat."  asriel hopped on his hoverboard and flew off. pit followed behind.sub-entry 270: "we can't take violet anywhere...":of all places i should have known not to bring violet around...why, oh why didn't i automatically red-flag a movie set?here we were looking at the aftermath of the suddenly crash of santa claus'sleigh, a rubber-suited godzilla monster (or reasonable facsimile) , anda motorboat with a purple cadillac as the members of a twisted sistertribute band when running for the hills. honestly i was expecting abigger explosion, but what happens in the movies doesn't necessarilyhappen under real circumstances.  you'd think that with that description, antoine tagged along.  not this time.okay, so asriel really wanted to see how movies were made and we had a movie star with connections. yes, i mean woolma lamb.so what wet wrong?let's review.woolma invited us to a backlot that had recently been set up not far fromtown. it seemed that the studio she was signed with was interested inbringing a little bit of tinseltown to fontraile. a lot of people hadgp signs in their eyes, metaphorically speaking, as cliche as thatcartoon gag goes.she was hoping some of us wouldn't mind sitting in on watching her do some re-shoots, since the location of thescene in the script had been changed. oddly enough it actually allowedthem to come in under budget...but i'm the wrong person to talk to aboutmoney."miss lamb you're needed in makeup.""welll, duty calls. don't get too bored waiting for meeee."eesh. female version of mettaton? yeah. i think that's an accurate description.we'd get a good view of how movies were filmed, on the condition we kept itquiet, well-behaved, and didn't do anything to make the director looklike an idiot."this is amazing, volt.""yeah, it is.""i hope it's no bother that i come along, commander.""no bother at all, pit. if anything the one we should be dubious about is violet."i looked over my shoulder at her."what?""you know what, my third in command."  i narrowed my eyes. "i'm bringing a serial larcenist to what may be the biggest score of her life.""aww, don't be that way. besides, marcel has taught me well the golden rule.""i think you don't understand the concept of the golden rule. it's treat others as you want to be treated yourself--""no, i mean the golden rule of thieves. don't be disappointed in a thieffor stealing...be disappointed in thief for getting caught!""goddammit, vi."it was true that in his origins, the orphaned boy, marcel--now adopted sonof verlaine gilneas--got his start in stealing to survive on thestreets; and he got good at his craft. really good.old habits die hard...and let's face it...he refined them to an art. somuch so that one christmas, violet hired him to completely empty out aldente of all of his possessions and sell every last one of them online.not only did he not get caught, but he also got triple what al dentepaid for everything he owned, not counting family heirlooms.most of the time, however, our favorite daemon channeler used his talents tohelp us. when a mission required acquiring things of extreme value andrarity, or even under extreme security measures, he'd find a way towalk away with the goods and not a dust particle of evidence."violet can you for once just sit and behave. is your chronic boredom really that severe?""gots' to keep da' life interesting, for all my ho-mies and bro-mies." i hated it when violet not only butchered her grammar on purposeinsisted on calling us pet names that should probably count asobscenities."you're a real peach, vi."  i folded my ears back.woolma's assistant, in the mean time kept asriel and pit occupied by showingthem the aspects of film-making, the various workers involved, and thevarious tasks that went into it."...is it really okay if we partake from the catering spread?""don't worry about it. i'm sure the two of you won't eat much. just bemindful of anything with a "reserved for" sign on it. some of theactors and actresses are very particular about things.""which is another way of saying "very demanding"."  one of the other assistants retorted. "evertry to index m&m's into separate bowls by color and sorting out themisshapen once and then following a 10-step blueprint for making theworld's most complicated banana split from them?"pit and asriel just looked at each other, kinda not sure what to make of it.and so..."...and the gaffer is in charge of the electrical work and lightning. withfilm-making everything has to have believable light and shadows.""wow. have you ever done gaffer work, volt?""well...it was a long time ago, but..."asriel looked at the camera."it's so big!""yup. she's a beaut'. the latest model, too. nothing but the best for our film."the ring of a bell and the hustle of some of the production crew soon let me know..."looks like they're about to start."we heard the proverbial "places, everyone!"as agreed, we took our seats in the extra chairs provided.the director took his place, picking up his bullhorn."oh wow! is that miss lamb?"woolma's costume was stunning. she could really doll up. no wonder she was atthe height of her career. with looks like that, she had this part inthe bag. but i wonder how her acting skills were?"yes. shh. keep you voice down, they're about to start recording.""oh! sorry!"thusly..."quiet on the set!"the usual film-making cliches were called out. lights. camera. theperson with the clap-board who reminded which scene of the movie wasbeing recorded."and action!"  yup. just like they depicted it. from there we zipped our lips and whatever questions i had about woolma,she absolutely blew us away.unfortunately as we all had to sign the confidentiality waiver, i cannot reproduce the details of this movie or its scenes.that's showbiz.the filming had our full attention.unfortunately, we kept our attention on the wrong director on the wrong set. violethad snuck away to the props and costume buildings on the back lot aswell as some of the other sets to "five-finger discount" things for hercollection.she often joked that she was the reason thatman of steel's superman costume was without its red underwear. i oftenwonder how true that was on our world. with so many things about earthprime--so many people, places, and events somehow coinciding with ourown history--i wouldn't be surprised.it was a major annoyance for me and the rest of uciat. and yet we still let it slide.i think the point where the straw breaks the camel's back would be ifshe ever decided to raid dead celebrities' wares. especially ones thatwere in museums or on display in places like graceland. she dared to bestupid but i knew she wouldn't dare to be that stupid."...and cut! that's a take. print it!"heh. cliche but effective.asriel didn't waste a moment to hug our little starlet. she didn't mind."oh, you're too kind. too kind." woolma seemed flattered by it."i have not seen such amazing feats of theater since the muses of olympulopolis."some day i'd have to check out pit's world in depth and not just cursoraryanalysis. maybe i could get assigned to it to get a historical accountof the three uprisings of his world. maybe see pit at his best.as the crew began to wrap up, i honestly though our day would end there with no surprises--"somebody stop her!!!"asriel, pit, and i all looked at each other."violet."  we all said in unison.woolma grabbed her personalized bathrobe and shower sandals and covered up,once the costume and makeup artists had gotten her cleaned up. shefollowed us outside and sure enough we saw violet go by on a bicycle.okay.  so she got caught this time. what did she-- ...wait a minute.you've got to be kidding me. of all things...that bicycle?i immediately facepalmed."isn't that the bike from the movie about the guy in the gray suit and bowtie--""i wish it weren't..."we all gave chase but stayed outside the buildings. and in no short orderviolet managed to drive through way more movie sets than i thought itwere possible for her to crash. and in no short order...violet managed to out maneuver security and drop and oil slick behind what wastrailing behind her--a motorboat and santa's sleigh and both carryingtwo very startled passengers still in costume.i don't know what stung worse. the fact that she was sloppy or........or.......ohcrap...this wasn't her being sloppy. this were her reenacting a scene.she did this on purpose!okay. i had two options. break out the checkbook and pay for the damages...and i'm pretty sure icouldn't afford even a fraction of them. or option 2..."asriel. what i'm about to do, i'm not proud of..."inevitably someone would come charging through and demand to know about violet.of course i said the first thing that came to mind:"i do not know that person. we're just bystanders. we saw the same thingas everybody else. whoever she is, she should be ashamed of herself."you're on your own, vi.cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-122 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-122. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 267: "the life cycle of the stars":for the longest time, he's been in meditation. bunnie seems concerned. even asriel seems worried.it had fallen into the night hour and the stars were in the sky."how...long has he been like this, sensei?""it has been...a while."  bunnie seemed hesitant to give an accurate measurement."do...you know why...?"bunnie shook her head.master splinter continued his session."so...you never really talked about it.""i am...not feeling up to it, asriel-san. it...just doesn't feel like an appropriate time to talk about our past. how we met. how long i trained under him. not because it's tragic or shameful or anything. it's more a matter...that splinter-sensei does not need additional distractions.""i feel like...i know this strange feeling.""asriel?""it's...the same vibe i had when...chara was..."asriel paused then looked really worried."sensei...you don't suppose he's--""no. it is not his time. but..."splinter opened his eyes and raised his head, looking up at the sky. at that moment a shooting star crossed across the night sky.bunnie's expression softened. like...she understood something."oh! a shooting star.""that is no star, my young friend. that is a lost soul who has completed his journey." splinter's voice broke the silence. these words struck a familiar chord. i had heard them before."journey?""sensei."  bunnie looked to the ninja master."one has become all. and all has become one. he can now leave a final task to the ones who are mourning the most."splinter's words echoed both of izumi's words or rather her students, having completed their month of survival to become students of alchemy...and of a native american medicine man the night that spike spiegel and vicious had their final duel; a drop of the sword and the fall of its wielder would gave way to the victor going out with a...bang."i understand."i watched by the doorway.asriel had difficulty understanding the metaphors but he had a feeling."who...was he?"splinter hesitated. "a noble soul who met his end at the hands of an horrible, honor-less beast. a beast who abandoned what little humanity he had left for vengeance.""oh my..."  asriel looked a little crestfallen.that look in splinter's eyes. i knew he wasn't telling the whole story. i felt like bunnie had picked up on it.splinter bowed his head and i heard him mutter quietly in jang-ese.bunnie closed her eyes.as an immortal, the concept of death was like a forgotten memory within. yet, my continuing existence never let me forget it. as long as i went on, i'd eventually see those around me finish their journey. those around me would one by one leave as new people filled the void, while i went on.i could not help but compare life itself to the oroboros of mythology, legends, and fables. a serpent eating its own tail to continue its life but ultimately reaching the end of its existence.splinter finished his session and stood up, picking up his walking stick and resting upon it, overlapping both of his hands over top of it in a...waiting position. he looked off to the heavens."hmm."i hadn't noticed it before, but i could swear there was a new star in the heavens. it was faint. as i studied it, i noticed the surrounding patterns seemed to connect in a new constellation. it was uncanny...but it looked like a much taller, much different version of...! i couldn't help but compare the image i came up with in my mind with the anthropomorphic rat in the magenta kimono and foot wrappings. a world of difference...but...it was like the same soul...in stereo."bunnie-sensei?""yes, asriel?""in school they taught us that...the light of the twinkling stars above may...have actually taken millions if not billions of years to reach us. the stars themselves have likely died out long ago."yes. that is an unfortunate fact of science. of the cosmos."i reflected on that for a moment. the sadness of a monster...or former monster, realizing that the stars they once sought to wish upon were long gone even before there even was a barrier to seal them underground. before there was even a war.asriel was quiet for a moment. then he walked over to splinter and stood beside him."grand master?""yes, young one?""i'd...like to hug you. if that is okay? you...look like you need one. so...may i?"splinter closed his eyes for a few moments, the semblance of a tear forming."i believe you are correct, asriel-san.  please do."with splinter's short height, he didn't really need to kneel or bend down to accept the embrace.asriel sniffled a little."do not grieve, young one. that soul has elevated to a higher plane of existence. they are one with life itself. they are at peace.""i...can't help but feel sad for someone i don't even know.""it is...good you feel this way. you have...proven exactly what i sensed in you that day we first met.""i'm...glad i wasn't a disappointment."splinter smiled briefly."you had so many doubts. even now some remain. but do not despair. you have grown so much in heart...in mind...in soul. asriel-san. your story has only begun.""but...what about...""worry not about my story. it will end when it is time. no sooner, no later. bunnie-chan is correct. i still have many more years left in me and much wisdom yet to impart. student of my student...you shall know me for all of your life even if i will not be with you for all of your own journey.""thank you for your words.""i believe our conversation has done us both good." asriel and splinter exchanged bows before asriel headed out of the garden and headed home.bunnie and i entered the main dojo."the one who passed on.""you understand, do you not? i sensed grand master splinter's aura. it has grown...stronger."i sighed."bunnie. i am...familiar with a theory. a dimensional theory and...while, it's not the most reliable source, the best way to explain it is with one of violet's stupid action movies. do you remember that one from a previous movie night...before we even met the vars girls?"bunnie grimmaced but for a moment, enduring the fact that violet wasn't a good point of reference for wisdom.  then she nodded, knowing full well what i was getting at."i know the one. the main protagonist becomes the target of his own alternate universe self. by ending the lives of other versions of himself the difference in their life force energies is divided up among the survivors until there is only one left with the power of a god...that he might become the one.""sounds like a ripoff of the highlander movie series and tv series, i know. but...the concept is there. i haven't found the existing dimension that corresponds to that movie, yet but as you can tell, it wasn't unrelated to what's happened in...one of the other universes in our space-time continuum."a pause."so...does splinter know it was--""he does."i paced, remembering the prime universe and the au's that also had their own master splinter."will he be okay?""yes. i will be okay as well."  bunnie looked outside the doorway at the sky. moments later, i could swear that a curious red star in the night sky was no longer there. confused, i looked to bunnie.she looked...relieved.it was about that time that splinter entered the dojo. he too, looked relieved."邪悪な人は倒れていますか?"  bunnie asked."悪いことはもはやありません。" splinter nodded."死は私達にすべて来る。" bunnie looked on at the spot in the night sky where the red star had vanished."邪悪な人が死んだとき、彼ははるかに悪い運命に苦しんだ。"  splinter narrowed his eyes.bunnie crossed her arms and nodded."彼の死は... ...名誉なし。"while i didn't understand their words, i could almost sense the context. i'd seen this equilibrium before. the end of bitter and hated rivals...the end of complete opposites...when absolute good and absolute evil came to an end, the balance of a world, a galaxy, or an entire universe was restored...for a time. i wonder which au it was? i couldn't prove it, but i was sure it happened outside of the ultraverse. maybe not in a prime universe, but it was definitely close to one.i had one last look at splinter. how did you cope with the knowledge that you...or rather another universe's version of you was no more?i left teacher and student to their privacy and headed off.asriel and i would be somber for a bit, knowing that there was one less hamato yoshi in the space time continuum.but...i could rest easy that there was now one less oroku saki.i didn't quite understand how that spirtual/psychic connection to other versions of yourself worked, but splinter was obviously in tune with them. the council got pretty dubious over the times i'd let alternate versions of other people i'd met in my lifetime meet; the major with her mobius counterpart and my terrain master with hers, just to name an example.this connection between parallel souls made me wonder if some day asriel would be in tune with au versions of his other selves. maybe that's why some of his...coincidences seemed to channel what little i knew about them.whatever the case, we'd need some time to move on.oddly enough, it wouldn't be the only incident involving rodents that asriel and i would encounter.sub-entry 268: "the return of danger mouse":i was working in the lab, late when night, when my eyes beheld......wait a minute. wrong holiday season. silly me.ahem.all kidding aside, i was actually in the lab but i was having trouble concentrating.from down the hall i could hear violet in her sub-lab, blaring the sounds of "the brides of funkenstein". somehow she proccured a tape of lydia deetz and her school mates, with special appearance by beetlejuice...sorry, i mean "betty juice" (ugh.) of them "getting dangerous".i just knew dropping that phrase was all but inviting the appearance of st. canard's own "terror that flaps in the night. yup. the winged scourge who pecks at your nightmares.  the tax man who comes to audit your property.  you know who i mean...and if you don't, then yeah...it's darkwing duck.moving on from that tangent, it would actually not be drake mallard's alter ego that would be interrupting me that day and actually...not violet or her shenanigans, for once.nope.it turns out that little sister tended to have more friends than even i knew about. from violet's much older lab mischief, some things had gone unaccounted for, including off-worlders that we never fully accounted for. some of them ended up making their home right here on our planet. some even in our city. and yes...even some took of residence in the lab, such as the littles.i didn't object at all when she befriended the littles.i was a little overprotective when she hung out with a trio of mouse motorcyclists with...weird antenna that came from really off world. but it was harmless in the end. it's not like one of them was...dating her...and of course hanging out with penny and brain when they'd venture out from metro city.and while i was supportive of her helping a police detective in his efforts to take down a crime organization headed by a guy with a thing for metal gauntlet on his right hand and a black cat with a distinctive laugh, i was not prepared to find out she had been going on missions with a british spy and his hamster companion who made their headquarters inside a pillarbox...or...whatever the english called them.i think i became aware however when i got buzz-bombed by..."what the--!!!" ...yeah. by a miniature. yellow, flying spy car with a two mice--one of them i recognized as my miniaturized sister, the other the white wonder himself, the "world's greatest secret agent", danger mouse--a spy who's so secret even his codename has a codename.as i said, white in fur color, wearing an eye patch over his left eye, white body suit that came up into a turtle neck which made it blend together with his fur, a red belt with a yellow buckle, and a logo--red circle with the initials d.m. displayed prominantly on his chest. yeah...not exactly subtle attire but i guess if you're that good.skilled in kung moggy (was...that even a real martial art?) and versed in 34 languages--some which he claimed were extra-terrestrial, a mouse of action and sharp-witted at that.but also crammed into the flying...ummm...danger mobile...?...was a brown furred hamster in a blue suit, yellow-and-black striped necktie, and oversized glasses who seemed to be cowering worse than jon or antoine."little sister! careful!""sorry, big brother!"that was of course followed up by cries from said hamster answering to the name of penfold."oh crumbs! oh carrots! oh heck! oh fiddle!"i still wonder why he was given the code name "the jigsaw". he had no skills, no grace, and no backbone. and he was always misunderstanding conversations and mistaking things for jokes."unless colonel k ordered you to disrupt laboratory operations, or unless baron sylus greenback suddenly invaded our world, could i respectfully ask you to take it outside?""apologies, old chap.""gadget, i don't mind that you hang out with strange and interesting characters but you really need to get them up to speed with things on this world.""oops! my mistake dear brother!"i put a stopper in the test tube and put the whole rack on the shelf before heading back over as the danger mobile's wings pulled into the main body and the car screeched to a stop. the mice exited the car. the hamster...more or less fell out of the car."be with you in just a moment, volt!" gadget adjusted her reduction belt, bringing both herself and danger mouse up to human size."hmm. quite a mechanization. you might have a future in on operation some day.""golly! you really think so?""d.m.! wait for me!" "oh bother. it seems we forgot to molecular-ly enlarge penfold.""this does seem to be a bit of a small problem, doesn't it?" gadget joked."quite so."a bit of exposure to gadget's reduction belt beam and penfold was enlarged."do be a chap and pick yourself off of the floor. it's very unbecoming of an agent.""right, chief."  penfold righted himself and adjusted his glasses.a knock at the door."hmm?"sure enough it was asriel."hi, volt. are you busy?""not...really but--""oh! i didn't realize you had guests. sorry to intrude then.""no worries.""yeah! come join us, azzy!""okay."asriel entered the room."asriel, this is danger mouse. a friend of mine. he's kind of an off-worlder.""london's best at your service.""you talk like mr. jon. oh! are you like a spy? like in those movies mr. bond is in?""well. observant little bloke aren't you?""he's totally a secret agent.""but if we know about it, then is it not a secret anymore?""penfold, shush."i rolled my eyes. even for an unintended joke that was lame. it didn't even get a laugh out of asriel or gadget."uh...right.""anyway. what does bring you to our neck of the woods?" i asked."general maintenance on the danger mobile. gadget offered to give the old girl a proper tuning and revisions."d.m. looked upon the still-miniaturized form of the danger mobile."maybe touch of the paint job and upgrade the bullet-proof glass. trick out the usual bevy of spy gadgets. oh! and is the vehicle bay fully stocked? we'll need to make sure d.m. has plenty of juice to get back to the other side of the world.""oh! that's no problem. i brought plenty with us. what kind did you need? orange, grapefruit or pomagranate?""...no, penfold. no. not that kind of juice."  danger mouse face palmed.asriel stifled a giggle."i can also substitute grape if you like.""penfold. shush."  i replied."much obliged."  d.m. replied."well, no objections. gadget, you know where the vehicle bay is. clean up after yourself when you're done.""okay, brother!""can i watch!""very well. but i have to ask you to swear to secrecy. this vehicle is top secret and we can't have its inner-workings leaked to outside sources.""right. like the time baron greenback snuck a control device aboard and took you on a wild ride."  gadget spoke up."right. not exactly smashing times.""except for the part where the danger mobile smashed into the ground. tee-hee. tee-hee-hee-hee.""penfold..."  d.m. started."yes?""shush!"  the rest of us all said in unison.cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-121 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-121. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 265: "jon's guilty pleasures":it was no secret that jon was our own big, fuzzy pushover. i imagine he had more in common with fluffybuns than i'd like to admit. i don't know how big asgore's appetite was, but one thing i was sure of was that the two of them had reputations for being softies.what jon did keep secret was could be the most blatent examples of him being a man-child; the kid that never grew up. while i compared him to vash the stampede and kenshin "the batousai", it wasn't outlandish to compare him to dr. raymond stantz."i won't be long, dear." elektra headed out, to leave jon to the house all alone.that was when jon talbain decided to let his embarrassing guilty pleasures out of the closet.in this case...literally.buried behind a secret panel he installed in his closet, he found the object of his interest."time to get cooking."jon opened the box to reveal one of those ez-bake oven sets. yeah. his big embarrassing secret was playing with a girl's toy to make cupcakes and other sweets.elektra leaned her back up against the front door and giggled a little. jon wasn't that good at keeping secrets...especially from his own wife.  but we let him think he was.a moment later and she was on her way.jon of course spent a few hours making, decorating, and of course...eating his confectionery delights. he had been practicing for maybe a few years; replacing the light bulb and the ingredients in secret.supposedly when he bought the device, he nodded and lied out his furry tush when the cashier commented that his daughter would be very happy.jon and elektra had been married for a while but they did not yet have kids. i'm pretty sure anyone reading this embarrassing tale has already figured that out.no slight against my son-in-law, mind you. honestly, he's pretty brave for ignoring age limits and gender biases. but if he were ever caught, even in this day an age, he'd never here the end of it. kind of a strange contrast for a guy who bench pressed 900 lbs. at the gym, easily."happy times." he smiled and proceeded to clean up the accessories and his cooking mess and get it all packed up and hidden again.of course this was only one of his guilty pleasures. those times when elektra was on call during the entire night shift, jon would dig out one of his stuffed animals and make sure he had a companion after he plugged in the night light for a good night's sleep."let's keep this our little secret."and of course there were those days alone when he'd put on a pink bathroom, get the biggest glass of chocolate milk (with a curly straw) and cuddle up in front of the tv and watch the likes of the care bears, my little pony, or even mew mew kissy cutie on dvd.and of course, still, for those restless nights he'd read himself a bed-time story.not wanting to make a big deal of it, i sneaked him a copy of peek-a-boo with fluffy bunny into his library that i had managed to procure from one one of the unstable timelines that hadn't completely formed.  i made sure he'd notice it when he went to select a story book.  it became an instant favorite of his, since."the ending always gets me..."deja vu...i didn't feel sorry for jon. in fact i felt protective of him. which is why it annoyed me that jon annoyed chameleon and a couple others like david the fareskel. he was our muscle-bound cinnamon roll. and most of us were fine with that. which is why even violet didn't let on that she knew his "dirty little secrets". heh. if anything his secrets these days were the cleanest out of all of us. especially violet.i respected jon. he was kind to everyone. but he was also afraid of his past catching up with him. what little i knew about it seemed to imply it was a darker past than even, if you'll pardon the pun, the skeletons in sans' closet.jonathan lawrence talbain, our gentle giant."i can't help it. i just have to be me. the me i want to be. not the me that i used to be."  i'd heard him say it before.what pain did he hide? how badly...how deeply did it cut for him to try so hard to be this marshmallow?  how did it lead to him coming to the decision that if he was going to abandon his old life he was going to abandon it in the way most opposite to everything he'd ever seen?i had my theories.  there were rumors that when his lycanthropy began, he ran away from home and spent a good amount of his life without guidance.  while the likelihood was that it began in his teens...i wasn't about to rule out that his first transformation happened as a child.  and if he'd been on his own that long, then maybe it wasn't outlandish that he never really grown up.  maybe he was more like son goku than i wanted to admit.there was one time i could hear him on the other side of the wall, when no one else was around.he was crying about the same as asriel...and maybe just as scared.i couldn't make out any words if he actually said anything. all i really needed to know was that his past was too much to bear and that he just needed his space.i guess perhaps the only real thing of note was how often he'd take frequent naps on his favorite bench in the park after a hard day's work. this definitely felt closer to sans, by comparison. but i guess having a reputation for eating, sleeping, and heavy-lifting wasn't the worst thing in the world.lately, i've been noticing asriel taking a moment to tend to him while he slept; bringing him a comfy blanket from rabbotou dojo or just petting him on the head and scratching behind his ears."mmnn...."  jon had this happy whine that just made it easy to feel happy for him. like a big puppy dog at heart. this was one of the times i could waive his tendencies to embarrass our species."sleep well, mr. jon." asriel whispered. then he gave him a little boop on the snoot. that made jon wag his tail.i could only watch from a distance and smile.moments like these reminded me that we were lucky to have him. and he was lucky to have us. violet chose well when she recommended him the day my uciat team was commissioned in neo arcadia city. i was so glad he chose elektra and she chose him.asriel quietly tip-toed back to me and we left jon to get his shut-eye.guilty pleasures in his own mind, maybe. but as long as we were around, we'd never let on and we'd never make light of them.  woe be to any one who dared to do so.  it was this sentiment which i had in common with sans.  it was the thing about him i understood the most.  i hoped that some day this would be common ground between us should our worlds ever completely cross over.sub-entry 266: "mitzi day (that's a lot of green)":mitzi day. that's what we decided to call it. truth be told mitzi didnt expect a holiday named in her honor. much less one that resulted from a yearly set of coincidences. so let's break it down, shall we?for as long as i held my position as uciat's commander in the old days, i could remember i'd have a...mishap in the non-toxic chemical lab. i figured that this much of an absence would finally break the curse. well. shows what i know.i'll spare you the details and give you the end result. i'd always end up walking out of the lab with my clothes completely dyed shades of green. fortunately the stuff didn't affect my flesh, fur, hair, or anything on my body. but it took to clothing of any kind like a moth to flame."i'm forever chained to this "curse"."  i exited the lab, my ego deflated a few sizes.now this happening once was one thing. you'd think i'd learn from my mistake. but when it happened year after year after year...you stopped believing in coincidences and start wondering if you should listen to rotor's secret interest in conspiracy theories. (yeah, the normal-est guy in town collected more conspiracy theories than mel gibson in the movie of the same title. go figure.)"well if the not-quite-a-curse happens like it does every year, i can expect--"*bamf*and there was bunnie. but not with her usual pink smokecloud. it was bright green. and her karate attire, one-piece swimsuit undergarment, headband, and sandals were all shades of emerald, jade, and green."major--""laundry day."simple enough explanation. bunnie's outfits were all in the wash save for a lone green set.okay two people dressed completely in green was a cute case of simultaneity. yet..."what's the sitches my b--""gonna stop you there. you've worn that one out. get a new greeting, vi.  or pay into asriel's swear jar."what she hadn't worn out was that one obnoxious kimono and sandals she made out of what i called "c.r.t." fabric and nano-phosphor-luminous transistor array polymer. basically nano-fiber-optics interwoven into a high definition matrix that display still images and full video like a "wearable computer". and what image did she choose to display? the green, raining computer code from the matrix movies.i think the general consensus around town was...this outfit was an eyesore."violet, why haven't you destroyed that obnoxious attire?""hey, if you don't have the passion for fashion and bring the bling to spring, you're gonna be the pariah of the party.""oh gods...""i put the vi in viridian, yo!""i thought you put the vi in virus.""i multitask, commander.""ex-commander. does no one get that? i swear if miles spends another day out on the frontlines, people are going to forget i even passed the torch to him."three people, now. weirded out, yet? wait...wasn't someone else supposed to--"team acorn, represent!"three green light contrails, followed by a very green trio of spinouts, ended with three victory poses.suddenly sally. and willie. and honey."let me guess. nikita servicing your tengu suits so you all three have to use the prototypes as spare clothes?""you got it!"  speaking in unison was somehow less odd than the fact they were all three dressed head to sandals in green.oh boy. six people who all happened to be wearing green. tell me you don't find this a little creepy as far as coincidences go.lupe showed up, her outfit a little greener than its usual color."oh! is it that time again?""okay, my faithful eco-science warrior druid. what's your story?""on a whim i decided to try something and i was able to succeed at making a copy of my outfit, completely out of grass, vines, and leaves and some mana usage.""trying to be eve, huh, lupe. maybe we should find you an adam.""violet!"  lupe protested, turning pink in the cheeks.a few more uciat members showed up, each with a story of coincidence. but we had to draw the line at antoine's appearance because his greener was a bit...disgusting. yeah, not going to say what happened or what was involved. nope. not gonna do it. not gonna do it.so i guess it was topped off when asriel was next to show up.but what surprised me wasn't that he, too, was wearing green...it was..."asriel? isn't...that your old sweater? from...from when you first...?""i had the strangest feeling of...nostalgia this morning. so i put it on for old time's sake."i knew the moment asriel learned the word "nostalgia", i'd have continuing feelings of dread...because i knew that violet would be constantly tweaking the definition in her usual ways."nice."  was all that i could say."hey...why is everyone wearing green?"we all looked at each other.that was when it all came to a head with the guest of honor, in the company of foxy "colleen" flannigan.""hi, guys! what's up?""you, too, mitzi? so what reason do you have for going green today?"mitzi blinked."reason? this is what i always wear."  she shrugged. then she realized. "ohhh! it's that day again!"  she said with a smile."land o' goshen! i love this day. it reminds me of me' own home country.""i guess uh...happy mitzi day, everyone?" i finally conceded."you didn't tell me you had a holiday in your honor, miss mitzi!""it's...not an official holiday. but it's still flattering that you named it after me. i mean, i would have been fine with calling it green day."violet chortled a bit."what?""oh...nothing.""violet...really? a music reference that obvious?""don't wanna be a neo arcadian idiot--"  she started to sing."a little late for that."violet stuck her tongue out.okay, so i'll say it if it isn't inherently obvious. march 17th. if the date rings a bell, then yeah. our mitzi day came into existence, somehow, as the counterpart to earth prime's own st. patrick's day. while there was a lot of green, i certainly discouraged any inappropriate drinking (that went double for violet). and i certainly didn't want to hear violet talking about leprechaun maiming.  yes.  you read that correctly.but what i did allow was for foxy to treat us to a day of celtic song and dance, mitzi treating us to some green-colored and naturally-green foods. green milk and lime-ade. granny smith apples, various foods with green food coloring. desserts and the like with green icing and sprinkles. yeah. i guess it was a little embarassing to admit that i secretely considered green a favorite color, despite my affinity toward gold and silver."more green pizza coming up!"you haven't lived until you've eaten a pizza with green sauce, green-colored cheese, and green crust and washed it down with green soda. honestly...sometimes i wonder where violet was able to find a source of surge soda?"i'm having a wonderful time, mitzi!""i think we're all having a wonderful time, asriel!"so many holidays. so little time."come on, mitzi! it's you're turn for karaoke!"  gadget handed her the microphone, wearing green coveralls of her own. in her own words: "i'm wearing green, because everyone else was already doing it!"so cute.by the end of day...i think we all had more than our fill of green.at least until next year...cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-120 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-120. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 263: "frisk": it was time to go for broke. i returned to the capital. i searched...and i searched. still no one from as far as new home to the judgement hall was concerned.yeah. pretty anticlimactic. reeeeeal descriptive, too.what can i say? i struck out. frisk was avoiding ending their journey. i didn't want to believe it but it seemed they just wanted to live here.i couldn't figure it out. how? how did they avoid me? where were they hiding?this was my fault, wasn't it?i sighed and headed, winding my way to hotland.i again dropped by napstablook's. to my suprise the door to hapstablook's house had been unlocked. had mettaton stopped by here?not wanting to intrude, i decided to talk to napstablook first."hey. it's me again. i apologize for bothering you.""oh....it's....no trouble..."  admittedly it was the happiest i'd seen him look."got another cd for you. how's the stereo system? my friends built it to specifications that a ghost would be able to operate. and we made it so the box could be opened by a ghost and not just someone physical matter, so...""it was...a wonderful present......thank you..."i loaded up the disc and let it play, agreeing to have another session of laying on the floor and feeling like trash. this tim i was the one who needed cheering up.as we lay there and spaced out, i let my mind wander.  maybe it was just my imagination but everything seemed to fade away into a wavy, surreal outer space-y void; stars and heavenly bodies all around.  maybe i was just imagining it, but i was certain napstablook, his refrigerator, computer (and computer desk), a spider web, and three cd cases had come aong for the ride."i have to be honest. i'm a little frustrated. i haven't seen the human child in so long. i'm worried about them.""i...see.......""you haven't by any chance run into them, have you?""it was...a while ago, but...i think i last saw them...taking a ride with the river person."wait. was that how frisk was avoiding me? during my long runs where i didn't shortcut between lands, that would be the quickest way of evading me and anyone else. but how did they get past the guards in hotland and skip past me around the elevator to the true lab and such?was it possible the micro-glitches were disrupting space? now there's a scary thought. frisk using teleports similar to sans.the river person owed me some explanations if they were the main method for frisk to get around.i considered other places in the underground that hadn't been checked. san's room. the skeleton brothers' shed. that locked door in snowdin.i'd even considered that spot in hotland that i'd run into that guy. i don't have to tell you...that was an encounter that made me sorry. one might say...so sorry... as nice as the guy was about it, i wasn't about to repeat it in this unstable timeline, having endured it enough times in the stable timelines.i still hadn't found hide nor...uh...marrow of w.d. gaster. that was something i should have been considering.a bit later, i bid fairwell to napstablook and trudged to the river person and decided to have a...heart to heart (heartless?) with them. honestly, i wasn't even sure they had a soul.funny that i should be thinking of gaster at the time. i was soon in for an encounter i wasn't prepared for. i'd heard the rumors of it in other stable timelines. but seeing him before my eyes and hearing him for myself just sent chills down my spine.i remember coming to the spot close to where undyne had originally started throwing her spears, taking a moment to open my umbrella before i decided to search the rainy area next."have you ever thought about a world where everything is exactly the same... except you don't exist?"i about jumped out of my sandals...and my lab coat, too."everything functions perfectly without you... ha, ha... the thought terrifies me."i looked upon the form of a completely grey-scale figure that greatly resembled monster kid. there were eyes...but...there were no irises...no pupils. i couldn't tell if was the micro-glitches getting the way or if their shirt was actually checkerboard instead of striped.i wasn't sure if i was looking at head fins, spikes like monster kid...or what could be a hairbow. could this...person be female? like...a sister? for some reason when i pondered this, it felt like a theory that wasn't mine but...someone else's in the space-time continuum. what was i channeling now? other people's theories?he...she......it?.......they looked upon my umbrella. at least i think they were looking at it."an umbrella...? but it's not raining. ha, ha... you know, that does make me feel a little better about this. thank you.""wait. who are you?""please forget about me. please don't think about this anymore."i blinked only once and saw what i thought was the shape melting into the form of what...resembled w.d. gaster for a brief moment. but by the next blink of the eyes...no one. i was alone again."what the hell is going on?" i watched as nearby micro-glitches collapsed upon themselves and all was right with the world again. or at least as right as this world got.i kept trudging through waterfall until i was able to catch a ride with the river person.i'd recorded a lot of their comments. i quickly learned each one was proceeded by "tra la la." a sing-songy way segue if ever there was one.ones that i didn't think deeply into included:"the waters are wild today. that is good/bad luck."and..."eat a mushroom every day. why? then i know you're listening to me."and still..."what's my name?... it really doesn't matter..."that one always made me dread the thought of violet coming along and making a reference to......wait a minute....i thought back to the ruins. wasn't there a rock named dwayne...?oh gods. violet's influence leaked into this world even before i knew this world existed. did it even matter what i think?now i really wanted to shine something up and stick it directly up violet's candy a--"tra la la...beware the man who speaks in hands."two gaster moments in the same day.the river person had spoken another variation of this before...but in that case i overheard it rather than being told it directly."beware of the man who came from another world."did they mean gaster? did they mean so sorry? or...did they mean...me?i climbed aboard...and i know my eyes weren't playing tricks on me, but i was sure the boat changed into a dog...or cat-like form. i couldn't be sure which. but it literally ran across the water instead of floated.so. that was a thing. go figure."i know you're not usually one for conversation but--""tra la la. the angel is coming.""..."okay. that was cryptic. did that mean the return of asriel dreemurr? or did they mean frisk? two theories that conflicted with me. i knew it couldn't be chara. she was out of the picture."do...you know anything about the human child? like...where they're at?""tra la la... the past has met the present but the present will decide the future. already the past is gone."that was a response i'd never heard before. there was an awareness here that i didn't realize before. how aware were they? sans level? flowey level? but she was right. frisk met chara--the past. the past was now gone. frisk had the power to shape the future.river person knew my dilema.on a different note, i was relieved that my role in the grand scheme hadn't spread. i didn't need fame around here. especially fame beyond my control. if i became a celebrity among all the monsters, how long before questions would be asked? ones that i couldn't comment on...this whole thing had gotten complicated...or maybe it just seemed that way to me, due to my tendency to overthink things.i decided to head back to snowdin. i had run out of ideas and i wasn't ready to talk to asgore.well. i hate to lose determination on this one, but logically, the kid has me beat. they may very well have the same kind of anomaly that the stc-council considered mobius' own blue hedgehog; not subject to the same destiny-on-rails as everyone else. yeah. the power of choice.the power to completely rewrite their destiny or fate rather than be bound to it like most everyone was. beings like this were fascinating to lady destiny. however...beings like this really pissed madam fate off. wouldn't you be a little steamed if one of your puppets cut their own strings?  or never had any to begin with?well. maybe it was time to check on toriel one last--"..."well. i guess i hadn't struck out after all."frisk."they looked at me with that look...the expression that said they were uneasy that i was the only one who addressed them by name rather than "my child", "human", "punk", or "little buddy".i sighed."i won't ask why. it is your choice but...you know things will stagnate. doing nothing maybe cause just as muchharm as going onward. being judge. facing him..."frisk dropped their head a little with a quiet moan.darn it...why wouldn't you talk...say something. at your age you should be able to speak.when i first met them, i mistakenly thought they were blind but...that was debunked. at least this version of them. in the prime universe and other au's...that was a different story."i'm sorry...i came on a little strong."  i looked off to the side.i thought a bit then spoke."we both know, don't we? we both know what it's like. we've...come to a strange place...a strange world. many, many times over in fact.the two of us are kindred spirits. we've encountered. we've befriended. we've battle. we've shown mercy. we've made things worse at times...and made things better with others.the power of time. we've both used it out of curiosity. we've both used it for selfish reasons. we've made a mess of the timelines but...we've also both...tried our best to fix things."i looked on."everything that is as it is now is our doing. we're responsible. our choices have...reshaped pre-ordained events that have multiple destinies...or fates.the power of time travel......save/load.....reset... it's one of the worst powers to have once you realize what it does...who it affects. all we can do now is...try one more time and hope our choices are the right ones.there's no undo option, not even for people like us. i don't know about you...but if the part i play in this gets the timeline to a better state...a more stable state, then i'm okay with leaving well enough alone and letting destiny and fate take their course. hopefully by then...all will be right. every piece will be back where it belongs. and everyone can have their happy ending, once and for all."frisk didn't answer...but there was something in the blank look of a gender-unknown child that seemed to acknowledge that i had made things a little easier for them.at that point i knew what they were thinking about."you know she's not around to force your decision or influence it. what you do here from here on out is your call. by the same note whatever happens is on you."frisk hesitated and nodded."i know you're carrying the items. but to what end...i don't quite know. i guess only you know for sure. i'm guessing the...other times didn't work out as well as you hoped. i can't image what caused you to reset--"frisk kinda turned away. i think acknowledging the reset was a risk i hadn't considered. this was probably the closest i was going to get to proof that they...remembered. they remembered everything."sorry. i'll...i'll drop it. i don't want to make you uncomfortable."i had a nagging suspicion there was something on frisk's mind. i mean i had my hands full, trying to figure out how kommand and i were going to stay one step ahead of a certain headache i had been dealing with since he turned traitor. if only the council had listened to me; to my reasons why i couldn't recommend him to open the pandora's box and genie's lamp........no. don't think about that now. you're getting distracted and you're punishing yourself.this is now.guide them."frisk. i'm not going to tell you what to do. only you can decide that. but uh...you know how to finish this adventure and finish it perfectly. the best possible way to give everyone their happy ending."i wanted to make them promise not to reset anymore. but...i had not right to ask that.i wonder if frisk resetting those true happy endings was because they were still trying to save one more person. maybe they thought it was still possible to get an even better ending. yet it still didn't explain the randomness. why genocide in one timeline...then pacifist in the next? why wasn't there consistency? why didn't it start genocide then slowly go through neutrals into pacifist? or vice versa? was it the timeline's instability? was it something i wasn't seeing?i had a seat with frisk in front of toriel's gates and just...stayed silent for a while. seriously. i tried to speak...but i couldn't think of anything to say. how familiar. and they refused to speak. maybe there was a reason they didn't.after a while i was at a loss. so i just patted frisk gently on the head and looked off into the distance.at first nothing came of this. but then frisk wrapped their armss around me and hugged...and cried silently. not even a whimper or a sad moan.this continued or a while before it got late. and we went our separate ways. i didn't think anything had been resolved. but...at least i had accomplished my goal. or half of it. i guess i'd come back again and see how this played out. i recalled the deloreon, jumped, and climbed aboard as it hovered way above the trees.at the very least, we shared each other's pain. there was nothing selfish about that."i hope this wasn't a waste of time. and i really hope something came of this..."with that, i was gone; back to miranda city.sub-entry 264: "one year later...":it was official. one year to the day (or night). asriel had been here twelve months. twelve. where did that time go? it didn't seem possible. reflecting on the past was only natural at this point.but it was asriel who would be searching for me. as if by...some echo...he traced my steps when i thought about this, 164 mission log sub-entries ago. which of course lead him back to the fountain.i knew he was watching as i stared up into the sky. it was already nightfall and quickly turning to night time. the lights in the town were starting to come on.i took a deep breath, crouched down and made the greatest jump i could handle. i went up...and up...and up. when i was at the peak of my jump, i let my electrical powers take over and carry me up further.asriel watched in silence. he knew what was on my mind.i slowed before reaching my limit, reaching out to the sky as if i expected something to be there...but there was nothing.i sighed in what felt slow motion as gravity began to take hold. i used my electric and magnetic powers to help me flip and soar back down to earth below, like a werewolf bullet.this time i aimed away from the fountain. yeah. i wasn't about to get wet.instead i fluxed all of my magnetism to create a gaussian magnetic mass--like an invisible airbag or cushion and landed with and understated shockwave.i collapsed the energy and stood up.i shook my head."here, i thought i'd be the one with home-sickness by this point."  asriel took my hand and grasped it gently.his eyes turned cyan."asriel...i..."i looked down at the ground.why was i trying to attempt something that had long since been a moot point to even try; the timeline was destroyed. even if it weren't, everyone was dust. the timeline collapsed before chara could complete her pact with that version of frisk and never collected their soul as a result.i had theories that without the monsters, the magic of the underground would die, too. nothing would be able to sustain the world within. but i didn't know anything about magic so...it was just at theory.also, if things of asriel's world followed the usual rules of the universe, then monsters going extinct could theoretically cause an imbalance. monsters were made of mostly magic and little substance; humans were made of mostly substance and little magic. what would happen to such a world wtihout the two keeping each other in check?"i...don't blame you for what happened. you know that, right?""yeah."a moment of silence."you...know i'm not trying to get rid of you. i want you to stay, but...i'm so conflicted.""...i know you feel obligated to put things back to the way they're supposed to be...but...""it was always a doomed hope. to get you back to your loved ones...to your home."asriel's eyes turned purple."i've learned to accept it." asriel looked up at the sky. "they're all gone, and they're not coming back. i can't get my old family back. miss undyne isn't coming back. chara's...gone. it still hurts but i have to let go. when you truly love people you have to let them go when it's their time.  despite it all, you have to go on.  you have to persevere."a sniffle.asriel's eyes turned green.we both felt compelled to hug each other. we both felt inclined to shed tears.nothing stopped us from doing so. so...we did. two crybabies just drawing from each other's strength."when i first came here...i didn't have a reason to live. i didn't want to live. but i was too much of a coward to--""no. you weren't a coward at all. if you had tried to commit suicide, that would be cowardly. you chose to live. with the consequences. with the burden of everything weighing down on you...with what chara made you promise. even now i can tell it still bothers you."i was once told, countless missions ago, that the risk of trying to fix someone who was broken was that you might end up cutting yourself on their pieces."that's what it means to have courage isn't it? it isn't something like sticking your head into a lion's mouth or going off to fight a war or something like that. it's living life. overcoming."asriel's eyes were orange."asriel you keep impressing me with your insight...your wisdom." i let him go and he stood on his own for a moment, in silence.asriel pulled his heart locket out from under his shirt, grasping it gently. he snapped it open to reveal the photo of himself and chara."best friends forever." he looked up at me."it's taken me this long to feel like...our friendship is appropriate. like i'm not too old...too grown up for you to pal around with. i don't know whether that was fear of being judged by others or self-doubt or even feeling like i had to prove myself worthy of your friendship. but...you gave it freely. whatever mistakes i've made, whatever mistakes i might still be making...you forgive me for them."i sniffled a little."you know that i'm keeping so much from you, even now......and you don't resent me for those secrets. you're so willing to be patient with me over them. things i can't tell you just yet...things i don't even know, myself, when you'll be ready for them. you're so understanding. so cooperative." i looked at his shirt. "purity really is the word, isn't it."asriel's eyes turned blue."it's who i am."there was a moment of silence."sooo...prince of this world's future, huh?"  i jabbed lightheartedly, refering back to what he had said at the climax of his and chara's battle in the square.his eyes faded back to dark copper red."hey. you're really going to bring that up? i was in a moment. it...just came to mind."  asriel defended, not really offended."i'm never going to be a prince again. i may have just been speaking metaphorically...but...i feel like i have to be setting some kind of example. master splinter said i he saw hope and light in me. i don't want to let anyone down...but i don't want to pressure myself so much that i make a bad choice or a mistake i can't fix. i just...want to be the best me that i can be. it's no longer about making everyone else happy. i want to make a better future for all of us...including myself.one that we can all share together.  i want to be part of that future.  and more than that...i want to protect that future."his eyes turned yellow.asriel's vocabulary had radically increased since being around us. in the early days, he had trouble pronouncing a lot of words, and had to ask us for some definitions. that is when he felt like speaking. he still had a lot of techno-babble to learn but...heck. he was using words like "metaphorically" like a boss now and was starting to recognize jang-ese words in written and spoken form."you know...as a king, you would have made the best speeches.""you think so? dad...asgore wasn't really good at them. i did tell you he wasn't that great at naming things, right?""heh. well...he did come up with one good name.""huh?""yours.""oh, you... "  asriel blushed a little."so...i guess we muddled over the past plenty.""yeah.""so...how should we celebrate 365 days of you being here? a whole year of living in miranda city?""it...does feel like cause for celebration. i say...we do anything and everything we can fit into an entire day...tomorrow."it made sense. it was getting really late. what was a day late of celebration for the big anniversary?"deal."asriel's eyes turned neon red.  we shared a bro-fist.the next morning, bright and early...we were off to rabbotou dojo for a little after-class activities in the gym, dojo, and garden."that tickles, kukuicha!" asriel got into a fit of giggles as kuki-chan smoothered his face in kissy-licks."chuuu!"that later led us to computer valhalla. i'd...put up with vi's annoyance for his sake."...get the cherry!" "pac-man is really fun!"from there...to rock-afire pizza where we both decided to make our own pizzas. they turned out well."a fine job, both of you!"we enjoyed our feast and a bit of dance to the music of mitzi's jukebox before we were off to meet up with sally at a rave for even more music and dancing. she assured me it would be a clean, family friendly venue. unlike violet, i knew she'd make good on her word without bending or breaking rules to still be in the right.from there to lupe's nature preserve where we toured the whole facility. it was amazing how much we were fitting into a single day.not long afterward, violet and skeeter caught up to us and roped us into a prank i knew we should have declined."violet...how did you get your hands on the modified camp bus...thing...from ernest goes to camp from the movie's climax? why would you get your hands on something like this......and...you're not listening...""uh...volt? do you know why skeeter has a toilet loaded up in this...catapult thing."oh no.violet lifted the lid and looked in then looked up at us both."ehhhhhh-yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew..." she said as she rapidly waggled her jaw side to side, rapidly in the style of one ernest p. worrel.asriel covered his eyes."violet, there isn't even any of...that...in there. you filled it with......tell me those sets of chemicals aren't what i think they are--""bombs away!" skeeter called from the other end of the catapult."asriel...i think it's prudent we deny any responsibility."and then before we knew it, vi dropped a match into the bowl and got clear."fire in the hooooole!" she gave in her best overwatch impression. and before we knew it a commode was sailing though the air.oh gods no...and then there was a crash on the other side of the area...followed by a muffled explosion...and a splat following it?minutes later, al dente trudged over to us, covered in green slime and whining about the damages he was going to have to pay the motel manager."instant non-toxic green slime. just add an oxygen flare. the fuel, once it reaches critical temperature, burns up andexpands so fast there's no danger of igniting anything. and the exothermic reaction is enjoy to get the other inert chemicals to react with each other--""...turning into the world's fastest green slime explosion. yeah. i read your notes."we...quickly vacated the area, leaving al to flounder around in the sticky mess.we continued our time, dropping in at the museum to sit in on vladimir stokes' science lessons."science is so cool!""yes. it is the coolest, my young friend."as much time as we were eating up, it seemed like the day was allowing for each and every activity. by any practical means we should have been running out of time to do all this.a quick visit to the indoor skating, a ride in the e.l.b. time train from here to westhaven and back (without traveling through time, mind you.), and a ride with gadget piloting a helicopter around the city...yeah...we crammed everything we could into the day.when it did get starting dark, i decided to host a cookout on the clocktower balcony, even though it wasn't a lunar cycle. jon sure didn't mind. any excuse for steak and burgers was a good one."these will be my best ones yet, mates.""that's what you said about the last batch.""and i was right, wasn't i?""yeah."but all good things come to an end. so i set up a telescope and asriel and i spent our time star-gazing. he really liked star-gazing. maybe stars and bright colors were just hardwired into him. most of the other au versions of him seemed to have that in common.i chuckled ot myself that maybe somewhere the otpr (outertale) version of him was looking back. then i kindly remembered to keep out of other sandboxes. sometimes the "king of crossovers" has to show restraint. oh well.once again when the day had ended, i dropped him off at scott and callie's."i had fun, volt.""so did i."we both shared a hug."happy 1-year anniversary, azzy.""it's been...just...*sniffle*...wonderful.""hey. no tears. there will be other days to cry.""i know...it's just...""yeah. everything.""i'm the luckiest kid alive. thank you all so much for making me so."i nodded and got back in the 57' chevy. "good night, azzy. pleasant dreams.""they will be. thanks to you."  asriel waved as i drove off. then he headed inside.cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-119 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-119. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 261: "let's go fly a kite":march. need i say more? winter's on its way out. spring is around the corner. make way for sunny skies and butterscotch-cinnamon pies.okay that last part i inserted on asriel's behalf.if there's one constant around this time of year it's..."--a lot of wind!""yup. plenty to get them airborne."it's not exactly hard to believe that kite-flying is a scarce thing in the underground. in fact it's pretty much nonexistent.it's pretty obvious that the inside of a mountain is not going to have clouds...and thus it's not going to have a source of wind.yet it's not entirely obvious how it manages to rain in the underground or how there's a transition from day to night. seriously. it's daylight in snowdin and turns almost immediately to dark in waterfall.waterfall's rainy weather is self-explanatory.the underground definitely has the concept of day and night. in genocide timelines, sans' speech prior to battle states that the birds are singing. save for owls and other nocturnal types, most birds don't make a peep during the night.one theory i have about the former is that snow and ice melt from the summit of mount ebott through unseen holes in the mountain. since the barrier only lets things in and not out (save for a powerful fusion of human and monster soul) and rain sure doesn't fall up; my guess is the holes in the ceiling of the cavern are directly over watefall.as for the latter, i'm still figuring that out. but i have surmised that the capital is at least lit by the "strange light" of the barrier.is it weird i'm spending this much time thinking about the underground when i'm about to take asriel and company out to the open fields of the park to fly kites...and hopefully take my mind off of the frisk dilema?"it'll be a relaxing past time, azzy.""yeah. at least until the kite-eating tree makes a meal of your kite." skeeter wrinkled his snoot."still complaining about that, bro?" rotor mused."it's not very funny.""you just...have bad luck, that's all." gadget comforted."for how many years straight?"again, i reiterate from two months ago: good grief."will they really fly?" asriel asked."you bet they will!"  gadget beamed."little sis has a knack for aeronautics. you know violet isn't the only pilot in the uciat.""really, big sister?""really!" gadget smiled. "i can fly all kinds of small planes and helicopters." at her young age, gadget was a prodigy. especially when it came to things that fly.i wondered...was asriel on his way to reaching, in a few years, where gadget was now?even if he didn't have the talent...he certainly had the determination, now.  that's where emmett and marty's advice came in: 'if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.'once at the park..."this looks like a good spot." i held onto the one i assembled. pretty plain and ordinary. gold, silver, and white color scheme with a simple tail. imagine that.asriel's was a little more fancier with the purple and white, plus the delta rune. a little bit of gold trim and tail with golden flowers lining it.gadget opted for the more box-type kite. personally engineered and decorated with decals of gears.rotor and skeeter had matching fish-motif kites. if history repeated they wouldn't be a pair for much longer.but i suppose the real surprise was..."mind if we join you?"okay, sally's appearance wasn't a surprise but coming all the way from neo arcadia was..."miss dottie! miss woolma! and miss portia!"woolma lowered her sunglasses. "it's good to be acknowledged by my adoring fans.""but i thought you came out here to get away from your adoring fans.""portia dear, fame never takes a vacation even if a star does.""besides, there hasn't been a real scoop back in the big city. you know i can't sit still without digging up something for a great exposè.""that's our news hound." portia smiled."well, you girls are welcome to join us. but...didn't you invite the guys?""are you kidding? the last time we flew kids, as kids...""let's not bring up bingo's cheating stunt again."asriel blinked."what did mr. bingo do?""he tried to rig the kite flying contest by tying a motorized airplane toy to the back of his kite. it didn't end well." dottie frowned."but mr. montgomery and mr. zipper...?""our fearless leader's busy with work. can't put down a wrench and a screwdriver long enough to check the time of day let alone take time off to fly a kite. i had half a mind to march over to chronosapien robotics and drag him out of his cubicle.""i think he has a corner office, actually." portia corrected."zipper turned us down. can you believe he said kite-flying wasn't his thing? i think he's still mad at bingo. who can blame him?" woolma checked her eyeliner in her compact. "this wind is just so bad for my looks. my stylist is going to charge me a fortune over this.""after all those years?""either that or he's just making him sweat over past mistakes until he works up the nerve to apologize for them." "golly. i didn't know grownups had so many problems they never got over as kids."all three looked at each other then laughed a little."not so much as problems...just memories that make for good anecdotes.""well, are we going to stand around here all day or we gonna fly kites, already?""in a hurry to feed the tree?"  rotor jabbed."...that's not very funny."  skeeter crossed his arms."what?" portia looked confused as did her friends."you'll see." i mused.and so..."...now get a good running start! that's it! you got it, asriel! let the wind carry it up!""oh wow! it's flying! it's flying!""keep a grip on that spool. don't let too much line out!"asriel laughed joyfully as he dug in his heels and stood his ground, letting the wind keep his kite aloft.it was reassuring to see such an old-timey activity in full swing in lieu of being glued to smart phones and tablets or stuck behind a tv or computer screen. whether this was a sport was debatable; i'm sure arlene would prefer to see something more full contact. but ariel rastajive would approve, as long as there was plenty of hollering and party atmosphere.it was at that moment bunnie literally soared in, in ninja garb...with a glider-modification. i'd heard that ninjas sometimes had "kite suits" but this was the first time i'd ever seen one, let alone used by the major."oh wow, sensei! you're like a hybrid kite!""i thought i might join you for this wonderful beginning of spring." bunnie landed and flung off the ninja suit in her true anime quick-change style. at least violet wasn't around to joke if she was the long-lost fourth member of team rocket. now i felt like needed to thwap her...yet again."you're welcome to join us. but it looks like you didn't bring a kite.""on the contrary. i just haven't put it together yet..." bunnie unfolded the shodouphone as it dropped out of her sleeve, into her grasp. with a number of strokes and a palm strike, bunnie's kite was assembled. and wow was it impressive."amazing!"a full scale xing-ese dragon, with an incredible amount of detail."if that had been around for the kite-flying contest back then, you would have been a shoe-in to win it, lady rabbotou." dottie mused."bunnie will suffice. we are all friends here. but thank-you, nonetheless. i learned much in my travels abroad, visiting jang's neighbor, xing."in mere moments bunnie had it airborn and it ruled the sky with magnificence. i was rather impressed. asriel was incredibly impressed.and with all of kites in the air, kite-flying was underway.it was fun for everyone. except skeeter."auuuuuuuuuuugh!!!!" "and the tree has been fed yet again." i muttered. as i watched skeeter's kite seemingly disappear into the foliage.for much of the day we spent our time letting the wind carry our kites and carry away our cares.the third month of the year. not my favorite month, per se, but definitely my lucky month (and definitely more enjoyable than the last month.)sub-entry 262: "hina matsuri/gadget's birthday":march 3rd. for bunnie, it meant a jangese holiday; hina-matsuri, the doll ceremony also known as girl's day. for gadget, it meant a birthday--the day she was biologically born rather than the genesis of her mutation. double special days like this are definitely something to talk about.hina-matsuri, by tradition was gender specific. but traditions were meant to be bent and broken; and who were we to deny asriel his curiosity? with gender stereotypes and labels being a hot spot for controversy, things had become more flexible in recent years. but i'm not going to delve into the can of worms if i don't have to.let's not turn this into a mound of tired-old boy vs. girl arguments and school ground antics. furthermore, let's definitely not turn this into a cess-pool of liberal views on sexism, gender segregation of bathrooms, or anything else that's going to cause headaches and sore throats from screaming. let's leave the "cooties" and such behind. let's call it what it should be; a cultural exchange. for someone like bunnie, who herself was breaking down barriers of the gender-specific traditions of her past, she was more than willing to let asriel watch and learn with the girls invited to take part.again i had a pamphlet to give asriel before dropping him off at rabbotou dojo. it read as follows (and i quote):who celebrates it: the people of jangwhen it's celebrated: march 3rdwhat it is: in jang, it is known as doll festival or girl's day.how it is celebrated: beginning in the "kyouto" period of jang history, the tradition of displaying dolls arose from the belief that dolls had the power to imprison evil spirits. descended from the practice of "hina-nagashi" (doll floating, literally); straw hina dolls were set afloat on a boat down a river to the sea in order to take with them troubles and evil spirits. some parts of jang have shrines where this is done in practice, often to pray for the safety of children. the holiday is celebrated by setting up an intricate doll set depicting the ruling royal jang family and royal court. the display is left up throughout march 3rd and 4th. per superstition, the display is not left up beyond march 4th on the belief that it will result in bad luck or a late marriage for the daughter.other practices/cuisine: the customary drink for the festival is "shirozake", a sake made from fermented rice. a colored "hina-arare", bite-sized crackers flavored with sugar or soy sauce depending on the region, and "hishimochi", a diamond-shaped colored rice cake, are served. "chirashizushi" (sushi rice flavored with sugar, vinegar, topped with raw fish and a variety of ingredients) is often eaten. a salt-based soup called ushiojiru containing clams still in the shell is also served. clam shells in food are deemed the symbol of a united and peaceful couple, because a pair of clam shells fits perfectly, and no pair but the original pair can do so."thank you for inviting me, sensei. i know this isn't really a holiday for boys like me so...i really appreciate it.""it's okay!"  gadget hugged him. "i'm not jangese and i celebrate it!"bunnie smiled as she and megami organized the containers which stored the hina matsuri display and pieces."for now you can be an honorary girl!" she added."just...as long as i don't have to wear a dress. i think that would be weird."stephanie and penelope-anne hugged him at the same time, stephie on the right and penny on the left."we won't make you do anything like that!"  stephie assured."but you'd look really cute in a dress..." penny mused with a smirk.that made goat son blush deep in the cheeks."i don't think i'm ready to change my name to asriella."heh."okay, we're ready to set up." bunnie informed."there's a very specific order and placement for each of these, so let's get started."megami spoke with bunnie translating."the dolls of a hina matsuri set arranged on a platform called a "hina dan" which is covered by a red carpet with rainbow stripes on the bottom known as a "dankake" or "hi-mousen". modern hina matsuri practice implements the setting up and display of the seven-tiered hina matsuri doll set, depicting the ruling jang royal family and royal court. while the order in which the dolls are placed may very the positioning per levels is always the same."the two of them set up said hina dan and carefully covered it with the dankake/hi-mousen. and sure enough it had seven tiers as was tradition."first tier." bunnie brought out the set of dolls depicting the current jang royal family."odairi-sama (emperor) holding a "shaku" (royal baton) and ohime-sama (empress) holding a fan. often placed in front of a gold, folding screen called a "byoubu" and beside jang garden trees. optional accessories include bonbori (lampstands), hibukuro (silk or paper lanterns with cherry or "ume" blossom patterns), and sanbou kazari (two vases of artificial peach branches called "kuchibana").""wow. the emperor's like a king, right?" "yes, asriel.""golly, the empress looks so beautiful!" gadget clasped her palms together and rested her cheek on the back of her hand in a mock sleeping position and a dreamy expression."second tier: san-nin kanojo (three court ladies). each holds sake equipment. from right to left: nagae no choushi (long-handled sake-bearer; standing), sanpou (seated sake-bearer), kuwae no choushi (backup sake-bearer). additional accessories include takatsuki (stands with round table tops for seasonal sweets).""i can't wait to be old enough to drink sake." penny chuckled."third tier: gonin bayashi (five court musicians). each holds an instrument save for the singer, who holds a fan. in order: "taiko" (small drum, seated), "outsuzumi" (large drum, standing), "kotsuzumi" (hand drum, standing), fue (flute, standing), "utaikata" (singer, holding a fan and standing).""even back then they had music on demand, huh?" "you've been spending time around violet again, haven't you.""mom and dad never had anything like that back in the capital."  asriel pondered a bit. "that would have been nice to have.""fourth tier: daijin (two ministers). consist of the udaijin (minister of the right, depicted as younger) and the sadaijin."the placement of the dolls continued."fifth tier: the fifth tier, between the plants, holds three helpers or samurai as the protectors of the emperor and empress. from left to right: nakijougo (maudlin drinker). okorijougo (cantankerous drinker), waraijougo (merry drinker).""so like...bodyguards?" asriel reasoned."yes.""but...why are they referred to as "drinkers"?"bunnie and megami looked to each other."we'll save that explanation for another time.""okay.""sixth tier: these are items used within the palatial residence: "tansu": chest of (usually five) drawers, sometimes with swinging outer covering doors, "nagamochi": long chest for kimono storage, "hasamibako": smaller clothing storage box, placed on top of nagamochi, "kyōdai": literally mirror stand, a smaller chest of drawer with a mirror on top, "haribako": sewing kit box, two "hibachi": braziers, and "daisu": a set of ocha dougu or cha no yu dougu--utensils for the tea ceremony.""fancy!""cool!""nice.""seventh tier: these are items used when away from the palatial residence: "jubako": a set of nested lacquered food boxes with either a cord tied vertically around the boxes or a stiff handle that locks them together, "gokago": a palanquin, "goshoguruma": an ox-drawn carriage favored by kyouto nobility. this last is sometimes known as gisha or gyuusha. less common, "hanaguruma" an ox drawing a cart of flowers.""the royal family has a lot of impressive things.""keep in mind, while the figures are the modern royal family, the setup is as it was in the olden times.""oh. kind of like where you get your family photo taken in olde-timey clothing with the themed backdrops?""ah. i see callista-hakase and scott-taisa have already gotten the family portrait?""yeah. we had a few different ones taken besides the main one. it was fun dressing up."and then once assembled..."it looks amazing, miss bunnie!"  stephanie beamed with joy."it gets better ever year, or so it seems like it.""wow..." asriel's eyes twinkled with wonder."it's so wonderful!"  gadget one-arm hugged the goat child. by now he wasn't as caught off guard by it as he was when he had first gotten to meet gadget.a bit of ceremony and partking in some of the snacks and the group was off to mitzi's to celebrate gadget's birthday.even as a young teenager, gadget still loved birthday parties with all the games and hooplah. part of me hoped she'd never grow up; i felt the same with asriel but...i knew it was an inevitability with the both of them.the gifts were given, the party games were played, and of course...it wouldn't be complete without a very purple, grape-flavored birthday cake that mitzi had backed in the shape of a giant gear.with a mighty breath, gadget extinguished all the birthday candles and made her silent wish.i gladly filmed the whole thing on asriel's cam-corder, determined to preserve this for future days."happy birthday, gadget." asriel hugged her and gave her a brotherly peck on the cheek."awwwwww...you're all so sweet! thank you all so much!"if she had lit up with any more joy we'd have to wear shades from the glow. and we were definitely feeling the glow."have a good day, little sister?""the best, big brother. the best." gadget tried to hold back her tears of joy...without success. but it was okay.days like these come and go...but somehow they're still forever.cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-118 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-118. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry: 259: "splat-tuned out":okay. two strikes, looking for frisk. it's okay. you still got this, volt...you still got this.ugh. i could start believe it at any time now...that red herring was tossed in the ice chest and i was already back at uciat hq, taking some time to oversee some mundane data and reports in the lab. i was expecting it to be a lovely period of silence, without so much as a clock ticking in the room.my door swung open, followed by dr. nikita lynx clearing her throat in a very pronounced and forceful way that made it painfully obvious that she was highly displeased about something.why do i never get a moment's peace after coming home empty-handed and a head full of conversations i didn't feel like remembering?"problem, doctor?"nikita pointed out into the hallway.i sighed and decided to follow."some clarification would be a common courtesy right about now.""you need to see it for yourself."when she said things like that...it was a good sign that i needed to prepare for my blood pressure to go through the roof.i followed until we got to the appropriate door to the appropriate room."by all means." she crossed her arms.i didn't have a good feeling as i reached out and turned the knob, then opened the door.the next few seconds the silence was broken by my sudden exclamation:"i've been vandalized...!..........by elvis!!!"nikita facepalmed but i'm not sure if it was from the sight or my choice of words. still...it was accurate enough.from floor to ceiling, and everything inside, everything had been covered in paint. but not splattered. no, this was photo-realistic paint done up to make everything look like high-class, baroque period furnishings. to be honest...it did look like something out of one of the rooms of elvis presley's graceland mansion. i should know having observed many alternate earth world versions of it while outside of time and space.the floor's intricate designs had since completely dried. i could still smell wet paint on the ceiling and a few spots on the tables and equipment."as much as i can appreciate the decor is at least some degree of mature, the act itself is unacceptable use of resources and a visual distraction. it has also rendered some of our equipment rather useless." nikita spoke, rather deadpan in tone.sure enough a lot of the glassware had been painted to look like rare ming vases, porcelain pottery, and other expensive trinkets you'd see in a very, very wealthy mansion setting."how do we even begin to fix this--" i started as i looked at the elaborate setting. then i noticed it. i got a magnifying glass out of my lab coat pocket and examined.sure enough when magnified just enough, the imagery was quite pixelated. like a digital image. but i could tell it was still paint. if anything...it was like an inkjet or laser printer embedded an hd image onto everything."!!!"in that moment i immediately knew who to blame.i noticed the door at the other end of the room was cracked open a bit and the paint smell was stronger on the other side of the door.i marched over, nikita following. i kicked it open, aiming for the doorknob. as much as i wanted to ruin the paint job on it, i wasn't going to be that petty just to jab at the guilty party.i took a deep breath and prepared to bellow that name of our pain--sudden something charged out and knocked me over, accompanied by a mechanical whimpering and whining.curious, asriel had heard us in the hallway. gadget had promised to bring him back to her sub-lab workshop to show what she had been working on. the two of them came into the room, only momentarily amazed by the room's makeover."g-gamma?" it was rvg-gamma alright. but then i saw what had him upset."you have been graffiti-ed all over!" sure enough there were so many spray tags overlapping him, that there weren't any uncovered metal spots. i was sure that nikita would collapse under the weight of all the anime hashtag veins on it by that point...or her whole head would explode like that infamous scene right out of scanners."not graffiti!" i heard rmb-delta cackle."decorations!" came the follow-up from his "brother", fnz-epsilon."multicolored petroleum bi-products!" they said in unison. honestly this was the most robotic things they had said. but it was too late i realized they were both quoting a movie--"no. no. don't you--!"violet suddenly dropped down from a hatch int he ceiling and landed in between the two spray-tagged robots.and the three of them suddenly recited that street gang credo."los locos kick your a--(flowey cackle)!" delta began, kicking a foot out but deliberately missing nikita's heinie."los locos kick your face!" episilon pointed a little too close to asriel's nose, causing him to shrink back with a whimper."los locos kick your b--(flowey cackle) into outer spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!" violet finished, gesturing below my gi's black belt. i was about ready to deck her.nikita finally had--"enough!!!" she roared. it was the loudest i'd ever heard her shout.she grabbed episilon and delta by the arm and yanked them out of the room."come. i will clean you both up. if those mouths were real and not mechanical with a loudspeaker and vocoder behind them i would wash them out with soap! i regret so much stepping out and letting violet program you both behind my back...""violet..." i glared."whaaat?" she feigned innocence."it's really colorful!" asriel admired.i stared at him blankly."uh...i mean...you did a very bad thing, aunt vi.""soooooo...i'm guessing that's a no on my 3d hyper-painter printer cannon?" violet hefted the huge modified sprayer rifle cannon-looking device. several hoses lead to her backpack. i'd noticed it had been switched out in place of her usual jet pack."seriously, violet?" i put my knuckles to my hips. i shook my head at the paint stains all over her lavish kimono."what a waste. ruining an expensive silk kimono like that with paint and ink and who knows what else you have in that contraption.""ahh, no worries. i have 99 other copies of my favorite kimono. and that's just this one. i have thousands of varations--""we get it, vi. you really do put the stupid in "stupid rich".""you know me, commander. i dare to be stupid!""oh! like mr. yankovic's song back at uncle eddie's garage?""that's right!""ughh...violet, this is going to cost a small fortune to clean up and get back in working order.""bah. pocket change for me.""vi, i'm getting a little tired of hearing how rich you are."i rubbed my temples."come on, asriel. let's go check out gadget's workshop. violet, when i come back here, i better not find this place looking like inkopolis.""see ya', around, cinnamon roll! and remember...staaaaay freeeeeesh!"i facepalmed. and then we left the room.sub-entry 260: "well-deserved downtime":is it any wonder why my wife and daughters spend so much effort trying to get me to rest and take a step back from work and sources of stress?speaking of...i think it was about time that asriel finally got to meet my other two daughters. it was overdue.but i'm getting ahead of myself. first things first. get as far as i can from the lab and violet's annoyance.i headed to rabbotou dojo and picked my way through the main building to the jang garden in back.here we were back at the go-genso-mon.let's see. as much as i enjoyed a fiery setting, the fire gate (火) was out. it was still too cold out, being the middle of february.not going anywhere near the water gate (水). plus i didn't want to waste time drying my fur and clothes out, no matter how therapeutic the waterfall and koi ponds were.metal gate (金属) ...ehh...i don't think training to the point where my hands and feet were throbbing would be very relaxing.going to the wind gate (風) would be very "oxygenating" in emmett's words...but at this time of year, those winds would be cold and brutal. while my real fear was stinging insects, part of me was still not that crazy about crazy heights.well. wood/forest gate (木) it was. i pressed on into grassy, flower-covered, and tree-filled setting.and sure enough i happened across bunnie and the rabite trio. and with them was asriel and many of our "fantastic beasts"glitter was there, enjoying a pack of saltines violet had programmed for her.kuma was scampering about the quilt asriel had set up. wait...a picnic this early on in the year? of course i soon noticed the holoprojector dome in the middle of the blanket. kuma couldn't stray far from it or his program would collapse. neither glitter nor kuma could reset the projector on their own if they exceeded its maximum operating diameter.little bulb and gamma (cleaned up rather quickly by nikita) did there own thing.megami knelt down, nearby, playing a shamisen. marcel's, familiar, josquin had followed the sound and didn't waste a moment to hover around rabbotou dojo's shrine maiden caretaker. this drakeslime could enjoy any kind of music. usually he'd partake in his master playing the accordion."ah. commander. join us, will you not?" bunnie smiled, having slipped off her sandals.asriel waved us over as well."i think i will. especially after the ordeal violet put me through.""you're not still mad at aunt vi, are you, volt?""i'll get over it." i had a seat on the quilt and slipped off my own sandals. asriel had done the same.it was odd. rabbot dojo's garden seemed a lot warmer than the day had been projected to be. it should have been in the 20's or 30's. but here it felt closer to the high 60's. was it an effect of the garden itself? was lupe around and granting us a special priveledge? or was the weather just being kind to us? whatever it was, i was enjoying it.i took a moment to take in the rabites playing around with bunnie and really take note of their personalities.houjicha, the white one, was always a hyperactive, curious ball of fluff with a happy-go-lucky sense of humor. everything was always a joy to him. if i had to ascribe a personality to "hoji-kun", i'd say he most closely fit that of monkey d. luffy, the straw hat pirate captain.bancha, the black rabite. like a smaller, male version of marie, he was of the ebon rabite type. for the uninformed, wild ebon rabites were violent and extremely vengeful if you crossed them. plus they tended to have very strong psychic abilities. bancha was the quiet, stoic one. usually brooding, usually attempting to meditate. his brother, hojicha always seemed to be his foil; like a pair of perfect strangers...or an odd couple. there were a couple of personilties that seemed to fit "ban-kun". it wouldn't be outlandish to draw a comparison to sasuke uchiha or shadow the hedgehog. but if i really had to draw a comparison...we was too cute to be them. if anything...metaknight was a closer comparison.which finally left the female member. the green puffball, kukuicha. described as super-demure. she was always a loving, affectionate type. she could find the good in anyone. even chameleon, who had been known to have an infamous streak of rabite abuse somehow got spared his wrath. just the lightest petting and she would repay the kindness with kissy-licks and nuzzles. out of the three of them, it was hard to find a personality match close enough to compare her to. but if i had to settle on someone...i guess the closest was orihime inoue. whatever the case...bancha was always protective of her, and hojicha was always keeping her amused and cheered up with his silly antics."so cute!" bunnie actually uttered a giggle as kuki-chan smothered her master in kissy-licks."awwww." asriel smiled.i watched for a while and started to drift off from the relaxing setting. i probably would have remained in my slumber all day...but then i was awakened by--""daddy!""daddy!"oooof! tacklehugged from both sides; one the left side but one green furred wolf girl, the other by an orange-ish furred wolf girl.i found myself falling flat on my back but laughing up a storm as the twins smothered me with love and attention.kuma went scurring over to gamma and lil' bulb. the rabite trio barely noticed; all three of them were absorbed in bunnie's attention."okay! okay! i missed you both, too!"lisa and elektra joined us at that point, slipping off their sandals and having a seat on the huge quilt. lisa gave me a big smooch on the lips as soon as the twins let up. elektra hugged me and gave a peck on the furry cheek.asriel took it in stride. he'd been wanting to meet them for some time and it was about time he did.he waved but not as shyly as he used to. i think after almost a full year he had gotten used to our world and had learned to be more outgoing.introductions were made."the green-furred one is penelope-anne. sometimes just "penny" or "annie". she's okay with either.""hi ya, azzy!"penelope-anne was the rambunctious one. if it was any indication she considered violet her mentor. did i need to say any more?"the orange-furred one is stephanie. or stephie.""it's nice to meet you, asriel."stephie chose bunnie as a mentor. that made me feel relieved.asriel got to know them both pretty quickly. he learned that stephie's element was technically wind/air but she had learned how to use her abilities to generate static electricity and sparks like me. when she got older she'd probably figure out how to generate small tornados and corona winds. i wouldn't be surprised if she taught herself to float once she learned how to control the aspects of air.as for penelope-anne, her element was grass/wood. she was already figuring out out to manipulate grass and plant life. i'd see her summon wood bark as armor during her sessions with violet teaching her the wonderful art of live action role play (larp). oh boy. things were going to get interesting when she got older."took long enough. but we finally brought them around for asriel to meet." lisa embraced me."you appreciate things more when you have to wait for them." i replied, remembering my own well spring of patience."how has...the quest been going?""at a stand-still. the person of interest is doing a good job of hiding out. logic tells me the last place to look is the capital. which is exactly where they need to go to bring this story to a happy ending. but...""but..?"i waited until asriel and the twins were far enough out of hearing range as they frolicked with the rabites."i don't know what to do about asgore. i know how it's supposed to go down but......would it be too drastic an altercation if i could find a way for him to...not..."i looked down at the ground at one of the lone flowers in the field."what would happen to the timeline if i kept him from meeting his fate and frisk from going up against omega f--" i couldn't finish my statement. there was a deep fear i was avoiding. one that even without the nightmares caused by the dust...hadn't diminished.i shifted gears pretty quickly."my real concern is sans. he has to know about the kid's resets. he has to know how many times they've made it to the surface...and then just had the dream ripped away. how many times did chara convince them to try to go back and save asriel? i've seen the timelines? as they are, no matter what frisk does, it can't be done. and no matter what they do, their mistakes can't be undone. not even by the reset. anyway...as far as i know frisk hasn't been to the judgement hall...yet. if that becomes the case then i might be too late to see how things play out in asgore's throne room.""sounds like you're seeing the end game on the horizon.""an end game. but...i feel there's a great danger lying in wait. and there have been some...quirks in the time stream that worry me. i feel like...there's something behind the scenes going on that's leading us all into a trap."i looked over where asriel and the others were playing with kuma, the rabites, and josquin. at some point kid the cat, mouse the rabite, and green the "warp scarab" had joined them."keeping this all from him for one year was hard enough...how am i going to turn this into five...or ten...or fifteen years...or who knows how long until he's ready to be told the truth. and how am i going to keep the underground stable long enough for that to come to pass?""admittedly, dad...i see your concern. it does seem overwhelming. but...you'll think of something. you always do."  elektra comforted."volt......neil...you can always turn to us when you need help with this.""i know...but even so...there's some things the council won't let me turn to you with.""kommand has your back, dad. she'll keep your tail out of the fire.""in the mean time, commander...join us for tea and snacks." bunnie and megami invited us back over to where they had set up the tea tray and such."yeah. i think that's probably the best use of my well-deserved down-time for now."we all gathered and enjoyed a serene bit of relaxing and calmness after the frolicking and fun. the story would go on but it would have to be another day.cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-117 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-117. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 257: "back to the search for frisk/the plight of burgerpants":once again, touching down at the save maker. i'd covered the ruins, snowdin, and waterfall. i guess hotland was next to start my search.given that i was using the save markers to return to the exact place and time i last left the underground, that meant there was no risk of frisk backtracking to a place i'd already covered. if they were hanging out somewhere, it would have to be in the remaining parts of the underground.i took my time enjoying hotland. while i had a lot of ideas where to search, i figured the largest spot would be the mtt hotel. if not in the dining area or the rooms, i'd have to search the area surrounding the core and mettaton's stage area.but perhaps i needed to converse with the locals and get information before i starting hunting all willy-nilly.of the locals, i could name three right off the bat worth talking to.first on the list was our cigarette-smoking, underappreciated, mtt burger-emporium peon, "burgerpants". (and boy, did he ever get peed on by his boss.) i'd heard him whine about his life in other timelines but i tried avoiding interecting directly. chances are a conversation with him would go about as well as it did with gerson. oh well. i was low on options this time.let's clarify something. his name wasn't really "burgerpants". it was just an unfortunate nickname he had been cursed with after an equally unfortunate incident.despite my many, many, many attempts to find out his real name......i've yet to succeed even once.on the same note...the shere number of times i'd heard him call someone (mostly frisk) "little buddy", i just can't help but feel like he's doing a captain alan hale reference right out of gilligan's island. just coincidence, i know...but if mettaton ends up putting coconut anything on the menu, i was going to suspect that more than just other utau's were leaking into our own ultraverse au.but that wasn't even the thing about him that made me scratch my head. when you poke around enough timelines you think you know it all...until the high-stress cat in question suddenly drops the phrase "goofy goober". yeah...i don't think this is something i need to include in my report to the council. just. nnnnno. no. i'm making a rule to avoid crabby patties.the second and final members on the list were a pair of besties that hung around behind the hotel--a pair of monsters answering to "catty" and "bratty". catty, obviously being a cat and bratty, not-so-obviously being an alligator...or crocodile. lupe would be able to tell me which, in all probability."welcome to mtt-brand burger emporium, home of the glamburger. sparkle up your day (tm). what can i do for you, little buddy?"do i look little? it's okay, volt. don't take it personally. i could make a joke about the irony of him being a pre-programmed employee of hotland's "sexy rectangle" but he probably needs a stress boost like a hole in the head."well, actually, i was hoping you've seen a human kid in--""i'm sorry, (ha ha) it's against the rules to talk to customers who haven't bought anything."and i was complaining about muffet being a greedy merchant? though...technically i could pin this one on mettaton."right.""how can i help you, o customer?!"sarcasm.  and a really forced smile.  he's...starting to scare me now."uh...i guess i'll take two glamburgers, two legendary heroes, a pair of starfaits and a pair of steaks in the shape of mettaton's face."ouch. over 2,000 gold in purchases. jon better appreciate what i'm bringing back."thanksy! have a fabu-ful day!!"i'm...pretty sure i could see the blood vessels in his eyeballs. if his lip stuck out any further, i could use it for a bench (okay, not really.).every time he stuck his cigarette back in his mouth, i'm sure he gained another chin. i think burgerpants set a record for most bizarre facial expressions in the entire underground. at least one of his rubber-faced expressions managed to out-weird undyne's messed-up, wacky-face."yeah...now about--""what? why do you keep trying to talk to me? i'll get in trouble if i get chummy with the customers! sorry." a long pause ensued. i started to ask again when he cut in with: "so. i wanted to be an actor.""uh--!"i hadn't even asked him about life advice. was he really this stressed or was this another wonky effect of the timeline's instability? was it because i was trying to interact in place of frisk and that was causing hiccups in......darn it...i'm overthinking agian. just get on with it."take it from me, little buddy. i'm getting on in years, so let me give you some advice, little buddy. you've still got time. don't live like me. i'm 19 years old and i've already wasted my entire life."only 19? jeeze. wait until you're 39, pal. or 59 or even 79. heck if you subtracted all of the years i've been immortal, i'd still be older than him. b.p. didn't know what he was talking about; he had a long way to go until he had any right to lecture me on being a burn-out."look, uh...burgerpants, was it--""really? really? you're another one of them!"ooooh. landmine. this is going to hurt...my ears."listen. i like you, little buddy. so i'm gonna save you a lot of trouble. never interact with attractive people. unless you're "one of them," they're just gonna take advantage of you. like that time those two chicks asked me to sneak them some glamburgers. and i, naive teenager that i was, said yes to them. bad idea. so i went out to the alley to see those two ladies, and uh... you know, see what'd happen next."a pause."then my boss, uh, saw me and asked me what i was doing. i was so startled, the hamburgers in my pockets tumbled out onto the ground. not wanting to lose face, i scrambled to pick them up! but, as i was leaning over, the weight of the remaining hamburgers... ...caused my pants to fall down. then the girls laughed at me. everyone calls me burgerpants now.""so...you don't want to be called burgerpants." really, volt? you had to ask a question that obvious?"everyone calls me burgerpants now. but you won't, will you, little buddy?" he leaned over the counter, heels of his palms pressed down on it, and practically touched his nose to mine, eyes bulging out of his head.awkward. and very uncomfortable."i'm sensing hostility. this doesn't have anything to do with mettaton, does it?""when i first came to hotland, it was my dream to work with mettaton.... well, be careful what you wish for, little buddy!""he can't possibly be that bad--"again, burgerpants interrupted."god, have you even looked around? this place is a labyrinth of bad choices. and every time we try to change something for the better, he vetoes it and says "that's not how they do it on the surface.  oh! right! humans are always eating hamburgers made of sequins and glue."okay, he's got a point there. wait...what did he say glamburgers were made of...? uh...i think jon just got a second helping. he'll eat anything, anyway."everyone else seems to like him. i think he's pretty cool.""why do people find him so attractive?? he's literally just a freaking rectangle." a pause. "you know, one time, i bought one of those, uh, kits online... to... uh, make yourself more rectangular... they don't work."i decided not to press it any further. this guy was even less helpful than gerson."......i...think it's better if i ask someone else about the human child. i'll try not to bother you in the future--""future? what future? nothing down here ever changes. i'll probably be trapped at this stupid job forever... but wait! there's one thing that keeps me going! if asgore gets just one more soul, we'll finally get to go to the surface! it'll be a brand new world! there's gotta be a second chance out there for me! for everyone! so stay strong, little buddy. when i make it big, i'll keep you in mind."i can confirm, with 100% certainty (as we say in science), that talking to burgerpants was a baaaaaad idea."do yourself a favor. run. run as far away from this place as you can!!!""...uh--"that's when i heard mettaton's voice in back."burgerpants, darling. i am in need of amusement. get in here while i ready the video camera. you're going to be an internet sensation!""well. it could be worse. you could be in hell--""i can't go to hell. i'm all out of vacation days."wait a minute. that response was out of place. i'd only heard him say that in a genocide timeline. was this a glitch in the timeline? did something somehow change? was another timeline leaking into this one? did this come from another au?"i'm just messing with you, little buddy."oh. humor...ehehehe...heh... you're overthinking things again, volt."don't you know? we make our own hell. i'm living it, baby. i'm living it."that was new."burgerpants! this instant!"okay. seriously. mettaton was a decent guy to everyone but this sad sack. maybe...burgerpants had that "it" factor. the one thing that made someone like antoine or al dente so easy to hate. i didn't have a problem with him. but jeeze, was he overselling his pain. considering the pain and humiliation the council, madam fate, and dr. adonis, and a number of other of my enemies had put me through...he had no idea what real pain and humiliation was. my sympathy for him only goes so far.i decided to take my business outside; around back.sub-entry: 258: "a conversation with bratty and catty yields another dead end":just from the title, you can set your expectations low. sorry to say, but i've spoiled how this attempt turns out. i'm going to have to go back to miranda empty-handed...again.bratty: tall. green. just your average pink-eyed, curly-blond-haired alligator monster with lipstick that matched her pink shawl. i'm pretty sure chameleon would be offended just by her appearance alone; and that's saying something. then again...chameleon was grumpy about everything. why not someone of similar species?catty: plump. purple. yellow-eyed cat creature with hair as black as my own...even the style was...similar. (maybe too similar.) weird blue highlights on the tips of her bangs. i couldn't quite explain the tufts of yellow hair coming out from under the straps of her blue overalls.......nor did i want to guess. if that turned out to be armpit hair, this was something i really wanted to omit from my report."hey! check it out!""yeah! check it out!"i'd come across the "american valley-girl" types before. i'd heard the dialect driven into the ground many a times; kimberly anne hart of angel grove was one such example. the head-in-the-clouds personality that absolutely insisted on inserting "like", "totally", "as if", and the occasional "gag me with a spoon" into their conversations. in small doses i could take it. but if i had to listen to bratty and catty speak all day? well, that was when i began to feel my (apparent) age.what could it hurt to at least look at their wares. besides, maybe it might sweeten the pot and i might get information about frisk out of it.i decided to buy some junk food. more for jon."you should buy all our stuff!""bratty, we're going to be rich!"further inquiry revealed that they no longer had the cowboy hat, empty gun and mystery key were no longer in stock. that meant frisk had been here.i figured maybe i could part with some broken parts that rotor wanted me to dispose of. i mean...junk was junk."thanks, but we, like, don't really need anything.""oh my god, can you go get us some glamburgers?""we don't--""--really need--""--anything."oh gods. they were finishing each other's sentences, now? this was...even worse than the valley girl speak."wait! i'll pay you 1000g if you get mettaton to autograph my butt!"wat.by now you should know, that's my most common way to express that my brain just shifted gears without the clutch. there are some things i don't even want to ask about. this was one of them.that's right about the point when catty started sniffing. i don't know how she could smell them while they were compressed into my e.n.g.i.n.e. micro-dots but somehow she could.only one explanation. magic."oh my god. is that a glamburger? oh my god!!! gimme!!!""god, catty. try to have some self-control.""sorry...""'cause they obviously brought that glamburger for me.""no wayyy!!!!!"headache...imminant."so uh...about--"i was about to learn that there were a lot of people in the underground that liked to interrupt me."i'm bratty, and this is my best friend, catty.""i'm catty, and this is my best friend, bratty.""..."i decided to skip asking about the garbage. i know it's "really good garbage".it didn't take long for the conversation to switch to mettaton. but i was surprised how much of a connection the two of them had to alphys of all people.how did i shift from collecting information about asriel to trying to learn more about the other boss monsters?"so uh...how about that mettaton, huh?"okay, bringing him up while making small talk got me a lot more than i bargained for."oh my god. mettaton.""oh my god, mettaton.""he's like... my robot husband.""actually he's like... my robot husband.""i think we're like... both going to marry him.""we're both like, already married to him.""he just, like, doesn't know it yet."i shifted a bit. i was engaging in a lot of familiar conversations. i know it was a lot of redundancy but i wasn't just on the lookout for frisk.my suspicions about the timeline were high and i was checking for deviations caused by my own presence, chara-wraith's interference, and the unstable nature of the timeline itself.again, it was the scientific method in action. searching for things out of place even though they might end up being exactly the same as the countless number of times i had run through these scenarios.i had to know what, if anything, was different. one minor alteration could result in a big butterfly effect."so...does mettaton talk much about where he came from?""so, like, dr. alphys built mettaton, right?""that's like, what they tell you.""but like...""mettaton always acts like...""... being built was his idea somehow.""and even right after he was built...""...he acted like alphys was an old friend.""but they're like...""not friends anymore.""yeah!!!""unlike me and bratty!!""best friends for-ever!!!"that was something i overlooked. it was kinda true...mettaton, for a while threw away a lot of the people who made him who his was today. first he abandoned napstablook. then when he had his robot body, he decided he didn't need alphys anymore.but all that changed. chara put him in a position where he had to go crawling back to his "creator" for help during my battle with chara-ton neo at the core. as a direct result of that, mettaton changed for the better and even went so far as to reunite with napstablook; an event that happened much earlier than it was supposed to. their reunion wasn't supposed to occur until after the barrier was broken and all monsters went free."you talk like you know alphys. have you met before?""oh my god. alphys.""oh my god, alphys.""she used to live on our street. she was like a big sister.""i mean, like, if your big sister...""takes you on trips to the dump.""she showed us the coolest places to find trash.""she was always collecting these weird cartoons.""then she became the royal scientist...""yeah, we haven't seen her in forever..."things about alphys were starting to come together. i had observed these timelines before but i never really thought into the notes i took. i just forwarded them to the council for analysis. now i was starting to relate to them on a personal level.no matter how many times i explored a utpr timeline: prime universe or an unstable timeline like the ones that popped up in the ultraverse, like this one...i always seemed to discover something new that i had overlooked before. learning that alphys had more acquaintances than i'd gathered was a breath of fresh air.i rubbed my chin."things changed when she became the royal scientist?""so alphys has always, like...""thought asgore is a super cutie.""so, like, i'm pretty sure she...""made mettaton to, like, totally impress him.""a robot with a soul...""that's, like, super relevant to his hobbies!""so after seeing mettaton, asgore...""asked her to do all this science stuff for him!""but nobody's, like, seen anything from her yet.""or... her at all...""she must, like, just stay in her lab all day.""like, live a little, girl.""yeah!!!""like us!!!"the lie. the first big lie. in total, i wonder how many alphys told? i knew of the major four the bat:1) mettaton; a robot with a soul.2) everything she told undyne to impress her; technically several but i grouped them as one.3) the amalgamates; technically she didn't say anything but...withholding the truth is technically lying. just like what i was doing with asriel. (but did it count if he knows about it and is okay with me keeping him in the dark until the proper time?)and 4) flowey the flower; the first golden flower was the alpha, and by now alphys suspected he was sentient and somewhere in the underground. i really shouldn't be ignoring the little yelllow murder-flower so much---hold on. what was that about having a crush on asgore? eheh...nope. don't want to think too much into it. but alphys' connection to asgore intrigued me."so...got any thoughts on his royal fluffybuns?""oh my god.""he's a total goober.""he's a big, fuzzy goofball!!""like, i love that guy.""he's like, so nice.""god, we're like...""god, we're like...""so hyped for the destruction of humanity.""so hyped for the destruction of humanity."at that moment i think i just imagined a record player needle being dragged across a vinyl with an unsoundly screech. hearing something like this in a pacifist timeline did not reassure me.their description of asgore was spot on. he was right, though. no one really understood what had to be sacrificed for their freedom. no one understood what it meant to murder a human for their soul. i wasn't lying to toriel when i said how much i hated his deeds. i just couldn't bring myself to hate him. bad choices just made him a person. a person with huge regrets. weighed down so by everyone's hopes and dreams for freedom."anyway. i was talking to the guy at the burger emporium--""oh, that guy from the store?""yuck, what a creep.""yeah! he's a creep!""but he's kind of cute, too...""c'mon catty, don't you have any standards?""nope!!!"i really should be asking about frisk. but the whole burgerpants issue was gnawing at me. i had to know."so...what's wrong with burgerpants?""ok, like, the annoying thing is...""he'd be ok if he just treated us with some respect.""but he just acts...""really weird.""and then acts like it's our fault he acts that way!""like, when we asked him to get those glamburgers...""he dropped them and ran away before we could even say anything!""we were, like, going to share them.""really?""i wasn't.""catty!"should i even try to play matchmaker with them? at the very least try to mend friendships?"so...if he asked to hang out some time--""oh, uh...""yeah!!""he should come look for junk with us!""but like, if we let him hang out with us... i just worry it'll...""... be really super fun!""um, that was not what i was gonna say.""but i was close, right !?""so...what's the problem?" i was asking for trouble on this one. but i might as well bring this full circle."well, that kind of guy...""you hang out with him once, then he wants to hang out...""all.""the.""time.""but don't you feel bad for him, bratty?""poor burgerpants...""think about how cool we are compared to him!!!""we'd be saving his life with our friendship!!""his life, bratty!!""uh, so?""...""think of all the glamburgers he could get for us!!""... so is he free after work?"this whole conversation was pointless, in the end. no deviations. nothing new to add. i guess this part of the timeline was stable. but seriously, volt. get back on task."so...the human child. they had to have come this way?""like...yeah.""totally. but that was like...""forever ago."really? forever ago. that was...descriptive. *sigh* maybe it was too long since i raised a teenager. but i'm pretty sure elektra was never like this. gods help me if stephanie or penelope-anne turn out like this."they haven't been back here recently?"the both of them shrugged."the last time we like...saw them they bought some junk off of us. the hat and the gun and some old key."to what ends were you snatching up all these personal items, frisk? frying pan and cooking apron, empty gun and cowboy hat, notebook and the glasses... all of those items belonging to the other six fallen.one point of view was for frisk to use them. increased armor and stronger weapons. but that was going by traditional rpg logic. i understood the need to have greater survival in the long run...but if if this was indeed a pacifist timeline, why the weapons?the other point of view was sentimental value. these items belonged to people. it was only right that they be returned to any surviving kin. if this was the case then i couldn't have admired frisk more at that point.the problem was that this contradicted frisk's current behavior. if they planned on returning this items to the fallen children's families...why were they avoiding going to asgore to confront him? why hadn't they already been judged by sans?"i guess that's all i needed to know.""like, you're a total cutie.""like...you wanna like date or something?"hellooooo!again my brain shifted gears without the clutch."sorry, girls. i'm married.""like bummer.""like total bummer."please stop, you two."i...guess i'll be on my way, now.""like, see you later!""like, later and stuff!"i shuffled away from the hotel and looked for an alternate route to the capital. one that i wouldn't have to go through the two royal guards for or through alphys' lab for.unable to find a way, i decided to use the spectre function and just slip past the guardsmen, completely intangible. once i was at the entrance to the capital, i set a new save marker and had kommand transport me back home.frisk was running out of places they could be hiding out. i knew once i caught up to them, the end game would soon start up. i had to figure out what i was going to do about asgore. but the real danger was something i had put out of my mind for so long i'd completely forgotten about it. time would tell if i'd catch my carelessness or if it would all fall apart because i focused on the wrong priority...cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-116 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-116. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 255: "rad racer 3":we've got to stop letting violet, ripper, and sally hang out together. by themselves, sally and ripper aren't a problem--sally actually keeps ripper out of trouble. but then it just takes violet to suggest something stupid to get the whole group on board.fortunately many of us had already put our feet down on anything too dangerous; furthermore ripper was still blacklisted from pyrotechnics. whatever ultimatum that chameleon laid down after his shack was finally 100%...ripper wasn't going to whisper a word about it. it must've been that bad if he didn't want to talk about it.uncle edward shipped us rdi-001 (roadie) and wls-002 (wheels), giving violet plenty of time to work on their onboard a.i. navigation computers.honestly...she could have reduced the units to the size of a cell phone. did she have to insist on making the removable moduals the size of those "portable battery-powered televisions" they made in the 80's? sure, once the units were installed in the dashboard consoles, the cumbersome-ness disappeared into "sleek-and-streamlined". but sometimes her obsession with "retro" made me scratch my head."at least you and sally agreed to do this out in this long stretch of road in the augustradian desert."even at this time of year, augustrad was nice and toasty. that was the main reason i was on board. but as to how i got dragged into this...?"bunnie, the next time i have a lapse in judgement and agree to one of violet's stupid bets--""we're both in the same boat, commander." bunnie crossed her arms as she had seated herself in the passenger's side of wls-002."at least we decided to leave asriel out of this.""actually..." violet grinned. "he'll be waiting for us at the finish line.""swell. us setting a wonderful example for--""miss vi, why did you lie about that? i'm right here with you."take a wild guess how hard my jaw hit the pavement."technically i didn't lie.  i said you'd be waiting for us at the finish line...because we'll be the ones to win this race while everyone else plays catch up.""violet...if anything happens to him--""you worry, too much!" violet said as she closed the gull-wing door of roadie."strap in, kiddo."i looked over in jon, at the wheel of wls-002."at least you had the common sense not to--" i about bit my tongue when i saw skeeter in the back seat of wls-002, behind bunnie, strapped in and helmet on."i don't know which of us i'm more disappointed in...." i cut off sharply as i heard the passenger's side door of the 57' chevy open then close."ready, big brother?" gadget was now in the passenger's seat."i guess we're not much better are we?" mitzi looked sheepish as pit had joined her in the cmd-x."it'll be awesome!"sally gave a thumbs-up as she had gotten behind the wheel of the turbo interceptor--a modified 1984 dodge m4s, sparkling silver in paint scheme and looking more futuristic than anything in the garage. with a top speed of 194.8 mph and able to go from 0 to 60 in 4.1 seconds, packing 440 hp, this would be a hard vehicle to keep up with. sally can pick em'. honey and willie squeezed together in the passengers seat.this is the worst thing we've ever done. by this time we took our place at the starting line.we agreed that none of the cars would be able to use the hovercraft conversion. since we were nowhere near water, the hydrofoil conversion wasn't an issue. finally, there was to be no automatic pilots, so we all made sure violet kept the new a.i. navigator computers off or at least muted. really. didn't we have enough talking cars as it is, what with k.i.t.t. in the x-vault?the hovering stoplight violet had set up ticked down from red to yellow to green."go, go, go!"we all hit the gas.violet blared the radio. i knew the song...and somehow she and sally found time to remix it. :detemmienation: (music link)we all jockeyed for first place position, the road starting out relatively tame. but i was worried that it wouldn't be long before we hit the hair-pin turns. easy way to end up in an accident or killed. what were we all thinking?!"yaaaaaay!" gadget cheered on. for a girl who was intimidated by a lot of things, she sure took high speed in stride!"faster, aunt vi!""don't encourage her, azzy!""faster? you just said the magic words!" sally tromped down hard on the accelerator and slingshot ahead."oh you did not!" violet grimmaced."we really gonna take this, mr. jon?""hold on to your potatoes, pit!""but i don't have any-- whoah!"i might not be the daredevil that sally was, but i knew my way around a slipstream as did gadget, being versed in aerodynamics. i rode behind sally, using the shape of the air currents to pull us behind her until we could get a chance to pull ahead. mitzi was close behind with vi pulling up fast and jon holding up the rear."checkpoint!" vidian was waiting by the first marker."oh my gods, vidian!"if she wore any less she would be indecent. but considering the temperature out here in augustgrad territory, not many would blame her. the first chance she'd get she'd shadow-merge; using her own unique elemental lycan ability to literally become one with the shade--even using shadows at portals between long distances.the next leg of the journey featured said hairpins; sharp turns in the road which an inexperienced driver could easily go off road, crash out, or worse on."this is amazing, aunt vi!""yeah, but let's not tell your mom and dad about this.""we're not doing anything...bad are we?""oh no, no, no. not bad...just--""you're not a very good liar sometimes." asriel deadpanned."eheheh...you're starting to learn, aren't you? and i thought it was hard enough to put one over on the commander."by that point violet pulled ahead of mitzi."oh no you don't...." mitzi felt a bit brave and ready to challenge to reclaim her position."man, this blows. can't you go any faster, mr. jon?""uh...f-faster?""yeah! i'm not going to be happy if we're the slowpokes on all this.""your brother is going to kill me..."i managed to pull ahead of sally."crashing the mode, commander? you've got guts, dude.""can you not say 'crashing', please?""we're in first!" gadget cheered on. she reached over and adjusted the radio and put on a driving song. i recognized it instantly as a cover of "gumball crash".the race kept on and soon jon managed to slingshot past violet and mitzi."now we're talking!"we kept on tearing up the pavement, and soon came up on the second checkpoint. and kid the cat was hovering overhead."what an exciting race!"asriel waved as violet sped past.as we continued on, each of us managed to get into the lead at some point only for someone else to grab the lead.before long another checkpoint. and then the last one."there's the finish line!"it was neck and neck between violet and myself. i promised myself i'd never do this again. plus i'd spent whatever it cost at the paint and body shop to fix whatever this race did to my 57' chevy."we're gonna win it, aunt vi!" asriel hollered."no, we're going to win it!" gadget challenged."this is why i hate competition..." i muttered."suck it up, commander! this race is in the bag--"and there ripper and valerie were at the finish line."i've got the checks so hit those pumpers like heck!" ripper held up the checkered flag.violet and i floored it. and in the end..."alright! a photo finish!"i spun out the car as violet did the same."who won?"it's...well. what do you think? should i spoil it or...?"...it's volt and gadget by a nose!""awwww..." asriel looked a little disappointed."darn. well...second place is better than ending up dead last."speaking of, sally crossed the line next, followed by mitzi. and holding up the rear..."you're never going to let me live this down, are you?"bunnie said nothing.skeeter just face-palmed.sub-entry 256: "the worst day of the year to be antoine":let me spell it out in two words: valentine's day.to anyone else, having a birthday on this day would be absolutely romantic.yet...there was one case where it was...not so much."commander? i know you're not going to believe me if i call in sick...so what about calling in dead?""sally...this day isn't easy for a lot of people."i looked over where mitzi sighed and gently turned over her framed photo of duke. then took another moment to empty a number of recent pictures of her ex into a deep metal wastebasket and set fire to it contents.elsewhere, bunnie seemed to have a little difficulty meditating."no offense but, for all of us who got it rough, there's as many of you guys who are happily married.""well, don't worry, sally. i'm pretty sure he learned his lesson from last--"we both heard it...and slowly looked up at the french coyote dangling from an invisible wire tether from a crane operated by rotor."ohhhh princess!"and sally's face just contorted into the most painful look i'd ever seen out of her.antoine was in full cupid disguise. down to the wings and...er...diaper. the pink bow with the foam rubber heart-tipped arrow."oh gods...just shoot me.""if you are in-seest-eeng..." antoine drew back the bow."rotor...why?!""i'm still asking myself that question, sally! but i'm pretty sure it was the 8 hours of incessant whining, pleading, threatening, bribing, and temper tantrums that did it.""antoine's reached a new low." i mumbled."uhhhh...?"i think that was about the time i covered asriel's eyes while jon covered gadget's.as rotor tried positioning the crane around..."uh-oh..." the motors, pulleys and rigs he set up to properly control antoine through the air got a bit...glitched."what eez this...?! what eez 'appening! no no no no no!"and thus antoine went for a wild. when it finished he found himself hanging by his toes as most of his harness came undone. but that was secondary compared to what violet had in store."commander...isn't that one of violet's rc drones...?""that it is, mitzi.""why is it flying toward antoine....wait...what is it doing--!"and the next thing we knew, the wings, the sash, the quiver, bow, and arrows came falling down."violet, no!""violet yes!" came he voice from the drone.and lastly the er...loinclotch came down. and the screams when up.bunnie could only facepalm."this isn't happening..." sally squeezed her eyes shut."oh it's happening, old friend."sally stood up, a forehead filled with angry anime "hashtag" veins bulging out. "done.""done?" mitzi questioned."just. done." sally walked off and headed indoors.but it only got worse for antoine as violet was already hacking rotor's crane and positioning antoine over the fountain.and thus antoine's screams and panic ended in a massive splash.he started to climb out, yet another frog on a lily pad atop his ruined hairdo."antoine. don't." bunnie warned. "at least not until you cover yourself with something.""what a terrible way to celebrate a birthday..." i shook my head and led asriel away as jon did the same."we're terrible people for not helping him out, you know.""yeah...we are not setting a good example for the kids.""...but i'm still not looking at his shame. i already did him that favor last summer, remember?"some time later..."...every year gets more meez-ra-bel." antoine sniffled...then sneezed. feeling sorry for him, some of us at least got him something to cover up with before he got arrested.that was when asriel came around."you had another bad day, didn't you, mr. antoine?""they...happen a lot. you might not be knowing but...i...am...not being zee most lucky person.""i...hadn't noticed." you're a terrible liar, azzy."anyway...umm...i had a couple left over from class today. so...i know it's not personalized, but...happy valentines' day." asriel handed over a valentine's day card. one of those kiddy ones that were either made in art class or bought in a supermarket."...""so...is it true that today's you're birthday, too?"wow, azzy. going right for the question.antoine just kinda nodded."i know it hasn't been very happy but...happy birthday anyway. everyone deserves at least that much."and with that antoine broke down and cried."there there..." asriel had a seat an pat him on the shoulder and back gently.maybe...maybe we weren't the role models asriel needed. maybe he was the role model we needed. it just goes to show...maybe it wasn't the worst day to have a birthday and be named antoine l. d'cooliette.cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-115 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-115. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 253: "lazer tag":so what lesson did asriel and i learn while laid up in the med bay with severe sinus infection and what felt like bronchitis? wellllll, if i said what i really felt, i'd have to censor a lot of my own language. but as you can guess cold and flu season can kindly do something unpleasant to itself. extrapolate that as you may and keep it to yourself. i don't want to be held responsbiel for spelling it out directly.however, with that bitterness and saltiness off my chest, i can honestly say that it's good to be feeling healthy again.i had to say...the 80's had some really cool fads at the time. and just by making that statement it was inevitable that violet dug up a little something-something and invited us all to take part."the auxilliary storage sector of the basement? sometimes i forget computer valhalla even has a basement. i mean besides the massive bevy of server farms for the central miranda global internet hub.""the emptiness was driving me nuts so i made better use of it.""you still haven't told us with what we're going to be doing."violet lead us down to the lower level.she looked over her shoulder as she flipped a power switch."welcome to the year...3010." she said with a devilish grin."...what are...!""advancements in new optronics have yielded a new genesis in photon combat.""...new optronics." i wrinkled my nose. "violet, if you're talking about what i think you're talking about, then this is 30 year-old technology.""aunt vi...?""now where did she disappear to? she was right here by the power switch. how do you disappear in a lit room?"mitzi and gadget just shrugged. pit wrapped his wings around himself."i suppose i should compliment her for actually improving in her stealth skills." bunnie muttered, arms crossed."i'm game for whatever's in her brain." sally shrugged."but why did she invite us along?" lupe asked. "i have a bad feeling about it.""knowing her, something that went out of style 30 years ago." rotor rolled his eyes.suddenly, violet again."boo.""ahh!" asriel jumped into my arms."not funny, violet." i sneered."oh yes it was. anyway. let's get you all equipped." violet handed over sets of what looked like vests with a holder right over the center of the chest, modified belts or bandoliers, holsters, and mixes of modified caps and modified helmets."wait a minute. you're not serious, vi." i suddenly knew exactly what this is.skeeter and the kids were already putting their stuff on."uhh...?""everyone suited up? now let's get you all properly geared up."violet handed each of us a weird pistol weapon. plastic. futuristic. looked like something out of a sci-fi tv show."the star light is a sleek, hand-held energy system. when depressed, a tiny l.e.d. appears in the sight lens. by firing an energized beam, players can "tag" each other from up to 80 feet away."violet handed each of us a weird electronic box--mostly hexaxonal but the bottom was elongated into a rectangle (almost key-shaped)--with a red dome in the center and a set of six lights under it."the star sensor is worn by all players and its rounded dome receives the energy beam from the star light. each time the star sensor is activated it registers a "tag".the game is played until one player receives six tags, thereby forcing him out. the sensor is attached by the star belt by a velcro receptical and completes the basic game playing apparatus.the star cap and the star helmet add a great deal to the game by providing 360 degree sensors. they will also register consecutive tags and will also emit the game over siren.when used with either the star cap or star helmet, the star vest enhances the game by allowing a player to wear more than one star sensor."it was too much. oh well. nothing to do but amuse her by this point.still. they were only toys. some day i'd have to tell asriel about the real laser tag and the laser tag academy. there'd come a time i'd introduce him to the jaron family bloodline that had ability to use the star light and star sensor's real power...but for now...the system had spent all this time powering up since violet flipped the switch. and now it finally came to life. violet took her place in the hovering master of ceremony chair. guess we knew who our referee was.it didn't take long for us to divide up into teams and discover that our arena was geared for a lot more...extreme rules. mixes of hoverboards and atv's were a twist even i didn't expect."three...two...one...begin!" violet's hover desk thing slid back and off the playfield.for several rounds we went, starting off in team vs. team. this time i got to team up with my best friend instead of against him."we make a good team, huh?""the best." i revved the atv. we also had gadget and mitzi plus lupe on our team."well you're not gonna get the best of us." skeeter had pit on his side as well as rotor and bunnie plus sally."i don't know about this..." lupe looked warily at her star light."lupe. it's just a game." i comforted. "i know you have a fear of guns. quite frankly i've never been fond of them either. even asriel isn't much of a firearm user. still gets nervous in the simulator even around mega buster arm cannons. but isn't part of growing stronger facing your fears.""o...okay. i guess..."lupe wasn't comfortable on an atv or a hoverboard. but what she lacked in technology, she made up for adaptability. that's where asriel got a look at her spirit meld for the first time.lupe grasped the triangular prism crystal that hung around her neck and the ghostly silhouette of a hawk superimposed over her and combined with her. with that, lupe gained the ability to fly with transluscent hawk wings that sprouted from her back!"she can fly!""surprise!""out!" violet called out as skeeter's star sensor registered a sixth sense and gave a game over siren."awww maaan!""ha hah. tough luck bro--""out!""bogus!" rotor whined.sally soared straight for gadget. "rookiiiiie!"but she didn't expect to see mitzi drop in from above with her jet anklets."oh, sally?""...!!!""tag! you're out!""mode!" sally cringed as she tumbled out of control."well are you a little spitfire?"  she looked up from where she landed, wrinkling her nose.mitzi gave a thumbs up. but she almost took a jolt as her sensei was quickly on the scene.gadget, however was quick to intercept."sorry, miss bunnie!""!!!" bunnie barely ninja vanished in time but not before taking two tags."well played, young gadget.""that's my big sister!" asriel wagged his tail."you should pay more attention, my student. lest you lower your guard--!""azzy, look out--!"i ended up taking the tag, getting in front of him."volt!""a good warrior doesn't lower his guard--"asriel dove off his hover board and tumbled."it's not going to be that easy, sensei!""but maybe it will be for me!" pit flew down out of nowhere."sorry, my loyal scout. i might not be the sharp-shooter that my sister is, but..."i banked my shot off of the first reflective object i could find in the room, which happened to be the closed domed metal shutters on the holo projector dome of violet's gtr-084."ohh! i'm hit!" pit was out."clever, commander." bunnie said as she scored the final hit on me and one each on the mice."out! out! out!""defeat me if you can, my student."asriel was already up to his final tag, despite battling like a tiger."i won't go down that easily." his eyes glowed red. he was determined.with a flury of his best flips, dodges, sommersaults, and evades, he was making bunnie work for this last tag.."you still have much to learn. remember what i said about who the master is and who is the student.""i remember. but the student always has the potential to surpass the master. " asriel leaned up against the pillar for cover."i'm afraid you chose poorly for cover."the pillar was practically in the corner of the room which meant asriel had only two ways to go. and both were right into the path of a star light blast.no answer...? that was unlike asriel."not going to acknowledge your opponent?" bunnie approached the pillar with her aim unwavering."...?"she approached the other side of the pillar...and opened fire...at an unoccupied vest...and no star sensor."point. and match." came the voice from above.bunnie looked up in time to see the red flash of the star light. and then down at her star sensor."out!""very clever."asriel's claws were dug deep into the column, his fingers having melted holes into it with his hybrid ability."resourceful. the victory would be yours.""game!"between all of us using our powers, it was an interesting battle or two. but things got really crazy when it stopped being team battle and every player for themself.by the time the power supplies all started running out, so were we. time flies when your having fun and so does your energy."good game, everyone.""which one?""all of them!""violet, i believe we'll all be having smoothies and a lot of down time.""come on, commander. give credit where credit is due.""very well. you've earned it." i handed her a candy bar.heh. even vi deserves a pat on the back now and then.sub-entry 254: "random fun in the x-vault":back here again. admittedly, i had no shortage of stuff to show asriel in this place but...i was running out of ways to keep it new and fresh. even if it wasn't more of the same, an improperly executed day out in the x-vault could still end up "more of the same".don't get me wrong. asriel was always one to appreciate whatever i did for him. he was always polite about it and always patient about it. but the eyes didn't lie. sometimes i could tell when something just seemed like he'd been there and done that.however i could usually find something to keep it fresh."i love when a plan comes together."i wasn't a sports guy but i couldn't resist a package of that one shredded bubble gum...you know the one. as much as it fit hannibal's character to be smoking a cigar...yeah. no. nermal taught me a long time ago that any tobacco product was a disgusting and unhealthy habit to start and even worse to quit.i raised my goggles and shut off my welder's torch."what do you think? good likeness, don't you think?"at violet's request i'd been researching a little about that lego dimensions game. as the so-called king of crossovers, i just couldn't resist looking back at old territory. and that reminded me just how many vehicles i had in storage at the x-vault.i recited to myself the synopsis of the incident from oh-so-long ago:"ten years ago a crack commando team was sent to prison by military court for a crime they didn't commit. these men promptly escaped a maximum security stockade to the los angeles underground. today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. if you have a problem, that no one else can help with, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...the a-team!"i stepped back and compared my work to the original van of said alpha team--john "hannibal" smith, the "face man", "howling mad" murdoch, and b.a. baracas. that black van with the red stripe that curled around the front, sides, and across the spoiler on top. and i had managed to create a miniature "power wheels" version; in asriel's size. sure he was 11 (plus a century) years old, but sometimes there is no such thing as too old.  it was kind of amazing that he didn't think he was so.  then again, it was bigger and more powerful than aforementioned toy but a long way from full scale.  somewhere in between.  like a 200 cc mario kart in approximate scope.  "battery's charged up. give her a run. i've had conky clean up the place for a pretty sizable track around the place. it was like the indoor race trace back in the powerhouse arcade's basement. but with only one car on the "track"."all right!" azzy didn't hesitate to jump in and start her up and take off around the place.  the x-vault was incredibly massive and there was plenty of room to maneuver around, even in something this size and with a good portion of the place occupied by various vehicles like the ecto-1 and so forth. the story of the a-team rang a familiar bell with asriel who'd heard scott's tragic vorostovian backstory.a while later, after asriel had his fun with that i found something else for us to do."i confiscated these from violet after...well...let's just say an incident that i'm not at liberty to disclose. at least not until you're in your teens."violet had rotor's and my help with building these--rc helicoptors based on a certain army medical copter under the code name "airwolf".we powered up our craft and flew them all over the place, laughing and enjoying our time. would anyone else but me let a young goat kid fly an rc aircraft indoors, let alone inside a top secret hanger full of old relics and keepsakes throughout time and space?"this is the life, huh?""if it is, i'm glad it's my life to live. and yours to live with me.""awwww...asriel, you always know just what to say."a little while later, i had decided to draw the archery set out from a certain orange 1969 dodge charger painted with the stars and bars of the confederate flag and the racing number, 01. it had traveled a long way from hazard county, let me tell you."...just like i showed you. don't worry about getting it on your first try. just let it happen naturally.""pit is going to be so impressed when i show him what i can do!"we each took turns shooting arrows at the straw targets."yeeee-haaaaaaaaw!" i grinned as i put one of harmony's spare cowboy hats on."you've come a long way, asriel. eleven months ago, you would have been too scared to pick one of these up, let alone any kind of weapon.""yeah...i still don't like using weapons...but i'm not scared to death of them like before.""you're still a kind and gentle person, asriel."his eyes were green. he knew even if he was too modest to admit it. the eyes gave it away.still a bit later, i invited asriel over to the lab tables to see how many experiments out of mr. wizard's world we could perform that weren't too dangerous...just enough so the require lab equipment and some safety gear."that...is hydrogen!"asriels's eyes had gotten the size of dinner plates from seeing the collection of hydrogen gas go up in a huge fiery flare."pretty wicked!""i know, right?"we finally closed our night, outside of the x-vault in tails' old hanger. i had secured the most powerful telescope i could and set it up on a hilltop. even though the world was mostly broken and kommand's technology was holding it together, it still had some beauty to behold. it still had sparks of its old self to admire.and i decided to treat asriel to a view of the stars and the planets. of space."oh wow....they look so much closer through the telescope! the stars at night look so amazing!""one of my greatest wishes was to see a space shuttle launch, asriel. some day...i'm hoping i'll be able to treat you seeing one. the two of us, together.""i'd like that."asriel stepped back from the telescope and held his hands together, letting a collective of his hybrid ability gather...and compress until it was small and bright...and star-shaped.it was strange...how similar his hybrid ability was to his old magic. to the magic of hyperdeath. it wasn't star blazing...but something similar."look. i'm holding a star in my hands right now." he smiled."yeah. that's pretty amazing, best friend."and like that, asriel let it dissipate into glowing dust, harmlessly.i had a feeling he didn't like using his powers that much...knowing that he had hurt chara with them. but i assured him...it was for the best. if he hadn't weakened her evil aura with his powers, then maybe we wouldn't have been able to break her free from the wraith."this was a wonderul day, volt. thank you for it.""it was a wonderful day. and i was glad to provide it."we hung around old mobius for a while before heading back to miranda city. i dropped him off at scott and callie's and headed back to my shop for the night.cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...

unexpected mission side project: the undisclosed files of case xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-114 and beyond
login: dr. arcadepassword: *****************old news: n/anew news: by order of the council and initiated by a.e.o.n. core directives, a full disclosure of the recent unofficial incident is to be submitted for a formal debrief and declassification.  details to follow.re: research mission logs: xxx-xxx-xxx-ut-114. codename:  project lost dreemurrnote: cautionary warning, level 9a.  the contents of these mission logs contain senstive information in regard to the previously unlogged stc exploration project carried out by stc agent vaa on the  encrypted date.  this pertains to the through investigation of the numbers of known and unknown timelines throughly observed over the chronal period in question.  this information should not be viewed without the complete set of data, maps of the continuum, and personal logs of agent vaa and the consent of of the council majority.  important nomenclature, lists of names, places, events, and miscellaneous items of interest are paramount for the concise breakdown of the following material.sub-entry 251: "setsubun":it's offcial. even though the "holidays" are over. that doesn't mean the end of holidays. once again we're going into the month and lead off with another holiday. this time it was one of bunnie's jangese celebrations. and that's without counting groundhog day a mere 24 hours ago. go figure."so many holidays in the year.""it never gets stagnate, let me tell you what." i replied to asriel, feeling a sudden and unexplainable appreciation for propane at the moment."this one is setsuban, right? sensei's holiday from her homeland?""correct, little man.""she never did explain it to me. what is it again? how is it celebrated."as always i just happened to have a pamphlet to explain things. it read, and i quote:"setsubun is marked by a traditional ceremony intended to cleanse away the evil of the previous year and drive away disease-carrying spirits known as "mameki" (literally translated as bean-throwing). while traditional jang practice involves the household's "toshitoko" (the male born on the corresponding year of the xingese zodiac or head male of the family) performs this ceremony, in light of things bunnie mei rabbotou performs the ceremony.the ceremony consists of using roasted soybeans (fortune beans known as fuku mame) are either thrown out the doorway of the household (in this case rabbot dojo) or at a corresponding member of the family (in this case a male member of rabbot dojo's exchange student class) wearing an oni (ogre demon) mask while attendees chant in the jang language "oni wa soto! fuku wa uchi!" (translated: "evil demons out! good luck in!").as part of facilitating bringing good luck in, it is customary to eat roasted soybeans--one for each year of one's life plus one additional one to represent the year of good luck.""amazing!"we reached the area of the rabbotou dojo mansion-temple complex where it was being hosted. as a courtessey, bunnie had some foreign exchange students from jang flown in. six of them--all humans--helped assist with the ceremony. the rituals, the taiko drums, and all the other details. it was my understanding that they were modern samurai alumni from bunnie's past. one of them was said to be heir to the shiba clan--the very clan that had ties to the rabbotou clan. the very same that had granted them their mansion temple in their native home in jang."wow!""you know this is a favorite time of year for our mutual favorite camera-rabite.""wrench?""the same.""why's that?""you'll see." i said with a wink and a grin.earlier last night, bunnie's foreign friends had arrived at the airport. they stayed in the guest house of rabbotou dojo and spend early this morning preparing."golly! it's already crowded!" asriel just then noticed the noise and the crowd. there was a lot of overlapping conversations and cheer in jangese. i could see the taiko drums being set up. bunnie hadn't made her appearance yet.asriel looked up at me."i'm not really sure what to expect. the pamphlet explained a lot but...""i guess you'll just have to be surprised." i mussed his head fur a bit.as we waited, bunnie's out-of-town friends started setting up at the taiko drums.and then the moment arrived. bunnie exited the temple in ornate ceremonial robes. in light of the lack of a living male member of the rabbotou clan, bunnie never hesitated to take up the roles of the other gender. to the uninformed, it probably wouldn't even have mattered unless bunnie or someone jangese had brought it up.speaking of the jangese, no longer were bunnie and bunnette the only ones in town. in recent years, out town would get an unexpected appearance by, of all things, a kitsune; the japanese fox spirt.for the longest time, the closest kitsune we had was our active leader, miles (what with having two tails). but a hybrid with an extra tail mutation being a kitsune was up for debate. go figure.i digress. the kitsune in question was a many-tailed fox that went by shinju. she had remained curled up in the lap of another jangese immigrant--a warrior of the order of the flame named ashitaka. a modern samurai of the "elegant brush style" that had evolved into bunnie's martial science.for public apperance during and after the ceremony, he had donned the robes and padded vest ofa komusou (zen buddhist monk of sorts), complete with a woven basket helmet covering for the face and carried a shakuhachi (jangese bamboo flute).and yet shinju wasn't the only kitsune there. and while most kitsune from jang were the red-furred variety, in attendence was the rare black-furred breed who was known as suzuka. a five-tailed fox spirit and shinju's daughter, no less.soon the ceremony was under way."鬼わ外！福わ内 ! 鬼わ外！福わ内 ! 鬼わ外！福わ内 ! 鬼わ外！福わ内 !"the chant went up as bunnie began the scattering of the fuku mame in the direction of the volunteer who had chosen to play the part of the "oni" (ogre)."oooooh." asriel watched by my side."heh." i smirked.the ceremony and blessings continued with the taiko drums in full rhythem, the sights and the sounds at their peek.  i was even sure i saw master splinter out in the crowd."so what did you mean about wrench, earlier?""have a look for yourself." i pointed to the ground where large numbers of the scattered beans had landed. sure enough our favorite rabite was having quite the feast."if you believe that it's lucky to eat soybeans--one for each year of your life and additional ones for each year of good luck--then i'd say wrench is the luckiest one of us all."we all had a good laugh while wrench had himself a good meal.afterwards bunnie introduced us all to her six alumni; each of them a student and practitioner of the ways of the samurai. in order, playing taiko, otsuzumi, and kotsuzumi drums: "takeru shiba, ryunosuke ikenami, mako shiraishi, chiki tani, kotoha hanori...and the one wearing the oni mask is genta umemori."asriel bowwed, greeted, and made introductions as bunnie had taught him.all day we got acquainted and enjoyed our time out. by tomorrow everyone had to leave for jang and it would be just another day from there on out.sub-entry 252: "february is the armpit of the year...":three words:being. sick. sucks.that's right. even an immortal, time-traveling werewolf is not immune to the common cold, flu, or sinus/respiratory infection.to clarify my previous three word statement, let me break it down for you. you don't feel like yourself. your temper's shorter. you lose all sense of taste for even your favorite foods. the aches. the pains. the fact that your throat feels like the aftermath of burning napalm. and all the other gross symptoms which make you feel like your body turned against itself, even though it's only doing what it must give the virus a forceful eviction.i've learned there's one comfort above all others. misery loves company. i mean...if you're going to be ill (and not in the rapper sense), you might as well not be the only one sick."bless you, volt." *sniffle*"thanks."for argument's sake, try to read our words with a stuffy nose and sore throat dimisioning the coherency somewhat."hope your folks don't mind you being tended to away from home." i said, having relieved my nasal passages and added to the growing wastebasket of tissues."it was my idea... *sneeze* ...mom can't afford to get sick. as a doctor, a lot of people are depending on her for surgeries and stuff.""awww." *coughing fit*at that moment, elektra walked in with trays of food and medication. immediately i spied the bio-cort injections. so did asriel...because he ducked under the covers upon sight."little guy's afraid of needles.""you were too, dad. don't think grandma nermal didn't tell an embarassing story or two.""i...don't know what you're talking about." *sniffle*"do you want me to tell asriel about how you used to hide in the wall socket to get out of--""you wouldn't dare!" i whined."oh! hey! you brought noodle soup!" asriel tried to change the subject."indeed. chicken, broth, and noodles. no carrots or celery. just like you like, dad. but asriel...the both of you aren't getting out of your anti-inflammatory injections. trust me, they'll relieve a lot of sinus and chest pressure."i sighed."i hate to admit when the doctor's right, but there's no winning this argument, azzy." *sneeze* "ughh...""being sick is the worst." asriel looked about in tears."your first experience with stomach sickness...sorry, little guy.""i never want to do that again."asriel laid his head back. "if this is what chara put herself through--""no, asriel. what she did to herself was far worse.  if you were that level of sick, you'd be vomitting blood. this is just... *cough cough cough* ...something that will cure itself in time.""if just being this level of sick is this bad...why would she ever do something so horrible to herself...""chara...didn't have an easy life, you know that. even though neither of us will ever know the specifics......what we do know is that she wasn't entirely in control of her actions.""mnnn....""now come on. don't think about such bad things.""i'll...try not to. it's...not easy to be in a happy place when everything feels so...blehhhh.""well, one good thing. you were so distracted by it, you didn't notice elektra already gave you your injection.""wha...?" asriel noticed the bandaid on his arm. "oh. that's...something.""anyway. let's just enjoy our soup. oh! and we have green tea with honey and lemon. that'll be good for our scratchy voices and burning throats.""if you say so." asriel sat up and started on the soup, now that it had cooled a little."mmn.""maybe later, if elektra doesn't object we can get vanilla ice cream.""we'll see. now eat up. you'll need the strength to keep your immune systems working.""right as always, daughter." i joined in the meal while elektra replaced the ice in our ice bags. did i forget to mention that fevers blow?  and that's coming from someone who doesn't mind being hot."volt?""yeah?""february isn't a very fun month.""dad...garfield used to say, in times of sickness, that feburary is the armpit of the year.""the armpit?""because it stinks."that made us both laugh."eww. gross.""you're laughing, too.""i know. and i shouldn't be.""oh, azzy, you're so clean-cut. don't ever change."and we both had a good laugh...and a coughing fit.cryptosmasher logoffend transmission...
