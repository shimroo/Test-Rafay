the shelburne falls trolley museum, in shelburne falls, massachusetts, is a fun day of trolley car rides, pump car rides and more for the entire family!







we brought the trolley parlor car "berkshire hills" back to western massachusetts, and we could use more donations to restore her to her original elegance.see here for a progress report.



-want to volunteer at sftm?we'd love to have you join our crew.



visit our operating museum, located near the historic bridge of flowers and the "glacial" potholes in the village of shelburne falls.
you can take a ride onÂ trolley no. 10 and our old fashioned pump car (not suitable for small children).  in our visitors center you can play with wooden and electric trains (suitable for children of all ages), browse historical photos from the time of trolleys and purchase trolley and railroad related items in our trolleyshop gift shop. 
outside you can climb into our big red caboose, and afterwards stroll among the artisan shops, galleries and restaurants in shelburne falls.

the shelburne falls trolley museum is dedicated to preserving and operating shelburne falls & colrain street railway
trolley car no. 10. this car was built by wason manufacturing co. in springfield ma in 1896. it was delivered new to shelburne falls and has
never left the valley. for thirty years it served its namesake towns. for twenty years it crossed the deerfield river on what is now the
famous bridge of flowers. saved by a local farmer, it spent sixty-five years as a chicken coop, tool shed and play house.
now, through
the efforts of the shelburne falls trolley museum, you can ride it in the same freight yard where it used to load
and unload passengers, apples, mail, milk and other freight, one hundred years ago.

i took my granddaughters, age 5 and 7, to the trolley museum  
today.  they had a blast.  so did my poochie and i.  we did it all -  
rode the trolley, climbed around inside the caboose, pumped  
the hand car, and the girls had a good ole time running the trains  
(or moving the brio ones) as i looked at photos.  plus we all enjoyed  
the historical descriptions and anecdotes.  lilly, the almost-8-year-old, confessed  
to me as we were riding on the trolley and she'd just pulled the bell  
cord that she hadn't really wanted to come to the trolley museum.  "i  
thought we'd just climb up some stairs and look and look at things  
and then climb some more stairs and look and look at more things -  
like we did at moma when daddy took us to new york. i like this a  
lot more than moma." so much for art.
