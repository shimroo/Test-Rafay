market reports
office overview
office vacancy in columbus is rising slower than the national average, at 9.4%, compared to 13.9% nationally, due to limited new projects and positive absorption. new lease sizes in columbus are modestly shrinking, but expansions by companies like bbi logistics offset this trend. 
vacancy rate trends: the columbus office market saw a gradual increase in the vacancy rate to 9.4% in q4 2024, up 60 basis points year-over-year, continuing to outperform the national vacancy rate of 13.9% due to limited new deliveriesâ.
leasing activity: leasing volumes in q4 remained muted, with significant tenant downsizing and relocations contributing to the return of 240,000 sf of space to the market over the past yearâ
rent performance: rent growth decelerated further to 1.1% in q4 2024, down from 1.8% in q3, but still outpacing the national benchmark of 1.0%. tenant concessions and competitive sublease options continued to pressure rentsâ.
construction pipeline: with minimal new projects breaking ground, the columbus construction pipeline remains at its lowest level in over a decade, with a little over 400,000 sf currently under construction, primarily in mixed-use developmentsâ.
-------------------------
âas we close out 2024, the columbus office market demonstrates resilience amidst national headwinds. limited new construction has kept vacancy increases modest, while tenants prioritize quality over quantity in their space decisions. although rent growth has softened, columbus continues to offer a competitive edge with its stable market conditions and future growth potential."- matt gregory, managing director

why overcoming current cre financing challenges hinge on more than interest rates
september 17, 2024
interest rates are currently at their highest level in over two decades, yet inflation persists. though many had hoped interest rate cuts were on the horizon as early as june, the federal reserve hasnât been comfortable doing so just yet, with analysts expecting it to be september before the first cut.
the current climate has commercial real estate owners, occupiers, investors, and developers sidelined and anxiously awaiting news that inflation has been tamed and the economy is stabilizing. but it may not all hinge on interest rates coming down.
the higher cost of funds along with several other market challenges could impact lending for longer than expected.a perfect storm
âover the past year, weâve felt the impact of the enormous influx of capital that was injected into the economy during the pandemic,â said travis mcintyre, vice president at park national bank.
the issuance of paycheck protection program (ppp) loans during the pandemic, and subsequently economic injury disaster loans (eidl) intended to save businesses from the immediate impact of the pandemic, allowed many small businesses to pay down existing pre-pandemic loans early, and in some instances, stop turning to banks for new loans.

three ways columbusâ newly adopted zoning code impacts commercial real estate
august 27, 2024
columbus city council officially adopted changes to the cityâs zoning code in july. the change marks the first significant evaluation and reformation of the prior code in more than 70 years. the years-long effort culminated in a unanimous vote for all six resolutions and the legislation is slated to take effect on august 28. as a result, six mixed-use districts were created along key corridors of the city, incentivizing the development of up to 88,000 housing units. hereâs what the change means for commercial real estate.eliminating parking requirements, relaxed density and height restrictions make development more cost-effective
the columbus region is experiencing a housing shortage. a 2017 study conducted by vogt strategic insights on behalf of the building industry association of central ohio evaluated the regionâs housing needs through 2050 and found that the region needs to build 14,000 housing units annually through 2050 to meet the needs of the growing columbus region. between 2010 and 2021, the columbus msa has averaged 8,214 permits per year, according to the report. this challenge has been exacerbated following the announcement that intel would build its campus in the region bringing the estimated population growth in the region to nearly 3 million by 2050.
