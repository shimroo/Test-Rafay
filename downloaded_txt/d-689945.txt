lesbian.org


about lesbian.org
in the beginning...
lesbian.org first began in the mid-1990âs and was one of the first major web sites for lesbians.â  for many years the site provided a comprehensive list of web links and also hosted discussion lists and web sites for lesbian-oriented non-profits.â  the site also sponsored a lesbian literary journal called sapphic ink.
you can see an early interview i gave about lesbian.org on netcafe onâ this pageâ on archive.org also check out earlier versions of lesbian.org in theâ wayback machine.
flash forward
now that the web has grown and changed so much, iâm trying to figure out how to make the best use of lesbian.org the site comes fairly high in google searches, which makes me wonder what kind of resource visitors are looking for, and whether such a resource exists elsewhere.
iâmâ open to suggestionsâ from visitors!
looking for?

lesbian.org book reviews.

web resources for lesbians
the most common questions visitors to the site have are: how do i deal with coming out? and how do i meet other lesbians?
i've gathered a few resources to help with each question:
coming out

stages of coming outâ from empty closets
should you come out to your parents?â (article onâ psychology today)
coming out later in lifeâ from the national resource center on lgbt aging
coming out resourcesâ from the human rights campaign

gathering spots

shoe lesbian community - forums
forums on afterellen.com
lesbian forum on hipforums
empty closet forumsâ (lgbt - also has chat room)

wayback when...
here's a screen shot of what lesbian.org looked like around 1997, thanks to the amazing wayback machine.









greetings!
i'm an atlanta native who grew up dreaming of owning a horse farm in colorado and teaching college-level writing... and now i've done both! 
i retired from over 20 years of teaching college-level in december 2015 so that i can devote my energies to developing a young adult fantasy series i plan to deliver as serialized graphic novels.
i took a break from writing in april and may of 2016 to get married, and for the past year i've been learning to create graphics using 3d software. i hope to have the first chapter ready to share by mid-2018!social media linksgoodreads
