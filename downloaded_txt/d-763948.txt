at dreamyard, art is action
building artists, building community, building dreams to change the world.








mission
dreamyard is an arts and social justice organization dedicated to working with bronx youth, families, and schools to build pathways toward equity and opportunity.
our vision is simple:
we aspire for everyone—our staff, board, parents, youth, teaching artists, school partners, alumni, and neighbors—to have the power, agency, and tools to fortify themselves and the communities they love. we utilize the humanitarian power of arts and social justice education to build thriving and just communities in the bronx and beyond. we are committed to nurturing artists, communities, and dreamers to change the world.
the core values guiding our work are activate, create, connect, and nurture.
