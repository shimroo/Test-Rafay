long before christian ska, there was liberation suite, incorporating brass with hard-rocking jesus music, first in the texas hill country, and then in war-torn northern ireland and the british isles. libsuite, as they were usually called, was one of two important christian groups to be part of the texas jesus movement. in the mid ‘70s – years before arkangel, much less king’s x, were on the scene – it was just liberation suite and hope of glory in the lone star state. libsuite’s sound was likened to chicago transit authority at the time (i.e., to the rock band that did “i’m a man” and “beginnings,” not to the abbreviated adult contemporary remnant that later did all those “hard for me to say i’m sorry” pop songs). indeed, liberation suite regularly performed “where do we go from here?” in their concerts, along with blistering versions of the doobie brothers’ “jesus is just alright” and eric clapton’s “presence of the lord.” their first album remains one of the most important – and one of the best – contributions of the era.-the encyclopedia of contemporary christian music by mark allan powell
