about me 











buddy bell lives in north carolina with his wife, two children, and a dog commonly referred to as “that damnable hound.” his real-life gig is running the gymnastics facility he and his wife own. he has convinced his wife that his days are long, stressful, and will likely be the death of him.  please don’t tell her otherwise.he attended catholic school for 13 years, but is surprisingly well-adjusted. (stop rolling your eyes, dear.) after high school, he was accepted into the north carolina state university aerospace engineering program and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy. for that, he apologizes profusely.he enjoys coaching youth sports, playing video games, and researching old cars he’d like to buy and fix up even though he never actually does.and bourbon.bourbon is good.
