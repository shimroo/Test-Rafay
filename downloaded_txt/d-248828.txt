orlando


orlando is one of virginia woolf's most-celebrated works. a cornerstone in feminist literature, the novel explores the complexities of gender, identity, sexuality, and self-discovery.'love, the poet has said, is woman's whole existence.'orlando follows the titular character over a period of 300 years as he miraculously transforms from a man into a woman. opening while orlando is living in elizabethan england as a nobleman, we observe as he shifts through centuries and identities while woolf compares the societal roles of men and women throughout history. often marked as the first literary text to explore transgender characters, orlando challenges traditional gender roles, dismissing the idea of gender binaries and the constraints of the patriarchy.first published in 1928, orlando was written as a mock biography for woolf's close friend and lover, vita sackville-west, as a dedication of love. woolf is widely hailed as having been key to the first wave of feminism, and orlando stands as a testament to her groundbreaking vision.

delilah green doesn't care


a clever and steamy queer romantic comedy about taking chances and accepting love—with all its complications—from the author of astrid parker doesn't fail.

delilah green swore she would never go back to bright falls—nothing is there for her but memories of a lonely childhood where she was little more than a burden to her cold and distant stepfamily. her life is in new york, with her photography career finally gaining steam and her bed never empty. sure, it’s a different woman every night, but that’s just fine with her.
 
when delilah’s estranged stepsister, astrid, pressures her into photographing her wedding with a guilt trip and a five-figure check, delilah finds herself back in the godforsaken town that she used to call home. she plans to breeze in and out, but then she sees claire sutherland, one of astrid’s stuck-up besties, and decides that maybe there’s some fun (and a little retribution) to be had in bright falls, after all.
 
having raised her eleven-year-old daughter mostly on her own while dealing with her unreliable ex and running a bookstore, claire sutherland depends upon a life without surprises. and delilah green is an unwelcome surprise…at first. though they’ve known each other for years, they don’t really know each other—so claire is unsettled when delilah figures out exactly what buttons to push. when they’re forced together during a gauntlet of wedding preparations—including a plot to save astrid from her horrible fiancé—claire isn’t sure she has the strength to resist delilah’s charms. even worse, she’s starting to think she doesn’t want to...











book lovers


 
 
“one of my favorite authors.”—colleen hoover

an insightful, delightful, instant #1 new york times bestseller from the author of beach read and people we meet on vacation.

named a most anticipated book of 2022 by oprah daily ∙ today ∙ parade ∙ marie claire ∙ bustle ∙ popsugar ∙ katie couric media ∙ book bub ∙ shereads ∙ medium ∙ the washington post ∙ and more!one summer. two rivals. a plot twist they didn't see coming...

nora stephens' life is books—she’s read them all—and she is not that type of heroine. not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. in fact, the only people nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister libby.

which is why she agrees to go to sunshine falls, north carolina for the month of august when libby begs her for a sisters’ trip away—with visions of a small town transformation for nora, who she’s convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. but instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, nora keeps bumping into charlie lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. it would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they’ve met many times and it’s never been cute.

if nora knows she’s not an ideal heroine, charlie knows he’s nobody’s hero, but as they are thrown together again and again—in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow—what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they’ve written about themselves.
