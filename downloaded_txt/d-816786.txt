season of light:  as we head into
the dark time of the year and our tradition’s festival of lights, we
will do some talmud study that pits hillel and shammai against each
other (as usual!) with respect to the right way to light chanukah
candles.  the study will bring up larger questions about
disagreements, traditions, and finding our way with multiple, competing
instructions. join
us at 1:30 pm, sunday afternoon december 11, either in person or on
zoom, for a discussion led by hebrew college rabbinic intern naomi gurt lind. if
you wish to participate and are not a betenu member, please contact the betenu office.
